Will the third time be the charm? After two oh-so-close attempts to land a rocket stage on a seagoing platform, SpaceX will try, try again during Sunday's launch of a Falcon 9 rocket.
The primary objective of the mission , due for takeoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 10:21 a.m. ET, is to deliver a robotic Dragon capsule with more than two and a half tons of supplies, equipment and experiments  ranging from a new docking adapter for accommodating future U.S.-built spaceships to a virtual-reality headset for the space station's crew.
This will be the first robotic cargo delivery since a Russian Progress capsule went awry in April , resulting in the loss of the craft's 3-ton payload. The Dragon's payload includes food, oxygen and other much-needed basics  and that's putting extra pressure on SpaceX for a successful launch.
SpaceX's vice president of mission assurance, Hans Koenigsmann, told reporters on Friday that his company was up to the job. "Dragon has been super-reliable," he told reporters.
No technical problems were reported as the two-stage Falcon 9 rocket was fueled up, and the chances of acceptable weather were set at 90 percent. You can watch launch coverage on webcasts that are being streamed by NASA and SpaceX .

The Dragon already has made six successful cargo runs under the terms of a $1.6 billion contract with NASA, plus an initial demonstration mission in 2012. But this time, SpaceX is hoping to pull off a trick that's never been done before: the safe landing of the Falcon's first stage on a drone ship stationed hundreds of miles out in the Atlantic.
The first stage's autonomous landing maneuver is due to unfold minutes after launch, while the second stage continues its rise to orbit with the Dragon capsule.
A completely successful landing at sea would mark a milestone in rocket reusability. SpaceX's billionaire founder, Elon Musk, says the technology would dramatically drive down launch costs and potentially pave the way for affordable trips to Mars.

SOUSSE, Tunisia  Makeshift memorials dotted this seaside resort town on Sunday as Tunisian officials deployed hundreds of extra police to guard tourist sites following a massacre on the north African nation's beach.
At least 39 people  mostly British, German and Belgian vacationers  were killed when a gunman disguised as a tourist opened fire on beachgoers in Sousse on Friday.
Flowers and candles dotted the beach on Sunday, where two days earlier sun loungers were turned into makeshift stretchers for the wounded in the attack for which ISIS claimed responsibility.

"We will never forget you," read one handwritten message placed in the sand, as armed police patrolled the beach on ATVs and boats offshore waved Tunisian flags.
Crowds gathered in front of the Imperial Marhaba Hotel  the site of the attack  chanting "with heart and blood we sacrifice for our flag." Below their feet, the sand was still bloodied.
As the community reeled, the imam of Sousse's second-largest mosque stressed how the attack ran counter to Islamic principles.

"Islam is a religion of peace and these terrorists are destroying its image," the young imam, Juma Yassin Kidary, told NBC News ahead of the special Ramadan prayer.
Tunisia's Interior Minister Mohamed Najem Gharsalli said 1,000 extra police were being deployed at tourist sites and beaches in the North African nation.
"We don't want to make tourist establishments into barracks, that's not our goal. But we must act to guarantee the security of the tourist sector," he said late Saturday, according to The Associated Press.
Tunisia's tourism industry  already grappling with fallout from the deadly terror attack in March at the National Bardo Museum in Tunis  suffered a further blow from Friday's violence .
Sousse's tourism commissioner Saloua Kadri told Reuters that more than 3,000 foreigners had fled the town on Saturday  and many more were awaiting flights out.

"We don't feel safe," Briton Sarah Maeson told Reuters at Ennfida airport.
Mahdin Zidani, 40, was on the beach when the attacker opened fire. He said he plans to see a therapist to help cope with the trauma of that day, but was certain he and his nation would heal.
"It is an accident, it can happen in any country, it happened in France and Kuwait," he told NBC News. "We will not give up, we will continue working and everything will come back to normal."

A young Boy Scout died when a flash flood swept through his campground in northern New Mexico, according to officials.
The victim was part of a group of scouts on a 12-day trek across Philmont Scout Ranch when a flash flood swept through their campsite before dawn on Saturday, according to NBC affiliate station KOB . Four boys were swept away but three were located immediately, KOB reported.
Philmont Scout Ranch  which has 214 square miles of wilderness  said its staff had "immediately" contacted crews and trekkers in the backcountry to check on safety and offer help after "significant" rainfall caused flooding in some areas of its property.
"During that process, our staff was unable to account for one youth participant, who we have since confirmed passed away," the ranch said in a statement offering thoughts and prayers to the affected family .
"All other participants have been accounted for and there are no additional injuries," it added.

TEHRAN  After years of marathon negotiations and several missed deadlines, crunch time has finally arrived for Iran's nuclear talks with the United States and five other world powers.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Sunday in Vienna with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, their third encounter since Saturday.
As gaps remained between all sides in the talks, Zarif planned to return to Tehran for 24 hours for consultations with Iran's leadership ahead of the June 30 deadline for a deal.
An enormous amount of ground already has been covered between Tehran and Washington , old foes who once referred to each other as "The Great Satan" and a member of "The Axis of Evil," respectively.
But despite this progress, there are still red lines to overcome before a deal can be struck.
America, Britain, Russia, France, China and Germany  known collectively as the P5+1 powers  want to ensure Iran cannot produce a nuclear weapon. They are asking for thorough inspections and written guarantees, resulting in harsh consequences if Iran does not hold up its side of the bargain.
In return, Iran wants an immediate end to the economic sanctions it says have crippled its economy. It also wants to rejoin the international community and lose its image as a global pariah.
In order to do this, however, Iran needs to prove its claim that its nuclear program is for energy alone and devoid of any military aspirations.

Powerful elements on both sides remain deeply skeptical. Senior figures in Congress have warned they could trip up any pact that does not retain the power to carry out spot checks on Iranian facilities, or an agreement that lifts economic sanctions before Tehran begins to comply fully with its terms.

KUWAIT  Kuwait on Sunday identified a suicide bomber who carried out the country's worst militant attack as a Saudi citizen and said it had detained the driver of the vehicle that took him to a Shi'ite Muslim mosque where he killed 27 people.
The interior ministry named the bomber as Fahd Suliman Abdul-Muhsen al-Qabaa and said he flew into Kuwait's airport at dawn on Friday, only hours before he detonated explosives at Kuwait City's Imam al-Sadeq mosque.
ISIS claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at the mosque, where 2,000 worshipers were praying at the time. It was one of three attacks on three continents that day apparently linked to hardline Islamists.

"The interior ministry will continue its efforts to uncover the circumstances of this explosion," interior ministry spokesman Adel Hashash told Kuwait state television.
The ministry said the driver of the Japanese-made car, who left the mosque immediately after Friday's bombing, was an illegal resident named Abdul-Rahman Sabah Aidan.
The interior ministry, which had earlier reported the vehicle owner's arrest, said Aidan, 26, was found hiding in one of the houses in al-Riqqa residential area.
"Initial investigations showed that the owner of the house is a supporter of the deviant ideology," the ministry said, employing a term often used by authorities in the Gulf Arab region to refer to hardline Islamist militants. The owner of the house, a Kuwaiti citizen, was also detained, the ministry said.

The former accomplice of slain escaped murderer Richard Matt told NBC News he is relieved that the "nightmare" is finally over.
Matt, 49, was fatally shot Friday by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection tactical team after three weeks on the run. Matt's fellow escapee, David Sweat, is still on the loose .
Lee Bates, who was convicted and served time for his role in a 1997 murder carried out by Matt, told NBC News that the he had "never met or seen anybody so vicious, so cruel and dangerous" in his life.

"If you really wanted to know what the devil looked like, take a picture of Richard Matt, look at a picture of Richard Matt," Bates told NBC News on Saturday. "That was the devil."
Bates, 38, testified against the Matt at his murder trial, describing how Matt had beaten, bound and eventually killed the boss who fired him. He was paroled in August, and told NBC News it had been "extremely difficult" living in Matt's shadow since then  even more so since Matt and Sweat used power tools to make a daring escape from New York's Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6.

A 17-year-old boy is in critical condition after he was apparently attacked by a shark in the ocean off North Carolina's Outer Banks Saturday, just 14 miles from the site of another suspected shark attack a day earlier, officials said.
The teen was swimming at a beach on the Cape Hatteras National Seashore near Waves at about 4 p.m. when he was apparently bitten by a shark and injured on his calf, buttocks and both hands, according to a statement from the National Park Service.
The victim was airlifted to Norfolk, Virginia. A spokesperson for Sentara Norfolk General Hospital said he is in critical condition.

The 17-year-old was swimming with friends in about three feet of water about 20 feet offshore when the shark attack occurred, NBC affiliate WITN reported. He was the only person injured.

On Friday, a 47-year-old man suffered injuries to his right leg and lower back believed to have been caused by a shark just 14 miles down the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, according to the National Park Service .
The last shark encounter at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, before the two this weekend, was in 2011, the Park Service said. NBC affiliate WITN reported that there were seven reports of people being attacked by sharks off the Carolina coast in the past two weeks.
Last week, two teens lost arms after separate shark attacks in Oak Island , North Carolina, which is nearly 300 miles from the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.

Women's mortality rates are much higher than men's, even when factoring in male combatants who are fighting and dying on the battlefield, according to the United Nations.

In fact, the U.N. calls the rates of violence against women in Afghanistan "exceptionally high" with up to 87.2 per cent of women having experienced some form of violence.
The situation is getting worse, according to activists. There has been a 31 percent rise in the cases of violence against women so far this year compared to 2014, according to Soraya Sobhrang, deputy chair of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission.
"This is a worrisome development that should be addressed  all the gains women made could be lost," she said.
While President Ashraf Ghani is broadly believed to be a supporter of women's rights, critics say he is hamstrung by the presence of powerful figures who are hostile to them. A stark example of this is how conservative forces have blocked the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) law, which criminalized and set prison sentences for rape, domestic violence, and underage and forced marriage, among other things.
Former President Hamid Karzai passed the law in 2009 but it never got through the lower house of parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, where some parliamentarians said it ran counter to Islam and could tear apart Afghan society.
Related: Will Afghan Leader Ashraf Ghani Bow to Pressure to Hide His Wife?
Qazi Nazeer Ahmad Hanafi is one of the most prominent voices against the EVAW and has been especially rankled by the provision in the law to create women's shelters for victims of domestic violence. According to Hanafi, a parliamentarian from western Herat province, these shelters were actually "brothels" and could prompt a "revolution" that could kill millions.
The conservative forces resisting the full inclusion of women into society extend beyond Hanafi.
Afghanistan's Ulama Council  the highest religious authority in the country  recently fought to block the appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court.
"Life in general is very challenging and involves a lot of risk ... I have been the target of assassination attempts."
While a female judge, Anisa Rassoli, has been nominated by Ghani to the chamber on Tuesday, the council's spokesman Ataullah Ludin said the move ran against Sharia law. This will likely strengthen the position of many conservatives in parliament who are looking to prevent her from taking her post.
The council has also been quiet on the need to defend women, according to Fawzia Koofi , a prominent lawmaker and the head of the parliamentary committee on women's affairs and rights.
"They have been ineffective and silent about violence against women," she said. "They didn't even condemn the brutal murder of Farkhunda."
Familiar path to pain
Many women and rights activists say their fear isn't only that the Taliban will return to power in some form. They're also afraid the country is going down the same road that led to the 1992-1996 civil war which swept the fundamentalist fighters into power.

Now women who dare speak out, or even step outside their homes without the burqa, say they increasingly risk abuse  or worse.
Like other women in public life that NBC News interviewed, such as politicians, teachers and activists, Koofi said she felt her life was in danger.
WATCH: For Afghan Women, Home Isn't Where the Heart Is
"Life in general is very challenging and involves a lot of risk, but it's much harder to be a woman in the public sphere," Koofi said. "I have been the target of assassination attempts. [Recently] a well-placed security source told me that a suicide bomber came very close to target my vehicle in central Kabul, but lost me in the traffic."
And it isn't just legislators and activists who feel vulnerable.
Rangina Hamidi, who owns Kandahar Treasure  a successful business selling traditional Afghan pottery and textiles made by women  says she constantly worries about the future.
Hamidi is proud of her company, which employs around 400 women who mostly work from home including many secretly, in the heart of Kandahar, the Taliban's birthplace. The business has recently been hurt by the withdrawal of thousands of foreign troops, whom the company used to sell to.
"For a place like Kandahar, which is only known for war and destruction, it is a success for a group of women to generate over $300,000," Hamidi said. "The gains are certainly under threat of a civil war, should there not be peace."
Just 15 years ago, the Taliban imposed its strict interpretation of Islam combined with profoundly conservative tribal codes onto the Afghan people. Men and women were strictly segregated, the vast majority of the country's girls' schools were shuttered, women were barred from leaving their homes without an all-enveloping burka and a male chaperon. Those who broke the rules were beaten or executed.
The Taliban's rule, and the chaos that preceded it, are constantly on Hamidi's mind. As are the economic realities of Afghanistan, with foreign troops leaving and insecurity making it even harder for women as well as businesses like hers.
"We obviously fear that everything we have gained, not only as an entity here but as a country as a whole [will be reversed]. As women that fear is definitely in our minds," she said.
"My biggest fear is to tell all these women that we will not be able to support them any longer," Hamidi added.

Crews in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania tranquilized a black bear after it was spotted by students at a party near Lehigh University. (Published Saturday, Jun 27, 2015)

A Pennsylvania college party got a little wild when a black bear showed up.
The black bear, weighing between 300 and 400 pounds, crashed the party early Saturday near the campus of Lehigh University.

Emergency officials received a flood of 911 calls after the bear was spotted around 2 a.m. in south Bethlehem, about 50 miles north of Philadelphia.
The bear "lumbered close to the party and scared the living daylights out of people," police Chief Mark DiLuzio said.

Lehigh University said in a "Bear Update" on its website that the animal was captured, tranquilized and removed from the area a couple hours later.
DiLuzio said the same bear was seen Friday near an arena and the university's athletic facilities, but it ran away into a swampy area.

Tyler Krieder, district officer of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, said a tattoo on the bear's inner lip indicates that it was from New Jersey. Noting that bears are good swimmers, he theorized that the animal swam across the Delaware River to find a new home.
"The bear wasn't any threat to anybody," Krieder told LehighValleyLive.com . "It was just looking for somewhere to eat, take a break."

Encroaching development often prompts bears to leave their ranges, and it's not unusual for them to stray into populated areas on their way to a new home, Kreider said. And while young bears can wander into neighborhoods in the spring as they strike out on their own, adult bears also move around this time of year because it is mating season, he said.
The bear remains in the custody of the game commission and is doing fine, Krieder said. Pennsylvania and New Jersey authorities will discuss on which side of the river the animal will be released, he said.

TAIPEI  The number of people injured in a fire at a Taiwan water amusement park rose to 516 on Sunday, government officials said, with more than 180 still in intensive care.
Media reported four mainland Chinese and two foreigners were among those injured after Saturday's fire, during a party where up to 1,000 revelers were sprayed with colored powder as they danced to music, seeking to escape the summer heat.
The blaze, which broke out around 8:30 p.m. at the Formosa Fun Coast water park on the outskirts of the capital, Taipei, is suspected to have been caused by an explosion of the powder, local government official Lin Chieh-yu told Reuters.

"It remains under investigation as to what made the powder explode," he added. Authorities have banned the use of the powder until the investigation is completed.
"The next few days will be a critical time for the injured," Taiwan Premier Mao Chi-kuo told reporters, adding that 410 people were still in hospital on Sunday, with 194 being treated for serious injuries.
In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, rescuers treated hundreds of people, most of them aged between 20 and 30, wearing wet swimsuits and lying on inflatable plastic doughnuts. Television showed images of people running from sky-high flames.
"There was blood and people were on fire," one injured man said.
No death has yet been reported, but victims of the incident suffered burns to the limbs, with some passing out from the pain while others had burned clothes stuck to their skin, media reports and pictures showed.

"She is young. A student," sobbed the father of an 18-year-old girl with burns on 80 percent of her body, according to television footage.
Soldiers, army vehicles and medical services joined the rescue effort, while hospitals in four municipal precincts, along with Taipei, are treating sufferers.
"We are very sorry about what happened and we will investigate the cause to find out who is responsible," Eric Chu, the mayor of New Taipei City, where the park is located, said on Saturday, adding that it had been ordered to shut down.
The amusement park has been closed temporarily, it said on its website on Sunday. Taipei has sweltered in temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in recent weeks.

Students Get Surprise Visit From CEO Dan Price Who Took Pay Cut to Raise Salaries

&lt;iframe width="635" height="500" src="http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=nn_jfr_ceo_surprise_150627" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
When CEO Dan Price raised the minimum wage to $70,000 at his small business in April, the story went viral, and Gravity Payments, a Seattle company that processes credit card payments, became an overnight household name.
Price dropped his salary from about $1 million to $70,000 in order to increase pay for many of his employees.
In the weeks that have followed, Price has received hundreds of messages  some from CEOs who followed suit with similar moves and others from critics who feel the decision will destroy Price's company.
For more on this story, tune into Weekend Nightly News at 6:30 p.m. ET
Of all the notes that he has received, the most striking to Price was a stack of 33 letters  delivered by mail  from a class of sixth graders at Woodbury Elementary School in Irvine, California.

"I honestly support your idea. Your kind heart will touch the lives of all your employees."
"I know some people might give you some criticism, but my class and I look up to you for all the sacrifices you've made."

For the students, it was a chance to practice writing business letters. But teacher Hilary Dimitruk also saw a deeper lesson.
"This was a great example of all the values we try to instill in our students here," she said.

The students were anxiously hoping Price would reply with a letter of his own.
The CEO had a better idea. Price showed up in person in their classroom last month, stunning the kids  and their teacher.
For about an hour, Price answered their questions about the business world and the reasons behind his wage hike. At the end, he asked the students to continue sending him notes and even added an incentive.
"If you write one letter every year, I am going to set aside a $1,000 scholarship for every single one of you," Price announced.
The kids and their teacher broke into applause. The exercise started as a lesson in business and resulted in an unexpected bonus.

Huckabee, Other GOP Hopefuls Slam Gay Marriage Ruling

DENVER  Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee told conservatives Saturday that the Supreme Court tried to "unwrite the laws of nature and the laws of nature's God" when it legalized gay marriage across the nation.
The former Arkansas governor suggested that people in the United States flout the ruling, as President Abraham Lincoln did in the wake of the justices' 1857 decision that blacks could not be citizens. Huckabee also pointed out that President Barack Obama opposed gay marriage until 2012.
"He was either lying in 2008, or he's lying now, or God has rewritten the Bible and only Barack Obama has gotten the new edition," Huckabee told the crowd at the Western Conservative Summit.

Huckabee was among the GOP presidential hopefuls at the gathering, which followed a week in which the high court also upheld Obama's signature health care law. The Republicans offered few suggestions on what to do about the gay marriage ruling, highlighting the party's challenges on social issues ahead of the 2016 elections.

One man was killed and eight people were rescued after a pontoon boat with nine aboard was swept over a dam in Maryland, officials said.
The name of the deceased or those rescued was not released. The accident occurred just before 6:30 p.m. on Lake Linganore in Frederick County, west of Baltimore.
"Neighbors heard calls for help and saw people hanging over the dam," Frederick County Fire and Rescue Services Division Capt. Kevin Fox said.

Four people hanging from the dam were rescued, three were pulled out of the spillway by a helicopter and another passenger was rescued by a boat, Fox said.

Before the boat went over the spillway some aboard jumped overboard, and a few people were found clinging to a tree near the water's edge, Candy Thomson of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police Department said.
The cause of the accident was not released. The body of the boat's driver, only identified as a 62-year-old man, was trapped underwater by the force of the falling water but was recovered later Saturday, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police said.
It is unclear if weather played any role in the accident, Thomson said. Periods of heavy rain were reported shortly before 2 p.m. at Frederick Municipal Airport, just a few miles west of Lake Linganore, according to the National Weather Service.

Coast Guard Suspends Search for Missing Olympic Sailor Trevor Moore

The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday suspended its three-day search for missing Olympic sailor Trevor Moore.
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the loved ones affected," Coast Guard Capt. Michael Long said in a statement. "Despite the tireless search efforts by multiple agencies and good Samaritans, we were unable to find Mr. Moore."

Moore, a member of the 2012 U.S. Olympic sailing team, was reported missing Thursday after his 16-foot boat was found in a Miami marina with the engine still running and his possessions on board, but the 30-year-old was nowhere to be seen.
The boat was found at Dinner Key Marina at around 6 p.m. Thursday, the Coast Guard said. The marina is near Biscayne Bay, where the United States Sailing Association said Moore was last seen. Moore was out on the boat alone, US Sailing said.

The search was called off as night fell Saturday. The Coast Guard said searchers covered more than 510 square nautical miles during the massive three-day search, which included a Coast Guard helicopter and rescue boat as well as boats from Miami police, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the National Park Service and members of the public.
"At some point during his journey something must have happened because the boat came back to the marina, was found kind of tied up in some mooring lines without anyone on board," Liz Barraco of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission told NBC Miami on Friday.
Moore finished 15th in the skiff event at the 2012 London Games.

A man was shot in the arm and several people detained after an argument broke out and shots were fired near the Civic Center/United Nations Plaza Saturday, just as San Francisco Pride celebrations were winding down nearby.
The shooting was "unrelated" to Pride events, police said, and stemmed from a dispute between several groups of young men. As the argument escalated, a suspect pulled out a gun and fired several shots.

One of the bullets hit a 64-year-old Pride spectator in the arm, police said. He was transported to San Francisco General Hospital and was reported to be in stable condition.
As the shots rang out, people nearby screamed and fled while police officers responded to the scene, according to several cell phone videos apparently recorded near the scene of the shooting.
Police said they were called to the area on a report of shots fired   just after 6 p.m. Officers detained several possible suspects on Market   Street.
The Crime Scene Unit, Gang Task Force and Night Investigations Units were on scene, police said.

Greece's parliament voted early Sunday in favor of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' motion to hold a July 5 referendum on creditor proposals for reforms in exchange for loans, with the country's future in the eurozone looking increasingly shaky.
Tsipras' surprise call stunned Greece's international debt negotiators, and the country took a big step closer to falling out of the euro currency union after fellow eurozone member states refused to extend its bailout program past its expiration date on Tuesday, leaving Greece on the brink of financial chaos.
In the streets of Greece, worried people queued outside banks for cash from dawn to dusk after Tsipras' announcement in the early hours of Saturday, after billions of euros had already been emptied in the preceding weeks.

Greece has a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) debt due to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday and its bailout program expires the same day, after which it is unclear how the country might survive financially.
The referendum is set for next Sunday with the question on whether to accept proposed reforms needed to get bailout loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF. The government is advocating a rejection of the proposals.
The radical left-wing leader accused the creditors of using blackmail and ultimatums against his proud but struggling people. European officials and all Greek opposition parties except the extremist far-right Golden Dawn party called his move for a vote a foolish and rash gambit that effectively ended negotiations to keep Greece financially afloat.
The sudden move comes after five months of stalemated negotiations, with Tsipras accusing creditors of trying to strong-arm his country into taking harsh austerity measures he says would hammer an economy already on its knees after months of creditor-demanded spending cuts and tax hikes.
The referendum move further crumbled already strained relations between Greece and its European partners.
Tsipras said the Greek people would vote against a deal next Sunday.
"This no will also be a big yes, a big yes to the decision of the Greek government to reject an ultimatum that insults the Greek people."

Investigators Probe Alaska Plane Crash That Killed Cruise Passengers
by The Associated Press

A team of aviation investigators is now working in a remote, mountainous site in southeast Alaska to determine what caused the crash of a sightseeing plane that killed eight cruise ship passengers and the aircraft's pilot.
The DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter turboprop  also known as a floatplane  went down Thursday. The excursion was sold through the cruise company Holland America.
Seven investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board made it to the crash site on Saturday morning and are spending the day scouring for clues to the disaster, said Clint Johnson, head of the board's Alaska office.
The plane was on its way back from the Misty Fjords National Monument, a wilderness area of lakes, snowcapped peaks and glacial valleys, Johnson said. The terrain where the plane crashed is steep, mountainous, and often sees strong winds and rain.

Johnson said the airplane's wings and tail broke off during impact, but the fuselage  the body of the plane  was largely intact. Officials said the plane crashed about 25 miles from Ketchikan on a cliff, 800 feet above Ella Lake in steep, muddy terrain. The cause of the crash isn't yet known.
"It's way too early to speculate," Johnson said. "We can't speculate out of respect to the families."
The eight passengers were on a cruise on the Holland America Line ship Westerdam. Their 7-day cruise had departed from Seattle on June 20.
Ketchikan-based airline Promech Air, operators of the airplane, said the pilot  64-year-old Bryan Krill, 64, of Hope, Idaho  had joined the company early this year as a summertime pilot.

A company spokeswoman said Krill was a skilled and experienced pilot with a good safety record. He had flown for many years and had 4,300 hours of flight experience, including roughly 1,700 hours piloting single engine seaplanes. The airplane that crashed is one of five floatplanes operated by the company.
