How Trump helps -- and also maybe hurts -- Jeb Bush
If you're Jeb Bush, the Republican presidential race becoming ALL ABOUT DONALD TRUMP has its positives. One, it freezes the rest of the field, sucking up oxygen from other candidates who might pop. Two, it provides him a foil to campaign against. Jeb can say, "I'm Mr. Responsible Republican, and we can't allow the irresponsible ones take over our party." And we saw Bush start to make this argument against Trump over the July 4 holiday weekend. But the rise of Trump has one big drawback for Jeb: It further exposes the party's wounds on immigration. Look no further than how Trump fired back at Bush's criticism. "[H]e doesn't understand anything about the border or border security. In fact, Jeb believes illegal immigrants who break our laws when they cross our border come out 'out of love.'" Indeed, Jeb's 2014 "act of love" comment is potentially radioactive in a GOP primary. It's one thing for a Republican to believe in immigration reform and a path to legal status; it's another to say that illegal immigration is an act of love. And as we've learned, Donald Trump isn't going to be shy at resurrecting those old quotes.
The immigration outrage doesn't match the data
Here's an additional point we want to make about Trump and the immigration debate: The outrage doesn't match the data. After all, illegal immigration from Mexico has declined . Deportations have gone up . And given the focus on the murder in San Francisco committed by an undocumented immigrant, the crime rate for first-generation immigrants is lower than the overall crime rate .

Who makes the debate stage -- and who doesn't?
With the first GOP presidential debate now less than a month from now, one of your authors crunched the numbers from the last five national polls (two from Fox, one CNN, one NBC/WSJ, and one from Monmouth), and below are the polling averages. Remember, the first debate is restricted to the Top 10:
Bush - 15.4 %

A reality check on the Hillary-vs.-Sanders horserace
Hillary Clinton today campaigns in Iowa, making stops in Iowa City and Ottumwa. She also sits down for the first national TV interview since becoming a presidential candidate, although she's conducted interviews with local political reporters in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. And we have a hunch that one question she gets is about Bernie Sanders' rise in the polls. Here's how the New York Times framed the Clinton-Sanders horserace : "Hillary Clinton's Team Is Wary as Bernie Sanders Finds Footing in Iowa." But as our sister publication The Lid noted yesterday , there are four things to keep in mind about Sanders' rise:
She's still ahead in Iowa by at least 19 points, a much wider margin than exists in the GOP race;
This kind of NYT story only helps the Clinton camp lower expectations;
Sanders' surge is being fueled by progressive whites -- the same folks who supported Bill Bradley in 2000 and Howard Dean in 2004. In fact, what Sanders has done is consolidate the 30% who were there for Elizabeth Warren. (What should concern Clinton Land is if he starts creeping up into the 40s;
And as the political scientists put it, the party (though its elected officials) ultimately decide the nomination. And so far, two-thirds of sitting Democratic senators have endorsed Hillary. That, to political scientists, matters more than the polls or crowd sizes.
In short, Sanders has consolidated the progressive wing of the party, and that is impressive. The question is: Can he grow it? And remember, a recent Gallup poll showed that a presidential candidate being labeled a socialist was the worst attribute -- lower than being a Muslim or an atheist. And for Sanders to TRULY take off, he needs to prove to Democratic elites that a socialist like him could win a general election.

Iran talks to extend -- again
Here's Andrea Mitchell on the latest in the Iran talks: "The State Department in Vienna announced it is taking steps to extend the agreement currently in place with Iran until July 10. Spokeswoman Marie Harf says they are more concerned about the quality of the deal than they are about the clock. Secretary of State Kerry plans to remain in Vienna to continue discussions."

The fundraising rules? There really are no rules
Welcome to our brave new world in fundraising for the presidential contest. Exhibit A: The Super PAC backing Carly Fiorina reported raising twice as much ($3.4 million) as the Fiorina campaign raised for 2nd quarter ($1.4 million). Exhibit B: The 501c4 helping Marco Rubio -- which doesn't have to disclose its donors -- says it's raked in nearly $16 million, which could very well exceed the haul by Rubio's campaign. Exhibit C: As we reported yesterday, the Ted Cruz campaign issued a press release highlighting BOTH its campaign's 2nd-quarter numbers and the expected Super PAC cash. And we thought that campaigns weren't supposed to coordinate with the Super PACs!!! But as the Washington Post writes , the fundraising rules in the Super PAC Era are that there really are no rules. "Operatives on both sides can talk to one another directly, as long as they do not discuss candidate strategy. According to an FEC rule, an independent group also can confer with a campaign until this fall about 'issue ads' featuring a candidate. Some election-law lawyers think that a super PAC could share its entire paid media plan, as long as the candidate's team does not respond."
FEC hasn't opened an investigation into alleged illegal Super PAC coordination
Why are there no rules? Answer: The Federal Election Commission doesn't seem to care. "Since 2010, the FEC has yet to open an investigation into alleged illegal super PAC coordination, closing 29 such complaints. In 28 of those cases, the agency's general counsel did not recommend pursuing the matters, according to Goodman of the FEC," the Post adds . Wow.
Carly's unimpressive fundraising numbers
One more point about Fiorina's $1.4 million campaign haul and the $3.4 million for her Super PAC: For a candidate who got buzz over the last 60 days, those AREN'T impressive numbers. In fact, $1.4 million is a barely considered a decent quarterly haul for a Senate candidate these days.
Rubio: "The race for the future will never be won by going backward"
In Chicago at 10:00 am ET, Marco Rubio will deliver a domestic-policy speech, in which his argument will be -- again -- that he represents the future. "For the first fifteen and a half years of this century, Washington has looked to the past. Our economy has changed, but our economic policies have not," he is expected to say, according to advanced excerpts of his speech. "And we have learned, painfully, that the old ways no longer work - that Washington cannot pretend the world is the same as it was in the '80s, it cannot raise taxes like it did in the '90s, and it cannot grow government like it did in the 2000s. The race for the future will never be won by going backward." He will add, "We need a new president for a new age - one with original ideas to unlock the two great doors to the future: the doors of innovation and education." After his remarks in Chicago, Rubio heads to campaign in Iowa.

VIENNA  Iran and major powers will continue negotiations on an historic nuclear deal past Tuesday's deadline for a long-term agreement, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.
"We are continuing to negotiate for the next couple of days. This does not mean we are extending our deadline," Mogherini told reporters.
The deal under discussion between Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States is aimed at curbing Tehran's most sensitive nuclear work for a decade or more, in exchange for relief from sanctions that have slashed Iran's oil exports and crippled its economy.

LONDON  As Londoners paused to remember victims on the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 transit bombings on Tuesday, police and security experts warned that terrorism remains a threat due to the "wicked cult" of ISIS.
Many of the British capital's world-famous red buses pulled over as the city observed a minute's silence at 11:30am (6:30 a.m. ET)  one of a series of ceremonies marking the suicide bombings that killed 52 people and seriously wounded hundreds more during the morning rush hour.
Commuters were asked to make part of their journey on foot, recreating the defiance shown on July 7, 2005 when millions continued their daily routines to show they would not be cowed by the atrocity  the single worst on British soil.

However, Prime Minister David Cameron warned: "Ten years on  the threat continues to be as real as it is deadly."
Experts agreed, saying the rise of individuals inspired by ISIS posed new issues for the security services.
"I think the threat has changed over the last 10 years and I think that this is more about lone actors now than it was," said Charlie Winter, researcher with the U.K.-based Quilliam Foundation.

Claude Monet's Water Lily Paintings Almost Never Existed
by Alexander Smith

Hundreds of the most famous paintings ever committed to canvas almost never came into being  all because of a group of paranoid French farmers, an exhibition curator has revealed.
Claude Monet completed around 250 paintings of his water lily garden in northern France, with the most valuable work selling for $80.4 million at a London auction in 2008.
But according to documents unearthed by Ann Dumas, co-curator of an upcoming exhibition on the subject in Cleveland, Ohio, and London, U.K., Monet's impressive water garden depicted in the images was not welcomed by his neighbors in 1893.
"There was a protest from local farmers who were very suspicious of these strange aquatic plants that Monet wanted to plant because they they would poison their water and kill their cattle," Dumas told a press briefing Monday attended by the BBC .

As well as becoming one of the most iconic names in the art world, Monet was an avid gardener. The impressionist wanted to divert the river Epte into his property in Giverny, France, to create the soon-to-be-famous water garden.
But fearing the effect the water lilies might have on their livestock, the farmers wrote to local officials in 1893 in an attempt to block his plans.
Monet only gained permission to proceed "after a lot of difficulty," Dumas said, according to the BBC.
The exhibition "Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse Exhibition" will tell the story of how gardens featured in the work of Monet and his peers. It will run at the Cleveland Museum of Art from October 11 to January 5 next year, and then the Royal Academy of Arts, in London, from January 30 to April 20.

A New Orleans cop has been arrested and suspended for allegedly withholding evidence involving the suspect charged in a fellow officer's shooting death, police said.
Officer Daryle Holloway was shot and killed while transporting aggravated assault suspect Travis Boys to jail .
The New Orleans Police Department has been investigating how Boys allegedly killed Holloway and escaped custody. It said in a statement Monday that an interview with the officer who initially arrested Boys for aggravated assault on June 20 revealed "sloppy police work"

Detectives allege Johnson "deliberately attempted" to leave a .40 caliber casing at the scene and "not process it for evidence," the force said in a statement. "In addition, detectives learned that Officer Johnson recovered a box of unused .40 caliber bullets at the scene and did not process it as evidence."
While Johnson told detectives he did not remember where he had left the box of bullets, "shortly after the interview, detectives observed Johnson removing the box of bullets from his vehicle and throwing them out of the window while driving," the statement said. "Johnson admitted to throwing the box of bullets out of his window," it added.
"I am extremely disgusted and outraged by the lack of professionalism and integrity shown by this officer," NOPD Superintendent Michael Harrison said. "This is an example of sloppy police work with a clear intent to cover it up, and it will not stand."
Johnson has been arrested for obstruction of justice, theft and malfeasance in office.
New Orleans Police Officer Wardell Johnson was suspended on July 7 after he was accused of withholding evidence in an assault case involving a man who later killed an officer, police said.

Bill Cosby said in a 2005 legal deposition that he obtained prescriptions of a powerful sedative to give to women he wanted to have sex with, according to documents released Monday in a Pennsylvania court.
The comedian's testimony was part of a civil suit involving a woman who accused him of drugging her and sexually assaulting her.
At one point, Cosby was asked by the woman's attorney about his use of prescriptions for the pills, known as Quaaludes.
"When you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?" the lawyer asked.
"Yes," Cosby said, according to the document, which was released after a request by The Associated Press.

One Killed, Four Injured as Washington State Ice Caves Collapse Again

A hiker was killed and four others injured when ice caves on a remote Washington state mountainside partly collapsed, authorities said Monday night.
Three of the injured were were airlifted to hospital with serious injuries after the accident at the Big Four Ice Caves in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
The body of the hiker could not immediately be recovered because of the "fragile nature of the ice," Snohomish County spokeswoman Shari Ireton said.

Survivor Chloe Jakubowski, 18, escaped from the cave and went to alert emergency services.
"There was a loud pop above us," she told NBC News. "Once I saw the ice chunks falling I ducked for cover and held my hands over my head."
A woman next to her was unconscious, she said.
It was the second straight day that part of the ice caves  which are accessible only by a 26-mile narrow, winding road  collapsed on Big Four Mountain, about 20 miles east of the town of Granite Falls. No one was injured in Sunday's collapse, which a visitor captured on video.

The caves are formed when runoff from melting snow hollows out a tunnel in snow mounds that slide off the mountain and collect at the base of a cliff. The main cave, nearly 100 feet deep and 25 feet wide, is among the most popular hiking destinations in the Cascade Mountains.
But authorities have long warned that the caves are dangerous, because when temperatures rise, they can fall apart in giant ice mounds.
Susan Gregg, a spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, said the hospital was treating two males for head lacerations and leg and pelvis fractures. A female patient arrived shortly afterward.
All the injured were conscious, but one man, 25, was in critical condition, Gregg said. A second man, 35, was in serious condition and the woman, 35, was in satisfactory condition.

One girl who was not seriously injured in the collapse was transported by ground and being treated at Providence Medical Center in Everett.
Snohomish County emergency officials said the area around the Big Four ice caves would remain closed until search and rescue teams could assess the safety of the caves and recover the deceased victim of the collapse.
Temperatures reached 80 degrees in the area of the caves Monday as Washington swelters through a heat wave. The heat led the U.S. Forest Service to issue a special warning in May alerting hikers that the main cave was in a "dangerous state ... large, inviting and collapsing," and urging them to stay out of it. Several signs along the trail warn people to steer clear.

The former Beatle opens up about his late bandmate
In a new interview with the U.K. edition of Esquire magazine, Paul McCartney has opened up on the subject of John Lennon, the Beatles bandmate whose posthumous reputation McCartney seems to find frustrating.
Describing his reaction to Lennons assassination in 1980, McCartney said, in part:
Yeah, John was the witty one, sure. John did a lot of great work, yeah. And post-Beatles he did more great work, but he also did a lot of not-great work. Now the fact that hes now martyred has elevated him to a James Dean, and beyond. So whilst I didnt mind thatI agreed with itI understood that now there was going to be revisionism. It was going to be: John was the one.
McCartney also expressed regret that a plan to alternate the Beatles songwriting credits between Lennon/McCartney and McCartney/Lennon did not come to pass, specifically citing the song Yesterday, written by McCartney solely.
I said, Could we have By Paul McCartney and John Lennon, wouldnt that be a good idea? [] Particularly on that particular song, because the original artwork had Yesterday by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and a photo of John above it. And I went, Argh! Come on, lads! Anyway they wouldnt do it.

Robocall Credit Card Interest Scam Continues to Plague Consumers
by Herb Weisbaum

Has "Rachel from Card Services" called you?
Telephone fraudsters know that Americans are fed up with high interest rates on their credit card balances and have for years been trying to cash in on that frustration by tricking consumers into paying them as much as several thousand dollars for bogus rate reduction programs.
This con, often initiated by pre-recorded robocallers like "Rachel," has been going on for years. And despite numerous enforcement actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it just won't go away.
'It's disheartening'
Bikram Bandy, coordinator of the FTC's Do Not Call Program, says he is concerned that many people are falling for the scam - and losing money - when offered the "too-good-to-be true" promise of unrealistically low interest rates.
advertisement
"It's disheartening that this scam continues, and it does continue because the scammers are still making money from it," Bandy told NBC News.
Like most telemarketing frauds these days, this scam typically starts with a recorded message from "credit services" or "card member services," often in the voice of "Rachel" but also from others, saying you qualify for a special interest rate reduction program that will help you pay off your balance sooner.

Respond to the message and you'll be connected to a representative who falsely claims to work for your bank or credit card company.
Victims who take the bait either get nothing for their money or the scammer does something that they could have done on their own - for free - such as asking the credit card company for a hardship rate reduction.

In recent years, the FTC has sued more than a dozen boiler-room operations making these bogus credit card rate reduction offers. And yet, the calls keep going out. In fact, when it comes to robocall complaints, these rate reduction calls top the list.
Several weeks ago, the FTC and Florida Attorney General sued an Orlando-based telemarketer that allegedly had been bombarding people across the country with rate reduction robocalls since 2011. A federal district court judge agreed to temporarily shut down the company.
"Too often the services promised were never provided, and the consumer faced even more credit card debt through charges made without their consent," Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
They may say it's 'free,' but it's not
Rosa Pagan, who lives near Philadelphia, got one of these calls last year. She wound up talking to "Eugene," who claimed to be associated with her Sears MasterCard. He claimed that because of her good payment history, she was "pre-qualified" to have the interest rate on her card reduced from 24 percent to zero.

"He had my complete credit card number and account information, so I really thought he was calling from Sears," Pagan told NBC News. "And he assured me there was no charge for this; it was free."
Once Eugene "verified" that she was qualified, he transferred Pagan to a "supervisor" who told her the service would cost $1,900, but he was willing to give her a special deal of $1,400. Pagan said "no," and told him she didn't want anything to do with the company.

When her next credit card statement arrived, Pagan found an unauthorized charge of $1,498 for the service she had declined. She complained to Sears, which reversed the fraudulent charge. Pagan told the FTC she did not give the company her card number and she does not know how they got it.
"It's terrible what they're doing to people," Pagan said. "You have a phone in your house and you can't pick it up because you never know what scam is going to come through the phone. We got caller ID and I will not answer the phone unless I am expecting the call or it's from someone I know."

Dealing with robocalls
Robocalls continue to be a serious problem. These automated calls are the cheapest and easiest way for telemarketing scammers to find their victims.
Remember: If you get a robocall that's trying to sell you something, that call is illegal unless you have given that company specific permission to call you.
If you pick up the phone and it is a robocall - hang up. Don't press any keys to speak to an operator or to add your number to their do not call list. These crooks don't have a do not call list. And never call back. If you respond in any way, it will probably lead to more robocalls.
Never give personal information, such as credit card, checking account or Social Security number to an unknown caller, not even if the caller tries to "confirm" this information. That's just a trick, possibly aimed at getting you to reveal your personal details or getting you to supply missing information, like a PIN, for data obtained from a hacker or some other nefarious source.
If you are struggling to make payments on your credit card, contact a reputable credit counselor. You can find a nonprofit agency near you by going to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling website.

ISIS' rampant destruction and looting of millennia-old heritage sites amounts to a form of "cultural cleansing," according to the head of the United Nations' heritage body.
UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova told NBC News that the extremists' campaign of wiping out antiquities in Iraq and Syria was unprecedented in contemporary history and classifiable as a war crime under international law.
"Cultural cleansing, in my view, is exactly what's happening in Iraq ," Bokova said in an interview. "These extremists want to impose a different vision on the world. They want to tell us that there is no memory [of these sites], that there is no culture, that there is no heritage."

Since announcing the establishment of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria last year, ISIS has destroyed dozens of historically-significant sites, according to UNESCO.

Heritage officials feared another irreplaceable loss in May after the Islamist group sized the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra , a UNESCO world heritage site and "one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world," according to the U.N. body.

Countless other places falling under ISIS' territory could be at risk. The group controls more than 20 percent of the 10,000 archaeological sites in Iraq alone, Bokova said at a discussion organized by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London.
As if to underline her concerns, security consultancy and NBC News partner Flashpoint Intelligence reported that ISIS released a statement the same day saying it had crushed a collection of statues that a suspected "smuggler" was attempting to remove from Palmyra.

Bokova explained that part of the problem was that there were "no inventories, no lists" of many relics.
"It's not like taking objects from the museum," she added.

Bokova said the "enormous legacy" and "wonderful remnants of heritage" from the long-standing Christian, Jewish, Yazidi and Muslim communities in the region all were at risk.
"It is about destroying of cultural heritage, it is about looting, it is about uprooting people from their living communities and it is about destroying the incredible cultural diversity of the Middle East and Iraq," she said.
The key difference between the damage being done by ISIS and the losses seen in previous conflicts was that it was "not the collateral damage of a conflict, it is a systematic," Bokova said. "It is very deliberate destruction."
But UNESCO and other heritage groups say that as well as proudly destroying some antiquities, ISIS has been looting precious items from these sites and selling them on the black market to fund their operations.

Bokova said it was impossible to know exactly how much money the Islamists were making in this way because "there are so many illicit activities going on."
However, she told the RUSI discussion that it was "safe to assume the trade in conflict antiquities from Syria and Iraq represents millions of dollars for violent extremist groups."
She told NBC News that "every single day, at some customs [authority] somewhere in the world, we see artifacts appearing from Syria from Iraq."

According to Chris Marinello, London-based lawyer specializing in looted art, ISIS represents the "gravest single threat to cultural heritage since the Second World War."
Marinello said there were reports the group was using eBay, Facebook and the instant messaging service WhatsApp to find buyers.
"A parallel can be drawn between the way [ISIS] is treating looted works of art and what the Nazis did it with so called 'degenerate art' looted from Jewish families 75 years ago," he said.
According to Marinello, both the Nazis and ISIS recognized the propaganda value in destroying some of the items they felt went against their beliefs, while simultaneously cashing in by selling others on the black market.
In an attempt to turn the tide, Bokova has brought together U.N. bodies, Interpol and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit) to allow experts to share their knowledge and attempt to monitor the exchange of these artifacts on the black market.
"It is said, 'You can't fight an enemy you don't know,'" she told last Thursday's RUSI discussion. "This is why we need more research and better analysis."

Chicago Funeral Homes Face Challenges in Gang Territory

There were more than 2,000 shootings in Chicago last year, and the city is on pace for more this year. The violence worsens in the summer months: over the holiday weekend , dozens of people were shot and nine died in the gunfire. Beneath the sobering figures are personal stories, both of fear and resilience. NBC News' Tracy Jarrett spent time in Chicago to hear them.
Part 2 in a series.

CHICAGO  At A.A. Rayner &amp; Sons funeral home in Chicago, Charles Childs is used to planning celebrations of long lives. His biggest concern traditionally has been timing the stop lights as he leads grieving families in a procession to the cemetery.
These days, though, he has to worry about arranging a police presence to control the large, often emotional crowds that show up for the funerals of young people whose lives have been cut short by gun violence.
Rayner &amp; Sons is a predominantly black funeral home founded in 1947 on the city's South Side. It handled the funerals for Emmett Till, the 14-year-old slain in Mississippi in 1955 after reportedly flirting with a white woman, and Mayor Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor.
Childs is the president of the funeral home and has been in the business for 40 years. He used to see one or two violence-related funerals a year. Now, he says he directs one or two every month.
So he has to take into consideration all sorts of things that he otherwise wouldn't  avoiding certain gang colors, navigating a tricky route between the service and the cemetery and hiring cops to keep the peace.

At these funerals for interrupted lives, the mood is as much tense as somber. Eulogies must be delicately written for "kids who may have been doing things they shouldn't have been doing," Childs said. The smallest thing can turn grief to violence.
"It could be something so minor, like somebody stepping on somebody's foot or not saying hello or being asked to take their hat off," Childs said.
In 2012, two men were shot outside a funeral that Childs was directing for a reputed gang member. One was critically injured, the other killed on the church steps. The family of the deceased had not told Childs about the gang association, so he hadn't arranged for police.
"I was standing over him when his eyes rolled in the back of his head," Childs recalled.
Behind the scenes, funeral directors in Chicago are dealing with demographic challenges  young mothers and grandparents, some of whom have wrenching questions about how and why death visited their young children. Others are all too aware.

Pamela Rayner, one of the owners of the funeral home, remembers one mother who would not speak for 15 minutes when she came to arrange services for her son. At the funeral, she stood outside for 25 minutes before entering.
"It kind of got to me because I'm thinking to myself this is her only child," Rayner said. "Can you imagine not today, not tomorrow, but next week when everybody is gone and everybody is back to their old daily work, she has to go into their son's house, in their son's room, and start putting away his clothes."
She has seen mothers and grandmothers who have taken out life insurance on their own kids. She had to stop one funeral because of the threat of gang retaliation, and tell the mourners that for their own protection the service couldn't go on.
Cost is a concern, too, for families and the funeral home alike. Rayner &amp; Sons and other funeral homes often provide pro bono services or deep discounts.
advertisement
An average family who comes to Rayner &amp; Sons spends $6,000 to $7,000 on the funeral alone, plus $2,000 to $5,000 on cemetery and burial fees. Many families that have lost children to violence can only pay a fraction of the cost, Childs said.
"We try to make sure they get the kind of decent service they can afford or that we can afford to give them," said Marguerite Gatling of Gatling Chapel, a funeral home that she runs with her husband on the South Side.
The Gatlings say they have seen families sell shirts and pins with the name and face of their loved one to cover the costs. Others have asked for donations at the services.

Still, Marguerite Gatling said, she and her husband try not to let money limit what they can provide for families who have lost a child to gun violence. Others who can pay full price keep the funeral home solvent.
Making sacrifices to honor the dead is important to the Gatlings. Lafayette Gatling Sr., Marguerite's husband, remembers his mother's funeral when he was five. He remembers a viewing at his home, and being ashamed at the simple casket.
He doesn't want anyone else to feel that way.
"Regardless of how this person lived or what he did or what crime he committed, it's not our personal business," he said. "Somebody loved this person. If nobody loved him, nobody would be here."

The Florida State University quarterback seen on video punching a woman in the face was fighting back after being provoked, his lawyer told NBC News.
De'Andre Johnson, 19, has been charged with battery following the June 24 incident at a Tallahassee club. The freshman player was kicked off the FSU football team after surveillance video emerged which appeared to show the freshman quarterback taking a swing at the unidentified woman.
According to his lawyer, Johnson was not the initial aggressor  but is "owning this" and trying to learn from the experience.

The woman raised her fist and shouted "racial epithets" at Johnson when the player accidentally made contact when he was walking up to the bar, lawyer Jose Baez told NBC News.
Johnson "tried to deescalate the situation" but the woman "kneed him in the groin area" and "took another swing before he retaliated," the attorney added.

"It wasn't until she struck him twice that he reacted," Baez said. "But he is very...He is very regretful that he didn't turn around and walk away immediately."

"He makes no excuses for what happened," he added.
Baez called Johnson's dismissal from the football team "unfortunate" and said his client is now volunteering at a shelter for battered women.
"All he wants to do is learn from this experience and move on and get an education," Baez said. "We certainly don't want him to pay for the rest of his life for an incident that occurred in a bar."
Court documents said the victim was trying to defend herself after she was pushed and grabbed by Johnson. A witness heard the victim yell "no" at Johnson twice before he punched her in the face, according to an affidavit.
The victim  who has declined comment to NBC News  suffered bruising under her left eye, swelling to the left cheek and a small cut near the bridge of her nose in the incident.

KABUL, Afghanistan  A NATO military convoy was hit by a suicide car bomb in the Afghan capital on Tuesday, officials told NBC News.
The Taliban claimed subsequently claimed responsibility for the blast in the Shah Shaheed area of the city, but NATO said that no coalition forces were killed in the explosion.
Around three or four civilians were injured in the bombing, according to the Ministry of Public Health. Abdul Bashir, a local police officer at the scene, had told NBC News earlier that "many people have been injured and ambulances are rushing [them] to the hospitals."

U.S. Army Col. Brian Tribus, spokesman for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, confirmed there had been an "attack on coalition forces" at around 11:30 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET).
He said the force was "gathering further information on this incident" but confirmed in a statement that no NATO personnel had been killed.

A deal returning NSA leaker Edward Snowden to the U.S. is not entirely out of the question , according to Eric Holder.
The former U.S. Attorney General told Yahoo News, I certainly think there could be a basis for a resolution that everybody could ultimately be satisfied with to return Snowden from his current asylum in Moscow. I think the possibility exists, he said.
Holder, who is going back to work at the law firm Covington &amp; Burling, where he worked before serving as Attorney General, said that Snowdens actions spurred a necessary debate on surveillance in America.
We are in a different place as a result of the Snowden disclosures, he said.

        <Description>Dr. Farid Fata could get as much as 175 years in prison when he is sentenced for misdiagnosing and over-treating patients.</Description>
        <MainBody>advertisement
Dozens of a disgraced cancer doctor's former patients  who say they were given false diagnoses or needless treatment  converged on a Detroit courthouse Monday for the start of a weeklong sentencing hearing.
Prosecutors are asking that Dr. Farid Fata, who pleaded guilty to fraud for bilking patients and insurance companies out of millions, get 175 years in prison.
About 35 of the victims took a bus to federal court for the chance to watch Fata as a government witness described his crimes.
"When he walked by me during one of the breaks, when they walked him out, I looked him square in the face. He had that 'Fata look'  smug," said Steven Skrzypczak.

Steve Skrzypczak, 68, was told he had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Fata implanted a mediport in his chest and gave him 25 treatments with one chemo drug in six months, Skrzypczak said.
After Fata's arrest in 2013, Skrzypczak went to two other oncologists who told him that he'd never had cancer.
"I want him to get life," the ex-patient said of the doctor.

In a pre-sentencing memo, prosecutors say 553 people allegedly got unnecessary treatment from Fata  amounting to 9,000 injections or infusions that cost insurance companies and patients millions. Some of the patients weren't even sick; others were so ill the treatments did more harm than good, prosecutors say.
advertisement
Fata's lawyer also filed a pre-sentencing memo, but it has been sealed. His attorneys have declined to comment on the allegations but they will get a chance to argue that he does not deserve a life sentence.
The hearing is expected to last at least four days. It opened with an expert witness for the government, Dr. Dan Longo, a Harvard oncologist who reviewed two dozen case files for prosecutors.
He said one patient identified only as C.C. received unnecessary chemotherapy for five years.
Fata's lawyer, Christopher Andreoff showed Longo evidence while he was on the stand that Longo had not previously seen that showed C.C. did in fact have cancer.
Longo said that while he would revise his testimony in light of that, he maintained, C.C. was treated with unnecessary chemotherapy.
"He's been treated continuously after going into remission," Longo said.
Fata's lawyer, Christopher Andreoff, retorted, "C.C. is alive after five years."
Longo said there was a common thread in the case files he examined.
"There is an aggressive approach to treating cancer  this was beyond aggressive. This was over the top."

Alabama Man Hunts Mystery Couple in Found Wedding Album
by Tracy Connor

When Randy Robinson bought an electronic photo frame at a discount shop in Alabama a few months ago, he didn't bargain on the mystery it contained.
The frame contained a data card, and Robinson, a engineer, was surprised to find out it was loaded with wedding pictures from July 2012
"I wanted to find the couple," he told NBC News on Monday.
He started by following the visual clues.
There was a photo of a catering truck, but when he called the company, they were reluctant to help and said their records didn't go back that far. He managed to trace the limousine to Massachusetts, but hasn't heard back from the company that owns it.
advertisement
Next step: Facebook.
Robinson posted a picture of the bride and groom with a shot-in-the-dark plea. By Monday afternoon, it had gotten 153,000 shares and he was deluged with friend requests.
"It's crazy," he said.
Six days after Robinson first posted the photo, a couple who own an event-planning company in the Boston area said on their Facebook page that they are the mystery newlyweds.
"This is hilarious!" they said. "Thank you everyone for posting this photo. We never lost our wedding photos thankfully, this is actually from a returned item we thought was broken (a digital picture frame). So heartwarming to know that people care so much."
The couple could not be immediately reached for comment to verify that they were the same bride and groom in the picture.

Prosecutors Charge Mexican Man With Murder in San Francisco Pier Death

Prosecutors have charged a Mexican immigrant with murder in the seemingly random shooting death of a woman who was on a waterfront stroll with her father last week in San Francisco.
Authorities said Monday that 45-year-old Francisco Sanchez is expected to be arraigned Tuesday in the death of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle. Sanchez, a repeat drug offender and undocumented immigrant who has been deported five times, was released from jail on April 15 in San Francisco.
The killing vaulted into the presidential race over the weekend, with Republican candidate Donald Trump pointing to it as evidence of his widely criticized comments last month about Mexican immigrants.

"This senseless and totally preventable act of violence committed by an illegal immigrant is yet another example of why we must secure our border immediately," Trump said in a statement. Trump's opponent Ted Cruz defended him on "Meet The Press," saying, "I salute Donald Trump for focusing on the need to fix illegal immigration."
Steinle's death has also brought criticism on San Francisco because it disregarded a request from immigration authorities to keep Sanchez locked up. The liberal city is one of dozens across the country that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The city goes so far as to promote itself as a "sanctuary" for people in the country illegally.
In a jailhouse interview with a TV station, Francisco Sanchez, the 45-year-old repeat drug offender arrested in the shooting last Wednesday of Kathryn Steinle, appeared to confirm that he came to the city because of its status as a sanctuary.
"Most of the blame should fall squarely on the shoulders of the San Francisco sheriff, because his department had custody of him and made the choice to let him go without notifying [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]," said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which wants tougher immigration enforcement.
Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi strongly defended his office's release of Sanchez and pointed the finger back at ICE, saying the federal agency should have issued an arrest warrant for Sanchez. Mayor Ed Lee issued a statement saying city policy was never intended to protect "repeat, serious and violent felons."

Lee asked for federal and local agencies to review what happened.
Many other San Francisco politicians stayed quiet as mourners held a late Monday morning vigil on the downtown waterfront where Steinle was gunned down.

BRISTOW, Okla.  Investigators were working Monday to identify a man who took more than $75,000 from an Oklahoma Walmart after disguising himself as an armored truck driver.
Bristow Police Chief Wayne Williams said authorities in northeast Oklahoma have received some anonymous tips about the identity of the man whose image was captured by a video surveillance camera.
"We've got some calls out on it, but nothing yet," Williams said. He said officials do not believe the suspect lives in the area.
Authorities say the suspect entered the Walmart store in Bristow about 10:30 a.m. Saturday, walked to the cash office, signed for the deposit and walked out of the store. He drove away in a dark four-door Chevrolet.
"He came to the Walmart kind of dressed like a Loomis armored car driver," Williams said. Walmart employees called police after the real Loomis employee arrived about 45 minutes later. Bristow is about 35 miles southwest of Tulsa.

Williams said Walmart has alerted its other stores about the theft and his department has notified other law enforcement agencies.
Walmart Stores Inc. spokeswoman Betsy Harden said she wasn't aware of any similar incidents involving other Wal-Mart stores.
"Obviously, it's an ongoing investigation," Harden said. She declined to comment on whether the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company plans to alter its policy on verifying the identity of workers who transport its cash deposits.
Williams said investigators have no evidence the suspect may have once worked for an armored transportation service and was familiar with its procedures.
"It's not something we suspect. It's a possibility," Williams said.
Loomis spokesman Danny Pack declined to comment on the case.

Four preteen boys will be charged with first-degree arson over a fire that destroyed a Oregon sports stadium on the National Register of Historic Places, authorities said Monday.
As weeping onlookers mournfully sang "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," Eugene's Civic Stadium  built in 1938 as part of the Depression-fighting Works Progress Administration  burned down June 29 just two months after a deal had been hammered out to give it new life as a facility for kids' sports.
Eugene police quickly zeroed in on five boys who had been seen near the stadium, and they were taken into custody last week.

Four of the boys, who weren't identified because they're all 10 to 12 years old, face a variety of other charges, including multiple counts of criminal mischief, burglary, reckless burning and reckless endangering, NBC station KMTR of Eugene and the Oregonian newspaper of Portland reported, quoting police and prosecutors.
"I don't know if you've talked to a 10- or 12-year-old boy recently. You don't get a whole lot of rational information out of them."
The fifth boy, whose parents tipped off police, won't be charged because he left the area before the fire started, police said.
Eugene police Detective Steve Williams told reporters the boys didn't appear to have intended to set the blaze, which they then fled from in panic on their bicycles.
"They were messing around, and they were lighting some debris on fire and just being kids," Williams said last week. But he said there's still much to be learned because interviews haven't yielded a great deal.
