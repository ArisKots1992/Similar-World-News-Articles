VACAVILLE &gt;&gt; California inmates are dying of drug overdoses at nearly triple the national rate and its unclear whether the tough steps state officials took this year to stop illicit drugs from getting into prisons are having any effect, though they are prompting criticism from civil rights advocates.
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is spending $8 million this year on drug-detecting scanners and a new breed of drug-sniffing dogs while also employing strip searches on visitors suspected of carrying drugs.
Corrections officials believe the stepped-up efforts are discouraging smuggling, but the data thats available so far doesnt support that  more than 6,000 scans have been done on visitors and employees at 11 prisons since December without finding anyone with drugs.
The state doesnt track if anyone has been arrested because of the dog searches and waited until mid-May to begin tracking the number of arrests made using any of the new procedures.
Meantime, criticism is mounting about false-positive results by the scanners and dogs that can lead to strip searches. Concerned lawmakers who oversee state prisons included language in the California budget plan passed this week that would end the searches and require an evaluation of the departments other efforts.
Its a humiliating process, can be easily used to humiliate and demean people, and was only for visitors, often women, Democratic Sen. Loni Hancock, said of the strip searches. There are many concerns about the dogs, which have historically been emblematic of intimidation of many communities of color, most notably during the civil rights movement.
But no one wants to see drug deaths, and she said the evaluation will show which of the new programs are effective.
More than 150 California inmates have died of drug overdoses since 2006, with a high of 24 in 2013. Moreover, the sharing of intravenous needles often spreads hepatitis C infections, which killed 69 inmates in 2013 alone.
Corrections Secretary Jeffrey Beard recently told lawmakers that drugs are rampant in the prisons.
What we are trying to do is send a message to people to not try to smuggle drugs in to the institution, he said in an interview. If we dont do this, were going to have people keep dying, were going to have continued violence in the prisons.
Beard is modeling Californias new procedures on those used successfully in the Pennsylvania corrections department he led for a decade. While California has a long-term annual rate of eight drug- or alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 inmates, Pennsylvanias is one.

Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio and Texas also each averaged one death a year per 100,000 inmates from 2001-2012, according to the most recent national figures. Maryland had the nations worst rate, at 17 deaths per 100,000 inmates.
Beard said Californias program would have more rapid success if lawmakers had given him more money, and he may seek funds to expand the program as early as this fall.
He believes the ion scanners  similar to those used to screen airport travelers  are deterring smugglers. The lack of results may be because only about 5 percent of visitors and employees are being scanned, he said, though the eventual goal is 30 percent. By contrast, Pennsylvania scanned 68 percent of visitors last year and at least 20 percent of employees.
Pennsylvania officials could not say how much contraband was found by using the scanners.
Records show the German shepherd and similar looking dogs long used in California prisons have been effective at rooting out hidden drugs. But to search visitors, employees and inmates the department is turning to less aggressive dogs including Labrador retrievers  fluffy, friendly dogs, Northern California canine program coordinator Sgt. Brian Pyle said.
The decision to use dogs to search humans, instead of unoccupied spaces as was previously the policy, prompted the resignation last fall of Wayne Conrad, the departments statewide canine program coordinator. He criticized the expense of sending California dog handlers to Pennsylvania for training, the use of breeds that he said are less reliable, and what he said was a supervisors effort to stifle concerns about the program because it was championed by Beard.
The dogs are going to start alerting on people whose kids are smoking dope or something, and that false positive could prompt an unnecessary strip search, Conrad said. The next thing thats going to come is the lawsuits.
Beard said he is seeking alternatives to strip searches, and downplayed the possibility that false-positive alerts unfairly implicate innocent visitors and employees. But thats what happened to Tania Gamboa of Riverside when she went to see her brother at Kern Valley State Prison.
She initially laughed when the ion machine tested positive for exposure to heroin, saying she doesnt even drink alcohol. But she was crying after she was required to strip naked in front of two female correctional officers and squat to demonstrate that she was not concealing drugs.
It doesnt make sense for me, knowing that I dont do all that and I got detected for it, she said.
Mohamed Shehk, an Oakland-based spokesman for Critical Resistance, which advocates for better conditions for inmates, said the policies are turning visitors into suspects.
The statistics  $8 million, 6,000 scans and nothing to show for it  show that these are intended to intimidate and criminalize people who are going to see their loved ones inside, he said.

NEW YORK &gt;&gt; In a box-office bout of Tyrannosaurus-sized proportions, Jurassic World kept the No. 1 spot with one of the biggest second weeks ever, while Pixars Inside Out nearly matched it with a $91 million debut well above expectations.
Universals Jurassic World took in $102 million in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday, making it only the second release to break $100 million in its second week. The enormous holdover for Jurassic World, which last week set an opening weekend record with $208.8 million, has been bested by only 2012s The Avengers, which made $103.1 million in second week.
The unexpected sensation of the Colin Trevorrow-directed, Steven Spielberg-produced fourth entry in the franchise had turned Disneys $175 million 3-D Inside Out into an underdog expected to merely nip at the heels of Jurassic World. But the emotional Inside Out, about the voices in the head of an 11-year-old girl, blew past its own forecasts to set records, too.
Inside Out was the first Pixar release not to open in first place, following an unparalleled two-decade streak of 14 straight no. 1s. But its the largest opening for a wholly original movie (one not based on source material or a sequel), unseating Avatar in that distinction. Directed by Pete Docter (Up) and co-directed by Ronaldo del Carmen, Inside Out had been expected to open in the range of previous Pixar non-sequels like Wall-E ($63.8 million opening) and Brave ($66.3 million).
But Inside Out was propelled by gushing reviews from critics, a flashy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival and an appetite for a movie from Pixar. The animation studio hadnt had a release in two years after delaying The Good Dinosaur last year.
We came into the weekend thinking wed do something in the 60s, said David Hollis, distribution head for Disney. As we got closer to release, we hit a critical mass of really unbelievable critical response. In this day and age where technology allows people to see a Rotten Tomatoes score or read something and pass it along to their friends, all of a sudden, there was quite a stir about this as a thing to see.
The twin hits of Inside Out and Jurassic World are giving Hollywoods summer a major boost. The weekend was up a staggering 64.6 percent over the same weekend last year, according to box-office data firm Rentrak. In 10 days, Jurassic World has already almost made $981.3 million  nearly $1 billion  and appears poised to be among the highest-grossing releases of all time.
Part of the success of Inside Out is owed to this massive infusion of moviegoers into the marketplace, says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Rentrak. If you look at last weekend, around the world, how many people were in theaters when Jurassic World made its debut?

He added, though, that Inside Out was also driven by Pixars unique storytelling knack: They can take almost any subject and turn it into something insightful, poignant and moving.
Inside Out and Jurassic World had the multiplexes largely to themselves over the weekend. The other wide release to open was Dope, a low-budget teen comedy set in Los Angeles Inglewood neighborhood. Written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa, starring newcomer Shameik Moore and boasting some high-profile producers (Forest Whitaker, Pharrell Williams), Dope was acquired by Open Road after a buzzy premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.
Though Open Road gave Dope an optimistic wide release of 2,002 theaters, it took in only $6 million.
In limited release, the Adam Scott and Jason Schwartzman comedy The Overnight  also a Sundance premiere  opened on three screens in New York and Los Angeles, pulling in $61,523, good enough for the most packed theaters (albeit in far tinier numbers) besides those playing Jurassic World and Inside Out.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. Jurassic World, $102 million ($160.5 million international).
2. Inside Out, $91 million ($41 million international).
3. Spy, $10.5 million.
4. San Andreas, $8.2 million.
5. Dope, $6 million.
6. Insidious Chapter 3, $4.1 million.
7. Pitch Perfect 2, $3.3 million.
8. Mad Max: Fury Road, $2.8 million.
9. Avengers: Age of Ultron, $2.7 million.
10. Tomorrowland, $2 million.

In this Monday photo, Ethan Fletcher, left, and partner Andrew Hickam pose for a photograph in Cincinnati. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule sometime this month on the legal status of same-sex marriage; Ohio is among states that still ban it. Gay couples, such as Fletcher and Hickam are gearing up for a quick run to the courthouse in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee _ the states involved in the cases that were argued in April before the justices. Dan Sewell  The Associated Press
CINCINNATI &gt;&gt; With a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage expected any day now, gay couples in states with bans are making wedding plans, courthouse officials are getting ready for different scenarios and steadfast foes are working on their strategies to keep up the opposition.
Marriage license bureaus are bracing for a rush of applicants if the court overturns bans. Meanwhile, theres been a series of planning sessions by groups that intend to explore religious objection responses to protect traditional marriage limited to heterosexuals.
Gay couples, such as Ethan Fletcher and Andrew Hickam of Cincinnati, are gearing up for a quick run to the courthouse in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee  the states involved in the cases that were argued in April before the justices. Theyre among 14 states that ban same-sex marriage, and if the high court rules in favor of gay marriage, it would apply nationally.
Fletcher, 31, a University of Cincinnati senior academic adviser, and Hickam, 30, a GE Aviation engineer, have arranged to take off work to get their license if the decision allows immediate same-sex marriages and will then plan a formal wedding. They became engaged nearly two years ago but decided against getting married in another state as long as there was the possibility they could do it at home.
Well, we live here and we pay taxes here and our families live here, said Fletcher, adding that they want his grandmother and Hickams mother to be able to attend. We didnt feel that it was reasonable for us to have to travel out of state for the freedom to marry.
In Hamilton County, where Cincinnati is located, the marriage license bureau said other courthouse staffers have been cross-trained and forms are available online to help speed the process. Court officials in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located, say theyre prepared to process triple the usual number of applications.
Probate Court Judge Jan Michael Long, of Pickaway County, near Columbus, said he and other probate judges met to discuss potential rulings and their impacts. There are a lot of procedural issues involving the need for gender-neutral wording and who gets legal notifications, he said, and it could be complicated depending on when the court ruling becomes effective and how its worded.
In Ingham County, Michigan, Clerk Barb Byrum said she might not wait for a new marriage license form from the state, and could simply white-out bride and groom on the application when she gets the legal green light.

She has collected dozens of email addresses from local same-sex couples to notify them of the Supreme Court decision when she knows it. She was among four clerks who issued licenses on a Saturday during a 24-hour period in 2014 when gay marriage in Michigan was legal between court orders.
The Tennessee Equality Project has been asking people to let them know in advance if they plan to get married on Day One. Its website includes instructions on obtaining licenses and finding officiants.
Bleu Copas, who lives just outside of Knoxville, said he wants to get married right away if the ban is lifted.
Were looking at wedding bands and what to wear, he said.
He and his fiance plan to marry at a small chapel on a farm belonging to the pastor of Nashvilles Covenant of the Cross Church, Greg Bullard, who intends to host at least 15 free weddings for same-sex couples on July 3 if the court makes it legal.
Some pastors, though, have signaled plans to resist a Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott recently signed a pastor protection law that allows clergy members to refuse officiating marriages that violates his religious beliefs.
Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting Wednesday in Columbus, issued a statement saying they would not recognize, host or perform same-sex marriages. Some county clerks in Kentucky and other states, including Nebraska, have expressed objections to the possibility of same-sex marriages, but Douglas County Clerk Thomas Cavanaugh, in Omaha, said Nebraskas largest counties already have changed marriage license applications to include gender-neutral wording and are ready to follow whatever the high court decides is the law.
North Carolina and Utah have passed laws allowing some court officials to refuse to perform gay marriage responsibilities.
Advocacy groups opposed to same-sex marriage have been discussing the legal defenses for religious objectors including business owners, employers and others besides clergy and court officials. Phil Burress, leader of the Citizens for Community Values that opposes gay marriage, predicts a ruling in favor of it will trigger more litigation and political action.
In Cincinnati, Hickam and Fletcher say if the court upholds bans, theyll go to a state that has recognized same-sex marriage through state, not federal action, to wed and then work for the political movement to gain recognition at the ballot box.
We would then just join forces with the rest of the gay community to bring about change through the democratic process, Hickam said. And things would be hopeful going that route.

In the most sobering study of extinction yet, a team of Bay Area scientists says that animal species are disappearing at an accelerating rate  portending the sixth mass extinction in the 4.5-billion-year history of the Earth.
We are entering a mass extinction equivalent to what happened to the dinosaurs unless conservation efforts are intensified, said UC Berkeley paleontologist Anthony D. Barnosky and an author of the report, which was published Friday.
If the trend continues, within two human lifetimes we are in danger of losing three of four species on Earth, he said.
The 21st century may mark the end of the line for animals confined to small and shrinking habitats, such as the Yangtze River dolphin or the African black rhinoceros. And, Barnosky said, their loss may be followed by icons such as elephants and tigers.
Californias state mammal, the grizzly bear, is among species at risk of extinction by the end of the century.
Also vulnerable are Californias state tree, the redwood; the state reptile, the desert tortoise; the state amphibian, the red-legged frog; and the state mammal, the grizzly bear, he said.
They are all moving to same status as the state fossil, the saber-tooth cat, Barnosky said.
Grizzlies were already extinct in California three decades before the Legislature named it the state animal in 1953. But more than 1,500 still survive in states such as Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Based on fossil records, the expected rate of extinction of vertebrate species, without human activity, is 2 per 100 years per 10,000 species. At this rate, nine species would have been expected to go extinct since 1900.
But the actual toll has been far greater, the team found. At least 198 vertebrate species have been lost since 1900: 35 mammals, 57 birds, 8 reptiles, 32 amphibians and 66 fishes. When the category is broadened to include species that are possibly extinct or extinct in the wild, the total rises to 477.
A continued trajectory is like going into the worlds most famous museum  say the Louvre in Paris  and slashing with a razor blade three out of every four paintings, Barnosky said. In one century, were destroying works of art that evolved over millions of years.

There is broad consensus among scientists that extinction rates have reached their highest levels since dinosaurs died out 66 million years ago.
More recently, Duke University biologist Stuart Pimm and others have asserted that this represents the beginning of Earths sixth mass extinction  echoing the five great extinctions over 4.5 billion years, each depleting 75 percent or more of all species.
But that conclusion has been criticized for using assumptions that overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis.
The new findings, published in the journal Science Advances by UC Berkeleys Barnosky and Stanford University biologists Paul Ehrlich and Gerardo Ceballos, support the dire forecasts, even though they used more modest rates of extinction.
The study shows without any significant doubt that we are now entering the sixth great mass extinction event, said Ehrlich, professor of population studies and a fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.
The work was divided between the Berkeley and Stanford labs. At Berkeley, Barnosky focused on fossil records of vertebrates, primarily mammals, which have the most reliable ancestral data. At Stanford, Erhlich and Ceballos, a Mexican conservationist, compared the rate of natural extinction before humans  2 per 10,000 species per 100 years  with current extinction rates, derived from data from the 2014 International Union of Conservation of Natures Red List.
Past mass extinctions were caused by massive volcanic eruptions and an asteroid falling from the sky.
Now, humans are delivering the coup de grce, according to the team. Were emitting carbon that drives climate change and ocean acidification. Were also cutting down forests, introducing invasive species and releasing poisons into fragile ecosystems.
If Earths population  now 7.13 billion  stops at 9 to 10 billion by the year 2050, other species stand a chance, Barnosky said.
But if it shoots up to 16 billion, he said, it is probably not going to work for keeping other species on Earth.
While its not too late to slow the loss of species, the window of opportunity is rapidly closing, they said. Already, the specter of extinction hangs over about 41 percent of all amphibian species and 26 percent of all mammals.
I dont want to be the generation that wiped out all these species, Barnosky said.

CHARLESTON, S.C. &gt;&gt; Members of a historic black church worshipped at their sanctuary Sunday for the first time since a gunman opened fire at a Bible study, killing nine people, and uniformed police officers stood among the congregation as a measure of added security.
The service started with a message of love, recovery and healing, which will no doubt reverberate throughout churches across the country.
We still believe that prayer changes things. Can I get a witness? the Rev. Norvel Goff said. The congregated responded with a rousing Yes.
But prayer not only changes things, it changes us, Goff said.
Sunday morning marked the first service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church since Dylann Roof, 21, sat among a Bible study group and opened fire after saying that he targeted them because they were black, authorities said. Among the nine killed was the church pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was also a state senator.
Events to show solidarity are planned throughout the city and beyond. At 10 a.m. EDT, church bells rang throughout downtown this Holy City  which garnered the nickname because of the numerous churches here.
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Mayor Joseph Riley attended the service at Emanuel.
Despite grim circumstances the congregation has been faced with, the welcoming spirit Roof exploited before the shooting is still alive, church members said.
I think just because of what people have gone through emotions are definitely heightened, not just in Charleston but with anyone going to church because it is such a sacred place, it is such a safe place, Shae Erdos, 29, said after a multiracial group of women sang Amazing Grace outside the church Saturday afternoon.
To have something like that completely shattered by such evil  I think it will be in the back of everyones heads, really, Erdos said. Erdos was planning on attending Sunday service in nearby Mount Pleasant.
The suburb is connected to Charleston by the Arthur Ravenel Bridge, where people are expected to join hands in solidarity Sunday evening. The bridges namesake is a former state lawmaker and a vocal Confederate flag supporter.
Roof had been photographed with the flag several times before the shooting.

Unity Church of Charleston the Rev. Ed Kosak said delivering his own Sunday morning sermon would be emotionally taxing but he felt empowered by the strength and grace Emanuel members have shown  a demeanor he said has set the tone for religious leaders everywhere.
Ive gone into Sunday sermons before like when Virginia Tech happened, and when the Sikh shootings happened Kosak said. The situation in Charleston may be harder to give a sermon on because it hits so close to home. But, Kosak said, I am more ready than ever to speak to this tragedy in ways I didnt think I could before.
For the family of Cynthia Hurd, Sundays service will be especially poignant. Hurd, a longtime librarian, would have been celebrating her 55th birthday and was planning a trip to Virginia with her siblings.
Sunday will not be a sad day for me; it will be a celebration for me. It will be a celebration for our family because our faith is being tested, Hurds younger brother Malcolm Graham said Friday. She was in the company of God trying to help somebody out. She was where she needed to be.
Felicia Breeland, an 81-year-old lifelong Emanuel member, said she sang in the choir with Susie Jackson, 87, who was also fatally shot Wednesday.
Its going to be sad. She sits right on the front row, too, Breeland said. She had a very soft soprano voice. It was beautiful.

        <MainBody>Iran parliament bans inspector access to military sites
By Ali Akbar Dareini, The Associated Press

# Comments
TEHRAN, Iran &gt;&gt; With some lawmakers chanting Death to the America, Irans parliament voted to ban access to military sites, documents and scientists as part of a future deal with world powers over its contested nuclear program.
The bill, if approved into law, could complicate the ongoing talks in Vienna between Iran and the six-nation group  the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany  as they face a self-imposed June 30 deadline. The talks are focused on reaching a final accord that curbs Irans nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.
Of 213 lawmakers present on Sunday, 199 voted in favor of the bill, which also demands the complete lifting of all sanctions against Iran as part of any final nuclear accord. The bill must be ratified by the Guardian Council, a constitutional watchdog, to become a law.
The terms stipulated in the bill allow for international inspections of Iranian nuclear sites, but forbid any inspections of military facilities.
Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani read the bill aloud in a session broadcast live on state radio. It states in part, The International Atomic Energy Agency, within the framework of the safeguard agreement, is allowed to carry out conventional inspections of nuclear sites.
However it concludes that access to military, security and sensitive non-nuclear sites, as well as documents and scientists, is forbidden.
Irans nuclear negotiators say they have already agreed to grant United Nations inspectors managed access to military sites under strict control and specific circumstances. That right includes allowing inspectors to take environmental samples in the vicinity of military sites.
But Iranian officials, including supreme authority Ayatollah Ali Khameni, have strongly rejected the idea of Iranian scientists being interviewed, calling that a violation of the countrys dignity and sovereignty.

TURIN, Italy &gt;&gt; Pope Francis paused in silent prayer before the Shroud of Turin Sunday, becoming the latest of hundreds of thousands of people who have come this year to Turins cathedral to view the burial linen some believe covered the body of Jesus after crucifixion.
Francis sat for several minutes before the shroud, contained in a protective glass case. He lowered his head at times in apparent reflection and occasionally gazed up at the 4.3-meter (14-foot) long cloth. Then he took a few steps, placed his hand on the case, and walked away without comment.
Later, after celebrating Mass of the faithful in a packed Turin square, Francis gave his impression of the cloth as he spoke of the love Jesus had for humanity when being crucified.
Icon of this love is the Shroud, which, even this time, has attracted so many people here to Turin, Francis said. The Shroud draws (people) to the tormented face and body of Jesus and, at the same time, directs (people) toward the face of every suffering and unjustly persecuted person.
The shrouds display began April 19 and runs through June 24.
Other pontiffs have made the journey to the northern city during previous displays of the shroud. When John Paul II saw the shroud in 1998, he said the mystery surrounding the cloth forces questions about faith and science and whether it really was Jesus burial linen. He urged continuous study. Benedict XVI described the cloth as an icon written with the blood of a crucified man.
Skeptics say the cloth bearing the image of a crucified man is a medieval forgery.
Turin, the heartland of Italys auto industry, is considered Italys blue-collar labor capital, and Francis used his two-day visit to the city to denounce exploitation of workers, singling out women, young people and immigrants as frequent victims.
Immigration increases competition, but migrants shouldnt be blamed because they themselves are victims of injustice, of this throw-away economy and of wars, Francis said in a speech in a square outside the cathedral.
He then made an apparent reference to European countries as well as some northern Italian regions which are refusing or are reluctant to take some of the tens of thousands of migrants who have landed at southern Italian ports after being rescued in the Mediterranean from overcrowded, unseaworthy smugglers boats.

It makes one cry to see the spectacle of these days in which human beings are treated as commercial goods, Francis said.
Turin is the Piedmont regions capital, and during Mass, the Argentine-born Francis quoted from a poem in local dialect that praises the qualities of those who emigrated from Piedmont  like some of his own ancestors  to seek work abroad.
Our ancestors knew well what it meant to be rock-solid, Francis said. Quoting from the poem, the pope said these emigrants were proper and sincere, they appear to be what they are.
In an unscheduled stop, Francis ducked into the church in Turin where his paternal grandparents were married in 1907, and where, in 1908, his father Mario was baptized. The ANSA news agency quoted the Rev. Giustizio Zoppi as saying Francis left a vase of yellow roses on the altar and then asked for a chair so he could sit in silence for a few minutes.
We didnt ask him to come, he wanted to, Zoppi said.
On Monday, before he heads back to Rome, Francis will lunch in Turin with some of his relatives who live in Piedmont.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip &gt;&gt; Nearly a year after a devastating war, Israel and Gazas Hamas rulers appear to have formed an unspoken alliance in a common battle against the shared threat of jihadis aligned with the Islamic State group.
While Israel and Hamas remain arch-enemies, both have an interest in preserving an uneasy calm that has prevailed since the fighting ended in a cease-fire last August  a stalemate that is largely the result of a lack of options on either side.
More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in last years fighting, according to Palestinian officials, and Hamas suffered heavy losses. It is isolated internationally, Gazas economy is in tatters and reconstruction efforts have moved slowly. A renewal of hostilities would be devastating for Gazas 1.8 million people.
On the Israeli side, 73 people, including 67 soldiers, were killed in last years fighting, and the summer-long war disrupted the lives of millions of people as they coped with repeated rocket attacks and air-raid sirens. But Hamas, which seized power in Gaza eight years ago, has survived three wars, and the cost of toppling the group would be extremely high, so Israel appears content to contain Hamas and keep things quiet.
Hamas officials say that efforts are underway, through Qatari mediators, to work out a long-term cease-fire. The deal would call for Israel to ease a stifling blockade on Gaza in exchange for Hamas pledges to disarm, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were discussing sensitive negotiations. It is unclear whether any progress has been made in the cease-fire efforts, which include Hamas demands to reopen sea and airports in Gaza. Israeli officials declined comment.
In the short run, the biggest threat to the quiet is a small but growing number of extremists in Gaza inspired by the Islamic State group, who have fired rockets across the heavily guarded frontier in order to undermine Hamas. The militants believe Hamas is soft on Israel and has failed to establish an Islamic state.
That has transformed Israel and Hamas  bitter enemies for nearly three decades  into unspoken allies against a shared threat.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the southern town of Khan Younis, where Hamas militants have been supervising work crews that are opening a road along Gazas eastern fence with Israel. The patrols have helped preserve quiet in a volatile area used in the past by rocket-launching squads.
Hamas officials say that maintaining the cease-fire is a national interest. A young element breaking that understanding is our responsibility and the responsibility of all of us and all the factions to stop him, said Hamas official Salah Bardawil. Nobody should break the national understanding in a meaningless way.
The road work has been taking place as close as 150 meters (175 yards) from the border, an area that Israel in the past has made off-limits. In an unusual scene earlier this month, four Israeli military bulldozers entered a buffer zone to remove brush along the fence. Camouflaged Hamas militants approached the area but did not confront them.

For sure, there are implicit, indirect understandings by both sides not to attack each other, said Ibrahim al-Madhoun, a Gaza analyst who is close to Hamas. The road is a message that there is a flexible political mind in Gaza (Hamas) that can take reasonable steps in the light of any regional or international changes.
Such a scene would have been unthinkable a year ago, when Israel and Hamas battled for 50 days in their third war since the Islamic militant group  which is sworn to Israels destruction  seized power in Gaza in 2007.
Hamas has honored the cease-fire that ended the war. But a number of small jihadi groups have grown increasingly active in Gaza and appear set on disrupting the calm. They dream of joining Gaza to the IS groups self-styled caliphate in Syria and Iraq, but because they are too weak to challenge Hamas directly, they have instead sought to undermine it by firing rockets at Israel.
Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gazas Al-Azhar University, said the rocket fire is aimed at embarrassing Hamas and provoking Israeli military action against the ruling militant group. Any confrontation will ease the security pressure Hamas put on the Salafists, he said, referring to ultraconservative Islamic groups.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he holds Hamas responsible for all attacks coming out of Gaza and threatened to use Israels full strength to respond. But so far, Israeli reprisals against the recent rocket fire have been limited to empty training sites, and there have been no casualties on either side.
The Israeli military declined to comment on the matter. But defense officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said they are aware of Hamas efforts to preserve the calm.
In addition to the border patrols, Hamas has arrested dozens of Salafi activists in recent months and set up checkpoints in sensitive areas to look for suspects.
Hamas officials say little about the road patrols. Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader, said the action has helped improve security by preventing Palestinians from infiltrating into Israel and is helping protect the properties of people from Israel. He also said the road would help local farmers gain access to lands that could not easily be reached following the war.
Alon Ben-David, the senior military correspondent for Israels Channel 10 TV, said Hamas was sending a conciliatory message to Israel.
What they are broadcasting with those patrols is: We are preventing friction with you (Israel), he said. We are here to prevent fire on Israel.
But he said the Hamas patrols are also collecting intelligence on Israeli military positions and soldiers. So this could all in a second turn upside down and become a military offensive maneuver. But now their objective is the opposite, he said.

Protesters close their eyes in silent prayer as they stand on the South Carolina Statehouse steps during a rally to take down the Confederate flag, Saturday in Columbia, S.C. Rep. Doug Brannon, R-Landrum, said its past time for the Confederate flag to be removed from South Carolinas Statehouse grounds after nine people were killed at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church shooting. Rainier Ehrhardt  The Associated Press
WASHINGTON &gt;&gt; Republican Mike Huckabee says the Confederate flag debate in South Carolina is something for that states residents to take on if they so choose, but he doesnt believe presidential candidates need to take a stand on the topic.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012, has called for the immediate removal of the Confederate battle flag from outside the South Carolina Statehouse.
The former Arkansas governor says he believes voters want presidential candidates focused on the economy and keeping Americans safe. They dont want the candidates weighing in on every little issue in all 50 states however important that issue is to a particular state.
Huckabees comments on NBCs Meet the Press come in the wake of the shooting of nine black people at a Charleston church.

New Orleans police arrest suspect in killing of officer
Investigators look over a New Orleans Police department vehicle in which one officer was shot and killed while transporting a prisoner in New Orleans, Saturday. The New Orleans Police Department said Officer Daryle Holloway was shot while transporting Travis Boys, who managed to get his handcuffed hands from behind his back to the front, grab a firearm and shoot the officer. A manhunt was underway for the 33-year-old Boys, according to Police Chief Michael Harrison. Gerald Herbert  The Associated Press

NEW ORLEANS &gt;&gt; Police in New Orleans say they have arrested a suspect they believe managed to slip into the front seat of a police vehicle while handcuffed and shoot the police officer who was transporting him to jail.
The New Orleans Police Department, in brief announcements on social media, announced the arrest Sunday morning of 33-year-old Travis Boys. The arrest follows a 24-hour manhunt for Boys, who escaped from the vehicle after allegedly shooting and killing Officer Daryle Holloway.
Holloway, 45, had been a member of the New Orleans Police Department since 1992. He was the father of three children.
Boys was under arrest on an aggravated assault charge at the time of the shooting. It was unclear how he allegedly obtained a weapon, worked his handcuffed wrists from behind his back and got through a barrier that separated him from the front seat.
Police Superintendent Michael Harrison and Mayor Mitch Landrieu were to hold a press conference later Sunday to provide further details on the investigation into the killing.
Harrison said he met with two of Holloways children and Holloways former wife at the hospital after he died. As a new chief, it was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in my life, said Harrison, who became chief last year.
He said he had known Holloway for 23 years and described him as a great police officer.
Landrieu on Saturday decried the killing as the lowest of the low and called on the public to help police with information on Boys whereabouts.
Killing an officer in the line of duty is an attack on our community that will not stand, Landrieu said in a statement. The heart and soul of New Orleans is heavy today as our community mourns one of our citys finest.
The last New Orleans Police Department officer killed in the line of duty was Officer Rodney Thomas on July 7, 2013, according to Gamble. More recently, a Housing Authority police officer, James Bennett Jr., 45, was found shot to death in his patrol car.

LONDON &gt;&gt; Thousands of revelers, new-agers and self-styled Druids descended on the ancient stone circle at Stonehenge on Sunday, catching a brief glimpse of the sun as they marked the summer solstice  the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.
About 23,000 sun-watchers gathered on the Salisbury Plain about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southwest of London, police said. But with the sun visible only briefly, the party was markedly shorter than in past years. Authorities reported nine arrests for drug offenses  fewer than in the past.
Visitors kissed the stones, dancers swirled on the grass and drummers pounded as part of the free-form celebrations. A small group of yoga enthusiasts held a short class and couples renewed their commitments to one another.
Stonehenge is an icon of Britain, and one of its most popular attractions. It was built in three phases between 3,000 B.C. and 1,600 B.C. and its purpose remains under study.

NEW YORK &gt;&gt; In an open letter to Apple, Taylor Swift has criticized the companys new streaming music service for failing to pay artists for a free three-month trial.
Writing on her Tumblr page Sunday in a posting titled To Apple, Love Taylor, Swift said she would withhold her 2014 album 1989 from Apple Music, which launches June 30. The pop star called Apples plan not to compensate artists, writers or producers during the three-month trial shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.
Swift said she was speaking up for the music community at large, not for her own personal gain. Three months, she said, is a long time to go unpaid. Last November, Swift also pulled 1989 off Spotify.
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

This undated photo provided by the City of New Orleans shows Officer Daryle Holloway.  The New Orleans Police Department said Holloway was shot while transporting a suspect, Travis Boys, who managed to get his handcuffed hands from behind his back to the front, grab a firearm and shoot the officer. A manhunt was underway for the 33-year-old Boys, according to Police Chief Michael Harrison. City of New Orleans via AP
NEW ORLEANS &gt;&gt; A handcuffed prisoner in a moving police cruiser managed to grab a gun, fatally shoot the officer at the wheel and escape from the vehicle, which careened into a utility pole at a busy intersection, police said Saturday.
Officer Daryle Holloway, 45, died at a hospital, police chief Michael Harrison said. Meanwhile, an intense manhunt was on for Travis Boys, 33, the suspect who had been arrested on an aggravated assault charge and was being taken to jail when he escaped.
The New Orleans Crimestoppers organization announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to Boys arrest.
Rifle-toting police in bullet-proof vests, some with trained canines, searched whole blocks of one neighborhood about a mile from the citys French Quarter Sunday afternoon. Residents clustered on street corners to watch as officers checked backyards and squinted under modest homes elevated on flood-protection piers.
He will be caught and he will be brought to justice for the murder of Officer Holloway and for this assault on our entire community, Harrison said in a police department statement.
The shooting happened Saturday morning as Boys was handcuffed in the back seat of the vehicle. Boys managed to get his hands from behind his back to the front and obtain a weapon as well, Harrison told reporters at the scene in a video interview posted on the departments Facebook page.
Boys got to the front seat through an opening in the cage that separates front and back seats and shot Holloway, Harrison said.
Officer Holloway put up a fight to try to get the subject to not exit the vehicle but succumbed to his injuries, Harrison said.
Department spokesman Tyler Gamble said police were trying to determine what weapon Boys used and how he obtained it, but do not believe Boys used the officers gun.
John Polk, who lives around the corner from where the police SUV came to rest, said he was just awakening when he heard a loud noise and his power went out. The noise, he figured, was an electrical transformer blowing.
I look out the door  Id heard the boom  I see the fire truck here on the corner, he said. It was only later 45 minutes later, after police had swarmed into the area that he learned what happened.
A helicopter circled overhead as marked and unmarked units from state police and other law enforcement agencies cruised the side streets. Utility workers worked to replace the downed power pole.
State police, St. Tammany Parish deputies, Housing Authority of New Orleans police and the U.S. Marshals Service were among those searching for Boys.

Police seeking Boys halted traffic Saturday into an area of several city blocks of the St. Roch neighborhood not far from where the shooting occurred. Officers kept people from entering the area, and others from leaving.
Vincent Alexander, a prep cook at Margaritaville restaurant in the French Quarter, said he was walking home from work when police detoured him a short distance from his house. I just called my roommate. Theyre not letting him get out the house.
Holloway had been a member of the New Orleans Police Department since 1992. He was the father of three children.
Harrison said Holloway was not the arresting officer but was transporting Boys to a jail when the shooting occurred.
Harrison said he met with two of those children and Holloways former wife at the hospital after he died. As a new chief, it was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in my life, said Harrison, who became chief last year.
He said he had known Holloway for 23 years and described him as a great police officer.

The last New Orleans Police Department officer killed in the line of duty was Officer Rodney Thomas on July 7, 2013, according to Gamble. More recently, a Housing Authority police officer, James Bennett Jr., 45, was found shot to death in his patrol car.

Charleston, S.C., shooting suspect Dylann Storm Roof is escorted from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, N.C., Thursday, June 18, 2015. Roof is a suspect in the shooting of several people Wednesday night at the historic The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The current brick Gothic revival edifice, completed in 1891 to replace an earlier building heavily damaged in an earthquake, was a mandatory stop for the likes of Booker T. Washington and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Still, Emanuel was not just a church for the black community.(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)
CHARLESTON, S.C. &gt;&gt; Parishioners were let into the bullet-scarred Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church on Saturday, getting a firsthand glimpse of the room where nine people from their congregation were slain.
Around that same time, two federal law enforcement officials said the FBI was investigating a manifesto purportedly written by the suspected gunman, 21-year-old Dylan Roof.
The website linked to Roof contained photos of him holding a burning American flag and standing on one. In other images, he was holding a Confederate flag, considered a divisive symbol by civil rights leaders and others.
The hate-filled 2,500-word essay talks about white supremacy and the author says the event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case.
Martin was an unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot in Florida in 2012 by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Martin was walking home, got into a confrontation with Zimmerman and was shot.
Prosecutors accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin, but he was acquitted of murder. The manifesto said it was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right and that the case led him to search black on White crime on the Internet.
I have never been the same since that day, it said.
Its unclear if Roof wrote it but the rants are in line with what he has told friends and what he said before allegedly opening fire inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church Wednesday night.
Cleaning crews worked at the church Saturday and church members announced they will hold a Sunday service. Harold Washington, 75, was with the small group that saw the lower-level room where the victims were shot.
They did a good job cleaning it up, there were a few bullet holes around but what they did, they cut them out so you dont see the actual holes, he said.
He said he expected an emotional service Sunday, and a large turnout.
Were gonna have people come by that weve never seen before and will probably never see again, and thats OK, he said. Its a church of the Lord  you dont turn nobody down.
The church had that same welcoming nature when Roof walked into their Bible study, Felecia Sanders, who survived the shooting, said at Roofs bail hearing Friday. She lost her son Tywanza in the attack.
Two federal law enforcement officials close to the investigation said the FBI is aware of the website linked to Roof and is reviewing it. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the case.

Internet registry records show that the website was created on Feb. 9 via a Russian registry service with the owners personal details hidden. A man who answered the phone at the Moscow-based company would not say who the sites owner was.
Roof is being held in jail, facing nine counts of murder and a weapons charge.
A police affidavit released Friday accused Roof of shooting all nine multiple times, and making a racially inflammatory statement as he stood over an unidentified survivor.
Roof had complained while getting drunk on vodka recently that blacks were taking over the world and that someone needed to do something about it for the white race, according to Joey Meek, who tipped off the FBI when he saw his friend on surveillance images.
In Charleston, the grief was so palpable three days after the shooting that a family re-routed its trip home from the beach and a bride-to-be interrupted her wedding day to pay their respects.
Its been a weird feeling, trying to have a celebration this weekend. But the whole city has been so supportive and such a show of grace, said Kathryn Cole, 27, who lives two blocks away from the church and is set to say her nuptials Saturday night. Life is carrying on. We arent letting this change our everyday lives.
Derrick Jones was vacationing on Hilton Head Island when he decided to drive an hour out of his way home to Greenville. He stopped at the church with his wife and three boys.
Theyve been asking questions all day since this has happened, Jones said. And I dont really have all the answers. I try to explain it the best way I can.
Greenville residents Stacey and Kenneth Penland arrived in Charleston for vacation Friday. During their first full day in the city, they came to the church with their children, 6-year-old Luke and 3-year-old Logan.
Weve been at the beach, and then the market, and of course we stopped by here, said Kenneth Penland.

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan &gt;&gt; An Afghan family returning to their home after fleeing a possible military operation struck a roadside bomb Saturday in the countrys south, killing at least 12 of them and wounding eight, authorities said.
The blast struck the familys van in Helmand provinces Marjah district, largely a Taliban stronghold. At least 12 died in the blast, though the death toll could rise, said Nabil Jan Mullahkhail, the provincial police chief.
The family fled the district in recent days after hearing a government offensive could take place there, relative Mohammad Salih said. Salih said the death toll likely was higher, as he believed as many as 21 of his relatives had been killed in the blast.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. The Taliban routinely plant roadside bombs to target Afghan security forces, though the bombs often explode as civilian vehicles pass by, killing them instead.
In February, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan documented 10,548 civilian casualties in 2014, the highest number in a single year since 2009. They include 3,699 civilian deaths, up 25 percent from 2013.
The U.N. said at the time that the Taliban and other insurgents were responsible for 72 percent of all civilian casualties, with government forces and foreign troops responsible for just 14 percent. The U.N. report attributed the rise in casualties to intensified ground fighting, in which weapons like mortars, rockets and grenades are used in populated areas, sometimes indiscriminately.
U.S. and NATO troops pulled back from volatile areas last year, handing security responsibility over to Afghan forces and officially concluding their combat mission at the end of the year. In the time since, local Afghan security forces have been increasingly targeted in insurgent attacks.
