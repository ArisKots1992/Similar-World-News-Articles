VACAVILLE &gt;&gt; California inmates are dying of drug overdoses at nearly triple the national rate and its unclear whether the tough steps state officials took this year to stop illicit drugs from getting into prisons are having any effect, though they are prompting criticism from civil rights advocates.
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is spending $8 million this year on drug-detecting scanners and a new breed of drug-sniffing dogs while also employing strip searches on visitors suspected of carrying drugs.
Corrections officials believe the stepped-up efforts are discouraging smuggling, but the data thats available so far doesnt support that  more than 6,000 scans have been done on visitors and employees at 11 prisons since December without finding anyone with drugs.
The state doesnt track if anyone has been arrested because of the dog searches and waited until mid-May to begin tracking the number of arrests made using any of the new procedures.
Meantime, criticism is mounting about false-positive results by the scanners and dogs that can lead to strip searches. Concerned lawmakers who oversee state prisons included language in the California budget plan passed this week that would end the searches and require an evaluation of the departments other efforts.
Its a humiliating process, can be easily used to humiliate and demean people, and was only for visitors, often women, Democratic Sen. Loni Hancock, said of the strip searches. There are many concerns about the dogs, which have historically been emblematic of intimidation of many communities of color, most notably during the civil rights movement.
But no one wants to see drug deaths, and she said the evaluation will show which of the new programs are effective.
More than 150 California inmates have died of drug overdoses since 2006, with a high of 24 in 2013. Moreover, the sharing of intravenous needles often spreads hepatitis C infections, which killed 69 inmates in 2013 alone.
Corrections Secretary Jeffrey Beard recently told lawmakers that drugs are rampant in the prisons.
What we are trying to do is send a message to people to not try to smuggle drugs in to the institution, he said in an interview. If we dont do this, were going to have people keep dying, were going to have continued violence in the prisons.
Beard is modeling Californias new procedures on those used successfully in the Pennsylvania corrections department he led for a decade. While California has a long-term annual rate of eight drug- or alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 inmates, Pennsylvanias is one.

Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio and Texas also each averaged one death a year per 100,000 inmates from 2001-2012, according to the most recent national figures. Maryland had the nations worst rate, at 17 deaths per 100,000 inmates.
Beard said Californias program would have more rapid success if lawmakers had given him more money, and he may seek funds to expand the program as early as this fall.
He believes the ion scanners  similar to those used to screen airport travelers  are deterring smugglers. The lack of results may be because only about 5 percent of visitors and employees are being scanned, he said, though the eventual goal is 30 percent. By contrast, Pennsylvania scanned 68 percent of visitors last year and at least 20 percent of employees.
Pennsylvania officials could not say how much contraband was found by using the scanners.
Records show the German shepherd and similar looking dogs long used in California prisons have been effective at rooting out hidden drugs. But to search visitors, employees and inmates the department is turning to less aggressive dogs including Labrador retrievers  fluffy, friendly dogs, Northern California canine program coordinator Sgt. Brian Pyle said.
The decision to use dogs to search humans, instead of unoccupied spaces as was previously the policy, prompted the resignation last fall of Wayne Conrad, the departments statewide canine program coordinator. He criticized the expense of sending California dog handlers to Pennsylvania for training, the use of breeds that he said are less reliable, and what he said was a supervisors effort to stifle concerns about the program because it was championed by Beard.
The dogs are going to start alerting on people whose kids are smoking dope or something, and that false positive could prompt an unnecessary strip search, Conrad said. The next thing thats going to come is the lawsuits.
Beard said he is seeking alternatives to strip searches, and downplayed the possibility that false-positive alerts unfairly implicate innocent visitors and employees. But thats what happened to Tania Gamboa of Riverside when she went to see her brother at Kern Valley State Prison.
She initially laughed when the ion machine tested positive for exposure to heroin, saying she doesnt even drink alcohol. But she was crying after she was required to strip naked in front of two female correctional officers and squat to demonstrate that she was not concealing drugs.
It doesnt make sense for me, knowing that I dont do all that and I got detected for it, she said.
Mohamed Shehk, an Oakland-based spokesman for Critical Resistance, which advocates for better conditions for inmates, said the policies are turning visitors into suspects.
The statistics  $8 million, 6,000 scans and nothing to show for it  show that these are intended to intimidate and criminalize people who are going to see their loved ones inside, he said.

Jurassic World holds box office, but Inside Out shows bite

NEW YORK &gt;&gt; In a box-office bout of Tyrannosaurus-sized proportions, Jurassic World kept the No. 1 spot with one of the biggest second weeks ever, while Pixars Inside Out nearly matched it with a $91 million debut well above expectations.
Universals Jurassic World took in $102 million in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday, making it only the second release to break $100 million in its second week. The enormous holdover for Jurassic World, which last week set an opening weekend record with $208.8 million, has been bested by only 2012s The Avengers, which made $103.1 million in second week.
The unexpected sensation of the Colin Trevorrow-directed, Steven Spielberg-produced fourth entry in the franchise had turned Disneys $175 million 3-D Inside Out into an underdog expected to merely nip at the heels of Jurassic World. But the emotional Inside Out, about the voices in the head of an 11-year-old girl, blew past its own forecasts to set records, too.
Inside Out was the first Pixar release not to open in first place, following an unparalleled two-decade streak of 14 straight no. 1s. But its the largest opening for a wholly original movie (one not based on source material or a sequel), unseating Avatar in that distinction. Directed by Pete Docter (Up) and co-directed by Ronaldo del Carmen, Inside Out had been expected to open in the range of previous Pixar non-sequels like Wall-E ($63.8 million opening) and Brave ($66.3 million).
But Inside Out was propelled by gushing reviews from critics, a flashy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival and an appetite for a movie from Pixar. The animation studio hadnt had a release in two years after delaying The Good Dinosaur last year.
We came into the weekend thinking wed do something in the 60s, said David Hollis, distribution head for Disney. As we got closer to release, we hit a critical mass of really unbelievable critical response. In this day and age where technology allows people to see a Rotten Tomatoes score or read something and pass it along to their friends, all of a sudden, there was quite a stir about this as a thing to see.
The twin hits of Inside Out and Jurassic World are giving Hollywoods summer a major boost. The weekend was up a staggering 64.6 percent over the same weekend last year, according to box-office data firm Rentrak. In 10 days, Jurassic World has already almost made $981.3 million  nearly $1 billion  and appears poised to be among the highest-grossing releases of all time.
Part of the success of Inside Out is owed to this massive infusion of moviegoers into the marketplace, says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Rentrak. If you look at last weekend, around the world, how many people were in theaters when Jurassic World made its debut?

He added, though, that Inside Out was also driven by Pixars unique storytelling knack: They can take almost any subject and turn it into something insightful, poignant and moving.
Inside Out and Jurassic World had the multiplexes largely to themselves over the weekend. The other wide release to open was Dope, a low-budget teen comedy set in Los Angeles Inglewood neighborhood. Written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa, starring newcomer Shameik Moore and boasting some high-profile producers (Forest Whitaker, Pharrell Williams), Dope was acquired by Open Road after a buzzy premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.
Though Open Road gave Dope an optimistic wide release of 2,002 theaters, it took in only $6 million.
In limited release, the Adam Scott and Jason Schwartzman comedy The Overnight  also a Sundance premiere  opened on three screens in New York and Los Angeles, pulling in $61,523, good enough for the most packed theaters (albeit in far tinier numbers) besides those playing Jurassic World and Inside Out.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. Jurassic World, $102 million ($160.5 million international).
2. Inside Out, $91 million ($41 million international).
3. Spy, $10.5 million.
4. San Andreas, $8.2 million.
5. Dope, $6 million.
6. Insidious Chapter 3, $4.1 million.
7. Pitch Perfect 2, $3.3 million.
8. Mad Max: Fury Road, $2.8 million.
9. Avengers: Age of Ultron, $2.7 million.
10. Tomorrowland, $2 million.

In this Monday photo, Ethan Fletcher, left, and partner Andrew Hickam pose for a photograph in Cincinnati. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule sometime this month on the legal status of same-sex marriage; Ohio is among states that still ban it. Gay couples, such as Fletcher and Hickam are gearing up for a quick run to the courthouse in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee _ the states involved in the cases that were argued in April before the justices. Dan Sewell  The Associated Press
CINCINNATI &gt;&gt; With a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage expected any day now, gay couples in states with bans are making wedding plans, courthouse officials are getting ready for different scenarios and steadfast foes are working on their strategies to keep up the opposition.
Marriage license bureaus are bracing for a rush of applicants if the court overturns bans. Meanwhile, theres been a series of planning sessions by groups that intend to explore religious objection responses to protect traditional marriage limited to heterosexuals.
Gay couples, such as Ethan Fletcher and Andrew Hickam of Cincinnati, are gearing up for a quick run to the courthouse in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee  the states involved in the cases that were argued in April before the justices. Theyre among 14 states that ban same-sex marriage, and if the high court rules in favor of gay marriage, it would apply nationally.
Fletcher, 31, a University of Cincinnati senior academic adviser, and Hickam, 30, a GE Aviation engineer, have arranged to take off work to get their license if the decision allows immediate same-sex marriages and will then plan a formal wedding. They became engaged nearly two years ago but decided against getting married in another state as long as there was the possibility they could do it at home.
Well, we live here and we pay taxes here and our families live here, said Fletcher, adding that they want his grandmother and Hickams mother to be able to attend. We didnt feel that it was reasonable for us to have to travel out of state for the freedom to marry.
In Hamilton County, where Cincinnati is located, the marriage license bureau said other courthouse staffers have been cross-trained and forms are available online to help speed the process. Court officials in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located, say theyre prepared to process triple the usual number of applications.
Probate Court Judge Jan Michael Long, of Pickaway County, near Columbus, said he and other probate judges met to discuss potential rulings and their impacts. There are a lot of procedural issues involving the need for gender-neutral wording and who gets legal notifications, he said, and it could be complicated depending on when the court ruling becomes effective and how its worded.
In Ingham County, Michigan, Clerk Barb Byrum said she might not wait for a new marriage license form from the state, and could simply white-out bride and groom on the application when she gets the legal green light.

She has collected dozens of email addresses from local same-sex couples to notify them of the Supreme Court decision when she knows it. She was among four clerks who issued licenses on a Saturday during a 24-hour period in 2014 when gay marriage in Michigan was legal between court orders.
The Tennessee Equality Project has been asking people to let them know in advance if they plan to get married on Day One. Its website includes instructions on obtaining licenses and finding officiants.
Bleu Copas, who lives just outside of Knoxville, said he wants to get married right away if the ban is lifted.
Were looking at wedding bands and what to wear, he said.
He and his fiance plan to marry at a small chapel on a farm belonging to the pastor of Nashvilles Covenant of the Cross Church, Greg Bullard, who intends to host at least 15 free weddings for same-sex couples on July 3 if the court makes it legal.
Some pastors, though, have signaled plans to resist a Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott recently signed a pastor protection law that allows clergy members to refuse officiating marriages that violates his religious beliefs.
Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting Wednesday in Columbus, issued a statement saying they would not recognize, host or perform same-sex marriages. Some county clerks in Kentucky and other states, including Nebraska, have expressed objections to the possibility of same-sex marriages, but Douglas County Clerk Thomas Cavanaugh, in Omaha, said Nebraskas largest counties already have changed marriage license applications to include gender-neutral wording and are ready to follow whatever the high court decides is the law.
North Carolina and Utah have passed laws allowing some court officials to refuse to perform gay marriage responsibilities.
Advocacy groups opposed to same-sex marriage have been discussing the legal defenses for religious objectors including business owners, employers and others besides clergy and court officials. Phil Burress, leader of the Citizens for Community Values that opposes gay marriage, predicts a ruling in favor of it will trigger more litigation and political action.
In Cincinnati, Hickam and Fletcher say if the court upholds bans, theyll go to a state that has recognized same-sex marriage through state, not federal action, to wed and then work for the political movement to gain recognition at the ballot box.
We would then just join forces with the rest of the gay community to bring about change through the democratic process, Hickam said. And things would be hopeful going that route.

In the most sobering study of extinction yet, a team of Bay Area scientists says that animal species are disappearing at an accelerating rate  portending the sixth mass extinction in the 4.5-billion-year history of the Earth.
We are entering a mass extinction equivalent to what happened to the dinosaurs unless conservation efforts are intensified, said UC Berkeley paleontologist Anthony D. Barnosky and an author of the report, which was published Friday.
If the trend continues, within two human lifetimes we are in danger of losing three of four species on Earth, he said.
The 21st century may mark the end of the line for animals confined to small and shrinking habitats, such as the Yangtze River dolphin or the African black rhinoceros. And, Barnosky said, their loss may be followed by icons such as elephants and tigers.
Californias state mammal, the grizzly bear, is among species at risk of extinction by the end of the century.
Also vulnerable are Californias state tree, the redwood; the state reptile, the desert tortoise; the state amphibian, the red-legged frog; and the state mammal, the grizzly bear, he said.
They are all moving to same status as the state fossil, the saber-tooth cat, Barnosky said.
Grizzlies were already extinct in California three decades before the Legislature named it the state animal in 1953. But more than 1,500 still survive in states such as Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Based on fossil records, the expected rate of extinction of vertebrate species, without human activity, is 2 per 100 years per 10,000 species. At this rate, nine species would have been expected to go extinct since 1900.
But the actual toll has been far greater, the team found. At least 198 vertebrate species have been lost since 1900: 35 mammals, 57 birds, 8 reptiles, 32 amphibians and 66 fishes. When the category is broadened to include species that are possibly extinct or extinct in the wild, the total rises to 477.
A continued trajectory is like going into the worlds most famous museum  say the Louvre in Paris  and slashing with a razor blade three out of every four paintings, Barnosky said. In one century, were destroying works of art that evolved over millions of years.

Mexico bans wild animals in circuses  but theres no place for them to go

Lions and tigers and bears no more.
A new law in Mexico banning the use of tigers, elephants, zebras, lions and other exotic animals in circuses comes into effect next week.
The law, which was approved in March 2015, is aimed at preventing animal cruelty, and those who violate it will be fined nearly $225,000.
Some 3,000 to 3,500 circus animals will be freed from performing under the big top thanks to the law, according to the International Business Times .
The question remains, however, what will happen to all of these animals?
For many circus owners, the animals will be too expensive to keep. One Mexican animal tamer estimated that it costs around 3,000 pesos (almost $200) a day to feed circus tigers. When you add other costs like veterinary bills on top of that, keeping wild animals is a pricey expense.
An official from the Mexican environmental protection agency said the government is evaluating different facilities that could take in the animals. Privately owned zoos have also offered to house them.
Some circus owners claim that the new law, designed to protect circus animals, is actually putting the animals in worse danger.
A lot of owners dont want to give the government the animals that are their livelihoods, President of the National Association of Circus Owners Armando Cedeo told the Guardian . Some are looking to sell them, and you dont always know who is buying. Others are so desperate they are looking to put them to sleep.
The Associated Press reported that Mexican authorities had found six tigers, seven baboons, four camels and three dromedaries abandoned in cages last week. Theyd been left without food or water.
Circuses across Mexico are also worried about revenue. Without animal attractions to draw spectators, attendance could drop, and some smaller circus operations have been forced to shut down already.
Workers, naturally, are concerned about their jobs. Over 1,000 circus employees protested against the law in Mexico City a year ago, saying that the law will leave thousands unemployed.
Mexico is the 29th country to pass a nationwide ban on circus animals, according to Stop Circus Suffering , a campaign of the NGO Animal Defenders International. Other countries with nationwide bans include Austria, Croatia, Greece, Bolivia and Costa Rica.

The US has full or partial bans on circus animals in only 22 states .
Perhaps cock fighting and bull fighting will be Mexicos next legal targets.

ATHENS, Greece &gt;&gt; Greece and its membership in Europes joint currency faced an uncertain future Monday, with the country under pressure to restart bailout talks with creditors as soon as possible after Greeks resoundingly rejected the notion of more austerity in exchange for aid.
With Greek banks running out of cash and facing the danger of collapse within days without new aid, the government in Athens is racing against the clock.
In an effort to facilitate negotiations on a new aid program, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who had clashed with European officials in the bailout talks, announced his resignation Monday.
But Greece and its creditors, who will meet again Tuesday to discuss how to keep the country in the euro, remain far apart on key issues, particularly the notion of debt relief.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke on the phone Monday ahead of the Tuesday summit, though no details were disclosed of what they discussed.
New negotiations will be complicated for the European creditors by Tsipras triumph in Sundays referendum. More than 61 percent of Greeks backed his call to vote no to budget cuts the creditors had proposed in return for rescue loans the country needs  even though those proposals were no longer on the table.
The vote was painted by opposition parties and many European officials as one on whether Greece should remain in Europes joint currency. In the aftermath, many European leaders softened their tone and said talks would resume, though Greeces chance of staying in the euro was looking increasingly shaky.
The countrys banks remained shut on Monday for a sixth working day and the government kept tight limits on cash withdrawals at ATMs and money transfers to limit the drain on deposits.
All eyes now turn to whether the European Central Bank will increase the amount of credit the banks can draw on to make up for the cash drain. Analysts expect the ECB to not provide more emergency assistance on Monday.
That means the banks would not be able to reopen and Greece might have to tighten its limits on cash withdrawals and transfers from the current 60 euros ($67) per day. Some banks may even face the risk of collapse in coming days as they continue to be drained of banknotes.
Greeces economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis, told the BBC that if the ECB keeps its support unchanged, the current cash withdrawals limits can stay in place until Friday without any banks collapsing.
Facing such urgency, the Greek government has vowed to quickly restart negotiations with creditors in other eurozone countries and with the institutions that oversaw the countrys bailout: the ECB, European Commission and International Monetary Fund.

Varoufakis appeared to be the first casualty of the Greek governments attempt to reach a deal with creditors.
With his brash style and fondness for frequent media appearances, Varoufakis had visibly annoyed many of the eurozones finance ministers during the past months debt negotiations.
Varoufakis said in a statement he was told shortly after the referendum result that some other eurozone finance ministers and the countrys other creditors would appreciate his not attending the ministers meetings.
The idea was one that the Prime Minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement. For this reason I am leaving the Ministry of Finance today, he said.
As for his European negotiating colleagues, he said of them: I shall wear the creditors loathing with pride.
A replacement was to be announced later Monday.
With his high-stakes gamble to call a referendum with just a weeks notice, Tsipras aimed to show creditors that Greeks, whose economy has been shattered and who face spiraling unemployment and poverty, have had enough and that the austerity prescribed isnt working.
But everything hinges on European reaction.
European officials appear to be split on a key demand by Greece to have the burden of its bailout loans be made more manageable.
Frances finance minister, Michel Sapin, indicated that discussing Greeces debt is not taboo, saying the country could not recover with its current obligations in the months and years to come.
Sapin also called for the ECB to maintain liquidity assistance to Greek banks.
Germany, however, remains reluctant to discuss debt forgiveness.
Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said Germanys position is well-known ... a debt cut is not an issue for us.
More broadly, Chancellor Angela Merkels spokesman said talks on a new bailout program for Greece would depend on what proposals Athens makes.
Steffen Seibert said Germany respects the clear no vote by Greeks against austerity measures.
However, he added that in view of Greek citizens decision yesterday, the conditions are not there at present to enter negotiations on a new program. He said the no vote is a vote against the principle  still supported by Germany  that solidarity requires countries to make their own reform efforts.
Besieged by a prolonged recession, high unemployment and banks dangerously low on capital, Greece defaulted on an IMF loan repayment last week, becoming the first developed nation to do so.
Now some analysts wonder if Greece is so starved of cash that it could be forced to start issuing its own currency and become the first country to leave the 19-member eurozone, established in 1999.
Tsipras was elected in January on promises to repeal the austerity demanded in return for its bailout and negotiations broke down late last month after dragging on unsuccessfully for five months.
Demetri Nellas and Menelaos Hadjicostis in Athens, Greece, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Raf Casert in Brussels and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed.

NEW YORK &gt;&gt; July 4th went off like a dud at the box office. Anticipated new releases Magic Mike XXL and Terminator Genisys fizzled, leaving the popular holdovers Jurassic World and Inside Out to top the holiday weekend.
Despite the brawny enticements of Channing Tatum and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the four-week rule of Universals dinosaur sensation Jurassic World continued with an estimated $30.9 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
Pixars acclaimed Inside Out nearly caught up to the runaway dinos, taking in $30.1 million in its third weekend of release.
The strength of those June hits and the unfortunate timing of July 4th this year coming on a Saturday (rather than stretching out a long weekend) meant the sequels Terminator Genisys and Magic Mike XXL both failed to match previous installments.
Paramounts Terminator Genisys, the fifth film in the series which also marks Schwarzeneggers return to his most iconic character, took in $28.7 million over the weekend and $44.2 million since opening Wednesday.
Warner Bros. also tried to expand the weekend, opening Tatums male-stripper romp Magic Mike XXL on Wednesday. But after a strong start, the film managed just $12 million over the weekend. Over five days it made $27.1 million.
The openings were disappointing for the new releases, but each has a different makeup. Terminator Genisys, an attempted reboot in the 31-year-old, James Cameron-created franchise, was made for $155 million. Magic Mike XXL, a road-trip sequel to Steven Soderberghs 2012 hit original, was made for just under $15 million.
Megan Colligan, head of worldwide distribution for Paramount, said the weekend simply didnt play like a holiday weekend.
The weekend got off to a very sluggish start because people didnt have off until Friday, said Colligan. Our start was just not where it needed to be. Some of that does have to do with it is pretty severe competition. Jurassic is still such a powerhouse in the marketplace and it was hard to anticipate that that wouldnt have burned off a little more by now.
Genisys failed to come close to the previous Terminator film, the Schwarzenegger-less Salvation, which had a five-day debut of $65.3 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2009. Genisys, which critics have slammed, is finding better business abroad. It made $74 million international over the weekend.
Magic Mike XXL, however, had the benefit of largely positive reviews and tracking numbers that suggested a possible No. 1 opening of more than $40 million. The original debuted with $39.1 million.

But Magic Mike XXL failed to expand its audience. Whereas moviegoers for the first film were 73 percent female, Magic Mike XXL was a staggering 96 percent female, Warner Bros. said.
Dan Fellman, head of domestic distribution for Warner Bros., said the film performed worse than expected in the South, Midwest and in Canada. Such a girls-night-out release, he said, didnt materialize over the holiday weekend.
Our audience wasnt available to us, said Fellman. We might be down but were not out. Im in the wait and see mode.
Hollywoods summer has been inching close to equaling its record 2013 season, thanks partly to the unexpected success of Jurassic World. (Now with $558.2 million domestically, its already the fourth-best showing of all time in North America.)
The biggest potholes this summer have been holiday weekends, noted Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office firm Rentrak.
Those weekends usually are the tent poles to Hollywoods summer spectacle, but the lagging Independence Day weekend follows a lackluster Memorial Day, when Disneys Tomorrowland flopped.
These are the weekends everyones going, Wow, what happened? said Dergarabedian. Part of it was the calendar. Part of it, too, was you have two movies out there  Jurassic World and Inside Out  that are just dominating the marketplace. Both those movies have appealed to every audience segment imaginable.
This weekend was still up 6.9 percent over last year, when Melissa McCarthys Tammy and the sci-fi adventure Earth to Echo made for Hollywoods worst July 4 in decades.
Universals animated off-shoot sequel Minions will debut next weekend after a strong international performance. The film, which gives the pipsqueak henchmen of the Despicable Me movies the spotlight, has already grossed $124.2 million abroad, including $54.3 million this weekend.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.
1. Jurassic World, $30.9 million ($42 million international).
2. Inside Out, $30.1 million ($18.6 million international).
3. Terminator: Genisys, $28.7 million ($74 million international).
4. Magic Mike XXL, $12 million.
5. Ted 2, $11 million.
6. Max, $7 million.
8. San Andreas, $3 million.
9. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, $1.3 million.
10. Dope, $1.1 million.

Confederate and American flags fly on top of motor homes at Daytona International Speedway, Saturday in Daytona Beach, Fla. NASCAR and the speedway offered to replace any flag a race brings to the track with an American flag. Phelan M. Ebenhack  The Associated Press
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. &gt;&gt; Steven Rebenstorf has numerous flags flying atop his canopy tent inside Daytona International Speedway.
The Confederate flag is front and center.
Its been like that for years. And the 57-year-old Rebenstorf has no plans to take it down  not even if NASCAR decides to ban the embattled flag from its racetracks.
Theyd have to come and get it, Rebenstorf said Saturday, pointing out that his American flag purposely flies a few inches higher than the rest.
Rebenstorf and others staunchly defended their Confederate flags at NASCARs first race in the South since the racing series and its tracks urged fans to no longer wave the banner. Dozens were scattered throughout the vast infield all weekend leading to Sundays race.
It kills me that NASCAR is jumping on the bandwagon, said 55-year-old Paul Stevens of nearby Port Orange. They should just let it pass, let everything die down. But NASCAR is too quick to try to be politically correct like everybody else.
NASCAR took a stance on the Confederate flag after last months South Carolina church massacre. It backed Gov. Nikki Haleys call to remove it from the Statehouse grounds and noted it doesnt allow the flag on anything it sanctions. The series stopped short of banning fans from displaying the flag at its events, but Daytona and 29 other tracks asked fans to refrain from flying them.
Not everyone obliged. Daytona also offered to exchange Confederate flags for American flags this weekend, and track officials said a few made the swap Sunday morning.
I think the voluntary exchange program for us right now was appropriate with the limited window that we had coming into this event weekend, track president Joie Chitwood said. And more importantly, I think its important to trust our fans, asking our fans to display a flag that we should all be proud of. Everybody should be proud of the American flag.
Indeed, the American flag is prominently displayed all around Daytona  no surprise given the Fourth of July holiday and the patriotism that NASCAR routinely promotes.
But spotting a Confederate flag is easier than finding a souvenir shop, restroom or beer stand.
The first motorhome located inside the Turn 4 tunnel has one flying high above it, and it doesnt take long to reach double figures when counting them on a stroll through the infield. Theyre on clothing, coolers and cars, and even tattooed on skin.

Larry Reeves of Jacksonville Beach has a tattered Confederate flag on top of his motorhome. He initially thought NASCAR was banning the banner and didnt display it this week. But once he saw some flying around him and asked a few questions, he realized it was voluntary and quickly sent his back up the pole.
Its just a Southern pride thing, the 66-year-old Reeves said. Its nothing racist or anything. Ive been doing this for 30 years. My family is from Alabama and weve been going to Talladega forever. It isnt a Confederate thing so much as it is a NASCAR thing. Thats why I fly it.
Like others at Daytona, Reeves believes the flag flap is much ado about nothing.
Its not a big deal one way or the other, Reeves said. If I cant fly it, I wont. But if I dont have to take it down, Im just going to leave it up.
Rebenstorf plans to leave his up no matter what NASCAR mandates.
The St. Petersburg resident spent six years in the Navy, served in the color guard and has strong feelings about vexillology, the scientific study of the history, symbolism and usage of flags.
The Confederate flag has absolutely nothing to do with slavery. It has nothing to do with divisiveness. It has nothing to do with any of that, Rebenstorf said, pausing for a few minutes to pull off his floppy hat, stand at attention and salute during the national anthem Saturday. It was just a battle banner until the Ku Klux Klan draped it around themselves. Now, all of a sudden, it represents slavery and thats not at all true.
The Civil War-era flag has been under attack since nine black men and women were gunned down at a historic church in Charleston on June 17.
The suspect, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, had posed with a Confederate flag in photos posted on a website that displayed a racist manifesto attributed to him.
NASCAR, which has roots in the deep South, moved quickly to distance itself from the flag despite some backlash from fans. The sanctioning body could have done  and eventually might do  more.
I think what happens in this situation is you have people on both sides who feel very strongly about something and theyre very passionate about it, Chitwood said. You cant argue with someones passion or their opinion. That creates something that ends up on the front page of the newspaper or is the headline in the news. If were going to enter that discussion, youve got to be thoughtful and weve got to really think through it and be fair to both sides and make sure that whatever we come up can work.
In something like this, the more thoughtful we can be, understanding and really taking the time to really vet through, I think thats going to be the important thing moving forward.

SACRAMENTO &gt;&gt; Thirty-five California counties have agreed to provide health care coverage to people who are in the United States illegally.
The decision was made Thursday by the County Medical Services Program. That program provides health services to the poor in the mostly rural, sparsely populated counties.
The program could begin next year. Several thousand people are expected to enroll.
Forty-seven of Californias 58 counties have now agreed to provide low-cost medical coverage to eligible people regardless of their immigration status.
Immigrants who are in the state illegally now comprise the single biggest group of Californias uninsured.
Last week, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a state budget that expands Medi-Cal coverage to low-income children regardless of their legal status.

There is broad consensus among scientists that extinction rates have reached their highest levels since dinosaurs died out 66 million years ago.
More recently, Duke University biologist Stuart Pimm and others have asserted that this represents the beginning of Earths sixth mass extinction  echoing the five great extinctions over 4.5 billion years, each depleting 75 percent or more of all species.
But that conclusion has been criticized for using assumptions that overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis.
The new findings, published in the journal Science Advances by UC Berkeleys Barnosky and Stanford University biologists Paul Ehrlich and Gerardo Ceballos, support the dire forecasts, even though they used more modest rates of extinction.
The study shows without any significant doubt that we are now entering the sixth great mass extinction event, said Ehrlich, professor of population studies and a fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.
The work was divided between the Berkeley and Stanford labs. At Berkeley, Barnosky focused on fossil records of vertebrates, primarily mammals, which have the most reliable ancestral data. At Stanford, Erhlich and Ceballos, a Mexican conservationist, compared the rate of natural extinction before humans  2 per 10,000 species per 100 years  with current extinction rates, derived from data from the 2014 International Union of Conservation of Natures Red List.
Past mass extinctions were caused by massive volcanic eruptions and an asteroid falling from the sky.
Now, humans are delivering the coup de grce, according to the team. Were emitting carbon that drives climate change and ocean acidification. Were also cutting down forests, introducing invasive species and releasing poisons into fragile ecosystems.
If Earths population  now 7.13 billion  stops at 9 to 10 billion by the year 2050, other species stand a chance, Barnosky said.
But if it shoots up to 16 billion, he said, it is probably not going to work for keeping other species on Earth.
While its not too late to slow the loss of species, the window of opportunity is rapidly closing, they said. Already, the specter of extinction hangs over about 41 percent of all amphibian species and 26 percent of all mammals.
I dont want to be the generation that wiped out all these species, Barnosky said.

1st service held at Charleston church since 9 slayings
Parishioners sit at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church four days after a mass shooting that claimed the lives of its pastor and eight others on Sunday in Charleston, S.C. David Goldman  The Associated Press

CHARLESTON, S.C. &gt;&gt; Members of a historic black church worshipped at their sanctuary Sunday for the first time since a gunman opened fire at a Bible study, killing nine people, and uniformed police officers stood among the congregation as a measure of added security.
The service started with a message of love, recovery and healing, which will no doubt reverberate throughout churches across the country.
We still believe that prayer changes things. Can I get a witness? the Rev. Norvel Goff said. The congregated responded with a rousing Yes.
But prayer not only changes things, it changes us, Goff said.
Sunday morning marked the first service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church since Dylann Roof, 21, sat among a Bible study group and opened fire after saying that he targeted them because they were black, authorities said. Among the nine killed was the church pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was also a state senator.
Events to show solidarity are planned throughout the city and beyond. At 10 a.m. EDT, church bells rang throughout downtown this Holy City  which garnered the nickname because of the numerous churches here.
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Mayor Joseph Riley attended the service at Emanuel.
Despite grim circumstances the congregation has been faced with, the welcoming spirit Roof exploited before the shooting is still alive, church members said.
I think just because of what people have gone through emotions are definitely heightened, not just in Charleston but with anyone going to church because it is such a sacred place, it is such a safe place, Shae Erdos, 29, said after a multiracial group of women sang Amazing Grace outside the church Saturday afternoon.
To have something like that completely shattered by such evil  I think it will be in the back of everyones heads, really, Erdos said. Erdos was planning on attending Sunday service in nearby Mount Pleasant.
The suburb is connected to Charleston by the Arthur Ravenel Bridge, where people are expected to join hands in solidarity Sunday evening. The bridges namesake is a former state lawmaker and a vocal Confederate flag supporter.
Roof had been photographed with the flag several times before the shooting.

Unity Church of Charleston the Rev. Ed Kosak said delivering his own Sunday morning sermon would be emotionally taxing but he felt empowered by the strength and grace Emanuel members have shown  a demeanor he said has set the tone for religious leaders everywhere.
Ive gone into Sunday sermons before like when Virginia Tech happened, and when the Sikh shootings happened Kosak said. The situation in Charleston may be harder to give a sermon on because it hits so close to home. But, Kosak said, I am more ready than ever to speak to this tragedy in ways I didnt think I could before.
For the family of Cynthia Hurd, Sundays service will be especially poignant. Hurd, a longtime librarian, would have been celebrating her 55th birthday and was planning a trip to Virginia with her siblings.
Sunday will not be a sad day for me; it will be a celebration for me. It will be a celebration for our family because our faith is being tested, Hurds younger brother Malcolm Graham said Friday. She was in the company of God trying to help somebody out. She was where she needed to be.
Felicia Breeland, an 81-year-old lifelong Emanuel member, said she sang in the choir with Susie Jackson, 87, who was also fatally shot Wednesday.
Its going to be sad. She sits right on the front row, too, Breeland said. She had a very soft soprano voice. It was beautiful.

        <MainBody>Iran parliament bans inspector access to military sites

TEHRAN, Iran &gt;&gt; With some lawmakers chanting Death to the America, Irans parliament voted to ban access to military sites, documents and scientists as part of a future deal with world powers over its contested nuclear program.
The bill, if approved into law, could complicate the ongoing talks in Vienna between Iran and the six-nation group  the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany  as they face a self-imposed June 30 deadline. The talks are focused on reaching a final accord that curbs Irans nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.
Of 213 lawmakers present on Sunday, 199 voted in favor of the bill, which also demands the complete lifting of all sanctions against Iran as part of any final nuclear accord. The bill must be ratified by the Guardian Council, a constitutional watchdog, to become a law.
The terms stipulated in the bill allow for international inspections of Iranian nuclear sites, but forbid any inspections of military facilities.
Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani read the bill aloud in a session broadcast live on state radio. It states in part, The International Atomic Energy Agency, within the framework of the safeguard agreement, is allowed to carry out conventional inspections of nuclear sites.
However it concludes that access to military, security and sensitive non-nuclear sites, as well as documents and scientists, is forbidden.
Irans nuclear negotiators say they have already agreed to grant United Nations inspectors managed access to military sites under strict control and specific circumstances. That right includes allowing inspectors to take environmental samples in the vicinity of military sites.
But Iranian officials, including supreme authority Ayatollah Ali Khameni, have strongly rejected the idea of Iranian scientists being interviewed, calling that a violation of the countrys dignity and sovereignty.

Pope Francis pauses in silent prayer before Shroud of Turin

Pope Francis speaks to faithful in front of the  Santa Maria Ausiliatrice Basilica, in Turin, Italy, Sunday.

TURIN, Italy &gt;&gt; Pope Francis paused in silent prayer before the Shroud of Turin Sunday, becoming the latest of hundreds of thousands of people who have come this year to Turins cathedral to view the burial linen some believe covered the body of Jesus after crucifixion.
Francis sat for several minutes before the shroud, contained in a protective glass case. He lowered his head at times in apparent reflection and occasionally gazed up at the 4.3-meter (14-foot) long cloth. Then he took a few steps, placed his hand on the case, and walked away without comment.
Later, after celebrating Mass of the faithful in a packed Turin square, Francis gave his impression of the cloth as he spoke of the love Jesus had for humanity when being crucified.
Icon of this love is the Shroud, which, even this time, has attracted so many people here to Turin, Francis said. The Shroud draws (people) to the tormented face and body of Jesus and, at the same time, directs (people) toward the face of every suffering and unjustly persecuted person.
The shrouds display began April 19 and runs through June 24.
Other pontiffs have made the journey to the northern city during previous displays of the shroud. When John Paul II saw the shroud in 1998, he said the mystery surrounding the cloth forces questions about faith and science and whether it really was Jesus burial linen. He urged continuous study. Benedict XVI described the cloth as an icon written with the blood of a crucified man.
Skeptics say the cloth bearing the image of a crucified man is a medieval forgery.
Turin, the heartland of Italys auto industry, is considered Italys blue-collar labor capital, and Francis used his two-day visit to the city to denounce exploitation of workers, singling out women, young people and immigrants as frequent victims.
Immigration increases competition, but migrants shouldnt be blamed because they themselves are victims of injustice, of this throw-away economy and of wars, Francis said in a speech in a square outside the cathedral.
He then made an apparent reference to European countries as well as some northern Italian regions which are refusing or are reluctant to take some of the tens of thousands of migrants who have landed at southern Italian ports after being rescued in the Mediterranean from overcrowded, unseaworthy smugglers boats.

It makes one cry to see the spectacle of these days in which human beings are treated as commercial goods, Francis said.
Turin is the Piedmont regions capital, and during Mass, the Argentine-born Francis quoted from a poem in local dialect that praises the qualities of those who emigrated from Piedmont  like some of his own ancestors  to seek work abroad.
Our ancestors knew well what it meant to be rock-solid, Francis said. Quoting from the poem, the pope said these emigrants were proper and sincere, they appear to be what they are.
In an unscheduled stop, Francis ducked into the church in Turin where his paternal grandparents were married in 1907, and where, in 1908, his father Mario was baptized. The ANSA news agency quoted the Rev. Giustizio Zoppi as saying Francis left a vase of yellow roses on the altar and then asked for a chair so he could sit in silence for a few minutes.
We didnt ask him to come, he wanted to, Zoppi said.
On Monday, before he heads back to Rome, Francis will lunch in Turin with some of his relatives who live in Piedmont.

In this Wednesday photo, Palestinian Hamas gunmen ride on the back of a pick-up truck as they patrol the border with Israel near the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Younis. Nearly a year after a devastating war, Israel and Gazas Hamas rulers appear to have formed an unspoken alliance in a common battle against the shared threat of jihadis aligned with the Islamic State group. Khalil Hamra  The Associated Press
KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip &gt;&gt; Nearly a year after a devastating war, Israel and Gazas Hamas rulers appear to have formed an unspoken alliance in a common battle against the shared threat of jihadis aligned with the Islamic State group.
While Israel and Hamas remain arch-enemies, both have an interest in preserving an uneasy calm that has prevailed since the fighting ended in a cease-fire last August  a stalemate that is largely the result of a lack of options on either side.
More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in last years fighting, according to Palestinian officials, and Hamas suffered heavy losses. It is isolated internationally, Gazas economy is in tatters and reconstruction efforts have moved slowly. A renewal of hostilities would be devastating for Gazas 1.8 million people.
On the Israeli side, 73 people, including 67 soldiers, were killed in last years fighting, and the summer-long war disrupted the lives of millions of people as they coped with repeated rocket attacks and air-raid sirens. But Hamas, which seized power in Gaza eight years ago, has survived three wars, and the cost of toppling the group would be extremely high, so Israel appears content to contain Hamas and keep things quiet.
Hamas officials say that efforts are underway, through Qatari mediators, to work out a long-term cease-fire. The deal would call for Israel to ease a stifling blockade on Gaza in exchange for Hamas pledges to disarm, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were discussing sensitive negotiations. It is unclear whether any progress has been made in the cease-fire efforts, which include Hamas demands to reopen sea and airports in Gaza. Israeli officials declined comment.
In the short run, the biggest threat to the quiet is a small but growing number of extremists in Gaza inspired by the Islamic State group, who have fired rockets across the heavily guarded frontier in order to undermine Hamas. The militants believe Hamas is soft on Israel and has failed to establish an Islamic state.
That has transformed Israel and Hamas  bitter enemies for nearly three decades  into unspoken allies against a shared threat.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the southern town of Khan Younis, where Hamas militants have been supervising work crews that are opening a road along Gazas eastern fence with Israel. The patrols have helped preserve quiet in a volatile area used in the past by rocket-launching squads.
Hamas officials say that maintaining the cease-fire is a national interest. A young element breaking that understanding is our responsibility and the responsibility of all of us and all the factions to stop him, said Hamas official Salah Bardawil. Nobody should break the national understanding in a meaningless way.
The road work has been taking place as close as 150 meters (175 yards) from the border, an area that Israel in the past has made off-limits. In an unusual scene earlier this month, four Israeli military bulldozers entered a buffer zone to remove brush along the fence. Camouflaged Hamas militants approached the area but did not confront them.

For sure, there are implicit, indirect understandings by both sides not to attack each other, said Ibrahim al-Madhoun, a Gaza analyst who is close to Hamas. The road is a message that there is a flexible political mind in Gaza (Hamas) that can take reasonable steps in the light of any regional or international changes.
Such a scene would have been unthinkable a year ago, when Israel and Hamas battled for 50 days in their third war since the Islamic militant group  which is sworn to Israels destruction  seized power in Gaza in 2007.
Hamas has honored the cease-fire that ended the war. But a number of small jihadi groups have grown increasingly active in Gaza and appear set on disrupting the calm. They dream of joining Gaza to the IS groups self-styled caliphate in Syria and Iraq, but because they are too weak to challenge Hamas directly, they have instead sought to undermine it by firing rockets at Israel.
Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gazas Al-Azhar University, said the rocket fire is aimed at embarrassing Hamas and provoking Israeli military action against the ruling militant group. Any confrontation will ease the security pressure Hamas put on the Salafists, he said, referring to ultraconservative Islamic groups.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he holds Hamas responsible for all attacks coming out of Gaza and threatened to use Israels full strength to respond. But so far, Israeli reprisals against the recent rocket fire have been limited to empty training sites, and there have been no casualties on either side.
The Israeli military declined to comment on the matter. But defense officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said they are aware of Hamas efforts to preserve the calm.
In addition to the border patrols, Hamas has arrested dozens of Salafi activists in recent months and set up checkpoints in sensitive areas to look for suspects.
Hamas officials say little about the road patrols. Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader, said the action has helped improve security by preventing Palestinians from infiltrating into Israel and is helping protect the properties of people from Israel. He also said the road would help local farmers gain access to lands that could not easily be reached following the war.
Alon Ben-David, the senior military correspondent for Israels Channel 10 TV, said Hamas was sending a conciliatory message to Israel.
What they are broadcasting with those patrols is: We are preventing friction with you (Israel), he said. We are here to prevent fire on Israel.
But he said the Hamas patrols are also collecting intelligence on Israeli military positions and soldiers. So this could all in a second turn upside down and become a military offensive maneuver. But now their objective is the opposite, he said.

WASHINGTON &gt;&gt; Republican Mike Huckabee says the Confederate flag debate in South Carolina is something for that states residents to take on if they so choose, but he doesnt believe presidential candidates need to take a stand on the topic.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012, has called for the immediate removal of the Confederate battle flag from outside the South Carolina Statehouse.
The former Arkansas governor says he believes voters want presidential candidates focused on the economy and keeping Americans safe. They dont want the candidates weighing in on every little issue in all 50 states however important that issue is to a particular state.
Huckabees comments on NBCs Meet the Press come in the wake of the shooting of nine black people at a Charleston church.

New Orleans police arrest suspect in killing of officer
Investigators look over a New Orleans Police department vehicle in which one officer was shot and killed while transporting a prisoner in New Orleans, Saturday. The New Orleans Police Department said Officer Daryle Holloway was shot while transporting Travis Boys, who managed to get his handcuffed hands from behind his back to the front, grab a firearm and shoot the officer.

NEW ORLEANS &gt;&gt; Police in New Orleans say they have arrested a suspect they believe managed to slip into the front seat of a police vehicle while handcuffed and shoot the police officer who was transporting him to jail.
The New Orleans Police Department, in brief announcements on social media, announced the arrest Sunday morning of 33-year-old Travis Boys. The arrest follows a 24-hour manhunt for Boys, who escaped from the vehicle after allegedly shooting and killing Officer Daryle Holloway.
Holloway, 45, had been a member of the New Orleans Police Department since 1992. He was the father of three children.
Boys was under arrest on an aggravated assault charge at the time of the shooting. It was unclear how he allegedly obtained a weapon, worked his handcuffed wrists from behind his back and got through a barrier that separated him from the front seat.
Police Superintendent Michael Harrison and Mayor Mitch Landrieu were to hold a press conference later Sunday to provide further details on the investigation into the killing.
Harrison said he met with two of Holloways children and Holloways former wife at the hospital after he died. As a new chief, it was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in my life, said Harrison, who became chief last year.
He said he had known Holloway for 23 years and described him as a great police officer.
Landrieu on Saturday decried the killing as the lowest of the low and called on the public to help police with information on Boys whereabouts.
Killing an officer in the line of duty is an attack on our community that will not stand, Landrieu said in a statement. The heart and soul of New Orleans is heavy today as our community mourns one of our citys finest.
The last New Orleans Police Department officer killed in the line of duty was Officer Rodney Thomas on July 7, 2013, according to Gamble. More recently, a Housing Authority police officer, James Bennett Jr., 45, was found shot to death in his patrol car.

LONDON &gt;&gt; Thousands of revelers, new-agers and self-styled Druids descended on the ancient stone circle at Stonehenge on Sunday, catching a brief glimpse of the sun as they marked the summer solstice  the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.
About 23,000 sun-watchers gathered on the Salisbury Plain about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southwest of London, police said. But with the sun visible only briefly, the party was markedly shorter than in past years. Authorities reported nine arrests for drug offenses  fewer than in the past.
Visitors kissed the stones, dancers swirled on the grass and drummers pounded as part of the free-form celebrations. A small group of yoga enthusiasts held a short class and couples renewed their commitments to one another.
Stonehenge is an icon of Britain, and one of its most popular attractions. It was built in three phases between 3,000 B.C. and 1,600 B.C. and its purpose remains under study.

NEW YORK &gt;&gt; In an open letter to Apple, Taylor Swift has criticized the companys new streaming music service for failing to pay artists for a free three-month trial.
Writing on her Tumblr page Sunday in a posting titled To Apple, Love Taylor, Swift said she would withhold her 2014 album 1989 from Apple Music, which launches June 30. The pop star called Apples plan not to compensate artists, writers or producers during the three-month trial shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.
Swift said she was speaking up for the music community at large, not for her own personal gain. Three months, she said, is a long time to go unpaid. Last November, Swift also pulled 1989 off Spotify.
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

This undated photo provided by the City of New Orleans shows Officer Daryle Holloway.  The New Orleans Police Department said Holloway was shot while transporting a suspect, Travis Boys, who managed to get his handcuffed hands from behind his back to the front, grab a firearm and shoot the officer. A manhunt was underway for the 33-year-old Boys, according to Police Chief Michael Harrison. City of New Orleans via AP
NEW ORLEANS &gt;&gt; A handcuffed prisoner in a moving police cruiser managed to grab a gun, fatally shoot the officer at the wheel and escape from the vehicle, which careened into a utility pole at a busy intersection, police said Saturday.
Officer Daryle Holloway, 45, died at a hospital, police chief Michael Harrison said. Meanwhile, an intense manhunt was on for Travis Boys, 33, the suspect who had been arrested on an aggravated assault charge and was being taken to jail when he escaped.
The New Orleans Crimestoppers organization announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to Boys arrest.
Rifle-toting police in bullet-proof vests, some with trained canines, searched whole blocks of one neighborhood about a mile from the citys French Quarter Sunday afternoon. Residents clustered on street corners to watch as officers checked backyards and squinted under modest homes elevated on flood-protection piers.
He will be caught and he will be brought to justice for the murder of Officer Holloway and for this assault on our entire community, Harrison said in a police department statement.
The shooting happened Saturday morning as Boys was handcuffed in the back seat of the vehicle. Boys managed to get his hands from behind his back to the front and obtain a weapon as well, Harrison told reporters at the scene in a video interview posted on the departments Facebook page.
Boys got to the front seat through an opening in the cage that separates front and back seats and shot Holloway, Harrison said.
Officer Holloway put up a fight to try to get the subject to not exit the vehicle but succumbed to his injuries, Harrison said.
Department spokesman Tyler Gamble said police were trying to determine what weapon Boys used and how he obtained it, but do not believe Boys used the officers gun.
John Polk, who lives around the corner from where the police SUV came to rest, said he was just awakening when he heard a loud noise and his power went out. The noise, he figured, was an electrical transformer blowing.
I look out the door  Id heard the boom  I see the fire truck here on the corner, he said. It was only later 45 minutes later, after police had swarmed into the area that he learned what happened.
A helicopter circled overhead as marked and unmarked units from state police and other law enforcement agencies cruised the side streets. Utility workers worked to replace the downed power pole.
State police, St. Tammany Parish deputies, Housing Authority of New Orleans police and the U.S. Marshals Service were among those searching for Boys.

Police seeking Boys halted traffic Saturday into an area of several city blocks of the St. Roch neighborhood not far from where the shooting occurred. Officers kept people from entering the area, and others from leaving.
Vincent Alexander, a prep cook at Margaritaville restaurant in the French Quarter, said he was walking home from work when police detoured him a short distance from his house. I just called my roommate. Theyre not letting him get out the house.
Holloway had been a member of the New Orleans Police Department since 1992. He was the father of three children.
Harrison said Holloway was not the arresting officer but was transporting Boys to a jail when the shooting occurred.
Harrison said he met with two of those children and Holloways former wife at the hospital after he died. As a new chief, it was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in my life, said Harrison, who became chief last year.
He said he had known Holloway for 23 years and described him as a great police officer.
Mayor Mitch Landrieu decried the killing as the lowest of the low and called on the public to help police with information on Boys whereabouts.
Killing an officer in the line of duty is an attack on our community that will not stand, Landrieu said in a statement. The heart and soul of New Orleans is heavy today as our community mourns one of our citys finest.
The last New Orleans Police Department officer killed in the line of duty was Officer Rodney Thomas on July 7, 2013, according to Gamble. More recently, a Housing Authority police officer, James Bennett Jr., 45, was found shot to death in his patrol car.

Charleston, S.C., shooting suspect Dylann Storm Roof is escorted from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, N.C., Thursday, June 18, 2015. Roof is a suspect in the shooting of several people Wednesday night at the historic The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The current brick Gothic revival edifice, completed in 1891 to replace an earlier building heavily damaged in an earthquake, was a mandatory stop for the likes of Booker T. Washington and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Still, Emanuel was not just a church for the black community.(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)
CHARLESTON, S.C. &gt;&gt; Parishioners were let into the bullet-scarred Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church on Saturday, getting a firsthand glimpse of the room where nine people from their congregation were slain.
Around that same time, two federal law enforcement officials said the FBI was investigating a manifesto purportedly written by the suspected gunman, 21-year-old Dylan Roof.
The website linked to Roof contained photos of him holding a burning American flag and standing on one. In other images, he was holding a Confederate flag, considered a divisive symbol by civil rights leaders and others.
The hate-filled 2,500-word essay talks about white supremacy and the author says the event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case.
Martin was an unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot in Florida in 2012 by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Martin was walking home, got into a confrontation with Zimmerman and was shot.
Prosecutors accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin, but he was acquitted of murder. The manifesto said it was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right and that the case led him to search black on White crime on the Internet.
I have never been the same since that day, it said.
Its unclear if Roof wrote it but the rants are in line with what he has told friends and what he said before allegedly opening fire inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church Wednesday night.
Cleaning crews worked at the church Saturday and church members announced they will hold a Sunday service. Harold Washington, 75, was with the small group that saw the lower-level room where the victims were shot.
They did a good job cleaning it up, there were a few bullet holes around but what they did, they cut them out so you dont see the actual holes, he said.
He said he expected an emotional service Sunday, and a large turnout.
Were gonna have people come by that weve never seen before and will probably never see again, and thats OK, he said. Its a church of the Lord  you dont turn nobody down.
The church had that same welcoming nature when Roof walked into their Bible study, Felecia Sanders, who survived the shooting, said at Roofs bail hearing Friday. She lost her son Tywanza in the attack.
Two federal law enforcement officials close to the investigation said the FBI is aware of the website linked to Roof and is reviewing it. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the case.

Internet registry records show that the website was created on Feb. 9 via a Russian registry service with the owners personal details hidden. A man who answered the phone at the Moscow-based company would not say who the sites owner was.
Roof is being held in jail, facing nine counts of murder and a weapons charge.
A police affidavit released Friday accused Roof of shooting all nine multiple times, and making a racially inflammatory statement as he stood over an unidentified survivor.
Roof had complained while getting drunk on vodka recently that blacks were taking over the world and that someone needed to do something about it for the white race, according to Joey Meek, who tipped off the FBI when he saw his friend on surveillance images.
In Charleston, the grief was so palpable three days after the shooting that a family re-routed its trip home from the beach and a bride-to-be interrupted her wedding day to pay their respects.
Its been a weird feeling, trying to have a celebration this weekend. But the whole city has been so supportive and such a show of grace, said Kathryn Cole, 27, who lives two blocks away from the church and is set to say her nuptials Saturday night. Life is carrying on. We arent letting this change our everyday lives.
Derrick Jones was vacationing on Hilton Head Island when he decided to drive an hour out of his way home to Greenville. He stopped at the church with his wife and three boys.
Theyve been asking questions all day since this has happened, Jones said. And I dont really have all the answers. I try to explain it the best way I can.
Greenville residents Stacey and Kenneth Penland arrived in Charleston for vacation Friday. During their first full day in the city, they came to the church with their children, 6-year-old Luke and 3-year-old Logan.
Weve been at the beach, and then the market, and of course we stopped by here, said Kenneth Penland.

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan &gt;&gt; An Afghan family returning to their home after fleeing a possible military operation struck a roadside bomb Saturday in the countrys south, killing at least 12 of them and wounding eight, authorities said.
The blast struck the familys van in Helmand provinces Marjah district, largely a Taliban stronghold. At least 12 died in the blast, though the death toll could rise, said Nabil Jan Mullahkhail, the provincial police chief.
The family fled the district in recent days after hearing a government offensive could take place there, relative Mohammad Salih said. Salih said the death toll likely was higher, as he believed as many as 21 of his relatives had been killed in the blast.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. The Taliban routinely plant roadside bombs to target Afghan security forces, though the bombs often explode as civilian vehicles pass by, killing them instead.
In February, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan documented 10,548 civilian casualties in 2014, the highest number in a single year since 2009. They include 3,699 civilian deaths, up 25 percent from 2013.
The U.N. said at the time that the Taliban and other insurgents were responsible for 72 percent of all civilian casualties, with government forces and foreign troops responsible for just 14 percent. The U.N. report attributed the rise in casualties to intensified ground fighting, in which weapons like mortars, rockets and grenades are used in populated areas, sometimes indiscriminately.
U.S. and NATO troops pulled back from volatile areas last year, handing security responsibility over to Afghan forces and officially concluding their combat mission at the end of the year. In the time since, local Afghan security forces have been increasingly targeted in insurgent attacks.

Standoff over social media passwords breaks new legal ground

HOUSTON &gt;&gt; A Texas man used social media to promote his gun store, posting politically charged messages that criticized the president and promoted Second Amendment rights.
But after losing ownership of his suburban Houston store in bankruptcy, Jeremy Alcede spent nearly seven weeks in jail for refusing a federal judges order to share with the new owner the passwords of the business Facebook and Twitter accounts, which the judge had declared property.
Its all about silencing my voice, said Alcede, who was released in May after turning over the information. ... Any 3-year-old can look at this and tell this is my Facebook account and not the companys.
Alcedes ultimately failed stand charts new territory in awarding property in bankruptcy proceedings and points to the growing importance of social media accounts as business assets. Legal experts say it also provides a lesson for all business owners who are active on social media.
If your business is something you feel very passionately about, it can be hard to separate those things, said Benjamin Stewart, a Dallas-based bankruptcy lawyer. The moral for people is you have to keep your personal life separate from your business life.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Jeff Bohm, who handled Alcedes case, acknowledged the landscape of social media is yet mostly uncharted in bankruptcy, and cited a 2011 New York bankruptcy court case that treated such accounts like subscriber lists, which provide valuable access to customers and potential customers.
Other cases in the U.S. and abroad have touched on similar issues. In 2012, a South Carolina Internet company settled a lawsuit filed against a former employee it had said cost them thousands of dollars in lost business when he took 17,000 Twitter followers with him. A Pennsylvania federal court in 2013 ruled in favor of a woman who had sued after her former employer took over her LinkedIn account following her firing.
That same year, a British court approved a companys request to temporarily stop a group of ex-employees from using the firms LinkedIn contacts to start a rival business. The employees claimed the LinkedIn accounts and contacts were personal.
Villanova University School of Law professor Michael Risch said Facebook and Twitter accounts, among other social media platforms, are now seen as property by companies.
I suspect thats what the judge was looking at, is this primarily an asset being used for business advertising to get customers to talk about what is going on with the company, said Risch, who specializes in Internet law. It might have started out as a personal (account) but turned into a business property.

Alcede, however, remains defiant, even after his release from jail, saying his refusal to hand over the passwords was not about keeping his Facebook page but fighting tyrannical big government.
He said his Facebook posts and tweets criticizing President Barack Obama and supporting gun owners rights were his personal views and not done to promote the business. But Bohm ruled in April that the gun stores social media accounts were not personal but used to boost sales, citing a tweet in which Alcede told his followers he was at a gun trade show as an example of something that would attract customers because it showed him as a connected insider in the gun-buying community.
Control of the store and social media accounts was given to Steven Coe Wilson, Alcedes former business partner. Bohms ruling described Alcede as a disgruntled former business partner trying to control assets that no longer belonged to him.
Alcede, who in June filed a motion to revoke the bankruptcy plan, had argued the accounts werent listed as assets in the bankruptcy court filings. He told The Associated Press he only turned over the passwords so he could deal with various personal issues, including health problems he developed while jailed.
Wilson said in an email he couldnt comment until Bohm releases the company from bankruptcy. Richard Kincheloe, Wilsons attorney, did not return phone calls seeking comment, but said at an April court hearing that the issues related to the social media accounts were not about what someone is allowed to say. Its about paying creditors.
If the new owners could not access the business accounts and send messages to followers, it could impact the stores profits, making it less valuable, Stewart said. While having Alcede spend seven weeks in jail over the passwords was harsh, Stewart said that in the end, Alcede held the key to his freedom.
You have to strike a balance between making sure people respect the courts authority and giving people the right to make their own decision and accept the consequences if that is the way they want to go, he said.

BONN, Germany &gt;&gt; The United States has succeeded in its bid to Remember the Alamo, after the U.N. cultural body approved its status as a world heritage site Sunday.
The Alamo was one of five Spanish Roman Catholic sites, known as the San Antonio Missions, to receive the coveted label likely to boost tourism.
UNESCOs World Heritage Committee approved the Missions status along with more than a dozen others from around the globe, including the Gunkanjima industrial site off Japan that South Korea had long objected to.
Susan Snow, an archaeologist for San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, said the site in Texas represents the very essence of the great melting pot of the United States.
These Missions are a living example of the interchange of cultures bringing together the indigenous, Spanish, Mexican, and other influences that form South Texas today, Snow said in a statement following the decision in Bonn, Germany.
The Missions were built in the 18th century in and around what is now the city of San Antonio to convert indigenous people to Catholicism and make them Spanish subjects.
The best known of the missions, The Alamo, was the site of the famous 1836 battle when an outnumbered band of Texas settlers staged a courageous stand before Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his Mexican forces seized the mission. During the Battle of San Jacinto weeks later, then-victorious Texas soldiers shouted, Remember the Alamo!
U.S. officials hope the designation will boost tourism to San Antonio, already one of the citys top five industry and responsible for one in eight jobs.
The Missions were the only sites in the United States proposed for world heritage status this year. Other American icons already on the list include the Statue of Liberty and the Grand Canyon.
In another decision, Japan received world heritage status for a collection of almost two dozen sites that illustrate the countrys industrial revolution during the 19th century.
The unanimous vote in favor of Japans bid was approved only after Tokyo and Seoul resolved a spat over whether to acknowledge the sites history of wartime forced labor, particularly that of Gunkanjima, or Battleship Island.
The fortress island near Nagasaki was key to Japans rapid development during the 1868-1912 era of the Meiji Emperor, who sought to catch up with Western colonial powers.

Until recently, Seoul had objected to the listing unless the role of Korean prisoners forced to work there during World War II was formally recognized.
Japan is prepared to take measures that allow an understanding that there were a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites, the Japanese delegation said in a statement after the decision.
More than a dozen other sites have also been granted world heritage status in recent days. They include:
 The Burgundy vineyards south of Dijon, France, which have been shaped by centuries of wine making. Along with surrounding villages and the historic center of Dijon, the site represents an industry in existence since at least the 12th century.
 Champagne, the sparkling wine distinctive of the eponymous French region, represented in the vineyards, the cellars where the bottled wine ferments a second time, and the storied sales houses.
 The Diyarbakir Fortress and Hevsel Gardens of Turkey, which goes back to ancient Greek and Roman times.
 The Par Force Hunting Landscape northeast of Copenhagen, a sculpted woodland where Danish kings hunted with hounds until the 18th century.
 A Lutheran church settlement known as Christiansfeld, also in Denmark. Founded in 1773 in the region of South Jutland, the town was built around a central church square to represent the democratic ideal of this Protestant denomination.
 Tusi sites in southwest China, named after the tribal chiefs who ruled there from the 13th to the early 20th century.
 The archaeological mounds and Ardeshirs palace along the Shavur River in Iran. Known as Susa, the site was continuously settled from the 5th century B.C. until the 13th century.
 The Maymand valley region of central Iran inhabited by semi-nomadic people who move between mountain pastures and caves depending on the season.
 Singapores Botanical Gardens, which were created in 1859 and have since become a world-class conservation and research site, as well as a major tourist attraction for the city state.
 The Baekje region of South Korea comprising archaeological sites dating from the late 5th to late 7th century.
 Mongolias sacred Great Burkhan Khaldun Mountain where Central Asian steppe meets the Siberian taiga. Tradition holds that it is the site of Genghis Khans birth and burial.
 Sicilian churches and palaces dating back to the islands 12th-century Norman rule, which incorporated Arab and Byzantine culture.
 Christian pilgrimage sites in modern Jordan where Jesus is said to have been baptized, along with Roman and Byzantine remains in the area.
 Prehistoric rock art showing human and animal figures in Saudi Arabias Hail Region.
 Hamburgs Speicherstadt district, a vast complex of red-brick warehouses built between 1883 and 1927 in Germanys biggest port.

        <MainBody>Police: Man dies after launching firework from the top of his head

CALAIS, Maine &gt;&gt; A young man who was drinking and celebrating the Fourth of July tried to launch a firework off the top of his head, fatally injuring himself, authorities said Sunday.
Devon Staples and his friends had been drinking and setting off fireworks Saturday night in the backyard of a friends home in the small eastern Maine city of Calais, said Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety. Staples, 22, of Calais, placed a fireworks mortar tube on his head and set it off, he said.
The firework exploded, killing Staples instantly, McCausland said.
His death is the first fireworks fatality in Maine since the state legalized fireworks on Jan. 1, 2012, authorities said.
Calais is on the Canadian border near New Brunswick.
State fire marshals were also investigating several other Fourth of July fireworks accidents involving injuries in Friendship, Jefferson, Lebanon and Woodstock. They said most of the accidents involved burns and eye injuries. McCausland said further details were expected to be released later Sunday.
In 2011, lawmakers voted to repeal a 1949 law banning fireworks, reasoning the industry would create jobs and generate additional revenue.

In this photo, a DJI Phantom 3 drone is flown by Chip Bowling, left, from Newburg, Md., president of the National Corn Growers, with Matthew Creger, marketing director for Intelligent UAS, during a drone demonstration at a farm and winery on potential use for board members of the National Corn Growers in Cordova, Md. Alex Brandon  The Associated Press
CORDOVA, Md. &gt;&gt; Mike Geske wants a drone.
Watching a flying demonstration on Marylands Eastern Shore, the Missouri farmer envisions using an unmanned aerial vehicle to monitor the irrigation pipes on his farm  a job he now pays three men to do.
The savings on labor and fuel would just be phenomenal, Geske says, watching as a small white drone hovers over a nearby corn field and transmits detailed pictures of the growing stalks to an iPad.
Nearby, farmer Chip Bowling tries his hand at flying one of the drones. Bowling, president of the National Corn Growers Association, says he would like to buy one for his Maryland farm to help him scout out which individual fields need extra spraying.
Another farmer, Bobby Hutchison, says he is hoping the man he hires weekly to walk his fields and observe his crops gets a drone, to make the process more efficient and accurate.
I see it very similar to how I saw the computer when it first started, says Hutchison, 64. It was a no-brainer.
Farmers are eager for the technology.
The small, relatively inexpensive vehicles could replace humans in a variety of ways around large farms: transmitting detailed information about crops to combines and sprayers, directing them very precisely to problem spots and cutting down on the amount of water and chemicals that a farmer needs to use in those areas.
The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group, says agriculture could account for 80 percent of all commercial drone use.
Agricultural use of drones is about to take off after being grounded for years by the lack of federal guidelines. The Federal Aviation Administration has approved more than 50 exemptions for farm-related operations since January.
Companies with those exemptions say business has grown, helped by quick advances in the technology.
Bret Chilcott of Kansas-based AgEagle, which sells unmanned aerial vehicles and the software to help operate them, says his company took its first orders last year. Now it has a backlog of several hundred orders. He says the technology has transformed the market during that short period.
Last year users had to land their aircraft and then take the data to the computer, he says. Now the data appears on your iPad or hand-held device a few minutes after flight.
That data could be pictures, 3-D images of plants, thermal readings of crops or animals or other observations that a drone could make while in the air. Information that in the past took days to collect  or could not have been collected at all  can be gathered now in minutes or hours and, in some cases, integrated with separate data collected from other high-tech farm machinery.

Chilcott is optimistic that the technology to scout out problem spots so precisely will be transformative because farmers can limit spraying just to those places.
In five years we wont have to blanket a field with chemicals, he says.
Still, most farmers cannot legally fly the vehicles yet.
The FAA is working on rules that would allow the drones to be used regularly for business while maintaining certain safety and privacy standards. An FAA proposal this year would allow flight of the vehicles as long as they weigh less than 55 pounds, stay within the operators sight and fly during the daytime, among other restrictions. Operators would have to pass an FAA test of aeronautical knowledge and a Transportation Security Administration background check.
Thomas Haun of North Carolina-based PrecisionHawk, another company with an exemption, says it is unclear what the business will look like eventually. Farmers may hire services that have unmanned aerial vehicles or every farm may get its own drone. Most likely, it will be a combination.
Haun says the proposed rules are appropriate. Its pretty spot on for where the technology is right now, he says.
Some people have concerns about the guidelines. Pilots of crop dusters and other planes that operate around farms are concerned the rules do not go far enough to ensure safety.
We cant see them, says Andrew Moore of the National Agricultural Aviation Association. His group advocated for the unmanned vehicles to include tracking systems or lights to help airplanes figure out where they are, but that was not included in the proposal.
The rules could pose some challenges for the eager farmers, too.
Geske may not be able to use drones efficiently to monitor all the irrigation pipes on his 2,100 acre Missouri farm if he has to keep them within sight. Hes still interested, though. The men he hires now use a lot of fuel and their trucks tear up his land and roads.
You can wait forever on advancing technology, Geske says.

MOSCOW &gt;&gt; An unmanned Russian cargo ship has docked successfully at the International Space Station, where it was anxiously awaited by the U.S.-Russian crew after the successive failures of two previous supply missions.
The Progress M-28M ship, which is carrying 2.5 metric tons of fuel, oxygen, water, food and other supplies, was launched into orbit on Friday from the Baikonur launch pad in Kazakhstan. Russian Mission Control said it docked successfully Sunday in the automated mode at the orbiting space station.
The previous Progress launch in April had ended in failure and a week ago a U.S. supply mission failed when SpaceXs Falcon 9 rocket broke apart shortly after liftoff.
The mishaps were preceded by last Octobers launch pad failure of Orbital Sciences Antares rocket, also carrying station cargo for NASA.

On his native turf, Pope Francis touches on cherished issues
Pope Francis waves to reporters at Romes Fiumicino International airport, Sunday as he boards his flight to Quito, Ecuador, where he will start a week-long trip to South America, including Bolivia and Paraguay. Francis is taking his church for the poor to three of South Americas poorest and most peripheral countries, making a grueling, week-long trip that will showcase the pope at his unpredictable best: speaking his native Spanish on his home turf about issues closest to his heart.

QUITO, Ecuador &gt;&gt; Historys first Latin American pope returns to Spanish-speaking South America for the first time on Sunday, bringing a message of solidarity with the regions poor, who are expected to turn out in droves to welcome their native son home.
The pope of the poor chose to visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay specifically because they are among the poorest and most marginal nations of a region that claims 40 percent of the worlds Catholics. Hes skipping his homeland of Argentina, at least partly to avoid papal entanglement in this years presidential election.
The trip starts in Ecuador, where falling world prices for oil and minerals threaten to fray the social safety net woven by President Rafael Correa, who has been buffeted for nearly a month by the most serious anti-government street protests of his more than eight years in power.
Crowds began gathering Sunday morning along the route from the airport to the papal nuncios residence, where Francis will be staying. The pope will switch from a car to a bubble-windowed popemobile for the last five miles of the trip.
Francis is likely to raise environmental concerns with Correa and the leader of Bolivia  who have promoted mining and oil drilling in wilderness areas  given his recent encyclical on the need to protect nature and the poor who suffer most when it is exploited.
In that document, Francis called for a new development model that rejects todays profit-at-all cost mentality in favor of a Christian view of economic progress that respects human rights, safeguards the planet and involves all sectors of society, the poor and marginalized included.
In a video message on the eve of his departure, Francis said he wanted to bring a message of hope and joy to all especially the neediest, the elderly, the sick, those in prison and the poor and all those who are victims of this throwaway culture.
Francis stops include a violent Bolivian prison, a flood-prone Paraguayan shantytown and a meeting with Bolivian trash pickers, the sort of people he ministered to in the slums of Buenos Aires as archbishop.
Crowds are expected to be huge. While the countries themselves are tiny compared to regional powerhouses like Brazil and Argentina, they are fervently Catholic: 79 percent of the population is Catholic in Ecuador, 77 percent in Bolivia and a whopping 89 percent in Paraguay, according to the Pew Research Center.

You can imagine what this embrace of love will be, this devotion of our people toward the pope, the universal pastor who comes from Latin America, said Guzman Carriquiri, the No. 2 of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and a top papal adviser.
The Vatican says it expects more than 1 million people to turn out for Francis major public Masses in each country, and organizers have scheduled plenty of time for the pope to meander through the throngs expected to line his motorcade route.
When St. John Paul II visited Ecuador in 1985, he called for a more just society and reminded indigenous groups of the role played by missionaries who had arrived on the continent centuries before. Francis will likely repeat those messages and pay particular attention to the role his Jesuit order played.
John Pauls visits were shadowed by the Polish popes concern about the rise of liberation theology, fearing that Marxists were using its preferential option for the poor to turn the Gospel into a call for armed revolution.
Carriquiri said a less turbulent situation awaits Francis, who has sought to revive a purer, less political version of liberation theology and recently approved beatification for one of its heroes, Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero. Francis also brokered a historic thaw between the United States and Cuba, countries he will visit in September.
Francis visit will be a huge boost to the priests of the Third World and theology of liberation, said Xavier Albo, a fellow Jesuit who, like the pope, is 80. He lives that theology through mercy, modesty and his obligation to the poor, the immigrants and the imprisoned.
Jesuits paid with their lives defending the downtrodden against dictatorships, as the pope knows well from his days as head of the Jesuits during the right-wing military dictatorship in Argentina.
Opponents of dictatorships in neighboring Paraguay and Bolivia were also disappeared. One, who was tortured and killed in 1980, was Father Luis Espinal, a Bolivian close to Albo whose body was dumped by the side of the airport road that Francis will travel on his way into La Paz on Wednesday.
Francis will stop the Popemobile there, get out and pray.

Israeli PM warns of growing concessions in Iran nuke talks

JERUSALEM &gt;&gt; Israels prime minister says each day that passes brings greater Western concessions toward Iran in talks over its nuclear program.
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday the progressing talks in Vienna do not represent a breakthrough but rather a breakdown. Western diplomats are trying to reach a deal before an extended July 7 target date. Any deal would result in an end to longstanding sanctions against Iran.
Israel has been a vocal opponent of loosening sanctions in return for curbs on Irans nuclear program, saying this would just lead to a bomb and aid the Islamic Republic in expanding its network of global terrorism.
Netanyahu assailed a preliminary deal reached earlier this year. He says the looming accord is even worse than the one that previously allowed North Korea to go nuclear.

BEIRUT &gt;&gt; U.S.-led coalition aircraft unleashed a series of airstrikes targeting the Islamic State groups stronghold of Raqqa in eastern Syria in what the coalition said Sunday was one of its most sustained aerial operations carried out in Syria to date.
IS said at least 10 people were killed and many others wounded.
At least 16 airstrikes were reported late Saturday and early Sunday, triggering successive explosions that shook the city and created panic among residents, activists said. The U.S.-led coalition often targets IS-held towns and cities in Syria, but the overnight strikes on Raqqa were rare in their intensity.
In a statement issued early Sunday, the coalition said it had conducted 16 airstrikes throughout Raqqa, destroying vital IS-controlled structures and transit routes in Syria.
The significant airstrikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq, said coalition spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Gilleran, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.
This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria, and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move from Raqqa, he said.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the so-called Islamic caliphate declared a year ago by the Islamic State group in territories it controls in Iraq and Syria. The sustained airstrikes add pressure on the militants in Raqqa, still reeling from last months loss of the border town of Tal Abyad to Kurdish fighters. The town on the Turkish border was a major avenue for commerce and smuggling for the group.
A militant website said 10 people were killed and dozens of others wounded. An IS-affiliated Facebook page said one civilian was among those killed and 10 were wounded including women and children. It also said the bombing destroyed several bridges.
The IS-affiliated Aamaq news agency released a video of what it said was the effects of shelling Saturday by a U.S. drone on Raqqa. It showed several wounded men on a stretcher and at least three young boys being treated for wounds at what appeared to be a hospital.
A Raqqa-based anti-IS activist network reported eight civilians were killed by the coalition airstrikes, including a 10-year-old child.
The casualty figures could not be independently confirmed.
The network, called Raqqa is Being Silently Slaughtered, said at least one airstrike targeted a group of IS members in the city center. Another targeted an IS checkpoint while a third destroyed large parts of an IS-held brick factory in the city.

In the remote northeastern city of Hassakeh, IS suicide bombers detonated an explosives-laden truck near a main power plant Sunday. State-run news agency SANA reported casualties and damage in the plant on the southern edge of the city.
Fighting has raged in Hassakeh since the IS group attacked several southern neighborhoods held by government troops earlier this month. The violence has forced tens of thousands of residents to flee. The predominantly Kurdish city was split between government forces and Kurdish fighters, who have been fighting the IS group separately.
In Iraq, a Defense Ministry statement said government forces repelled an IS attack Sunday morning on the town of Haditha and the nearby Haditha dam in Anbar province. At least 20 militants were killed in the failed attack, said the statement, which did not provide any further information.
Iraqi forces, backed by Shiite militias, have been struggling to recapture areas lost to the IS group in the countrys west and north.
In May, the militant group scored a stunning victory, overrunning Ramadi, the provincial capital of western Anbar province. Yet, Haditha and some other towns remain under control of government forces and allied Sunni tribal fighters.
In Lebanon, some 200 Kurdish nationals staged a demonstration in downtown Beirut in solidarity with their brethren in Syria who are fighting against IS militants.

BAGHDAD &gt;&gt; A series of attacks, mainly car bombs, in Iraq killed at least 19 people and wounded dozens on Saturday, authorities said.
Police officials said the deadliest attack occurred Saturday night when a car bomb exploded on a commercial street in Baghdads western neighborhood of Amil, killing nine people and wounding 24 others. Several shops and cars were damaged.
Earlier, police said a car bomb blast near a bus stop killed three people and wounded 15 in southern Baghdad. A bomb explosion near an outdoor market killed three people in Mhamoudiya town, just south of Baghdad.
Another car bomb went off near a row of restaurants in the Shiite town of Balad Ruz, killing four and wounding 14. Balad Ruz is 70 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Baghdad.
Hospital officials confirmed the casualties from all the attacks. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to reporters.
Nobody claimed responsibility for the attacks. Iraq sees near-daily bombings that are often claimed by the Islamic State group which seized a large swath of the country during an offensive last year. The Iraqi army, backed by Shiite and Sunni militia fighters, has been gradually retaking territory.

The United States marks 239 years as an independent nation on Saturday as it celebrates the Fourth of July with parades, fireworks, food and music. Here are some highlights and lowlights of Independence Day celebrations:
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS CAMPAIGN IN PARADES
Parades across Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first presidential nominating contests, were clear reminders of the race for the White House: Red balloons promoting Jeb! 2016, a tractor draped in a Rick Perry banner and dutiful volunteers holding signs and chanting for their chosen candidates.
Former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida, Rick Perry of Texas and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island as well as South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham worked the crowd in Amherst, while Hillary Rodham Clinton marched in a parade in New Hampshires North Country. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spent the holiday in New Hampshires Lakes Region, as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley met voters in Iowa.
NATHANS HOT DOG EATING CONTEST
Matt Stonie devoured 62 wieners and buns in 10 minutes to upset Joey Jaws Chestnut in the annual hot dog eating contest at Nathans Famous in Coney Island, breaking Chestnuts bid for a ninth straight victory.
Stonie, who finished second last year, beat Chestnut on Saturday by two wieners. Both are from San Jose, California. The third-place finisher ate 35 hot dogs.
Defending champion Miki Sudo won the womens division by devouring 38 wieners and buns in 10 minutes.
The Las Vegas woman retained the coveted mustard yellow winners championship belt by downing four more hot dogs than last year and besting Sonya Black Widow Thomas of Alexandria, Virginia, who devoured 31 wieners.
MUSIC, CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS ON NATIONAL MALL
A fife and drum corps, parade and concerts on the National Mall highlight the festivities in Washington.
As morning rains cleared, the capitals Fourth of July parade kicked off. The parade features marching bands, floats and balloons with plenty of red, white and blue.
The National Mall is also hosting the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. The annual festival features the culture of Peru this year, drawing thousands of visitors to the mall before the evening fireworks.

The U.S. Air Force Band performs Saturday evening on the Washington Monument grounds. And the big event is the Capitol Fourth concert on the west lawn of the Capitol, featuring Barry Manilow and the National Symphony Orchestra before the fireworks.
FIREWORKS SHOOT INTO COLORADO CROWD, BURN 9
Officials say nine people suffered minor burns during an accident at a fireworks show in Avon, Colorado.
Virginia Egger, the town manager in Avon, says a malfunction caused a fireworks shell to explode in its tube rather than firing into the sky Friday night. She says the misfired shell caused a rack of shells to tip, causing two or three shells to go off toward the crowd.
The accident occurred about 17 minutes into the 23-minute fireworks show over Nottingham Lake, bringing the event to a halt. The annual event attracts about 20,000 people.
The cause of the malfunction is under investigation.
IN AMERICAS BIRTHPLACE: CONCERTS, A PARADE AND BEER
Philadelphia started its Fourth of July celebration a little early.
The citys Liberty Block Party kicked off the festivities Friday near Independence Hall with music on three stages, treats from local food trucks and restaurants and a beer garden.
The Philly Pops performed patriotic tunes Friday night on the Independence Hall steps.
Saturdays events include a Celebration of Freedom ceremony, a parade through the citys historic district and a free concert and fireworks on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The Celebration of Freedom marks the 50th anniversary of a protest outside Independence Hall that would be a milestone in the fight for gay rights.
The concert features performances from Philadelphias own The Roots, Miguel and Jennifer Nettles.
BOSTON POPS FEATURE 42ND SHOW
Boston gospel singer Michelle Brooks-Thompson will perform the national anthem as Keith Lockhart celebrates his 20th year as conductor for the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on Saturday.
The star-studded event is held at the DCR Hatch Cell in the citys Back Bay off the Charles River Esplanade and will also feature Broadway star Michael Cavanaugh, American Idol finalist Melinda Doolittle and Americas Got Talent finalist Sons of Serendip, a quartet who met at Boston University.
Drum and bugle corps the Boston Crusaders and the USO Show Troupe will also perform.

        <MainBody>McCain: US must reassess Afghanistan troop withdrawal
By Associated Press

<<<<<<< HEAD
KABUL, Afghanistan &gt;&gt; The ongoing Taliban offensive in Afghanistan demands a reassessment of the Obama administrations current plan to drawdown U.S. forces, U.S. Sen. John McCain said Saturday during a visit to the countrys capital.
The Republican told reporters that Afghan national forces are fighting bravely, but suffering heavy losses in the field.
American and international troops have already stopped playing a combat role, remaining as trainers for local forces. The international numbers will be reduced further at the end of 2016. But McCain said reductions should be based on conditions on the ground.
With the rise of ISIS and the distinct fighting season that is marked this year, the threat environment continues to evolve in ways that clearly, in my view, demands a reassessment of the administrations current calendar-driven drawdown of U.S. forces with a plan that must be based on conditions on the ground, McCain said.
Meanwhile, Afghan lawmakers rejected President Ashraf Ghanis nominee for defense minister, a position that has remained empty for more than nine months amid some of the toughest fighting since the Taliban insurgency began 14 years ago. Masoom Stanekzai received 84 out of the 107 votes needed for parliamentary approval.
Stanekzais rejection reflects in part a power struggle between Ghani and Afghanistans Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Stanekzai, the second nominee put forth by Ghani to be rejected, is also seen by some to be ineffective, based on the chaotic security situation around the country.
Stanekzai led the High Peace Council negotiating body charged with ending the conflict with the Taliban. He has been serving as the countrys top defense official in an acting capacity.
In January, Gen. Sher Mohammad Karimi also failed to get enough votes in parliament. It could be months before a new nominee for the position is put forth.

In this Monday photo, Ethan Fletcher, left, and partner Andrew Hickam pose for a photograph in Cincinnati. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule sometime this month on the legal status of same-sex marriage; Ohio is among states that still ban it. Gay couples, such as Fletcher and Hickam are gearing up for a quick run to the courthouse in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee _ the states involved in the cases that were argued in April before the justices. Dan Sewell  The Associated Press
CINCINNATI &gt;&gt; With a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage expected any day now, gay couples in states with bans are making wedding plans, courthouse officials are getting ready for different scenarios and steadfast foes are working on their strategies to keep up the opposition.
Marriage license bureaus are bracing for a rush of applicants if the court overturns bans. Meanwhile, theres been a series of planning sessions by groups that intend to explore religious objection responses to protect traditional marriage limited to heterosexuals.
Gay couples, such as Ethan Fletcher and Andrew Hickam of Cincinnati, are gearing up for a quick run to the courthouse in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee  the states involved in the cases that were argued in April before the justices. Theyre among 14 states that ban same-sex marriage, and if the high court rules in favor of gay marriage, it would apply nationally.
Fletcher, 31, a University of Cincinnati senior academic adviser, and Hickam, 30, a GE Aviation engineer, have arranged to take off work to get their license if the decision allows immediate same-sex marriages and will then plan a formal wedding. They became engaged nearly two years ago but decided against getting married in another state as long as there was the possibility they could do it at home.
Well, we live here and we pay taxes here and our families live here, said Fletcher, adding that they want his grandmother and Hickams mother to be able to attend. We didnt feel that it was reasonable for us to have to travel out of state for the freedom to marry.
In Hamilton County, where Cincinnati is located, the marriage license bureau said other courthouse staffers have been cross-trained and forms are available online to help speed the process. Court officials in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located, say theyre prepared to process triple the usual number of applications.
Probate Court Judge Jan Michael Long, of Pickaway County, near Columbus, said he and other probate judges met to discuss potential rulings and their impacts. There are a lot of procedural issues involving the need for gender-neutral wording and who gets legal notifications, he said, and it could be complicated depending on when the court ruling becomes effective and how its worded.
