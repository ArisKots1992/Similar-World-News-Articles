VIENNA - A senior U.S. official acknowledged Sunday that Iran nuclear talks will go past their June 30 target date, as Iran's foreign minister prepared to head home Sunday for consultations before returning to push for a breakthrough.
Iranian media said Mohammed Javad Zarif's trip was planned in advance. Still, the fact that he was leaving the talks so close to the Tuesday deadline reflected his need to get instructions on how to proceed on issues where the sides remain apart - among them how much access Tehran should give to U.N. experts monitoring his country's compliance to any deal.
The United States insists on more intrusive access than Iran is ready to give. With these and other disputes still unresolved the likelihood that the Tuesday target deadline for an Iran nuclear deal could slip was increasingly growing even before the U.S. confirmation.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Vienna again for the talks. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports Kerry is under pressure to deliver President Obama's chief foreign policy goal - a nuclear accord with Iran.
Several former Obama aides warned in a recent letter that the emerging deal "may fall short of meeting the administration's own standard of a 'good' agreement."
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius are currently in Vienna, and their Russian and British counterparts are to join later. China was sending a deputy foreign minister in a building diplomatic effort to wrap up the negotiations.
For weeks, all seven nations at the negotiating table insisted that Tuesday remains the formal deadline for a deal. But with time running out, a senior U.S. official acknowledged that was unrealistic.
"Given the dates, and that we have some work to do ... the parties are planning to remain in Vienna beyond June 30 to continue working," said the official, who demanded anonymity in line with State Department practice.
Asked about the chances for a deal, Federica Mogherini, the European Union's top diplomat, told reporters: "It's going to be tough ... but not impossible."
Steinmeier avoided reporters but told German media earlier: "I am convinced that if there is no agreement, everyone loses."
"Iran would remain isolated. A new arms race in a region that is already riven by conflict could be the dramatic consequence."
Both sides recognize that there is leeway to extend to July 9. As part of an agreement with the U.S. Congress, lawmakers then have 30 days to review the deal before suspending congressional sanctions.
But postponement beyond that would double the congressional review period to 60 days, giving both Iranian and U.S. critics more time to work on undermining an agreement.
Arguing for more time to allow the U.S. to drive a harder bargain, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - a fierce opponent of the talks - weighed in on Sunday against "this bad agreement, which is becoming worse by the day."
"It is still not too late to go back and insist on demands that will genuinely deny Iran the ability to arm itself with nuclear weapons," he said.
The goal of the talks involving Iran and the U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia is a deal that would crimp Tehran's capacity to make nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief.  Iran insists it does not want such arms but is bargaining in exchange for sanctions relief
On Saturday, diplomats told The Associated Press that Iran was considering a U.S.-backed plan for it to send enriched uranium to another country for sale as reactor fuel, a step that would resolve one of several outstanding issues.

        <Description>Greece's European partners debate whether or not to let the country's banks run out of cash after new prime minister threw bailout negations into turmoil</Description>
        <MainBody>Greece says it will not be able to make the 1.7 billion dollars in payments it owes this month as it tries to strike a deal with lenders. CBS New...
Parliament approved Tsipras' referendum call early Sunday, with the national vote set for July 5.
The ECB has said it can only continue its current assistance if the banks are basically solvent. A failure by Greece's government to get more aid before its bailout ends Tuesday and a big payment to the International Monetary Fund is due could prompt the ECB to decide the Greek banks are not financially solid any more.
Capping the aid would quickly force Greek banks to limit withdrawals - but such controls could take Greece a step closer to leaving the 19-nation eurozone.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said it's up to elected officials to decide Greece's fate . Analysts say the central bank wants to give politicians every chance to negotiate a deal.
Two opinion polls indicate most Greeks want to keep using the shared euro currency and would prefer a deal with Greece's European partners rather than a rupture.
The polls published Sunday were both conducted before Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared early Saturday that he was calling a referendum on financial proposals made by Greece's creditors in return for continuing to fund the country with bailout loans. Still, they provide an indication of public sentiment.
In the poll by Alco for the Proto Thema Sunday paper, 57 percent said they believed Greece should make a deal with its EU partners while 29 percent wanted a rupture. A separate poll by Kapa Research for the To Vima newspaper found 47.2 percent of respondents would vote in favor of a new, painful agreement with Greece's creditors, compared to 33 percent who would vote no and 18.4 percent undecided.
Both nationwide polls were conducted from June 24-26. The Alco poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percent while Kapa Research's was 3.09 percent.

TAIPEI, Taiwan - A fire on a music stage spread into a crowd of spectators at a party Saturday night at a Taiwan water park, injuring about 500 people, including 141 in serious condition, authorities said.
The fire was sparked by an accidental explosion of an unknown powder that was fired from a stage in front of about 1,000 people, said Wang Wei-sheng, a liaison with the New Taipei City fire department command center.
Taiwan's Central News Agency on Sunday reported 474 have been injured, including 141 in serious condition. It quoted the New Taipei City health bureau. The injured included four mainland Chinese and two foreigners. Other news sources put the injured count at over 500.
The fire erupted at the Formosa Water Park in New Taipei City near the island's capital and was quickly brought under control.
Video showed rescue workers and bystanders carrying burned and injured people on their backs, in inflatable boats and on stretchers to get medical treatment.

CNA reported witnesses as saying the fire spread quickly after the colored powder was blown into the air.
It wasn't clear if the colored powder was part of a performance. The cause of the fire is being investigated.
The event manager and several park employees were detained and questioned after the incident, the BBC reports. There are also reports of at least one person arrested for looting among the victims.
Taiwan News reports the the company owner in charge of the show, Lu Chung-ji, offered a public apology following the incident, and said he takes responsibility.

        <Description>Gay rights advocates worldwide hope U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in favor of same-sex marriage will help their cause</Description>
        <MainBody>As the Supreme Court says "I do" to gay marriage, we take a look back at the legal battles, tragedies, and personal bravery that brought the LGBT...
In other countries where gay sex is treated as a crime, beleaguered activists said they took heart from the U.S. ruling even though same-sex marriage is not on the horizon. In most cases, activists seek to decriminalize homosexuality before pressing for marriage rights and other benefits.
In the deeply conservative Arab world, where homosexuality is regarded as a crime in many countries, some clerics warned that the U.S. ruling would lead to the collapse of civilizations.
In Jordan, where homosexuality is not illegal but is considered taboo, one member of the small gay community said the U.S. ruling is "a victory for human rights in general and gives everyone hope."
He is hopeful same-sex marriage will one day be legal in Jordan.
"In this region, we are going through the dark ages, and when we come out, we will move toward full rights," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he feared the consequences of being identified as gay.
Marriage equality is also not part of the conversation in many parts of Africa, where more than two-thirds of the countries treat homosexuality as a crime.
That is true of Cameroon, which has pursued dozens of prosecutions in recent years under an anti-gay law imposing up to five years in prison for same-sex acts.
Lambert Lamba, a leading Cameroonian activist who has been imprisoned on accusations of violating anti-gay laws, said he was "exulting" in the U.S. ruling.
"It's a giant step for the fight in the United States," he said. "And it confirms for me that we can take giant steps in Cameroon as well."

He also wants all financial sanctions on Iran to be lifted immediately, not gradually as the U.S. has proposed.
There's pressure at home, too. Several former Obama aides warned in a recent letter that the emerging deal "may fall short of meeting the administration's own standard of a 'good' agreement."
James Jeffrey, the president's former ambassador to Iraq, signed that letter.
"We are worried that the administration is going to do a rush to signature and essentially cave to the supreme leader's most recent and absurd red lines," Jeffrey told CBS News.

        <Description>Investigators looking into what truck driver with history of radical Islamic ties did with the photo</Description>
        <MainBody>Yassine Salhi was arrested in France Friday, accused of beheading his boss and trying to cause an explosion at a plant. CBS News correspondent Ma...
One of the officials said the selfie was forwarded via WhatsApp, the globally popular instant messaging system owned by Facebook, to a phone number in Canada. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.
No group immediately claimed responsibility. The severed head appeared to mimic ISIS' practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads for all to see, and came days after the militants urged attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. French authorities say Salhi had links to radical Salafists in the past.
Paris prosecutor's office spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said the leading suspect began speaking with investigators after first refusing to do so. She declined to provide details, but said investigators haven't found any foreign connection.
The site of the beheading wasn't yet known to investigators, and the victim had been strangled beforehand, she said.
A fourth person arrested Friday was released without being charged. Under French anti-terrorism laws, Salhi and the women can be held up to four days before either being released or handed preliminary charges and locked up.

President Francois Hollande's office said he will convene a meeting with top parliamentary leaders about the matter on Tuesday.
Separately on Saturday, hundreds of people turned out in the region to honor slain businessman Herve Cornara and denounce the violence. Dozens turned out for a minute of silence in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, the town southeast of Lyon where Friday's attack took place at an Air Products chemicals warehouse.
Several hundred people also gathered outside a housing project in the town of Fontaines-sur-Saone to honor Cornara, 54, the manager of a transportation company that had employed Salhi since March. They recalled a kind, humble man who was active in the community of the Lyon suburb.
"He lived on the fifth floor, me on the fourth. He spoke with all the young people in the neighborhood. He didn't differentiate between (non-Muslim) French and Muslims," said Leila Bouri, a 24-year-old cafeteria cashier. "If you ever had a problem, you would go see him."
"When I heard this, I was shocked. It's shameful," she said. "I am a Muslim, but you can't kill like this. It's not who we are. In Islam, we're not told to slit throats. We only slit the throats of sheep. You don't slit the throats of people."
The suspected killer, she added, "isn't a Muslim in my opinion."

Is Tunisia the next hotbed of terror activity?
Shares
After an attack at a Tunisian beach resort left at least 39 people dead -- many of them western tourists -- the world is once again focusing on the country as a hotbed of terrorist activity.
"In Tunisia, you have the problem that you have terrorist groups and operatives operating in a country that has been relatively stable compared to its neighbors," CBS News senior national security analyst Juan Zarate said, contrasting Tunisia from Libya and Egypt as a "bright spot" in the wake of the Arab Spring.
Tunisia is the only country in the region to have built a democratic system after the revolutions that rocked the Middle East and North Africa.
There have been a string of terror attacks overseas that have left over 60 dead and hundreds injured. In France, a man with a history of radical ...
"But the reality is they've been facing a growing sense of terrorist threat and dread," Zarate added. "You've seen these episodes of attacks, and certainly what you're seeing here is, I think, another episode where terrorists are trying to impose themselves either from the outside of Tunisia or taking advantage of terrorist operatives that are operating there in Tunisia."
An ISIS Twitter account claimed responsibility for the attack in Sousse , posting a photograph of the gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui, a Tunisian student who was later shot dead by security forces.
The country is no stranger to terror attacks. In March, gunmen at the national museum killed 22 people near the parliament building in Tunis. In 2013, the city of Sousse was also the site of a failed suicide bomber attack.
Tunisia Prime Minister Habib Essid announced Saturday that his administration would toughen security measures, including closing mosques known for embracing extremist ideologies and calling up army reservists.

"The fight against terrorism is a national responsibility," Essid, who came under fire in March after the national museum massacre exposed governmental security weaknesses , said at a press conference early Saturday. "We are at war against terrorism which represents a serious danger to national unity during this delicate period that the nation is going through."
Zarate, who served as the deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under President George W. Bush, isn't surprised that the terror attack struck a western target in the Tunisian city. He notes that the mass assault was specifically "trying to hit western tourists."

"The fight against terrorism is a national responsibility," said a visibly exhausted Habib Essid at a press conference in Tunis early Saturday. "We are at war against terrorism which represents a serious danger to national unity during this delicate period that the nation is going through."
He announced a string of tough measures to fight extremism, including examining the funding of organizations suspected of promoting radicalism, closing some 80 mosques outside government control and declaring certain mountainous zones military areas.
At the Imperial Marhaba Hotel where the attack took place, vans and buses were carrying away tourists on Saturday. While the hotel was not actually closing down, the tour operators had urged everyone to leave, the director said.
"We may have zero clients today but we will keep our staff," said Mohammed Becheur, adding the 370-room hotel had been at 75 percent occupancy before the attack.

Tourism is a key part of Tunisia's economy and had already fallen some 25 percent after a terrorist attack on the national museum in the capital Tunis that killed 22 people in March.
"It's really sad but what can you do, for everyone, for the tourists, for the people who died, for their families," said Belgian tourist Clause Besser, as he recovered in the hospital from a gunshot wound he received fleeing from the attacker. "For me, somehow, with a bullet in the leg, it's not a catastrophe. For those who died or were injured for life, it's something else."
British travel companies Thomson and First Choice said they are flying back thousands of tourists from Tunisia Saturday and are canceling all flights to the country in the coming week. Tourist flights from Ireland to Tunisia have continued in the wake of the attack, but travel agents are offering full refunds for those canceling. Slovakia has sent a plane to evacuate some 150 of its citizens who are currently in Tunisia, according to the Foreign Ministry, and Scandinavian tour operators have stopped all flights to the North African country for the rest of the season.
"We felt a bit scared because Sousse isn't that far away, it's only 40-50 kilometers (25-30 miles) from where we stayed," said Kathrin Scheider as she waited in line to check in to her flight out of the country at the Hammamet airport near Sousse. "We felt quite safe during the whole holiday, but as soon as we heard, we were quite happy to leave because you don't feel that safe anymore if something happens like that."
The Tunisian Ministry of Health has confirmed the nationalities of 10 of the 39 victims of the attack , including eight Britons, a Belgian and a German. The government of Ireland said an Irish nurse was also among those who were killed.
Relatives and family friends say Lorna Carty was fatally shot as she sunbathed. She and her husband, Declan, had received the holiday as a present to help Declan Carty relax following his recent heart surgery. Family friends speaking to the couple's two children said Lorna Carty went ahead of her husband to the beach, where she suffered fatal gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead in hospital.

        <MainBody>The U.S. women's soccer team pursuing World Cup glory...
Despite missing midfielders Megan Rapinoe and Lauren Holiday, who were suspended for yellow card accumulation, the U.S. managed a more attacking attitude and extended its unbeaten streak against China to 25 matches dating to 2003.
"I think it was a highly energized performance," U.S. coach Jill Ellis said. "I thought we took care of the ball well, still created a lot of opportunities. So, yeah, we're really pleased."
Morgan Brian replaced Holiday in the middle of field, with Tobin Heath and Kelley O'Hara -- making her first start since March -- the flanks. Amy Rodriguez started up top with Alex Morgan, injecting more pace, while Abby Wambach did not enter until the 86th minute.
Wearing the captain's armband, Lloyd got the breakthrough with her 65th goal in 200 international appearances. Julie Johnston lofted a long ball into the penalty area and Lloyd met it with her head 10 yards from the goal line and bounced the ball off the artificial turf and past goalkeeper Fei Wang. That brought cheers from the overwhelmingly pro-American crowd of 24,141 at Lansdowne Stadium.
"These are the moments I live for," Lloyd said after the game, CBSSports.com's Sean Wagner-McGough reported .
Before that, the best American chance was by Johnston in the 26th minute that was cleared in front of an open net by defender Li Dongna. Johnston also had a header off a corner kick in the 31st minute that popped over the crossbar.
Brian had a chance to double the lead in the 73rd, but her long strike hit a post, and Lloyd missed high on the rebound.
The U.S. had a 17-6 advantage in shots and its offense was less stagnant than in the round-of-16 win over Colombia. The American face a considerable challenge in Germany, which lost to Japan in overtime in the 2011 quarterfinals.
"The U.S. only netted one goal, but it finally played a game that resembled a top team in top form," Wagner-McGough wrote after the game. "The passing was crisper, the runs were more dangerous, and multiple goals were just inches away from materializing. For a U.S. team that has struggled so much on offense, the way in which it played has to give it confidence moving forward."
Germany advanced earlier by beating France 5-4 on penalty kicks after a 1-1 tie. The United States has an 18-4-7 overall record against the Germans, including a 3-2 advantage in World Cup matches.
In Saturday's quarterfinals, host Canada faces England and Australia plays defending champion Japan.

SOUSSE, Tunisia -- A young man pulled a Kalashnikov from a beach umbrella and sprayed gunfire at European sunbathers at a Tunisian resort, killing at least 37 people - one of three deadly attacks Friday from Europe to North Africa to the Middle East that followed a call to violence by Islamic State extremists.
The Health Ministry said among  the 37 dead included Tunisians, British, Germans and Belgians, without giving a breakdown.

The Irish Times reports one of the victims was an Irish national, Lorna Carty, a nurse on vacation with her husband. The Times reports she had traveled to Tunisia with her husband after he gave her the trip as a present. He had recently underwent heart surgery. She has two children, Hazel, 18, and Simon, 21.
In a statement Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charles Flanagan, confirmed the death of an Irish citizen.
"I condemn unreservedly the terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and France today. Sadly, I can confirm that an Irish citizen has been killed in the attack in Sousse , Tunisia," he said.
Others began Tweeting about missing family members who they said had been in Tunisia at the time of the attack, but hadn't been heard from.

British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond says at least five Britons were killed but expected to toll to rise because a high proportion of the dead were believed to be British.
Heroes also began to emerge in the midst of such devastation. The BBC reports , a Welsh tourist used his body as a shield to protect his Fianc when the shooting on the beach began. Saera Wilson, 26, the Fianc of gas engineer Matthew James, 30, said he is alive, but his pelvis is shattered after being shot three times.
The shootings in the Tunisian resort of Sousse happened at about the same time as a bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a U.S.-owned factory in France that included a beheading. It was unclear if the violence was linked but it came days after the IS militants urged their followers "to make Ramadan a month of calamities for the nonbelievers." In all, the assailants killed at least 65 people.

The attack in Tunisia, the country's worst ever, comes just months after the March 18 massacre at the national Bardo museum in Tunis that killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, and has called into question the newly elected government's ability to protect the country.
"Once again, cowardly and traitorous hands have struck Tunisia, targeting its security and that of its children and visitors," President Beji Caid Essebsi told reporters at the RIU Imperial Marhaba hotel, near the beach rampage site.
Essebsi promised "painful but necessary" measures, adding: "No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries."
British tourist Gary Pine told AP he was on the beach with his wife around noon when heard the shooting. They shouted for their son to get out of the water, grabbed their bag and ran for the hotel. Their son told them he saw someone shot on the beach.

There was "sheer panic" at the hotel, Pine said. "There were a lot of concerned people, a few people in tears with panic and a few people - older guests - they'd turned their ankles or there was a few little minor injuries and nicks and scrapes."
Elizabeth O'Brien, an Irish tourist who was with her two sons, told Irish Radio she was on the beach when the shooting began.
"I thought, 'Oh my God. It sounds like gunfire,' so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things" before fleeing to their hotel room, she said.
The FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin Friday warning of attacks against law enforcement officers and the military during the July 4th holiday.

"We must recognize that there are real lessons to be learned from the tragedy in Benghazi," he said. "Namely, we need to know in advance who is likely to take power or vie for it once a dictator is toppled."
Doug Wilson, who serves as O'Malley's senior foreign policy adviser and chair of the board of advisers at Truman, told reporters following O'Malley's remarks that the speech was not meant as a criticism of Hillary Clinton. Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the presidential race, voted for the Iraq invasion as a senator and has been accused of mishandling the Benghazi attack during her tenure as Secretary of State.
"You see no mention of any candidates names in what he had to say," Wilson said. "You see only a mention of what he thinks this country needs to do in order to have a better shot at succeeding around the world."
He also defended the former Baltimore mayor and governor of Maryland's foreign policy experience.
"This governor has traveled. He has met with foreign leaders," he said, mentioning that O'Malley has met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "He has also met with leaders on regional and local levels and in civil society on his travels he believes these are people who are going to have influence on policies in their countries for a long time to come."
O'Malley's emphasis on partnerships runs through his entire vision of American foreign policy. He has called for more engagement around the world, in terms of national defense but also to combat what he calls "21st century challenges" like climate change and cyberterrorism.
"After 12 years on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan," he said, "it is understandable that many Americans would like to disengage from the world. Understandable, but not responsible."

        <MainBody>Dozens killed after gunman opens fire on tourists in a Tunisian tourist resort town
The killings in the Tunisian resort of Sousse happened at about the same time as a bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a U.S.-owned factory in France that included a beheadin g. It was unclear if the violence was linked but it came days after ISIS militants urged their followers "to make Ramadan a month of calamities for the nonbelievers." In all, at least 67 people were killed.
The SITE Intelligence Group reported later that the IS claimed credit for the Tunisia attack on its Twitter account and identified the gunman as Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani.
The attack in Tunisia, the country's worst ever, comes just months after the March 18 assault on the national Bardo museum in Tunis that killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, and has called into question the newly elected government's ability to protect the country.
"Once again, cowardly and traitorous hands have struck Tunisia, targeting its security and that of its children and visitors," President Beji Caid Essebsi told reporters at the RIU Imperial Marhaba hotel, near the beach rampage site.
Essebsi promised "painful but necessary" measures, adding: "No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries."
Rafik Chelli, the secretary of state of the Interior Ministry, told The Associated Press that the attack was carried out by a young student not previously known to authorities. The shooting spree ended when he was shot to death by police.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at the Shiite mosque in Kuwait City that killed at least 27 people and wounded scores of other worshippers at midday prayers - the first such attack in the mostly quiet and relatively secure Gulf Arab nation in more than two decades.
In southeastern France, a man with ties to Islamic radicals rammed a car into a gas factory, touching off an explosion that injured two people. Authorities arriving at the site made a grisly discovery: the severed head of the driver's employer was found hanging at the plant entrance.
The suspect, Yassine Salhi, was seized by an alert firefighter, authorities said, and French President Francois Hollande said the attacker's intention had been to cause an explosion. A security alert for the southeast region was raised to its highest level for the next three days, and the U.S. Embassy in Paris warned American citizens to be vigilant.
In an audio recording released Tuesday, ISIS called on its supporters to increase attacks during Ramadan and "be keen on waging invasion in this eminent month and commit martyrdom."
