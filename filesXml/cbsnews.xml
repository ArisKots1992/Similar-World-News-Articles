TOKYO -- The world's oldest man, a retired educator from Japan, has died at the age of 112, an official said Tuesday.
Sakari Momoi died from kidney failure Sunday at a nursing home in Tokyo, said Saitama city official Aya Kato.
Momoi was born Feb. 5, 1903, in northern Japan's Fukushima prefecture, where he became a teacher. He later moved to Saitama, north of Tokyo, and served as a high school principal until retirement.
Momoi, who enjoyed Chinese poetry and drawing, was certified by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest man in August 2014, when he was 111.
Another Japanese man, 112-year-old Yasutaro Koide of Nagoya, succeeds Momoi as the world's oldest man, according to the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group. Koide was born March 13, 1903.
One of the world's fastest-aging countries, Japan has about 54,000 centenarians.
The world's oldest person is Susannah Mushatt Jones of Brooklyn, New York, who celebrated her 116th birthday on Monday.

VIENNA - A senior U.S. official acknowledged Sunday that Iran nuclear talks will go past their June 30 target date, as Iran's foreign minister prepared to head home Sunday for consultations before returning to push for a breakthrough.
Iranian media said Mohammed Javad Zarif's trip was planned in advance. Still, the fact that he was leaving the talks so close to the Tuesday deadline reflected his need to get instructions on how to proceed on issues where the sides remain apart - among them how much access Tehran should give to U.N. experts monitoring his country's compliance to any deal.
The United States insists on more intrusive access than Iran is ready to give. With these and other disputes still unresolved the likelihood that the Tuesday target deadline for an Iran nuclear deal could slip was increasingly growing even before the U.S. confirmation.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Vienna again for the talks. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports Kerry is under pressure to deliver President Obama's chief foreign policy goal - a nuclear accord with Iran.
Several former Obama aides warned in a recent letter that the emerging deal "may fall short of meeting the administration's own standard of a 'good' agreement."
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius are currently in Vienna, and their Russian and British counterparts are to join later. China was sending a deputy foreign minister in a building diplomatic effort to wrap up the negotiations.
For weeks, all seven nations at the negotiating table insisted that Tuesday remains the formal deadline for a deal. But with time running out, a senior U.S. official acknowledged that was unrealistic.
"Given the dates, and that we have some work to do ... the parties are planning to remain in Vienna beyond June 30 to continue working," said the official, who demanded anonymity in line with State Department practice.
Asked about the chances for a deal, Federica Mogherini, the European Union's top diplomat, told reporters: "It's going to be tough ... but not impossible."
Steinmeier avoided reporters but told German media earlier: "I am convinced that if there is no agreement, everyone loses."
"Iran would remain isolated. A new arms race in a region that is already riven by conflict could be the dramatic consequence."
Both sides recognize that there is leeway to extend to July 9. As part of an agreement with the U.S. Congress, lawmakers then have 30 days to review the deal before suspending congressional sanctions.
But postponement beyond that would double the congressional review period to 60 days, giving both Iranian and U.S. critics more time to work on undermining an agreement.
Arguing for more time to allow the U.S. to drive a harder bargain, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - a fierce opponent of the talks - weighed in on Sunday against "this bad agreement, which is becoming worse by the day."
"It is still not too late to go back and insist on demands that will genuinely deny Iran the ability to arm itself with nuclear weapons," he said.
The goal of the talks involving Iran and the U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia is a deal that would crimp Tehran's capacity to make nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief.  Iran insists it does not want such arms but is bargaining in exchange for sanctions relief
On Saturday, diplomats told The Associated Press that Iran was considering a U.S.-backed plan for it to send enriched uranium to another country for sale as reactor fuel, a step that would resolve one of several outstanding issues.

        <title>Prosecutors announce prison wishes for ex-Nazi guard</title>
        <Link>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/prosecutors-3-years-former-nazi-guard-oskar-groening/</Link>
        <Description>Oskar Groening, 94, should be convicted of 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his Auschwitz role, prosecutors say; verdict expected this month</Description>
        <MainBody>BERLIN - German prosecutors are asking for 3.5 years in prison for a 94-year-old former SS sergeant who served at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
Oskar Groening has admitted guarding prisoners' baggage after they were unloaded from cattle cars onto the camp's ramps, and collecting and counting money stolen from the new arrivals and sending it to Berlin.
The dpa news agency reported prosecutors said in closing arguments Tuesday that his role helped the camp function, and he should be convicted of 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for those killed while he was there.
When his trial began in April, Groening said he felt moral guilt but it was up to the court to decide if he was legally guilty of a crime.
A verdict is expected this month.
Groening has told the Lueneburg state court in a statement read by his attorney that it was hard today to understand the blind obedience he had to the Nazi system even when witnessing the terrible atrocities perpetrated at the death camp in German-occupied Poland.
"There was a self-denial in me that today I find impossible to explain," Groening said, the dpa news agency reported. "Perhaps it was also the convenience of obedience with which we were brought up, which allowed no contradiction. This indoctrinated obedience prevented registering the daily atrocities as such and rebelling against them."

In his statement, Groening said even though he had known what was going on at Auschwitz, the personal stories of the co-plaintiffs during the trial had brought home the enormity of the atrocities.
"I can only ask my God for forgiveness," he said.

        <title>Nervous Greeks crowd ATMs awaiting ECB decision</title>

        <Description>Greece's European partners debate whether or not to let the country's banks run out of cash after new prime minister threw bailout negations into turmoil</Description>
        <MainBody>Greece says it will not be able to make the 1.7 billion dollars in payments it owes this month as it tries to strike a deal with lenders. CBS New...
Parliament approved Tsipras' referendum call early Sunday, with the national vote set for July 5.
The ECB has said it can only continue its current assistance if the banks are basically solvent. A failure by Greece's government to get more aid before its bailout ends Tuesday and a big payment to the International Monetary Fund is due could prompt the ECB to decide the Greek banks are not financially solid any more.
Capping the aid would quickly force Greek banks to limit withdrawals - but such controls could take Greece a step closer to leaving the 19-nation eurozone.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said it's up to elected officials to decide Greece's fate . Analysts say the central bank wants to give politicians every chance to negotiate a deal.
Two opinion polls indicate most Greeks want to keep using the shared euro currency and would prefer a deal with Greece's European partners rather than a rupture.
The polls published Sunday were both conducted before Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared early Saturday that he was calling a referendum on financial proposals made by Greece's creditors in return for continuing to fund the country with bailout loans. Still, they provide an indication of public sentiment.
In the poll by Alco for the Proto Thema Sunday paper, 57 percent said they believed Greece should make a deal with its EU partners while 29 percent wanted a rupture. A separate poll by Kapa Research for the To Vima newspaper found 47.2 percent of respondents would vote in favor of a new, painful agreement with Greece's creditors, compared to 33 percent who would vote no and 18.4 percent undecided.
Both nationwide polls were conducted from June 24-26. The Alco poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percent while Kapa Research's was 3.09 percent.

        <title>Explosives, detonators stolen from French military</title>

        <Description>"Professional" theft comes as France remains on high alert due to recent terrorist attacks</Description>
        <MainBody>More +
PARIS -- French authorities are investigating the theft of roughly 200 detonators plus grenades and plastic explosives from a munitions depot in southeastern France.
The thefts at the Miramas site, which is operated by a combination of military services west of Marseille, appeared to have occurred overnight from Sunday to Monday. The break-in comes as France has strengthened its security measures after two deadly attacks by extremists this year.
Top French security and defense officials were meeting Tuesday about the theft. A gendarmerie official said the thief or thieves appeared to have cut through a fence to enter the high-security depot. He was not authorized to speak publicly because the operation is ongoing.
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said in a statement that an investigation has started on charges of "theft with break-in carried out by a criminal group" and "fraudulent entry into a military compound."
Mayor Frederic Vigouroux of Miramas told the BFM television network the theft appeared to be "very professional."
Vigouroux told the AP he did not know precisely what was stolen, but said it was the first theft at the site. He said the outer fences were broken into, and that nine storehouses were affected.
"It wasn't cotton candy that was stolen," he said. "These are dangerous munitions. Everything is inherently dangerous."
CBS Radio News correspondent Elaine Cobbe reports that French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has ordered a security review on military weapons depots following the heist at the site, which doesn't utilize any security cameras.
Cobbe reports that no one has suggested the heist is terror related, and nearby Marseille is a hotbed of violent gang crime.
However, the theft comes at a time when France is on a high level of alert for terrorism in the wake of recent attacks .

TAIPEI, Taiwan - A fire on a music stage spread into a crowd of spectators at a party Saturday night at a Taiwan water park, injuring about 500 people, including 141 in serious condition, authorities said.
The fire was sparked by an accidental explosion of an unknown powder that was fired from a stage in front of about 1,000 people, said Wang Wei-sheng, a liaison with the New Taipei City fire department command center.
Taiwan's Central News Agency on Sunday reported 474 have been injured, including 141 in serious condition. It quoted the New Taipei City health bureau. The injured included four mainland Chinese and two foreigners. Other news sources put the injured count at over 500.
The fire erupted at the Formosa Water Park in New Taipei City near the island's capital and was quickly brought under control.
Video showed rescue workers and bystanders carrying burned and injured people on their backs, in inflatable boats and on stretchers to get medical treatment.

CNA reported witnesses as saying the fire spread quickly after the colored powder was blown into the air.
It wasn't clear if the colored powder was part of a performance. The cause of the fire is being investigated.
The event manager and several park employees were detained and questioned after the incident, the BBC reports. There are also reports of at least one person arrested for looting among the victims.
Taiwan News reports the the company owner in charge of the show, Lu Chung-ji, offered a public apology following the incident, and said he takes responsibility.

        <Description>10 days after Beijing said land reclamation in disputed South China Sea territory was near complete, local mayor sees "full-blast construction"</Description>
        <MainBody>There are growing tensions between China, its neighbors and the U.S. over disputed waters in the South China Sea. The Chinese military is racing ...
CBS News correspondent Seth Doane was on the Philippines' Pag-Asa Island earlier this month, where he reported that the Chinese have filled in enough of the South China Sea to create 2,000 acres of artificial islands in just the last 18 months.
In the mid-portion of the emerging island, a 1.9-mile-long landfill is taking the shape of a runway, Bito-onon said.
His comments followed similar findings by the U.S. military and independent defense analysts.
Two senior Philippine military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to the media, said that aside from Subi Reef, China's island-building has also continued on Mischief Reef, also in the Spratlys, based on recent military surveillance.
Chinese Embassy officials in Manila did not comment immediately.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on June 16 that the land reclamation projects on some islands and reefs "will be completed in upcoming days." However, in a sign that the developments were far from over, the ministry also said on its website that China would follow up by building infrastructure for operations ranging from maritime search and rescue to environmental conservation and scientific research.
The U.S. and the Philippines, its defense treaty ally, have expressed concern that China's island-building on at least half a dozen features in the South China Sea could be used for positioning military planes and navy ships to intimidate other claimants, reinforce China's claim over virtually the entire sea and threaten freedom of navigation in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in the statement that the projects "do not affect the freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in accordance with international law in the South China Sea."
A U.S. Navy plane flying near one of the artificial islands last month was told to leave the area by the Chinese military . In a separate incident, a Philippine air force plane was similarly ordered by the Chinese navy several weeks ago to leave the area. The incidents raised fears that China was preparing to enforce an air defense identification zone over the South China Sea, similar to one it declared over disputed Japanese-held islands in the East China Sea in 2013.
The U.S. argues that China can't use artificially constructed islands to expand its sovereignty. U.S. officials have said they were considering stepping up patrols to ensure free navigation in the contested region.

One person was found decapitated and two others injured Friday after an assailant -- with a possible accomplice -- drove a vehicle onto an industrial complex near the eastern city of Lyon and tried to blow up a gas factory.
An attack on a gas factory near the eastern city of Lyon left at least one person dead
"The intent was without doubt to cause an explosion. It was a terrorist attack," President Francois Hollande said at a news conference in Belgium.
The attack targeted a chemical factory in the town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, about 20 miles southeast of Lyon. The plant is owned by the U.S. firm Air Products .
Witnesses said a man drove into the forecourt of the gas supply company, spun his car around in the yard, reports CBS News' Elaine Cobbe. Then they heard an explosion and saw fire.
The slain victim's head was found yards away from the body, stuck on a perimeter fence, with Arabic writing on or near it. There were also flags or banners bearing Arabic writing found at the scene.
The newspaper Le Dauphine libere reports that the decapitated victim was the manager of a transport company who happened to be at the site for a delivery.
French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian declared the attack an "act of terrorism," and said the national Defense Council was to convene at the presidential Elyse Palace at 3 p.m. local time (9 a.m. Eastern).
CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports the factory was locked down along with other businesses in the area during the police investigation.

France Uber strike
French taxi drivers smashed cars, set tires ablaze and blocked traffic across the country on June 25, 2015 in a nationwide strike aimed at Uber after weeks of rising, sometimes violent tensions over the U.S. ride-hailing company's booking service, known in France as UberPOP. The angry taxi drivers say Uber's lowest cost service is taking their livelihood away.

During a strike by French taxi drivers on Thursday, June 25, 2015, travelers going to and from the airport walked alongside highways with their bags or got caught in ambushes, like U.S. singer Courtney Love, who was rescued by two men on a motorcycle.
"They've ambushed our car and are holding our driver hostage," Love tweeted. "They're beating the cars with metal bats. this is France- I'm safer in Baghdad."

        <Description>Defender Gonzalo Jara was caught trying to provoke Uruguay's Edinson Cavani to get a red card in the Copa America quarterfinals</Description>
        <MainBody>More +
SANTIAGO, Chile -- South American football officials will look into the actions of Chile defender Gonzalo Jara , who was caught on video poking Edinson Cavani's behind to provoke a red card in the Copa America quarterfinals.
Alberto Lozada, a member of CONMEBOL's disciplinary panel, said Thursday that the local governing body "will open an investigation" into Jara.
Cavani, Uruguay's top striker in the tournament, was sent off after the 63rd-minute provocation by Jara, and Chile went on to score the only goal on Wednesday, and reach the semifinals for the first time in 16 years.
Cavani slapped Jara in the face immediately after the Chilean put his hand on him, but the referee punished only Cavani, giving him a second yellow card. While the slap appeared to be light, Jara dropped to the ground with his hand to his face.
Cavani's first yellow was for complaining to the linesman in the 30th.
Uruguay captain Diego Godin said after the match that Cavani "reacted the way he did" only because of what Jara did.
The striker entered the match enduring a personal ordeal back in Uruguay, where his father was detained after allegedly driving drunk and being involved in an accident that killed a motorcyclist.
It wasn't the first time Jara was seen provoking another player. In 2013, Uruguay striker Luis Suarez was sent off from a World Cup qualifier for punching Jara in the face after a similar provocation from the Chilean.
If Jara has a hearing and is suspended, it could be costly for the hosts, who are trying to win the Copa for the first time. Chile will play either Peru or Bolivia in the semifinals.

        <Description>The State Department blasted the two nations, although attempts to improve relations with them are continuing</Description>
        <MainBody>Pamela Falk, CBS News Foreign Affairs Analyst, discusses the highest level U.S. delegation to Cuba in decades beginning two days of negotiations.
On Cuba, the human rights reports said the government continued to use threats and intimidation to suppress peaceful dissent in 2014. And they accused government officials of carrying out "most human rights abuses" at the direction of their superiors.
Although Cuba released 53 political prisoners as part of the normalization process with the United States, the reports noted that Cuban activists in 2014 had recorded the highest number of arbitrary arrests of dissidents in the past five years. And though the government in 2014 indicated it will expand internet and telecommunications access, it "continued to block its citizens' access to uncensored, independent information in general," the reports said.
Other Cuban rights abuses mentioned in the reports include the abridgement of the ability of citizens to change the government; use of government threats, extrajudicial physical assault, intimidation, violent government-organized counter-protests against peaceful dissent; and harassment and detentions to prevent free expression and peaceful assembly.
"Impunity for the perpetrators remained widespread," the reports said.

        <title>Noriega asks for Panama's forgiveness in jailhouse interview</title>
        <Link>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/manuel-noriega-panama-jailhouse-interview/</Link>
        <Description>Former dictator breaks long silence to ask compatriots to forgive military regime's actions that culminated in U.S. invasion</Description>
        <MainBody>More +
PANAMA CITY -- Former dictator Manuel Noriega broke a long silence to ask his compatriots on Wednesday to forgive actions by his military regime that culminated in the 1989 U.S. invasion.
Noriega began the brief jailhouse interview with local network Telemetro reading a handwritten statement in which he said his apology came after days of reflection with his family and members of the church.
He said he wasn't motivated by any personal interest but a sincere desire to bring closure to the military era, a dark chapter in Panama's history that left the country in ruin and hundreds dead.
"Before the altar of my conscience I've come to express myself in the spirit of forgiveness," Noriega said, his hand shaking but otherwise appearing in good health for his 81 years.
The onetime CIA informant hadn't spoken to a journalist since a 1996 interview with CNN's Larry King from a Miami federal prison, where following his capture by American troops he was sent for being a major conduit for Colombian cocaine traffickers.
After completing his sentence in the U.S., Noriega was extradited to France to serve time for money laundering. He returned to Panama in 2011 to complete a 60-year sentence for murder, corruption and embezzlement during the military's three-decade rule.
Referring to himself as the "last general of the military era," Noriega apologized to those "offended, affected, injured or humiliated" by his own actions or those of his superiors and subordinates during the regime that he began serving as a low-ranking officer in the 1960s.
He didn't comment on any specific abuses and refused to take the bait when pressed about whether his act of contrition involved clarifying the still murky circumstances that led to the disappearance and murder of two prominent opponents.
Saying he was "totally at peace" with himself, Noriega said he didn't want to distract from the "solemnity" of his statement.
Reaction among Panamanians was mixed.
Many on social media saw the apology as a surprising capitulation from the famously stubborn strongman, who lost his apparent interest and power to influence Panamanian politics years ago.
But others judged it as a sly move to pave the way for a presidential pardon or for him to finish his sentence under house arrest, something his lawyers have been seeking on medical grounds for years. Indeed, he prefaced his written statement with a brief protest against what he said were excessively long sentences imposed by Panamanian courts in absentia.
"The problem with Noriega is you can never distinguish between what's true or not," said R.M. Koster, an American novelist and biographer of Noriega who has lived in Panama for decades.

        <title>U.S. same-sex marriage ruling could have global impact</title>
        <Link>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling-could-have-global-impact/</Link>
        <Description>Gay rights advocates worldwide hope U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in favor of same-sex marriage will help their cause</Description>
        <MainBody>As the Supreme Court says "I do" to gay marriage, we take a look back at the legal battles, tragedies, and personal bravery that brought the LGBT...
In other countries where gay sex is treated as a crime, beleaguered activists said they took heart from the U.S. ruling even though same-sex marriage is not on the horizon. In most cases, activists seek to decriminalize homosexuality before pressing for marriage rights and other benefits.
In the deeply conservative Arab world, where homosexuality is regarded as a crime in many countries, some clerics warned that the U.S. ruling would lead to the collapse of civilizations.
In Jordan, where homosexuality is not illegal but is considered taboo, one member of the small gay community said the U.S. ruling is "a victory for human rights in general and gives everyone hope."
He is hopeful same-sex marriage will one day be legal in Jordan.
"In this region, we are going through the dark ages, and when we come out, we will move toward full rights," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he feared the consequences of being identified as gay.
Marriage equality is also not part of the conversation in many parts of Africa, where more than two-thirds of the countries treat homosexuality as a crime.
That is true of Cameroon, which has pursued dozens of prosecutions in recent years under an anti-gay law imposing up to five years in prison for same-sex acts.
Lambert Lamba, a leading Cameroonian activist who has been imprisoned on accusations of violating anti-gay laws, said he was "exulting" in the U.S. ruling.
"It's a giant step for the fight in the United States," he said. "And it confirms for me that we can take giant steps in Cameroon as well."

        <MainBody>Coordinated bombings by Islamic extremists on Britain's biggest transport network leave 52 people dead
Four British men inspired by al Qaeda blew themselves up on three London subway trains and a bus during the morning rush hour on July 7, 2005, killing 52 commuters. Last month's gun rampage in the Tunisian resort of Sousse was the deadliest attack on Britons since then.
The head of Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence agency said the country faced a "serious societal and security challenge" from "a tiny fraction of the population" willing to use violence against their fellow citizens.
MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the 2005 bombings "and other appalling acts are attempted by individuals who have grown up here but decided for whatever twisted reasons to identify their own country as the enemy."
"Ten years on from the 7/7 London attacks, the threat from terrorism continues to be as real as it is deadly," Cameron said in a statement.
He said Britain would continue to fight extremism, protect the public and promote "the shared values of tolerance, love and respect that make Britain so great."
Cameron will lay a wreath at a monument to 7/7 victims Tuesday before attending a memorial service at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the initial attack on the convoy. A NATO spokesman in Kabul, Col. Brian Tribus, confirmed the attack shortly before noon and said the coalition was gathering more information on the incident.
One of the wounded was an Afghan civilian while the second person was from the convoy, said Gen. Abdul Rahman Rahimi, the city's police chief who was at the scene of the blast. He did not elaborate.
In a text message to media, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the attack targeted a "foreign car."
U.S. and NATO combat troops pulled out of the country at the end of last year, leaving full security responsibility in the hands of Afghan forces. The coalition has remained in Afghanistan in a training and support role.
Since then, the Taliban have stepped up attacks targeting Afghan officials, soldiers and local security forces.

        <Description>Following referendum vote against deeper austerity cuts, no guarantees that Greece can secure infusion of cash to shore up flailing banks</Description>
        <MainBody>With the nation on the brink of default on its international loans, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum and the governmen...
In a sign of compromise, Tsipras appointed a new finance minister to lead talks with creditors and replace Yanis Varoufakis, who clashed with his European counterparts.
Euclid Tsakalotos, a 55-year-old economist, has appeared more willing to engage with creditors. He will be tested as soon as Tuesday, in Brussels.
"I won't hide from you that I am very nervous and very anxious. I am not taking over at the easiest moment in Greek history," Tsakalotos said after being sworn in.

Greek banks are running out of cash even after the government placed  limits on how much depositors can withdraw. The ECB has been providing  emergency credit to the banks, but on Monday said it could not increase  the amount offered because the banks' collateral was weaker now, after  the "no" vote.
Normal commerce is now impossible in Greece. Small businesses, lacking use of credit cards or money from bank accounts, were left to rely on cash coming from diminishing purchases from customers. But Greeks are holding tightly onto what cash they have. And suppliers are demanding that businesses pay cash up front.
In Paris, Merkel and Hollande both expressed respect for Greek voters, but urged swift action from Athens.
"I stress that there is not lots of time left. There is urgency for Greece. There is urgency for Europe," Hollande said.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said that if Greece is to remain part of the eurozone, it needs to enact reforms that will spur economic growth and pay off its debt.
"We're inclined to help Greece but Greece must follow Europe's rules," he said in an interview on Spain's Telecinco evening news program.
The ongoing Greek drama hurt stocks around the world, particularly in Europe. The losses were not as great as some had feared, however, suggesting investors think that a possible Greek exit from the euro would be manageable for the global economy, though devastating for Greece and destabilizing in Europe.
"The 'no' vote in Greece's referendum on Sunday dramatically increases the risk of a slide toward a disorderly Greek exit from the eurozone," ratings agency Fitch said. "An agreement between Greece and its official creditors remains possible, but time is short and the risk of policy missteps, or that the two sides simply cannot agree on a deal, is high."
Tsipras has agreed to imposing more harsh austerity measures, but he wants eurozone lenders to grant the country better terms for bailout debt repayments.
"The prime minister is ... committed to starting a fundamental debate on dealing with the problem of sustainability of the Greek national debt," a statement signed by the government and three pro-European opposition parties said in a rare sign of solidarity.
Greece, after years of crippling recession and spiraling unemployment, has already been granted 240 billion euros in loans from other eurozone countries. But the spending restraint demanded as a condition for the loans hurt economic growth, and reforms to make Greece more business-friendly have been slower than hoped.
European officials remain split on Greece's demand for easier debt repayment - with lead eurozone lender Germany still reluctant.
James Nixon, chief European economist at Oxford Economics, said there's "a narrow trajectory from here that sees an emboldened Greek parliament accepting the need for reform in return for a debt write-down."
"The next 48 hours will be crucial."

        <title>Iran nuke talks to drag on through 2nd deadline</title>
        <Link>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-nuclear-talks-deadline-iaea-access-military-sites-arms-embargo-kerry/</Link>
        <Description>Hours before diplomats hoped to have final agreement in place to reign in Tehran's atomic program, officials say it's going to take longer to clear hurdles</Description>
        <MainBody>Pamela Falk, CBS News Foreign Affairs Analyst, discusses the ongoing negotiations to reach a nuclear deal with Iran.
With time running out, Kerry brought the world powers together for the first time in three months. Their central goal remains elusive: convincing Iran to give international inspectors broad access to suspect nuclear sites, including those on military installations.
A top European official said Tuesday that the talks would continue after Tuesday night, but insisted that would not mean the deadline had been missed.
"We are continuing to negotiate for the next couple of days.This does not mean we are extending our deadline," European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.
"We are interpreting in a flexible way our deadline, which means that we are taking the time, the days we still need to finalize the agreement, which is something that is still possible even if now we are getting into the difficult time," Mogherini added.
Brennan reports Kerry is to remain in Vienna until Friday, but that he and his team were still very much hoping to get a deal signed for Congress to review in Washington by Thursday.
In exchange for oversight and parred-back enrichment activities, Iran  wants a battery of punishing economic sanctions levied during the last  decade by the international community lifted.
"Access is really important," explains Laura Rockwood, who wrote the access rules for inspectors during her time at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog.
"The IAEA should have access to military bases. They have access in other countries, at least 10 other countries... there's no exemption, no automatic exemption for access to a military location," Rockwood told Brennan.
Iran wants arms embargo dropped in nuke talks
If access to those key sites is limited, it would make it difficult to prove whether Iran is complying with any final deal the diplomats do reach.
Inside the IAEA in Vienna, new technology is being designed to make cheating on an inspection regime harder than ever: encrypted, real-time cameras are immune to hacking, 3-D laser sensors that register movement of equipment, and highly sensitive radiation detectors are all in the works.
U.S. officials also want to monitor what isn't visible, by questioning Iran's nuclear scientists about how much they know. But Iran is reluctant to make those individuals available because at least five top scientists have been mysteriously killed after their identities were revealed.
Former arms control negotiator Tarik Raouf said just because the U.S. demands it, doesn't mean Iran will comply.

ATHENS -- On Sunday, Greek voters said "no" to foreign creditors who demanded strict belt tightening in return for more loans. It was a win for national pride but, in victory, Greeks now confront banks critically short of money and a government can't pay its debts.
Roula Antonopoulou, a Greek pensioner, supported the "no" vote in Sunday's referendum.
CBS News
Greece is on the edge of a financial abyss , but last night there were celebrations after Greek voters rejected the demands of international creditors.
One of them was Roula Antonopoulou, a pensioner.
"At last we can stand up and say here we are, we have a strong voice, and you're going to listen to what we have to say too," she said.
In exchange for an extended $8 billion bailout, Greece's foreign creditors wanted the country to live within its means by increasing taxes and cutting pensions and public spending.

War encircles popular summer vacation spot in Syria

CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer traveled to Syria for a rare look at how the country's civil war is impacting its people and cities. Palmer filed this report from Latakia - one of the last remaining areas under full government control.
LATAKIA, Syria -- There are few places left in Syria where a "good shot" has nothing to do with guns, but instead, a score on a volleyball court.
Latakia, on the Mediterranean Sea, is one of the last cities in the country under full government control. If you're Syrian and you can afford it, this is where you come for your summer vacation -- and to block out Syria's vicious war , which is creeping ever closer.
Less than 50 miles away, extremist fighters took the city of Jisr al Shugour in May. Rebel groups now control large areas of countryside.

Only half an hour's drive out of Latakia we found one of the Syrian army posts holding the line. We weren't allowed to film their fighting positions, just the soldiers checking traffic for rebel sympathizers and weapons.
Beyond the Syrian government checkpoint is contested territory.  The Syrian military -- tired and overstretched -- doesn't like to admit it, but things are not going well. Over the past year they've lost ground to ISIS and a whole patchwork of extremist groups.

One man we met, Haeyk, has a family home in government territory. But he tells me his son's school -- just a mile away -- has fallen to the opposition.
"What would happen if you went there?" I asked him.
"Not a chance," he answered. "The snipers would get us."
Latakia's city center is still bustling with life, but everyone here, just like the people on the beach, is afraid that the little pockets of stability remaining are on borrowed time.
Latakia has an extra measure of protection because a majority of the people who live here are big supporters of President Bashar al-Assad and his government, so any rebel attack is bound to meet with ferocious resistance from the population.

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador -- Pope Francis has concluded the first mass of his Latin America trip in Quayaquil, Ecuador, where hundreds of thousands of faithful braved high temperatures and humidity in order to catch a glimpse of him. Guayaquil, Ecuador's major port city, is the nation's financial capital and its biggest city.

The area around the mass, held in a park outside Guayaquil, had a very festive atmosphere, with people selling hats, food and drinks, souvenirs and all kinds of head coverings.  Almost everyone wore a hat or carried an umbrella, due to the intense heat.  Entire families huddled under sheets or blankets to shield themselves.  People of all ages attended.  One father carried his one-month-old daughter in his arms, while his wife held their two small boys by hand; they said this event was too important for them to miss.
Pope Francis is known for doing things no other pope has done before; he's cracked down on abuse in the church; he's washed the feet of female pr...
The service was colorful, incorporating local music and traditions.  In his homily, the pope spoke about the value of the family, saying the family is the foundation of society, "the nearest hospital, the first school for the young, the best home for the elderly." He said the family is where we learn to forgive, even after fighting.
After the mass, Pope Francis heads to a Jesuit school nearby, where he'll spend time with Father Paquito, a 90-year-old Jesuit priest who is an old friend.  Then, he flies back to Quito for a courtesy visit with the President of Ecuador, and a prayer at the Quito Cathedral.
This is the Francis' second trip to Latin America as Pope.  He'll also visit Bolivia and Paraguay, and the entire trip will last 9 days.

        <MainBody>The U.S. women's soccer team pursuing World Cup glory...
Despite missing midfielders Megan Rapinoe and Lauren Holiday, who were suspended for yellow card accumulation, the U.S. managed a more attacking attitude and extended its unbeaten streak against China to 25 matches dating to 2003.
"I think it was a highly energized performance," U.S. coach Jill Ellis said. "I thought we took care of the ball well, still created a lot of opportunities. So, yeah, we're really pleased."
Morgan Brian replaced Holiday in the middle of field, with Tobin Heath and Kelley O'Hara -- making her first start since March -- the flanks. Amy Rodriguez started up top with Alex Morgan, injecting more pace, while Abby Wambach did not enter until the 86th minute.
Wearing the captain's armband, Lloyd got the breakthrough with her 65th goal in 200 international appearances. Julie Johnston lofted a long ball into the penalty area and Lloyd met it with her head 10 yards from the goal line and bounced the ball off the artificial turf and past goalkeeper Fei Wang. That brought cheers from the overwhelmingly pro-American crowd of 24,141 at Lansdowne Stadium.
"These are the moments I live for," Lloyd said after the game, CBSSports.com's Sean Wagner-McGough reported .
Before that, the best American chance was by Johnston in the 26th minute that was cleared in front of an open net by defender Li Dongna. Johnston also had a header off a corner kick in the 31st minute that popped over the crossbar.
Brian had a chance to double the lead in the 73rd, but her long strike hit a post, and Lloyd missed high on the rebound.
The U.S. had a 17-6 advantage in shots and its offense was less stagnant than in the round-of-16 win over Colombia. The American face a considerable challenge in Germany, which lost to Japan in overtime in the 2011 quarterfinals.
"The U.S. only netted one goal, but it finally played a game that resembled a top team in top form," Wagner-McGough wrote after the game. "The passing was crisper, the runs were more dangerous, and multiple goals were just inches away from materializing. For a U.S. team that has struggled so much on offense, the way in which it played has to give it confidence moving forward."
Germany advanced earlier by beating France 5-4 on penalty kicks after a 1-1 tie. The United States has an 18-4-7 overall record against the Germans, including a 3-2 advantage in World Cup matches.
In Saturday's quarterfinals, host Canada faces England and Australia plays defending champion Japan.

        <Description>Taxi drivers in France took to the streets to protest ride-sharing service, saying it is taking away their livelihood</Description>
        <MainBody>More +
PARIS - French taxi drivers smashed up livery cars, set tires ablaze and blocked traffic across the country on Thursday in a nationwide strike aimed at Uber after weeks of rising, sometimes violent tensions over the U.S. ride-hailing company.
Travelers going to and from the airport walked alongside highways with their bags or got caught in ambushes, like singer Courtney Love, who was rescued by two men on a motorcycle.
"They've ambushed our car and are holding our driver hostage," Love tweeted. "They're beating the cars with metal bats. this is France- I'm safer in Baghdad."
It wasn't immediately clear what type of car Love was riding in.
Taxi drivers are angry, saying Uber's lowest cost service is taking their livelihood away.
Despite repeated rulings against the low-cost UberPop service, its drivers continue to ply French roads and the American company is actively recruiting drivers and passengers alike. Uber claims to have a total of 400,000 customers a month in France.

Riot police chased strikers from Paris' ring road, where protesters torched tires in the middle of the roadway and swarmed onto exit ramps at rush hour.
Love, Kurt Cobain's widow, sent a litany of tweets on Thursday afternoon, including one to Kanye West suggesting she would have been better off staying at the airport with him. West later appeared at the Louis Vuitton menswear show, cool and calm.
She wrote: "paid some guys on motorcycles to sneak us out, got chased by a mob of taxi drivers who threw rocks, passed two police and they did nothing."
She later posted a selfie wearing a motorcycle helmet with her two smiling rescuers.
France's top security official said he had ordered an immediate ban on unlicensed services like UberPop in the Paris region but called for an end to violence against the service's drivers.
"We are calling for calm. We are in a state of law," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. "A state of law is not a state of violence."
Uber's more expensive livery service is still legal but a source of intense frustration for French taxi drivers, who pay tens of thousands of euros (dollars) for the equivalent of medallions and who face customer complaints that they are being resistant to changes such as credit cards and geolocation.
Taxi drivers complain that livery services like Uber unfairly undercut them and in recent weeks nearly 100 Uber drivers have been attacked, sometimes while carrying customers. One irritated taxi passenger was left with a broken face and black eye after he praised Uber.
"There are people who are willing to do anything to stop any competition," said Thomas Meister, a spokesman for Uber. "We are only the symptom of a badly organized market."

KARACHI, Pakistan - The devastating heat wave that struck southern Pakistan last weekend is slowly subsiding but the toll was still climbing Thursday,  a senior health official said.
While the Associated Press is reporting 860 confirmed deaths due to the heat, Reuters, citing government and hospital officials, reports more than 1,100 people have died since Saturday due to the searing heat.
Jam Mehtab Hussain, the provincial health minister in the southern Sindh province, said people were still being admitted to hospitals with heat-related ailments - though in smaller numbers than in previous days. Previously dehydrated patients lay in hospital corridors and outside on the streets as overwhelmed medical staff struggled to cope with the disaster.
Ahmad Kamal, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority, said authorities were providing free medical treatment to people in Karachi, the capital of Sindh province. He said the situation was improving due to lower temperatures .
The death toll from the recent heat wave in Pakistan continues to soar, even as temperatures cool
On Thursday, the temperature dropped to 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in Karachi from a high of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday.
TV footage showed ambulances transporting heatstroke patients to various hospitals in Karachi, where people continued holding small rallies against power outages, which had exacerbated the effects of the heat wave.
Weather pattern shift bringing more heat waves
The heat wave was the worst seen in the city since 1979, officials said, and came as Muslims were fasting from dawn to dusk for the holy month of Ramadan.
The drinking of even a single drop of water invalidates the fast, but Muslims are also encouraged not to fast if they are sick or if doing so would cause serious physical harm.

Mohammad Ayaz said he and other Karachi residents were struggling to stay cool, with hundreds of people sleeping outside because of long power cuts.
Wakil Ahmed, another resident, said the weather had improved from previous days, when it was so hot it became difficult to breathe. He said Thursday brought clouds and a slight breeze.
Karachi is home to some 20 million people and has long suffered from an inefficient power grid and a shortage of potable water.

MOSCOW - Russia needs a mighty military to fend off threats near its borders, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday, in a stance that reflects soaring tensions with the West over the crisis in Ukraine.
The Russian leader, whose approval ratings reached an all-time high this month despite a bruising recession, said a "powerful army equipped with modern weapons is the guarantor of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Russia."
Speaking at Thursday's Kremlin meeting with graduates of Russian military academies, Putin also vowed to continue a sweeping military modernization effort that envisions the purchase of large numbers of new weapons.
Despite the fact that oil-rich Russia is now in a recession, Putin's plan aims to spend 22 trillion rubles (over $400 billion) through 2020 to give the armed forces dozens of navy ships, hundreds of new planes and missiles and thousands of tanks and other weapons.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling on the U.S. to stop telling Russia what to do. Putin spoke at a business conference in Russia, which ...
Putin added that Russia has no aggressive intentions and aims to "settle any disputes exclusively by political means with respect to international law and interests of other nations."
Relations between Russia and the West have sunk to post-Cold War lows after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine.
The United States and the European Union have responded with sanctions that have sharply limited Russia's access to Western capital markets and curtailed the transfer of military and energy technologies.
Russia retaliated by banning the import of agricultural products from the EU, U.S., Australia, Canada and Norway. The Cabinet formally extended the ban by one year after the EU agreed this week to keep its sanctions in place through January.
Coupled with plummeting prices for oil, Western sanctions helped drive the Russian economy into recession, resulting in a drop in incomes for the first time since Putin took the helm in 2000. But despite the economic woes, Putin's popularity has soared.
The president's approval rating reached an all-time high of 89 percent this month, according to a nationwide poll conducted by the Levada Center, a leading independent opinion research firm. The survey, based on interviews with 1,600 people, had a margin of error of no more than 3.4 percentage points.
Many observers attribute the solid support for Putin to blanket positive coverage of his activities by state television stations and other Kremlin-controlled media that have described the Ukrainian crisis as part of Western efforts to weaken Russia.
Levada head Lev Gudkov called the TV propaganda as the main factor behind Putin's popularity.
"This is a very aggressive and false propaganda," he said. "All alternative channels, therefore all alternative points of view, assessments are pushed out of the public sphere."

"Ideally this culminates with integrated exercises with units from more and more allied nations that are able to call for fire from one another's artillery, our tanks maneuver in support of their infantry units, and vice versa," he said.
The U.S. already regularly conducts maneuvers with allied countries. In Romania on Thursday, U.S Navy Adm. Mark E. Ferguson III, a top NATO commander, said recent exercises have shown that the alliance is capable of training and operating across northern and eastern Europe.
He also noted that NATO successfully relocated the Allied Joint Force Command temporarily from Italy to Romania for exercises this month involving 1,000 troops from 21 nations, as the alliance continues to hone its ability to react to Russia's moves in Ukraine or other security challenges.

SOUSSE, Tunisia -- A young man pulled a Kalashnikov from a beach umbrella and sprayed gunfire at European sunbathers at a Tunisian resort, killing at least 37 people - one of three deadly attacks Friday from Europe to North Africa to the Middle East that followed a call to violence by Islamic State extremists.
The Health Ministry said among  the 37 dead included Tunisians, British, Germans and Belgians, without giving a breakdown.

The Irish Times reports one of the victims was an Irish national, Lorna Carty, a nurse on vacation with her husband. The Times reports she had traveled to Tunisia with her husband after he gave her the trip as a present. He had recently underwent heart surgery. She has two children, Hazel, 18, and Simon, 21.
In a statement Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charles Flanagan, confirmed the death of an Irish citizen.
"I condemn unreservedly the terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and France today. Sadly, I can confirm that an Irish citizen has been killed in the attack in Sousse , Tunisia," he said.
Others began Tweeting about missing family members who they said had been in Tunisia at the time of the attack, but hadn't been heard from.

British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond says at least five Britons were killed but expected to toll to rise because a high proportion of the dead were believed to be British.
Heroes also began to emerge in the midst of such devastation. The BBC reports , a Welsh tourist used his body as a shield to protect his Fianc when the shooting on the beach began. Saera Wilson, 26, the Fianc of gas engineer Matthew James, 30, said he is alive, but his pelvis is shattered after being shot three times.
The shootings in the Tunisian resort of Sousse happened at about the same time as a bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a U.S.-owned factory in France that included a beheading. It was unclear if the violence was linked but it came days after the IS militants urged their followers "to make Ramadan a month of calamities for the nonbelievers." In all, the assailants killed at least 65 people.

The attack in Tunisia, the country's worst ever, comes just months after the March 18 massacre at the national Bardo museum in Tunis that killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, and has called into question the newly elected government's ability to protect the country.
"Once again, cowardly and traitorous hands have struck Tunisia, targeting its security and that of its children and visitors," President Beji Caid Essebsi told reporters at the RIU Imperial Marhaba hotel, near the beach rampage site.
Essebsi promised "painful but necessary" measures, adding: "No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries."
British tourist Gary Pine told AP he was on the beach with his wife around noon when heard the shooting. They shouted for their son to get out of the water, grabbed their bag and ran for the hotel. Their son told them he saw someone shot on the beach.

There was "sheer panic" at the hotel, Pine said. "There were a lot of concerned people, a few people in tears with panic and a few people - older guests - they'd turned their ankles or there was a few little minor injuries and nicks and scrapes."
Elizabeth O'Brien, an Irish tourist who was with her two sons, told Irish Radio she was on the beach when the shooting began.
"I thought, 'Oh my God. It sounds like gunfire,' so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things" before fleeing to their hotel room, she said.
The FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin Friday warning of attacks against law enforcement officers and the military during the July 4th holiday.

Massive crash at Tour de France leaves 20 riders on ground

HUY, Belgium -- British rider Chris Froome took the Tour de France leader's yellow jersey after finishing second behind Spanish veteran Joacquim Rodriguez in Monday's crash-marred third stage, as a second straight day of chaos caused around 20 riders to fall and several to quit.
Filippo Pozzato of Italy and Lampre-Merida adjusts his clothing following a crash near Brabant Wallon during stage three of the 2015 Tour de France, a 159.5 km stage between Anvers and Huy, on July 6, 2015 in Huy, Belgium.

The 2013 Tour winner Froome almost caught Rodriguez near the top of the day's final climb, but the Spaniard held on for his second career Tour stage win five years after his first.
"I didn't expect to be in yellow this early on. Couldn't be a better feeling," said Froome, whose title defense ended when he crashed early in last year's race. "I may look calm on the outside but I assure you I'm not. A huge thank you to my teammates, they turned themselves inside out to keep me at the front."
(L-R) William Bonnet of France riding for FDJ, Simon Gerrans of Australia riding for Orica-GreenEdge, Jose Mendes of Portugal riding for Bora-Argon 18, Greg Henderson of New Zealand riding for Lotto Soudal and Ramon Sinkeldam of the Netherlands riding for Giant-Alpecin lay on the ground after being involved in a crash with 65km remaining in stage three of the 2015 Tour de France from Anvers to Huy on July 6, 2015 in Huy, Belgium.

He now leads German rider Tony Martin - who is not a threat for overall victory  - by just one second and is 13 seconds ahead of American rider Tejay Van Garderen, who is shaping up as a dangerous outsider.
More importantly, Froome's touted main rivals are lagging.
Froome is now 36 seconds clear of two-time champion Alberto Contador of Spain, 1:38 ahead of defending champion Vincenzo Nibali of Italy and 1:56 ahead of Nairo Quintana of Colombia, the Tour runner-up two years ago.
"I'd rather be in this position that I'm in now rather than having to make up time," said Froome, who took the race leader's jersey from Swiss veteran Fabian Cancellara. "I just hope to get through these next few days without any major issues."
Froome's relief was understandable, given how heavy the crash behind him was. It happened with a little under 37 miles remaining, forcing the stage to be neutralized and then stopped altogether shortly after - for nearly 20 minutes.
With the race moving from neighboring Netherlands into Belgium, stage three was 99 miles from Antwerp to Huy. It featured four short and sharp climbs but the crash took place shortly before climb No. 1 when Frenchman William Bonnet's wobbling bike slid forward and down.
Racing at tremendous speed, it was impossible for those behind to either slow down or get out of the way, and one after the other they went up, down, or sideways in a bewildering flash of colors, bobbing helmets and spinning wheels.
The end result was a tangled mess of bikes, spewed in all directions. Some riders lay on their backs in the grass and others were curled up in agony on the hot tarmac.
Cancellara was one of the last to go down, leaping into the air with his bike attached to him, then landing with a thud: the grass landing saving him from being more seriously hurt.

Bonnet was taken off on a stretcher with a brace around his neck. Dutch rider Tom Dumoulin - competing for the best young rider's white jersey - Australian veteran Simon Gerrans, and Russian Dmitry Kozontchuk also withdrew from the stage and race.
As the pack up ahead waited, riders started coming back: cuts and bruises decorating their backs and legs. According to CBSSports.com, Cancellara  was able to continue despite feeling "groggy," said  Alain Gallopin,  who is a sports director for Cancellara's Trek Factory  Racing team.
Cancellara grimaced in pain, Australian Michael Matthews looked to be in tears, and it was hard to see which team Johan Van Summeren was riding for given how shredded his shirt was.
The stage re-started for good with about 31 miles remaining. But it almost seemed like a training ride as no rider wanted to speed up.
Finally, about a dozen riders surged ahead.
Exhausted, the others let them go.
After taking chunks of time out of Nibali and Quintana on Sunday's rain-soaked and wind-battered second stage, Froome did it again as he accelerated in the last climb.
"It's never too early to take the yellow jersey," Froome said. "Really happy to come second and put more time on my GC (general classification) contenders."
Rodriguez and Froome clocked the same time of 3 hours, 26 minutes, 54 seconds. Frenchman Alexis Vuillermoz was third, four seconds behind them.
The day's final two climbs - 0.8 miles - up Cote de Cherave and the Mur du Huy featured on this year's Fleche Wallonne (Walloon Arrow) classic - which Rodriguez has previously won and where Froome crashed in this year's race.
Froome had better luck this time, gaining 11 seconds on Nibali and Quintana and 18 seconds on Contador.
"Froome is very strong and he's come here in good form," Contador said.
Tuesday's fourth stage stays in Belgium's Walloon region, starting out from Seraing, and ending in the northern French town of Cambrai 138.6 miles later. With 8 miles of cobblestone sections dotted around the route, it could also prove treacherous.
"There have been nerves and stress every day," Contador said. "Tomorrow will be the same."

In nuclear talks, Iran renews call to end arms embargo
Ministers sit around the table at the Palais Coburg Hotel where the Iran nuclear talks meetings are being held in Vienna, Austria, on July 6, 2015.

VIENNA - A day before the new deadline for a nuclear accord , Iran pushed Monday to lift the U.N. arms embargo on the country as a parallel deal - a demand that the United States opposes as it seeks to limit Tehran's Mideast clout.
Speaking on the eve of a belated target date for a complete agreement , a senior Iranian official said his country and the six world powers it is negotiating with are also working on a U.N. resolution that endorses any future nuclear deal.
The nuclear negotiations with Iran could go either way if Iran does not bend on critical remaining issues. The latest adjusted deadline is just t...
CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports that the pace of talks has been slowing as the July 7 deadline near. There has, however, been significant headway made on the topics of sanctions, as well as the possibility of an investigation into whether Iran has already tried to make a nuclear weapon.
Lifting the arms embargo would be separate from a long-term accord that foresees limits on Iran's nuclear programs in exchange for relief from crippling sanctions on the Islamic Republic. But Iran also sees existing U.N. resolutions imposed on Iran's nuclear program and the accompanying sanctions as unjust and illegal. It has insisted that those resolutions be lifted since the start of international negotiations nearly a decade ago to limit its nuclear-arms making capability.
After world powers and Iran reached a framework pact in April, the U.S. said "important restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles" would be incorporated in any new U.N. guidelines for Iran.
Negotiators and some foreign ministers of the six world powers plus Iran gathered in Vienna to complete a comprehensive nuclear deal by June 30. When they couldn't reach agreement by then, they agreed to extend the deadline to July 7. But many core issues remain, and an announcement on Tuesday is unlikely.
While the discussions have been focused on uranium stockpiles and the timing for lifting economic sanctions, Iran's long-standing desire to have the arms embargo lifted at the signing of a deal is another wrinkle thrown into the mix.
Russia and China have expressed support for lifting the embargo, which was imposed in 2007 as part of a series of penalties over its nuclear program.
But the U.S. doesn't want the arms ban ended because it could allow Tehran to expand its military assistance to Syrian President Bashar Assad's embattled government , for the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon. It also would increase already stalwart opposition to the deal in Congress and in Israel.

Last month, CBS News' Clarissa Ward had a rare look at the destruction wrought inside the country by weeks of fighting and relentless Saudi airstrikes. Upon landing at Sanaa's airport, the first thing Ward and her team saw was an airplane sitting on the tarmac, nearly cut in half by a missile.
The Old City, in the heart of the capital, dates back more than 2,500 years. The area has now been hit by the airstrike . Resident Abdullah Kakalla showed Ward his family home, which was destroyed by a strike just days earlier.
"They destroy our people for not any reason," said Kakalla, asking sardonically, "Is this a military site?"
The conflict has left 20 million Yemenis without access to safe drinking water and uprooted over one million people from their homes, the United Nations said. Last Wednesday, it declared its highest-level humanitarian emergency in the country, where over 80 percent of the population needs assistance.

"We must recognize that there are real lessons to be learned from the tragedy in Benghazi," he said. "Namely, we need to know in advance who is likely to take power or vie for it once a dictator is toppled."
Doug Wilson, who serves as O'Malley's senior foreign policy adviser and chair of the board of advisers at Truman, told reporters following O'Malley's remarks that the speech was not meant as a criticism of Hillary Clinton. Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the presidential race, voted for the Iraq invasion as a senator and has been accused of mishandling the Benghazi attack during her tenure as Secretary of State.
"You see no mention of any candidates names in what he had to say," Wilson said. "You see only a mention of what he thinks this country needs to do in order to have a better shot at succeeding around the world."
He also defended the former Baltimore mayor and governor of Maryland's foreign policy experience.
"This governor has traveled. He has met with foreign leaders," he said, mentioning that O'Malley has met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "He has also met with leaders on regional and local levels and in civil society on his travels he believes these are people who are going to have influence on policies in their countries for a long time to come."
O'Malley's emphasis on partnerships runs through his entire vision of American foreign policy. He has called for more engagement around the world, in terms of national defense but also to combat what he calls "21st century challenges" like climate change and cyberterrorism.
"After 12 years on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan," he said, "it is understandable that many Americans would like to disengage from the world. Understandable, but not responsible."

Woman on trial for deaths of 8 of her babies
Dominique Cottrez, flanked by her lawyer, Franck Berton, appears at the North Assize Court in Douai, France, June 25, 2015. Cottrez, a former nurse's aid, is charged with having killed eight of her children at birth since 1989.

DOUAI, France - One day in the summer of 2010, a man was digging in his garden in northern France when he discovered a trash bag containing the remains of an infant. When he summoned the police, they found the body of another newborn. A few days later, they found more bags in the garage with six additional small corpses.
Police contacted the house's previous owners, and quickly discovered the horrifying explanation: Frenchwoman Dominique Cottrez confessed to secretly bearing and then killing eight of her newborns, saying she feared they were children of a long, incestuous relationship with her father.
Cottrez, a 51-year-old mother of two grown daughters, went on trial Thursday in the city of Douai, accused of multiple counts of first-degree murder of minors.
Cottrez wept as she took her seat. She faces life in prison if found guilty.
Her lawyers are expected to argue that she was a victim of rape and incest, and ask for a lesser sentence.
The worst infanticide case in modern French history stunned the country when the bodies were discovered in and around the Cottrez' former home in 2010.
Cottrez's obesity appeared to hide the pregnancies, which went unnoticed by her husband, children, neighbors, colleagues -- and even doctors at a nearby hospital.
Dozens of forensic and psychiatric experts, police investigators and witnesses, including her husband, daughters and siblings, are scheduled to testify to help understand the incomprehensible, and perhaps to help the defendant open up.
A withdrawn, secretive nurse's aide, Cottrez told investigators she was raped by her father, first when she was 8 and repeatedly through her childhood and teenage years, according to judicial documents. She later entered a long, incestuous relationship with him as an adult, including after she married, and said that it became consenting, and even said she was in love with her father more than she was with her husband.
Her father died in 2007.
One of the first witnesses called to the stand Thursday is Leonard Meriaux, who bought the Cottrez family house and discovered the first corpse in 2010.  He called police, who found another in the garden.

From one interrogation to another, the police went from surprise to stupor. Cottrez first admitted killing the two infants found in the garden. Then she herself informed the investigators that several other bodies were in the garage of the house, but she didn't know how many exactly, according to court documents.
She told the investigating judge that she had never used contraception or had an abortion because of a phobia of doctors. She also said she didn't keep the babies because she was afraid that they were the results of her incestuous relations with her father. She said the killing had become a "means of contraception," according to the judicial documents.
She said she told her father of the eight pregnancies and the eight murders, and investigators believe he could have helped her hide some of the bodies.
The death she described the most clearly is the first one, in 1989. She said she smothered the baby boy with sheets, placed him in a trash bag that she had prepared in advance, and put the bag in her wardrobe, according to the documents.
The second killing happened when she was hospitalized for an epilepsy seizure. She said she gave birth in the hospital toilet, strangled the child, wrapped it in plastic sheeting and towels, placed it in the closet of her hospital room and then brought it back home, hidden in her garment bag.
Her memories became blurred for the following births and deaths. The last infanticide was in 2000.
Her husband and daughters say they noticed foul odors in various parts of the house, but thought they came from sewage, or their dog, or even their father's feet.
Cottrez was released from jail in 2012 after spending two years in temporary detention. In a January interview with a local newspaper, she said: "I never gave first names to the babies. The first one, I saw he was a baby boy. The others, I didn't look, I didn't want to. But when they were in the garage, when it was cold, I went there and covered them with a blanket. "
The verdict is expected next Thursday.

BOGOTA, Colombia -- A woman who survived a jungle plane crash with her 1-year-old son drank coconut water to stay alive for four days until being rescued, Colombia's air force says.
Rescuers reached Maria Nelly Murillo and her child in a remote area of western Colombia and flew them to the nearby town of Quibdo for medical treatment on Wednesday. Murillo suffered some injuries and burns but the baby was unhurt.
They were aboard a twin-engine Cessna that crashed Saturday into the thick jungle shortly after taking flight from Quibdo, near the Pacific Ocean.
The pilot was killed, but rescuers said a load of fish on board absorbed much of the impact in the plane's cabin, allowing Murillo and her son to survive against the odds.
Colombia's air force posted images of the woman and her son on Twitter, calling the rescue a "miracle."

        <MainBody>Dozens killed after gunman opens fire on tourists in a Tunisian tourist resort town
The killings in the Tunisian resort of Sousse happened at about the same time as a bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a U.S.-owned factory in France that included a beheadin g. It was unclear if the violence was linked but it came days after ISIS militants urged their followers "to make Ramadan a month of calamities for the nonbelievers." In all, at least 67 people were killed.
The SITE Intelligence Group reported later that the IS claimed credit for the Tunisia attack on its Twitter account and identified the gunman as Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani.
The attack in Tunisia, the country's worst ever, comes just months after the March 18 assault on the national Bardo museum in Tunis that killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, and has called into question the newly elected government's ability to protect the country.
"Once again, cowardly and traitorous hands have struck Tunisia, targeting its security and that of its children and visitors," President Beji Caid Essebsi told reporters at the RIU Imperial Marhaba hotel, near the beach rampage site.
Essebsi promised "painful but necessary" measures, adding: "No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries."
Rafik Chelli, the secretary of state of the Interior Ministry, told The Associated Press that the attack was carried out by a young student not previously known to authorities. The shooting spree ended when he was shot to death by police.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at the Shiite mosque in Kuwait City that killed at least 27 people and wounded scores of other worshippers at midday prayers - the first such attack in the mostly quiet and relatively secure Gulf Arab nation in more than two decades.
In southeastern France, a man with ties to Islamic radicals rammed a car into a gas factory, touching off an explosion that injured two people. Authorities arriving at the site made a grisly discovery: the severed head of the driver's employer was found hanging at the plant entrance.
The suspect, Yassine Salhi, was seized by an alert firefighter, authorities said, and French President Francois Hollande said the attacker's intention had been to cause an explosion. A security alert for the southeast region was raised to its highest level for the next three days, and the U.S. Embassy in Paris warned American citizens to be vigilant.
In an audio recording released Tuesday, ISIS called on its supporters to increase attacks during Ramadan and "be keen on waging invasion in this eminent month and commit martyrdom."
