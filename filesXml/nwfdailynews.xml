NICEVILLE - A 21-year-old Niceville woman is in custody after a warrant was issued due to charges that she attacked her boyfriend with a stiletto.
The woman, who is not being named to attack the victim's identity, was arrested on June 7.
The attack occurred on March 28, around 6:30 p.m., according to the arrest report. She and her boyfriend were reportedly living together in a room at Tisa's Friendly Inn.
The woman hit her boyfriend in the head with the heel of a four-inch stiletto shoe, the report said. He was treated for a three-inch wound to his head.
The wound went through the skin stopping at the skull (approximately three centimeters deep) and required six staples to close, a doctor reported to Niceville Police officers. A witness told police that the woman repeatedly said, "I did not mean to hurt him."
She is charged with aggravated battery causing great bodily harm.
Her next scheduled court date is July 27.

DeFUNIAK SPRINGS  One passenger on a church bus that crashed on Interstate 10 on Friday suffered serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
Madison Brennan, 18, of Pineville, La., was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola, the FHP reported Saturday.
Brennan was one of 21 people who were taken to several hospitals after the 2010 Ford bus crashed at 2:50 p.m. just west of U.S. Highway 331.
The bus was traveling east when it veered off the highway and hit two trees, according to the FHP. The driver, 50-year-old Derek Griffin of Pineville, apparently lost control on a slight curve in the road.
The bus was carrying 23 passengers ranging from 15 to 18 years old.
Griffin, who suffered minor injuries, was one of seven people who were taken to Healthmark Regional Medical Center in DeFuniak Springs.
The other 13 passengers who were hurt were taken to Twin Cities Hospital in Niceville, North Okaloosa Medical Center in Crestview and Sacred Heart Hospital on the Emerald Coast in Miramar Beach.
Emergency responders said Friday that none of the injuries was life-threatening. No further details were available from the hospitals Saturday.
The bus, which sustained $10,000 in damage, was traveling with another bus and a passenger van from the church. The FHP report did not identify the church.
Passengers in the other vehicles were taken to the DeFuniak Springs Community Center after the accident.
The FHP said Saturday that its investigation was continuing.

        <MainBody>Local homicides are up in 2015
By TRISTA PRUETT | Daily News
Published: Saturday, June 27, 2015 at 06:30 PM.
In the past six months, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa Counties have seen what seems, anecdotally, to be a spike in violence, with five homicides and a non-fatal shooting between three departments.
Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office shared some numbers, noting that crime had actually gone down in the last couple of years.
There was a 55 percent increase from 2009 to 2010 and another 15 percent increase from 2011 to 2012.
However, 2013 brought an increase in the budget and a drop in violent crime of more than 10 percent, they said.
Violent crime went down another 3 percent in 2014.
We are tremendously concerned anytime any one is a victim of violent crime, said Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We need resources to work to prevent crime, not just react. We have the same manpower levels we had in 2007.
Below is a look back at each shooting by department:
Okaloosa County Sheriffs Office
The first shooting was that of 18-year-old Mark Anthony Williams, whose body was seen by a passing motorist along the wood line of State Road 85 South of Duke Field on Jan. 21.
His body was autopsied and Williams was found to have died from a gunshot wound, Okaloosa County Sheriffs Department announced less than a week later.
Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Michele Nicholson said Friday they are still waiting on some forensics results from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Lab.
However, she said they are constantly working on the case, re-interviewing people and reviewing evidence.
The second from Okaloosa County was more recent.
On June 24, residents around a Marty Lane mobile home heard multiple gunshots around 5:20 a.m. When deputies arrived, they found 39-year-old Jimmy Lee Dodds body outside of his mobile home.
Investigators brought in K-9s, and Dodds body was taken in for autopsy.
Both deaths remain under investigation.
As these are all active criminal investigations, we are not able to release additional details publicly. We do not want to jeopardize any of the evidence weve gathered to this point, Nicholson said Friday.
The Sheriffs Office is also investigating a non-fatal shooting on Carmel Drive on June 18.
The Sheriffs Office reported that two men were shot by a homeowner during an attempted home invasion. One of the men later told deputies that hed had no idea the other was going to attempt to break into a home.
Both men were hospitalized later that day with gunshots wounds.
No charges have been filed against anyone.
The Sheriff's Office reported two homicides in 2014: the man charged with killing his mother in Mary Esther and the woman charged with killing her newborn in Fort Walton Beach.
She noted that they have also had two men arrested for attempted murder this year, both in the first full week of May.
We are actively working both the Williams and Dodd murder cases as well as the Carmel Drive shooting as vigorously as possible, Nicholson said. We want to continue to encourage anyone with information, no matter how minor they think it is, to contact our agency either via a call to the OCSO at 850-651-7400 or through Emerald Coast Crime Stoppers at 850-863-TIPS.
Fort Walton Beach Police Department
Fort Walton Beach added two homicides in less than a week to those numbers.
Fort Walton Beach Police Capt. Tom Matz noted that last year, there were no homicides in the city departments jurisdiction.
On June 11, late in the evening, a man heard a single gunshot outside of his Cape Drive residence.
He looked out the window to find that Randy Campbell, also known as Randy Shareef Ali, was dead outside.
At the time, Police Chief Ted Litzchauer said people of interest had been identified and were being interviewed.
Less than a week later, on June 17, 89-year-old Freddie Cason was shot and killed in the home hed lived in for more than 40 years.
A man then barricaded himself in the home until eventually surrendering to police. He was interviewed multiple times as a person of interest before being released.
Matz said there is not believed to be any connection between the two.
Were concerned about all homicides, he said. We respond the same way on each homicide. We devote all available resources towards the investigation in seeking the truth.
He said they had no updates to release on either case as of Friday, but said citizens should know law enforcement is doing all they can to address all crime issues.
The citizens should remain cognizant, keeping aware of the activities around them at all times, Matz said. Please remember it takes a partnership between the citizens and law enforcement to address crime.
He asked that anyone with information about either case call the department at 833-9546 or Emerald Coast Crime Stoppers.
Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office
In Santa Rosa County, 43-year-old Stephen Richmond Rice was found dead in his home on Persimmon Hollow Road on March 26.
Soon after his body was discovered, Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office said hed been dead for an undetermined amount of time and foul play was suspected.
On April 29, they asked for any former customers of Rice, who ran a business via the internet and person to person sales, to come forward.
The believed one of his customers might have information that could assist in the homicide investigation.
On Thursday, Sheriffs Office spokesperson Sgt. Rich Aloy said that Santa Rosa County had not had an increase in homicides.
He declined to comment further, but did encourage anyone with information to call Det. Gary Baney at 850-983-1296 or Santa Rosa County Crime Stoppers at 850-437-STOP.

HURLBURT FIELD You cant count on phone lines or other ways to communicate during a hurricane or other natural disaster.
Thats when ham radio operators step up.
For us to ask for help, provide communication with the outside world, let your family know youre okay, this is how its going to be done, Mo Hodgdon,chairman of the Playground Amateur Radio Clubs annual Field Day, said as he sat in front of a radio powered by a battery.
For more photos, click here.
Field Day is an exercise for amateur radio operators to make as many contacts across North America as possible. About 10 operators monitored the radio wavesSaturdayat stations set up on tables at Hurlburt Fields picnic area.
Well be making some (contacts) with Morse code. Well be making some with digital. Well be making some with voice, or what we call phone, Hodgdon said.
For a video, click here.
He expected to make 300 to 400 contacts between1 p.m.Saturdayand10 a.m.today.
The Field Day also gave people not familiar with the radios a chance to see them in action and send out some signals with supervision from PARC members.
Hodgdon said hes been able to contact radio operators in France, Japan and Australia over the years. He hoped to try contact with the International Space Stationon Saturdayevening.
Some places youll never get, like North Korea, Hodgdon said.

        <MainBody>Petitions call for removing Confederate flag
By KARI C. BARLOW | Daily News
Published: Thursday, June 25, 2015 at 06:44 PM.
The push to stop flying the Confederate flag over government buildings  and other public areas  has reached Northwest Florida.
Two petitions, started on www.change.org, are urging the removal of the Confederate flag from the Walton County Courthouse lawn and from the William Uncle Bill Lundy memorial in Crestview.
The Okaloosa County NAACP launched its petition Tuesday, asking Crestview Mayor David Cadle and the City Council to remove the rebel flag from the Lundy monument, which sits at the intersection of E. First Avenue and State Road 85.
I am sure that the City Council will look at this very closely, Cadle said.
He said he has received two phone calls from local citizens on the issue.
The NAACP has attempted in years past to remove the flag from the Lundy monument. The group tried most recently in December 2013, but the City Council refused to vote on the issue.
Lundy, believed by some to be the last surviving Confederate veteran, died in 1957. The Crestview Lions Club built the memorial the following year.
The petition calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the Walton County Courthouse lawn in Defuniak Springs was launched Tuesday by Santa Rosa Beach resident Michelle Uhlfelder.
As of Thursday evening, almost 300 people had signed the petition, which is directed at the Walton County Board of Commissioners.
Uhlfelder said she took the initiative after hearing the pastor at her church talk about the mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.
He said, Its a time to be bold about things like this, she said. ... I would love to get 1,000 people. A thousand people wins an election down here.
Uhlfelder said its past time for the controversial flag to come down.
It has such a soiled history, she said. ... Its of a confederacy of rebels that tried to rise up and lost. Now were flying the losers flag, essentially, on our property.
Walton County NAACP President Raymond Jackson said he supports the removal of the flag.
Its time for it to happen, said Jackson, who lives in DeFuniak Springs.  ... The Spanish were here. The British were here. And we dont fly their flags at the courthouse.
The rebel flag has flown over Walton Countys Confederate Monument since it was first erected in 1871. The monument is Floridas first memorial to Confederate war dead. In 2002, the local chapter of the NAACP lobbied to have the flag removed, but commissioners voted down the measure.
Uhlfelder, who grew up in Atlanta and Memphis and has lived in Santa Rosa Beach for seven years, also is rallying other residents to attend the July 14 commission meeting. The item has been placed on the boards agenda for discussion.
County Commission Chairman Bill Imfeld said the issue is a timely one and that he is interested in reaching a compromise.
(The flag) can mean different things to different people, and I think we should try to be judicious ... and achieve a decorum that will diffuse harsh feelings and bring the community together.

Okaloosa County announced it was the second best performing school district overall in the state on the most recent testing data released.
The ranking occurred after students showed improvement over the previous year in three of the four exam results released by the Florida Department of Education earlier this month.
The improvements Okaloosa has seen over the last couple of years is a real testament to what a team can accomplish when they work together on a common goal, said Superintendent Mary Beth Jackson. I am honored to represent the extraordinary students and teachers that make us an academically top performing District in Florida.
A big part of the team were the teachers and administrators who diligently worked through the ever-changing state standards to help students excel on their state end of course exams, according to Assistant Superintendent Marcus Chambers.
Our teachers showed their commitment to their students in what was arguably the hardest year in education. Chambers said. We are fortunate to have teachers and administrators who spend countless hours to help students find success.
Below is a breakdown of student performance this year compared to last year on the five exam results released:

Villani looks ahead to retirement (VIDEO)
Okaloosa County Public Safety Director Dino Villani poses at the Emergency Operations Center at the Northwest Florida State College. Villani will retire in early July after 15 years of guiding the county through everything from wild fires and hurricanes to ice storms and floods.

Hurricanes. Floods. Oil spills. Ice storms.
After 15 years of guiding Okaloosa County through some of its worst disasters, Public Safety Director Dino Villani is calling it a career.
But like a true emergency junkie, hes giving out his cell phone number  just in case.
I dont want to leave anyone in the lurch, he said with a smile. If anyone needs anything, I will be around.
For a video of Villani reflecting on his last 15 years, click here.
Villani got his start as an EMT in the Everglades and planned to be a doctor but veered off into emergency management instead. He began working for Okaloosa County in 2002 after serving as the EMS bureau chief in Tallahassee for the state Department of Health.
The job was here, so it worked out, but I came here because I wanted to live here, he said. Its beautiful.
Not even Hurricane Ivan  which tops Villanis list of disasters  could change that. In the face of washed out highways, widespread destruction and the loss of water and power for days, the county took a major hit but emerged better off.
In terms of the value of that event making us more prepared, that was immeasurable, he said. That was the ultimate test.
And it led to Villanis dream of building countys state-of-the-art Emergency Operations Center, now in use at Northwest Florida State College in Niceville.
This was the vision right here, he said, standing in the giant control room that features a 10-foot-by-34-foot screen and other smaller screens for monitoring weather and news. Its constantly being used. Its designed to hold 200 people every day for two full weeks.
The countys emergency phone and text alert system also arose out of Ivan  a time when the county was bombarded with more than 100,000 phone calls.
Almost six years after Hurricane Ivan came the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill  an event that reinforced the need to disseminate information quickly.
We had tremendous public pressure for information, and we had to answer for everything, Villani said. The public was afraid and they were reacting. ... It really makes you think on your feet.

Stranded leatherback turtle taken to Gulfarium (PHOTOS, VIDEO)
Staff from the Gulfarium Marine Adventure Park set up a harness to lift a 5-foot, 382-pound female Leatherback sea turtle into a truck after the turtle came ashore Thursday at the north end of Rocky Bayou in Niceville.

Published: Thursday, June 25, 2015 at 05:44 PM.
NICEVILLE  A leatherback turtle took up temporary residence at Gulfarium Marine Adventure Park Thursday after stranding itself in Niceville.
The 5-foot, 5-inch, 382-pound female sea turtle was found around 9 a.m. in Niecy Cooper's backyard, which is located at the north end of Rocky Bayou.
She immediately contacted Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, who asked the Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge and Gulfarium to respond to the scene.
VIDEO of the stranding.
Ive never been that close to a leatherback, Cooper said. Its amazing actually.
Leatherbacks are the largest sea turtle in the world and typically weigh between 500 and 1,500 pounds when fully grown. The endangered species are rarely spotted locally.
Its the second call FWC received this week about a stranded leatherback turtle. On Sunday morning, people spotted one stuck on a sandbar in Toms Bayou in Valparaiso. They pushed it back into the water with the help of an FWC officer.
Its most likely the same one, but I cant 100 percent say that it is, said FWC spokeswoman Bekah Nelson.
In spite of criticism, Nelson said FWC handled the first stranding appropriately.
The officer was there, she said. He looked over the turtle.
Before freeing it from the sandbar, the officer checked the turtles eyes, flippers and shell and found no signs of illness or trauma, Nelson said.
Amanda Wilkerson, who oversees ECWR, said they were en-route to the stranding Sunday and expressed concern it was released that day.
The turtles location in the bayou was a red flag for her agency, she said.
We predicted that she would re-strand, and she did, Wilkerson said.
While waiting for Gulfarium crew to arrive, ECWR staff kept the turtle cool and wet with moist towels.
An evaluation at the scene didnt reveal any clear reasons for the stranding, so they opted to move her to Gulfarium on Okaloosa Island, according to Allen McDowell, who is the director of the sea turtle care program there.
Leatherbacks do not do as well in rehabilitation programs as other species of turtle, but the turtles proximity to fresh water and distance from the Gulf combined with the likelihood it had twice stranded itself, prompted the decision, McDowell said.
The turtle is alert and moving, but again, were not comfortable just releasing it, he said.
Once at the facility, staff took blood tests, an ultrasound and X-rays.
Its only the third time in the last decade a leatherback has beached itself along local shores. In both the other cases, the turtles died on the beach.
Gulfarium officials said they will share updates on the turtle as they get back test results. If no issues are found, staff will release turtle in the Gulf of Mexico.
A small loggerhead turtle was also rescued by wildlife officials Thursday morning.
The Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge was contacted around 9:30 a.m. about the sea turtle stuck in a fishing net along a beach on Eglin Air Force Base, said director Amanda Wilkerson.
It was taken to Gulf World for rehabilitation and is expected to make a full recovery.

Its for you, she said, shrugging at the 17-year-old football player. Somebody named Joe Paterno.
Johnson was a Niceville senior. Prior to that phone call he hadnt thought much about going to school. He had decided he would go into the military.
It is difficult to comprehend now, a football player less than a year away from high school graduation, showing interest only when one of the greatest coaches in the history of football was on the other line of a phone. 
The thought of going to college was not something that was going through my mind my junior or senior years, said Johnson, who went on to play for Alabama and is now the football coach and athletic director for Fort Walton Beach. I enjoyed playing football and I loved playing football. It just wasnt as big of a thing as it is now. We didnt have all the ESPNs and things like that, highlighting everything that a kid did.
"Nowadays kids, even if theyre not that good, they just assume they should be being recruited," he added.
Nowadays, if kids dont get something by the time theyre upperclassmen, theyre surprised, discouraged, stressed.
There is a 10-year-old athlete in the area receiving interest from an SEC school. There are middle schoolers around the country receiving verbal offers.
The recruitment process has jumped down a rabbit hole that has no foreseeable way out.
Everybodys targeting the younger kids now, telling them what they want to hear and holding on to them, Paxton basketball coach Jeff Bradley said. These kids are getting dragged along and theyre just a number to them. Theyre not anything more than a number. Thats starting crazy early.
Sami Mims was, in her mind, late. A freshman at Niceville in 2012, she had just begun playing volleyball.
By then girls were already sending out highlight tapes, she said.
High school freshmen are as predictable as the weather. There is no telling what their mood will be tomorrow, much less four years from then, a point raised by Navarre football coach Jay Walls in regards to schools offering 13- and 14-year-old kids.
Sometimes you just have to wonder, he said. How do they know?
Truth is, they dont.
The more difficult truth: They may no longer have a choice.
Its absolutely gotten nuts, Northwest Florida State softball coach Jack Byerly said. When I was at a four-year school (Auburn from 2004-2008), we brought them in senior year for a visit and they committed. Now if they dont commit to you in the eighth grade, youre behind the times.
Its crazy to me. I dont understand it. You have no idea what these kids are going to do. What were you thinking about when you were 14? Youre losing the joy of it because all of a sudden its become so competitive that its all you think about," he added. "You have these big tournaments and these big time coaches coming to watch you play. Its a totally different stage.
NCAA rules regarding athletes signing have remained rigid, antiquated. An athlete still cannot sign with a school until a year prior to them leaving for college. Maybe there is a solution on the horizon, maybe not. Neither Walls nor Bradley nor Johnson nor any of the other dozen coaches interviewed for this story posed a cure-all for the anarchy that has become recruiting.
Theres no way to really stop the escalation right now, Barton Simmons, the director of scouting for 247 Sports, said. The fact that colleges are recruiting kids that are freshmen and sophomores means that everybody has to do it.
You cant really sit on the sidelines because you dont believe in it," he added. "In a perfect world, youd go after a kid after his senior year because you get the full body of work and the kid can make a sound decision but of course thats not how it works."
Note to Readers:
This series began marinating in my head when I was working for a paper in Maryland and covered an athlete who had received offers to play basketball for every ACC school as a freshman. With our schedule easing over the summer, I had time to dig into this new world of recruiting, and down the rabbit hole I went. Nearly two dozen coaches, athletes and parents were interviewed for this series, each providing a new perspective on the volatile process that has become recruiting.

Burned kitten recovering at PAWS
Disco, an 8-week-old kitten, was rescued earlier this week in the Navarre area with severe burns on her paws. Panhandle Animal Welfare Society and Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office are trying to find out what happened.
Special to the Daily News

The Panhandle Animal Welfare Society is hoping to find out what happened to an 8-week-old kitten that was found in the Navarre area with severe burns earlier this week.
Shes been in pain and shes very vocal like any other kitten, said Chloe Finley, a PAWS employee who is also fostering the kitten. Shes sweet. Theres not anything bad I can say about her.
Krystal Martel found the kitten in her Midway neighborhood on Maverick Lane Sunday and later brought the cat to Navarre resident Melanie Oberlander, who took her to PAWS. She and her kids named the kitten Disco.
You could smell the infection and see the bones of her feet, she said. I took her in overnight and gave her some antiseptic and got in touch with Melanie.
Martel said her neighborhood has a number of stray cats. In the past, shes heard of other animal abuse stories.
We seem to be a place were people drop off their litters, she said.
Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office Public Information Officer Rich Aloy said deputies took a report a few days after the kitten was found, but that they are not investigating.
Dee Thompson, executive director of PAWS, said her agency couldnt investigate the case because it likely didnt occur in Okaloosa County, which is where PAWS has jurisdiction.
What PAWS can do is to take care of the kitten and share any information they receive with officials in Santa Rosa County.
Were trying to figure out if the burns are chemical or thermal, since she doesnt have singed hair, Thompson said. Thats why we want to know if anybody has seen something...this is felony level cruelty.
Thompson said Disco wears bandages on her paws that have to be changed throughout the day. She is on a high calorie/high protein diet and uses shredded paper instead of cat litter to avoid anything interfering with the bandages.
It will definitely be a little bit before they adopt her out, Thompson said.
DONATE TO DISCO: You can donate to Disco by bringing in a/d Hill brand canned cat food or make a monetary donation. More information about PAWS is available at paws-shelter.com.
Anyone with information about what happened to Disco, can anonymously report it by calling the Santa Rosa County Crime Stoppers at 850-437-STOP.

NICEVILLE - A man finished a shopping trip with his son to find a strange man sitting in his car.
The man called Niceville Police officers on June 15 around 10 p.m. to report that he'd come out of Walmart with his son and found a man sitting in his front seat, according to the call log. He said the man appeared to be trying to start his car.
The caller said he confronted the man, the man apologized, the log said. The caller waited to see if the other man would get in to a similar vehicle, but the man got into a blue van and drove off.
The caller drove a Ford Fusion, according to the log. The man requested officers make contact with the man and find out why he was in another vehicle.

        <MainBody>Local amateur radio club hosting field day this weekend
JASON EPPINK | Special to the Daily News
Published: Thursday, June 25, 2015 at 03:55 PM.
The Playground Amateur Radio Club will host an Amateur Radio Field Day at Hurlburt Field Picnic Grounds this weekend to promote the use of ham radios.
Were trying to preserve the hobby, said Mo Hodgdon, chairman of the event. I believe winds of 90 miles per hour can take down cell phone and landlines. Without them how do you communicate?
Hodgdon pointed out during Hurricane Katrina emergency crews communicated through amateur and CB radios.
During the field day, all ages can participate using radios provided by the club to make contacts with other radios along North America as other clubs will be participating with similar events.
While ham radios may seem to be an archaic piece of technology, they have more capability than most think. Some of the more expensive models can be hooked to a computer and send emails, photos and chat.
Hodgdon said he hopes kids will attend to learn more about amateur radios and perhaps even gain interest in obtaining a radio license.
After 9/11 a 10-year-old girl with a handheld radio did communications between a shelter and New York City Emergency Operation Center for eight hours, he said.
In the local area, Hodgdon and his wife volunteer to provide communications during disasters.
We want people to see what we can do, he said. Radios can help in any emergency situation.
The PARC Field Day is from 1 p.m. Saturday until 10 a.m. Sunday at the Hurlburt Field Picnic Grounds, located at the south side of U.S. Highway 98. For more information, visit w4zbb.org.

MARY ESTHER - A 36-year-old woman is charged with striking a deputy after a fight with another woman.
Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputies were called for a disturbance between two women around 2 p.m. on June 10, according to the arrest report. When deputies arrived, they broke up the two women.
Chesney Leigh Anderson turned away from the other woman and started a verbal argument with a deputy, the report said. She allegedly hit the deputy's shoulder in an attempt to avoid being detained.
She was restrained and taken to a chair, showing signs of being under the influence of a narcotic, according to the report. Deputies reportedly noticed a small amount of white powder around her mouth.
Anderson is charged with battery on an officer.
Her next scheduled court date is July 21.

Sacred Heart Health Care System has resolved its contract negotiations with Florida Blue, but another nail-biting contract dispute has the potential to affect individuals across Northwest Florida.
Letters have gone out from Humana notifying patients of Hospital Corporation of America facilities that as of July 10 those hospitals will no longer participate in your Medicare PPO plan network.
Both Twin Cities Hospital in Niceville and Fort Walton Beach Medical Center in Fort Walton Beach are run by HCA.
We understand that changing your hospital can be difficult, but were here to help you through this transition, the letter, dated June 3, said.
Fort Walton Beach residents Eva Mae and Walter Salvatore said its kind of scary knowing they are caught in the middle of the two parties negotiations.
They have looked to see if they could find a different insurance carrier, but they havent found anyone who would accept them until open enrollments in October.
The government says you have to have insurance, Walter said. Well, weve got insurance, but how can the government allow this insurance company to quit in the middle of the year and say no hospital is going to take you?
Im 84, wife in her 70s, he added. For us to go without a hospital for the next four months is crazy.
Though the tone of the letter sounded dire enough to scare some people, Humana spokeswoman Nancy Hanewinckel said Humana and HCA still have plenty time to reach a contract agreement.
Our contract with HCA is still in existence and will not expire until July 10, she said. There is still a very active negotiation going on. Were hoping any day now we will be reporting we have signed a new agreement.
Hanewinckel said the insurance company was required to send the letter as the deadline to reach an agreement with HCA approached to within 30 days.
Humana sent a second letter to clear up some discrepancies with the first. That letter said the insurance companies are terminating its contracts with HCA hospitals, but attempted to clarify that HCA ambulatory surgery centers would remain as Humana participants.
The emphasis on are terminating further confused patients.
HCA operates 47 hospitals in Florida.
Fort Walton Beach Medical Center spokeswoman Denise Kendust provided an HCA statement on the ongoing discussions with Humana.
We remain actively engaged in continuing discussions with Humana and are optimistic that well come to an agreement before the July 10th extension date for Humana Commercial and Humana Medicare Advantage plans, the statement said.
The hospital offered two phone numbers for patients to call with questions about their coverage.
Those are 850-863-7511 or 850-863-7515.

        <Description/>

Published: Saturday, June 27, 2015 at 05:42 PM.
The headlines about the "flesh-eating" bacteria that waits for you at the beach are over-hyped.
"There's a few misnomers," said Ryan Mims, public information officer for the Florida Department of Health in Okaloosa County. "Those headlines cause a lot of panic, but if you're a healthy individual and practice good hygiene there's a low risk of you contracting vibrio vulnificus."
Here's the facts about vibrio:
First, what is vibrio vulnificus?
Vibrio Vulnificus, or vibrio, is a bacterium that is normally found in warm saltwater. Coastlines throughout the U.S. can be a host for vibrio. There's two ways to contract vibrio, said Mims. First, by entering saltwater with open wounds and second, by ingesting undercooked shellfish and oysters. So far this year, Santa Rosa County has had one case of vibrio. Walton and Okaloosa County have not any cases.
How do I know if I have vibrio?
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of vibrio is acute illness, which can begin one to three days after exposure or as late as seven days in a small percentage of cases. If exposed by an open wound, you may see increased swelling, redness and pain at the site of the wound. You may also notice swelling and redness on arms and legs with blood-tinged blisters and low blood pressure or shock.
"It's not a flesh-eating bacteria," Mims said.
There is a chance of amputation in severe cases, but if treated in a timely and effective manner , those who recover should see no long-term effects, Mims added.
How do I prevent vibrio?
Don't immediately fret if you get a paper cut at the beach. Vibrio is preventable.
"It can be a serious disease and even lead to death, but if you take proper care, your risk should be minimal," said Dr. Carina Blackmore, deputy state epidemiologist in a video on the DOH-Okaloosa website.
With that being said, those with underlying health conditions and compromised immune deficiencies, especially those with chronic liver disease, have a higher risk of contracting vibro, said Blackmore. Perform first aid before wounds become infected and keep wounds covered with dry, clean bandages. And cook your shellfish thoroughly. Oysters can also be carriers if the bacteria is present in their environment, but can only legally be harvested in from waters free from contamination.
Safety and oysters
Follow these tips from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when cooking at home for safe meals
When you purchase oysters the shells should be closed. Throw away any oysters with shells already opened.
In the shell: After the shells open, boil live oysters for another 3-5 minutes. (Use small pots to boil or steam oysters. Do not cook too many oysters in the same pot because the ones in the middle may not get fully cooked. Discard any oysters that do not open during cooking).
In a steamer: Add oysters to water that is already steaming and cook live oysters for another 4-9 minutes.
Shucked Oysters:
Boil or simmer shucked oysters for at least 3 minutes or until the edges curl.
Fry at 375 degrees for at least 3 minutes.
Broil 3 inches from heat for 3 minutes.
Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes.

Supreme Court upholds nationwide health care law subsidies
Jessica Ellis, right, with the "yay 4 ACA" sign, and other supporters of the Affordable Care Act, react with cheers as the opinion for health care is reported outside of the Supreme Court in Washington on Thursday. The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the nationwide tax subsidies under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, in a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.
JACQUELYN MARTIN | AP
By The Associated Press
Published: Thursday, June 25, 2015 at 11:01 AM.
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the nationwide tax subsidies under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, in a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.
The justices said in a 6-3 ruling that the subsidies that 8.7 million people currently receive to make insurance affordable do not depend on where they live, under the 2010 health care law.
The outcome is the second major victory for Obama in politically charged Supreme Court tests of his most significant domestic achievement. It came the same day the court gave the administration an unexpected victory by preserving a key tool the administration uses to fight housing bias.
Chief Justice John Roberts again voted with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. Roberts also was the key vote to uphold the law in 2012. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a dissenter in 2012, was part of the majority on Thursday.
"Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.
In a dissent he summarized from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia said, "We should start calling this law SCOTUScare." Using the acronym for the Supreme Court, Scalia said his colleagues have twice stepped in to save the law from what Scalia considered worthy challenges.
Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas joined the dissent, as they did in 2012.
Nationally, 10.2 million people have signed up for health insurance under the Obama health overhaul. That includes the 8.7 million people who are receiving an average subsidy of $272 a month to help pay their insurance premiums.
Of those receiving subsidies, 6.4 million people were at risk of losing that aid because they live in states that did not set up their own health insurance exchanges.
The challenge devised by die-hard opponents of the law, often derided by critics as "Obamacare," relied on four words  established by the state  in the more than 900-page law.
The law's opponents argued that the vast majority of people who now get help paying for their insurance premiums are ineligible for their federal tax credits. That is because roughly three dozen states opted against creating their own health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, and instead rely on the federal healthcare.gov to help people find coverage if they don't get insurance through their jobs or the government.
In the challengers' view, the phrase "established by the state" demonstrated that subsidies were to be available only available to people in states that set up their own exchanges. Those words cannot refer to exchanges established by the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees healthcare.gov, the opponents argued.
The administration, congressional Democrats and 22 states responded that it would make no sense to construct the law the way its opponents suggested. The idea behind the law's structure was to decrease the number of uninsured. The law prevents insurers from denying coverage because of "pre-existing" health conditions. It requires almost everyone to be insured and provides financial help to consumers who otherwise would spend too much of their paycheck on their premiums.
The point of the last piece, the subsidies, is to keep enough people in the pool of insured to avoid triggering a so-called death spiral of declining enrollment, a growing proportion of less healthy people and premium increases by insurers.
Several portions of the law indicate that consumers can claim tax credits no matter where they live. No member of Congress said that subsidies would be limited, and several states said in a separate brief to the court that they had no inkling they had to set up their own exchange for their residents to get tax credits.
The 2012 case took place in the midst of Obama's re-election campaign, when he touted the largest expansion of the social safety net since the advent of Medicare nearly a half-century earlier. But at the time, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act were mostly in the future. Many of its provisions had yet to take effect.
In 2015, the landscape has changed, although the partisan and ideological divisions remain for a law that passed Congress in 2010 with no Republican votes.
The case is King v. Burwell, 14-114.

DeFUNIAK SPRINGS  Twenty people were taken to area hospitals Friday after authorities say a church school bus traveling on Interstate 10 veered off the highway and hit a tree.
The crash was reported at 3:10 p.m. just west of State Road 331 near DeFuniak Springs, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
The bus was one of three vehicles from a church in Louisiana that were heading east on I-10, said Bryan Pierce, a battalion chief from Walton County Fire Rescue. He was not sure why the bus left the road.
Twenty people were taken to hospitals, although none of them suffered life-threatening injuries, Pierce said.
Seven were taken to Healthmark Regional Medical Center in DeFuniak Springs; one was taken to Twin Cities Hospital in Niceville; seven were taken to Sacred Heart on the Emerald Coast in Miramar Beach; and five were taken to North Okaloosa Medical Center in Crestview.
About 40 people were in a second bus and a passenger van that were traveling with the bus that wrecked. They were taken to DeFuniak Springs Community Center for the night, according to Pierce and the Walton County Sheriffs Office.
Many of the people who were hurt were youths. The bus driver and chaperones were adults, Pierce said.
The wreck closed one eastbound lane of I-10.
We did back up traffic for miles, Im afraid, Pierce said.
FHP was investigating the crash, but had released no details Friday night.
Walton County sheriffs deputies and DeFuniak Springs police and firefighters assisted at the scene.

        <MainBody>Police called for fight at Tom Thumb
By STAFF REPORTS | Daily News
Published: Friday, June 26, 2015 at 09:00 PM.
NICEVILLE - Police were called for a fight at Tom Thumb between two women during a custody exchange.
Niceville Police officers were called around June 10 for a disturbance at Tom Thumb, according to the call log. The disturbance started out as a verbal argument during a child exchange.
The man's ex wife and his current wife had an argument that became physical in the parking lot, the log said. The current wife put her arm up to "keep the ex wife out of her face" and the ex wife grabbed her arm and scratched her.
The man left both women at Tom Thumb and took the children home before going to the police department, according to the log. No charges were filed because both women were found to have an equal part in the fight.

        <MainBody>Sacred Heart, Florida Blue reach agreement
By KARI C. BARLOW | Daily News
Published: Wednesday, June 24, 2015 at 06:15 PM.
Sacred Heart Health System announced Wednesday it will continue to be a participating healthcare provider for Florida Blue insurance plans.
The two entities signed a new contract that will allow Florida Blue members with continued access to Sacred Heart services for the next three years.
Our hospitals in Miramar Beach, Port St. Joe and Pensacola, including our Childrens Hospital, will continue to be a participating provider in Florida Blue plans, said Susan Davis, president and CEO of Sacred Heart Health System.
Kirk Fischer, vice president of delivery system for Florida Blue said the Northwest Florida community is a very important market to the company.
Our new contract with Sacred Heart ensures we can continue to provide the members in the area with access to high-quality and affordable health care, he said.
The new agreement comes less than a month after Sacred Heart sent letters to some of its customers notifying them the health care system could part ways with Florida Blue by July 1. The letter said Sacred Heart and Florida Blue had been negotiating a new contract for several months and had been unable to reach an agreement.
Im very happy. Its fantastic, said Kathleen Armstrong, who is insured by Florida Blue and regularly receives health care services at Sacred Heart on the Emerald Coast.
Armstrong, who received her letter June 11, suffers from a rare genetic immune deficiency disease that requires her to have monthly treatments. She said she was never notified by Florida Blue about the potential change.
She was distraught at the prospect of no longer being able to use Sacred Heart.
I just think its exceptional care and I wouldnt want to go anywhere else, she said. Im glad its going to continue.
Armstrong spoke out about her concerns to the Daily News earlier this month.
I wanted to be a voice for the community, she said. I hope if this ever happens again, the community will band together.

Sacred Heart will continue as an in-network provider for the following Florida Blue plans:
Blue Care HMO (Health Options Inc.)
BlueChoice (Preferred Patient Care)

Popular doctor, lawyer, politician Durell Peaden passes away
Sen. Durell Peaden (center), R-Crestview, asks a question of Rep. Don Brown (far right), R-DeFuniak Springs, in 2004 in Niceville as members of the area's legislative delegation met to discuss priorities for the 2005 session.

CRESTVIEW  Former state Sen. Durell Peaden, a towering figure in Northwest Florida politics, passed away Tuesday. He was 69.
Peaden, who was both a physician and an attorney, represented the northern portions of several Northwest Florida counties in the state Senate from 2001 to 2010, when he left office due to term limits. From 1995 to 2000, he represented much of that same area in the state House of Representatives.
He always called Crestview home, said state Sen. Greg Evers, who was a close friend and distant cousin of Peadens. He cared so much about the people who live here.
Evers, who followed Peaden into the Florida House in 2000 and the Senate in 2010, said Peaden was the smartest man I ever knew.
He had an insightfulness that was always right on, Evers added. In any situation, you could call on him for advice, and hed always have the right answer.
Born in DeFuniak Springs in 1945, Peaden grew up in Crestview, a block away from his lifelong friend and longtime legislative aide, Roger Robinson. He later graduated from Tulane University, the medical school at Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law at Faulkner University.
Peaden and his wife, Nancy, had three children: Durell III (Trey), Tyler and Taylen.
He was extremely brilliant, Robinson said. He just exuded compassion for his patients when he was practicing medicine, and for his constituents when he was in the legislature. I run into people all the time who say things like, Dr. Peaden saved my grandbabys life. He was always working non-stop to help people.
Like most successful politicians, Peaden was outgoing and friendly, Robinson said.
He had a photographic memory, Robinson added. If he met you once, he remembered you. He could tell you where he met you, and under what circumstances.
Evers said that while Peaden was interested in many issues, his foremost concern was providing access to medical care for his constituents.
He was probably proudest of being able to bring the FAMU pharmacy school to Crestview, Evers said. He also worked very hard to bring the Lake Erie College of Medicines dental school to DeFuniak Springs.
As one of the sponsors of Florida's Stand Your Ground law, Peaden was back in the limelight in 2012 following George Zimmermans shooting of Trayvon Martin.
He explained to people that the law was never meant to be applied in that type of circumstance, Robinson said. That law was prompted by an incident where an elderly couple in Pensacola were living in a FEMA trailer following Hurricane Ivan. An intruder broke in, and a man shot him. The senator said the man shouldn't have to wait 90 days to see if the prosecutor was going to bring charges against him.
Peaden was a dean at the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was there earlier this month for the schools graduation when he suffered a massive heart attack. Robinson said Peaden was admitted to the hospital there, where he later passed away.
Both Robinson and Evers said Peaden leaves a legacy of many behind the scenes accomplishments.
He wasnt looking for glory, Robinson said. He just did things because they were the right things to do. He is going to be greatly missed.

        <MainBody>Man claims paraphernalia belongs to his 'hooker girlfriend'
By STAFF REPORTS | Daily News
Published: Friday, June 26, 2015 at 08:52 PM.
NICEVILLE - A 31-year-old Niceville man facing drug paraphernalia charges reportedly told officers that it belonged to his "hooker girlfriend."
The man was pulled over for a faulty tag light around 11:15 p.m. on June 10, according to the arrest report. He was allegedly "shaking a lot" and "was so shaky he threw" his license "out the window."
Niceville Police officers asked the man if there was anything in his car that would get him into trouble, because he seemed nervous, the report said. The man said there wasn't.
Police asked for permission to search the vehicle and the man agreed, telling officers that he kept his car "immaculate," and had just finished vacuuming it, according to the report. Police found a spoon with white and green powder and a cotton ball that was "saturated with powder" under the driver's seat.
When the man saw the spoon, he told officers it belonged to his "hooker girlfriend" and that she'd left it in his car, the report said. He also allegedly told officers that he'd told her not to leave the rest of the pill on the spoon and to lick if off the spoon instead.
He is charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.
His next scheduled court date is June 30.

DOT sees light at the end of Gap Creek
Construction crews work Tuesday on the bridge at Gap Creek on Beal Parkway, which has been under construction since January 2014.
NICK TOMECEK | Daily News
By KARI C. BARLOW | Daily News
Published: Wednesday, June 24, 2015 at 05:49 PM.
FORT WALTON BEACH  Work has resumed on the Gap Creek bridge replacement project on Beal Parkway.
Construction crews returned to the site June 8 after being on standby for much of the spring due to a large number of underground obstructions  logs and stumps  found in the creek bed.
In March, officials with the Department of Transportation announced the bridges completion date would be pushed back to late summer.
DOT Spokesman Ian Satter said the project is still expected to meet that deadline.
The bridge substructure, the bridge superstructure and the north and southbound roadway construction are all left to do, he said.
Motorists can expect some traffic shifts in the coming months, and DOT will announce those changes before they happen, Satter added.
The $3.3 million project has slowed traffic considerably on that section of Beal Parkway.
Im very frustrated as a business owner because the worst is yet to come, said Terry Akens, who owns Southern Signs, which sits on the west side of Beal Parkway.
His main concern is that his company has to make and receive multiple deliveries each day. He said the DOT has guaranteed him access to his business from Beal Parkway, but he doesnt know exactly what that will look like.
Akens, like many locals, will be happy when its completed.
It will be better all the way around, he said. Theres no doubt about that.

One escaped murderer fatally shot; other is on run
Authorities search an area in Constable, N.Y,. for convicted murderers Richard Matt and David Sweat on Friday. Police shifted a focus of their three-week search closer to the Canadian border.

Published: Friday, June 26, 2015 at 05:06 PM.
MALONE, N.Y.  One of two convicted killers who staged a brazen escape from an upstate maximum-security prison and had been hunted for three weeks was shot and killed Friday, but the other is still on the run.
An official with knowledge of the manhunt said Richard Matt was killed and David Sweat is still on the run. The official wasn't authorized to talk about the development publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo says Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall, squirmed through pipes and escaped early on June 6 from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, near the Canadian border.
Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy in Broome County in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss.
A civilian worker at the prison was charged with helping the killers flee by giving them hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools.
Prosecutors said Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailoring shop instructor who got close to the men while working with them, had agreed to be their getaway driver but backed out because she felt guilty for participating. Mitchell pleaded not guilty on June 15 to charges including felony promoting prison contraband.
Authorities said the men had filled their beds in their adjacent cells with clothes to make it appear they were sleeping when guards made overnight rounds. On a cut steam pipe, the prisoners left a taunting note containing a crude caricature of an Asian face and the words "Have a nice day."
Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said they apparently used tools stored by prison contractors, taking care to return them to their toolboxes after each night's work.
Authorities also said Mitchell had discussed killing her husband, Lyle Mitchell, as part of the plot.
"Joyce Mitchell tells us that was discussed between her and Matt and that upon their escape they were going to return back to Joyce Mitchell's home at which time Matt and Sweat were going to kill her husband," Wylie said.
Lyle Mitchell's lawyer, Peter Dumas, said June 18 that his client was shocked by word of the plot and that Joyce Mitchell had told her husband she couldn't go through with it and the inmates threatened to harm him.
"Toward the end, Joyce had told Lyle  and we have no reason to doubt it  that she told Sweat and Matt that she wasn't going to go through with it," he said. "At that point, they threatened her by threatening Lyle, saying they were going to have someone on the outside do something to him or someone on the inside when he was back at work do something to him, so I think it was a point of control."
Lyle Mitchell was cooperating with authorities and wasn't facing charges.
On June 24, authorities charged Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer with promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct. Officials said he gave the two prisoners the frozen hamburger meat Joyce Mitchell had used to hide the tools she smuggled to Sweat and Matt. Palmer's attorney said he had no knowledge that the meat contained hacksaw blades, a bit and a screwdriver.
Dannemora, built in 1845, occupies just over 1 square mile within the northern reaches of the Adirondack Forest Preserve and is surrounded by forest and farmland. The stark white perimeter wall of the prison, topped with guard towers, borders a main street in the village's business district.
The escape was the first in history from Clinton Correctional's maximum-security portion. In July 2003, two convicted murderers used tools from a carpentry shop at Elmira Correctional Facility to dig a hole in the roof of their cell and a rope of bedsheets to go over the wall. They were captured within three days, and a subsequent state investigation cited lax inmate supervision, poor tool control and incomplete cell searches.

        <MainBody>Florida's largest insurer to ask for rate hikes in 2016
STOCK PHOTOGRAPHY
By The Associated Press
Published: Wednesday, June 24, 2015 at 05:39 PM.
TALLAHASSEE  Florida has dodged hurricanes for the last decade, but the state's largest property insurer says it needs to keep hiking the rates paid by those customers who live along the coast and in heavily populated South Florida.
The board of Citizens Property Insurance voted unanimously Wednesday to raise rates an average of 3.2 percent statewide, although the actual rates paid by homeowners could vary widely depending on where they live. Many inland customers with Citizens, for example, are expected to see a slight decrease.
Citizens officials approved the rate hike without any debate or discussion. State regulators must still sign off on the rate hike, but if it is approved the higher rates would take effect in February 2016.
Nearly half of the state-created insurer's 600,000 customers will actually see slight decreases in their rates according to figures drawn up by Citizens staff.
But those customers who live near the coast could pay an average of 8.6 percent more. Citizens officials say rate hikes are needed for homeowners in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties.
Citizens officials say there are several reasons for the need for higher rates in South Florida. One reason is that Citizens is shrinking in size due to an aggressive push by the insurer to have policyholders switch to privately run companies. That leaves Citizens with customers who are at a higher risk of storm damage.
Another reason cited by Citizens is that there has been a rise in South Florida claims associated with water damage that is not storm-related.
"Every year, Citizens' actuaries calculate rates based on the same methodology used by insurance companies all over the world, which compares potential risk to the ability to pay claims," said Chris Gardner, the chairman of Citizens Board of Governors, in a statement.
Gov. Rick Scott and legislators have pushed Citizens to trim the number of its policyholders. That's because Citizens is allowed under state law to impose a surcharge on most insurance policy holders, including those with auto insurance policies, if it cannot pay off its claims following a major storm.
Several years ago legislators capped the annual rate hikes at 10 percent.

Century plant
All she wanted was a bloom from her plant.
Unfortunately for Mickey Patterson, those blooms stood at least 20 feet in the air atop a century plant that she had placed in her yard in 1972. After years of waiting, the plant started putting up its massive stalk in March as it began its first and only blooming.
I thought if that thing had limbs I could climb up and cut a bloom, said the 94-year-old Fort Walton Beach resident.
But it didnt. Instead she called the Ocean City-Wright Fire Department, who brought out a fire truck equipped with a bucket, and lifted Patterson high enough up to cut a bloom herself.
Ive waited to pick that bloom for 43 years, remarked Patterson Thursday, as she showed off the large and unusual looking bloom to family and friends for photographs. It was worth it all.

Published: Wednesday, June 24, 2015 at 05:20 PM.
FORT WALTON BEACH  The final phase of the Bud and Dorie Day Patriots Trail will continue as planned despite funding for the project being vetoed by Gov. Rick Scott.
When Scotts $461 million in vetoes were announced Tuesday, city officials became concerned about the fate of the trail.
But City Manager Michael Beedie confirmed Wednesday that in late May his staff had requested  and was granted  a funding extension by the state Department of Economic Opportunity.
Because weve got an agreement, which is similar to a contract, the money is there, he said. We still have, like, $90,000 left to spend.
State Rep. Matt Gaetz praised the citys forethought and said he was pleased with the extension.
Thats a good thing, he said. We should put the money to use locally.
Initially, the city had to spend the remainder of its initial $125,000 allocation by June 30. Now it will have until Sept. 15 to complete the final phase of the trail  which includes the demolition of the Docie Bass Recreation Center and the construction of a courtyard with pavilions and landscaping in its place.
Weve basically got three months to do it, Beedie said. Its going to really push us into overdrive.
He said his staff is currently working on fast-tracking the design and should bid out the work in the next few weeks.
Patriots Trail, which officially opened to the public May 28, winds down Staff Drive, Nebraska Avenue and California Drive to Ferry Park. Its first phase features 16 historical markers with information about Bud and Dorie Days life together and was paid for primarily with an $88,000 grant from the Florida Recreational Trails program.

FORT WALTON BEACH  Richard Whittington fell asleep Thursday night in a small camper parked at what will become the areas first permanent cold night shelter.
Whittington, who has been living in his van since 2012, was the first official resident of the facility that will become One Hopeful Place.
The 61-year-old stayed at the plant, which is at the end of North Beal Extension, at the request of Community Solutions, the nonprofit developing the shelter.
The Community Development Corporation had stipulated in its grant that someone had to stay on site before the end of June to verify the sites worthiness and to make sure organizers were on pace.
Whittington was selected by local homeless advocates in the community.
I think its marvelous, said Whittington, who moved onto the streets after his mother died and he lost her home. The only drawback I see is its so out of the way.
Transportation can be such a fragile thing, he added. It can come and go on a whim.
The first phase of the shelter  a cold night shelter  is expected to be complete by the end of October. Subsequent phases will expand the facility.
Whittington works as a telemarketer, which helps him keep his car and pays for his basic needs. He doesnt make enough to get off the streets and hasnt had luck getting more substantial employment.
He says he hopes he doesnt have to use One Hopeful Place when it opens, but guesses he might still be on the streets.
The location is remote, he said, but beautiful
It was quiet, he said. It cooled off and was marvelous. You could hear the frogs and crickets. The rainfall on the roof put me to sleep. It was great.

        <MainBody>Couple sentenced in fatal stabbing case
Amy and Jeffrey Brandenburg
By KELLY HUMPHREY | Daily News
Published: Wednesday, June 24, 2015 at 05:03 PM.
CRESTVIEW  A husband and wife charged in connection with a fatal stabbing on March 8, 2014, have been sentenced after entering into plea agreements with the State Attorneys Office.
Circuit Judge Michael Flowers sentenced Jeffrey Allen Brandenburg on Tuesday to 30 years in the Florida Department of Corrections as a habitual felony offender. According to a press release from the State Attorneys Office, Brandenburg pleaded no contest to manslaughter in the death of Samuel Cornish, who was found on State Road 85 after suffering a stab wound to the chest.
According to earlier reports, Cornish was taken to North Okaloosa Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead. The Medical Examiners Office conducted an autopsy and determined he died from a lacerated aorta.
Brandenburg and his wife, Amy, fled to Brewton, Alabama, where they were arrested and detained on March 10.
A nearby business surveillance camera caught footage of a car that fit the description of one owned by the Brandenburgs, and a witness told investigators the couple complained about being ripped off while purchasing narcotics from Cornish, an earlier police report said.
The witness also told police the Brandenburgs said they saw Cornish walking down the road around and stopped their vehicle. The witness said Jeffrey Brandenburg got out and remained out of Amy Brandenburgs sight before he returned with blood on his hands.
The witness told investigators that Amy Brandenburg asked Jeffrey Brandenburg what had happened, and he cursed at her and told her to drive away, police reports said.
Jonathan Schlechter, who prosecuted the case, said Amy Brandenburg entered a plea to a charge of accessory after the fact to aggravated battery.
She was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days in the county jail, followed by four years of probation, Schlecter said. She also agreed to testify against her co-defendant.

        <MainBody>Google's search for test facility led to climatic lab (VIDEO)

EGLIN AFB  For two years researchers at Google have been working on a project using balloons to send wireless signals to underserved corners of the world.
Google describes it's "Project Loon" as "a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space, designed to connect people in rural and remote areas, help fill coverage gaps, and bring people back online after disasters."
The project marked the second anniversary of its inception by moving into the massive McKinley Climatic Laboratory.
VIDEO: See a Google video of the balloon concept.
"The McKinley Climatic Lab provides testing for commercial companies throughout the year," base spokeswoman Sara Vidoni said. "This testing ensures our engineers, machinists and staff remain well-equipped and prepared for when a military test needs to be accomplished. While in the facility, the customer sets the parameters needed to test the limits of their item and our team creates the weather conditions that will make that happen."
Vidoni added that while the main chamber at the McKinley Climatic Lab routinely tests items down to -65 degrees Fahrenheit, for the Google balloon test the chamber was lowered down to -83 degrees.
In an interview with Wired magazine, Google engineer Mahesh Krishnaswamy described the lab as a "giant refrigerator in Florida."
The lab's ability to produce sub-zero temperatures, high winds, rain and other challenging weather allows Google to simulate the conditions that its balloons might encounter while flying through the stratosphere.
"Our earliest tests started back in 2011, using a weather balloon and basic, off-the-shelf radio parts," a post on the company's Google+ page explained.
"These tests showed that balloon-powered Internet might just work, but the team knew that weather balloons wouldnt be a long term solution since they arent built to last in the stratosphere."
The Internet giant waited two years to get access to the McKinley lab. According to Krishnaswamy, the wait was worth it.
Weve never been able to look at the balloon in the cold, he told Wired. This allows us to get up close and personal at these temperatures  . The idea is to try and get a good understanding of how the materials behave.

        <MainBody>Summer school middle, high students released early
By STAFF REPORT | Daily News
Published: Wednesday, June 24, 2015 at 12:48 PM.
Middle and high school students attending summer school in Okaloosa County were sent home early Wednesday because of issues with the computer program they use.
Students were released about two hours early after it became clear a credit recovery program students use called Edgenuity was not going to fixed quickly, according to Assistant Superintendent Marcus Chambers.
The statewide issue began around 9 a.m. It also impacted Okaloosa Online.
We waited a decent amount of time, probably an hour an half, Chambers said.
Parents were notified classes were canceled for the day just before lunchtime, according to a news release from the district.
Chambers said they have summer school programs at every high school and middle school in the county except Ruckel and Lewis, which are combined into one program.
Summer school for the older students was expected to resume normal operations on Thursday.
Its a self-paced program, so theyll be able to pick up wherever they left off, Chambers said.
Elementary school students weren't affected.
Parents are asked to contact individual schools if they have additional questions.

Supreme Court rules gay marriage legal nationwide
The crowd reacts as the ruling on same-sex marriage was announced outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, Friday. The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the US.

Published: Friday, June 26, 2015 at 10:32 AM.
WASHINGTON  Same-sex couples won the right to marry nationwide Friday as a divided Supreme Court handed a crowning victory to the gay rights movement, setting off a jubilant cascade of long-delayed weddings in states where they had been forbidden.
"No longer may this liberty be denied," said Justice Anthony Kennedy.
The vote was narrow  5-4  but Kennedy's majority opinion was clear and firm: "The court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry."
The ruling will put an end to same-sex marriage bans in the 14 states that still maintain them, and provide an exclamation point for breathtaking changes in the nation's social norms in recent years. As recently as last October, just over one-third of the states permitted gay marriages.
Kennedy's reading of the ruling elicited tears in the courtroom, euphoria outside and the immediate issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples in at least eight states. In Dallas, Kenneth Denson said he and Gabriel Mendez had been legally married in 2013 in California but "we're Texans; we want to get married in Texas."
In praise of the decision, President Barack Obama called it "justice that arrives like a thunderbolt."
Four of the court's justices weren't cheering. The dissenters accused their colleagues of usurping power that belongs to the states and to voters, and short-circuiting a national debate about same-sex marriage.
"This court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent. Roberts read a summary of his dissent from the bench, the first time he has done so in nearly 10 years as chief justice.
"If you are among the many Americans  of whatever sexual orientation  who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision," Roberts said. "But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it."
Justice Antonin Scalia said he was not concerned so much about same-sex marriage as "this court's threat to American democracy." He termed the decision a "judicial putsch." Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also dissented.
Several religious organizations criticized the decision.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said it was "profoundly immoral and unjust for the government to declare that two people of the same sex can constitute a marriage."
Kennedy said nothing in the court's ruling would force religions to condone, much less perform, weddings to which they object. And he said the couples seeking the right to marry should not have to wait for the political branches of government to act.
The 14th Amendment to the Constitution requires states to allow same-sex couples to marry on the same basis as heterosexuals, he said
"The dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right. The nation's courts are open to injured individuals who come to them to vindicate their own direct, personal stake in our basic charter," Kennedy wrote in his fourth major opinion in support of gay rights since 1996. It came on the anniversary of two of those earlier decisions.
"No union is more profound than marriage," Kennedy wrote, joined by the court's four more liberal justices.
The stories of the people asking for the right to marry "reveal that they seek not to denigrate marriage but rather to live their lives, or honor their spouses' memory, joined by its bond," Kennedy said.
As he read his opinion, spectators in the courtroom wiped away tears when the import of the decision became clear. One of those in the audience was James Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court fight.
Outside, Obergefell held up a photo of his late spouse, John Arthur, and said the ruling establishes that "our love is equal." He added, "This is for you, John."
Obama placed a congratulatory phone call to Obergefell, which he took amid a throng of reporters outside the courthouse.
Speaking a few minutes later at the White House, Obama praised the decision as an affirmation of the principle that "all Americans are created equal."
The crowd in front of the courthouse at the top of Capitol Hill grew in the minutes following the ruling. The Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C., sang the "Star-Spangled Banner." Motorists honked their horns in support as they passed by the crowd, which included a smattering of same-sex marriage opponents.
The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration. But county clerks in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas began issuing licenses to same-sex couples within hours of the decision.
The cases before the court involved laws from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Those states have not allowed same-sex couples to marry within their borders, and they also have refused to recognize valid marriages from elsewhere.
Just two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law that denied a range of government benefits to legally married same-sex couples.
Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor formed the majority with Kennedy on Friday, the same lineup as two years ago.
The earlier decision in United States v. Windsor did not address the validity of state marriage bans, but courts across the country, with few exceptions, said its logic compelled them to invalidate state laws that prohibited gay and lesbian couples from marrying.
There are an estimated 390,000 married same-sex couples in the United States, according to UCLA's Williams Institute, which tracks the demographics of gay and lesbian Americans. Another 70,000 couples living in states that do not currently permit them to wed would get married in the next three years, the institute says. Roughly 1 million same-sex couples, married and unmarried, live together in the United States, the institute says.
The Obama administration backed the right of same-sex couples to marry. The Justice Department's decision to stop defending the federal anti-marriage law in 2011 was an important moment for gay rights, and Obama declared his support for same-sex marriage in 2012.
The states affected by Friday's ruling are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, most of Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States.
Gay and lesbian couples already could marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The court's 5-4 ruling means the remaining 14 states, in the South and Midwest, will have to stop enforcing their bans on same-sex marriage.
The outcome is the culmination of two decades of Supreme Court litigation over marriage, and gay rights generally.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, just as he did in the court's previous three major gay rights cases dating back to 1996. It came on the anniversary of two of those earlier decisions.
"No union is more profound than marriage," Kennedy wrote, joined by the court's four more liberal justices.
The four dissenting justices each filed a separate opinion explaining their views.
"But this court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent. Roberts read a summary of his dissent from the bench, the first time he has done so in nearly 10 years as chief justice.

The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration. But some state officials and county clerks might decide there is little risk in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

10:15 a.m.
The Supreme Court ruling that grants same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide comes on a date with legal significance.
Two previous rulings by the high court also came on June 26. Both were also written by Justice Anthony Kennedy 
In 2003, the court issued its ruling in the case Lawrence versus Texas, striking down state laws that made gay sex a crime.
And on the same date in 2013, it struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law in the case U.S. versus Windsor.

NICEVILLE - A 21-year-old Niceville woman is in custody after a warrant was issued due to charges that she attacked her boyfriend with a stiletto.
The woman, who is not being named to protect the victim's identity, was arrested on June 7.
The attack occurred on March 28, around 6:30 p.m., according to the arrest report. She and her boyfriend were reportedly living together in a room at Tisa's Friendly Inn.
The woman hit her boyfriend in the head with the heel of a four-inch stiletto shoe, the report said. He was treated for a three-inch wound to his head.
The wound went through the skin stopping at the skull (approximately three centimeters deep) and required six staples to close, a doctor reported to Niceville Police officers. A witness told police that the woman repeatedly said, "I did not mean to hurt him."
She is charged with aggravated battery causing great bodily harm.

CRESTVIEW - A 20-year-old Freeport man is accused of trespassing at a home after telling an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy that he encountered that he was going to back to the home.
The man was issued a trespass warning at the home on June 7 around 10 p.m., according to the arrest report. The homeowner called police to report that he was at work and his daughter was home alone.
The man was knocking on all of the exterior doors and windows and had tried to use a credit card to gain entry to the home, the report said. The daughter said she'd opened the door and told the man to leave.
Crestview Police officers issued a trespass warning at the homeowner's request.
On June 8, around 4 a.m., a mere six hours later, the man encountered a deputy during an unrelated incident, according to the report. He allegedly told the deputy that he was going to return to a residence that he'd been trespassed from earlier that evening.
While conducting a security check on the home, a Crestview officer saw the man go onto the property.
The man is charged with misdemeanor trespassing.
His next scheduled court date is July 7.
