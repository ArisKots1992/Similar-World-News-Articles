DeFUNIAK SPRINGS  One passenger on a church bus that crashed on Interstate 10 on Friday suffered serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
Madison Brennan, 18, of Pineville, La., was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola, the FHP reported Saturday.
Brennan was one of 21 people who were taken to several hospitals after the 2010 Ford bus crashed at 2:50 p.m. just west of U.S. Highway 331.
The bus was traveling east when it veered off the highway and hit two trees, according to the FHP. The driver, 50-year-old Derek Griffin of Pineville, apparently lost control on a slight curve in the road.
The bus was carrying 23 passengers ranging from 15 to 18 years old.
Griffin, who suffered minor injuries, was one of seven people who were taken to Healthmark Regional Medical Center in DeFuniak Springs.
The other 13 passengers who were hurt were taken to Twin Cities Hospital in Niceville, North Okaloosa Medical Center in Crestview and Sacred Heart Hospital on the Emerald Coast in Miramar Beach.
Emergency responders said Friday that none of the injuries was life-threatening. No further details were available from the hospitals Saturday.
The bus, which sustained $10,000 in damage, was traveling with another bus and a passenger van from the church. The FHP report did not identify the church.
Passengers in the other vehicles were taken to the DeFuniak Springs Community Center after the accident.
The FHP said Saturday that its investigation was continuing.

        <MainBody>Local homicides are up in 2015
By TRISTA PRUETT | Daily News
Published: Saturday, June 27, 2015 at 06:30 PM.
In the past six months, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa Counties have seen what seems, anecdotally, to be a spike in violence, with five homicides and a non-fatal shooting between three departments.
Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office shared some numbers, noting that crime had actually gone down in the last couple of years.
There was a 55 percent increase from 2009 to 2010 and another 15 percent increase from 2011 to 2012.
However, 2013 brought an increase in the budget and a drop in violent crime of more than 10 percent, they said.
Violent crime went down another 3 percent in 2014.
We are tremendously concerned anytime any one is a victim of violent crime, said Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We need resources to work to prevent crime, not just react. We have the same manpower levels we had in 2007.
Below is a look back at each shooting by department:
Okaloosa County Sheriffs Office
The first shooting was that of 18-year-old Mark Anthony Williams, whose body was seen by a passing motorist along the wood line of State Road 85 South of Duke Field on Jan. 21.
His body was autopsied and Williams was found to have died from a gunshot wound, Okaloosa County Sheriffs Department announced less than a week later.
Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Michele Nicholson said Friday they are still waiting on some forensics results from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Lab.
However, she said they are constantly working on the case, re-interviewing people and reviewing evidence.
The second from Okaloosa County was more recent.
On June 24, residents around a Marty Lane mobile home heard multiple gunshots around 5:20 a.m. When deputies arrived, they found 39-year-old Jimmy Lee Dodds body outside of his mobile home.
Investigators brought in K-9s, and Dodds body was taken in for autopsy.
Both deaths remain under investigation.
As these are all active criminal investigations, we are not able to release additional details publicly. We do not want to jeopardize any of the evidence weve gathered to this point, Nicholson said Friday.
The Sheriffs Office is also investigating a non-fatal shooting on Carmel Drive on June 18.
The Sheriffs Office reported that two men were shot by a homeowner during an attempted home invasion. One of the men later told deputies that hed had no idea the other was going to attempt to break into a home.
Both men were hospitalized later that day with gunshots wounds.
No charges have been filed against anyone.
The Sheriff's Office reported two homicides in 2014: the man charged with killing his mother in Mary Esther and the woman charged with killing her newborn in Fort Walton Beach.
She noted that they have also had two men arrested for attempted murder this year, both in the first full week of May.
We are actively working both the Williams and Dodd murder cases as well as the Carmel Drive shooting as vigorously as possible, Nicholson said. We want to continue to encourage anyone with information, no matter how minor they think it is, to contact our agency either via a call to the OCSO at 850-651-7400 or through Emerald Coast Crime Stoppers at 850-863-TIPS.
Fort Walton Beach Police Department
Fort Walton Beach added two homicides in less than a week to those numbers.
Fort Walton Beach Police Capt. Tom Matz noted that last year, there were no homicides in the city departments jurisdiction.
On June 11, late in the evening, a man heard a single gunshot outside of his Cape Drive residence.
He looked out the window to find that Randy Campbell, also known as Randy Shareef Ali, was dead outside.
At the time, Police Chief Ted Litzchauer said people of interest had been identified and were being interviewed.
Less than a week later, on June 17, 89-year-old Freddie Cason was shot and killed in the home hed lived in for more than 40 years.
A man then barricaded himself in the home until eventually surrendering to police. He was interviewed multiple times as a person of interest before being released.
Matz said there is not believed to be any connection between the two.
Were concerned about all homicides, he said. We respond the same way on each homicide. We devote all available resources towards the investigation in seeking the truth.
He said they had no updates to release on either case as of Friday, but said citizens should know law enforcement is doing all they can to address all crime issues.
The citizens should remain cognizant, keeping aware of the activities around them at all times, Matz said. Please remember it takes a partnership between the citizens and law enforcement to address crime.
He asked that anyone with information about either case call the department at 833-9546 or Emerald Coast Crime Stoppers.
Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office
In Santa Rosa County, 43-year-old Stephen Richmond Rice was found dead in his home on Persimmon Hollow Road on March 26.
Soon after his body was discovered, Santa Rosa County Sheriffs Office said hed been dead for an undetermined amount of time and foul play was suspected.
On April 29, they asked for any former customers of Rice, who ran a business via the internet and person to person sales, to come forward.
The believed one of his customers might have information that could assist in the homicide investigation.
On Thursday, Sheriffs Office spokesperson Sgt. Rich Aloy said that Santa Rosa County had not had an increase in homicides.
He declined to comment further, but did encourage anyone with information to call Det. Gary Baney at 850-983-1296 or Santa Rosa County Crime Stoppers at 850-437-STOP.

HURLBURT FIELD You cant count on phone lines or other ways to communicate during a hurricane or other natural disaster.
Thats when ham radio operators step up.
For us to ask for help, provide communication with the outside world, let your family know youre okay, this is how its going to be done, Mo Hodgdon,chairman of the Playground Amateur Radio Clubs annual Field Day, said as he sat in front of a radio powered by a battery.
For more photos, click here.
Field Day is an exercise for amateur radio operators to make as many contacts across North America as possible. About 10 operators monitored the radio wavesSaturdayat stations set up on tables at Hurlburt Fields picnic area.
Well be making some (contacts) with Morse code. Well be making some with digital. Well be making some with voice, or what we call phone, Hodgdon said.
For a video, click here.
He expected to make 300 to 400 contacts between1 p.m.Saturdayand10 a.m.today.
The Field Day also gave people not familiar with the radios a chance to see them in action and send out some signals with supervision from PARC members.
Hodgdon said hes been able to contact radio operators in France, Japan and Australia over the years. He hoped to try contact with the International Space Stationon Saturdayevening.
Some places youll never get, like North Korea, Hodgdon said.

Okaloosa County announced it was the second best performing school district overall in the state on the most recent testing data released.
The ranking occurred after students showed improvement over the previous year in three of the four exam results released by the Florida Department of Education earlier this month.
The improvements Okaloosa has seen over the last couple of years is a real testament to what a team can accomplish when they work together on a common goal, said Superintendent Mary Beth Jackson. I am honored to represent the extraordinary students and teachers that make us an academically top performing District in Florida.
A big part of the team were the teachers and administrators who diligently worked through the ever-changing state standards to help students excel on their state end of course exams, according to Assistant Superintendent Marcus Chambers.
Our teachers showed their commitment to their students in what was arguably the hardest year in education. Chambers said. We are fortunate to have teachers and administrators who spend countless hours to help students find success.
Below is a breakdown of student performance this year compared to last year on the five exam results released:

Villani looks ahead to retirement (VIDEO)
Okaloosa County Public Safety Director Dino Villani poses at the Emergency Operations Center at the Northwest Florida State College. Villani will retire in early July after 15 years of guiding the county through everything from wild fires and hurricanes to ice storms and floods.

Hurricanes. Floods. Oil spills. Ice storms.
After 15 years of guiding Okaloosa County through some of its worst disasters, Public Safety Director Dino Villani is calling it a career.
But like a true emergency junkie, hes giving out his cell phone number  just in case.
I dont want to leave anyone in the lurch, he said with a smile. If anyone needs anything, I will be around.
For a video of Villani reflecting on his last 15 years, click here.
Villani got his start as an EMT in the Everglades and planned to be a doctor but veered off into emergency management instead. He began working for Okaloosa County in 2002 after serving as the EMS bureau chief in Tallahassee for the state Department of Health.
The job was here, so it worked out, but I came here because I wanted to live here, he said. Its beautiful.
Not even Hurricane Ivan  which tops Villanis list of disasters  could change that. In the face of washed out highways, widespread destruction and the loss of water and power for days, the county took a major hit but emerged better off.
In terms of the value of that event making us more prepared, that was immeasurable, he said. That was the ultimate test.
And it led to Villanis dream of building countys state-of-the-art Emergency Operations Center, now in use at Northwest Florida State College in Niceville.
This was the vision right here, he said, standing in the giant control room that features a 10-foot-by-34-foot screen and other smaller screens for monitoring weather and news. Its constantly being used. Its designed to hold 200 people every day for two full weeks.
The countys emergency phone and text alert system also arose out of Ivan  a time when the county was bombarded with more than 100,000 phone calls.
Almost six years after Hurricane Ivan came the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill  an event that reinforced the need to disseminate information quickly.
We had tremendous public pressure for information, and we had to answer for everything, Villani said. The public was afraid and they were reacting. ... It really makes you think on your feet.

'Starting crazy early:' Some colleges are recruiting athletes in middle school
Tommy Johnson, left, talks with a friend in this yearbook photo following a game against Walton County in 1991.
SPECIAL TO THE DAILY NEWS
By TRAVIS MEWHIRTER | Daily News

Tommy Johnson was, as he tells it, elbow deep in flour when a manager at Kentucky Fried Chicken peeled around the corner, the fast food chains phone in hand.
Its for you, she said, shrugging at the 17-year-old football player. Somebody named Joe Paterno.
Johnson was a Niceville senior. Prior to that phone call he hadnt thought much about going to school. He had decided he would go into the military.
It is difficult to comprehend now, a football player less than a year away from high school graduation, showing interest only when one of the greatest coaches in the history of football was on the other line of a phone. 
The thought of going to college was not something that was going through my mind my junior or senior years, said Johnson, who went on to play for Alabama and is now the football coach and athletic director for Fort Walton Beach. I enjoyed playing football and I loved playing football. It just wasnt as big of a thing as it is now. We didnt have all the ESPNs and things like that, highlighting everything that a kid did.
"Nowadays kids, even if theyre not that good, they just assume they should be being recruited," he added.
Nowadays, if kids dont get something by the time theyre upperclassmen, theyre surprised, discouraged, stressed.
There is a 10-year-old athlete in the area receiving interest from an SEC school. There are middle schoolers around the country receiving verbal offers.
The recruitment process has jumped down a rabbit hole that has no foreseeable way out.
Everybodys targeting the younger kids now, telling them what they want to hear and holding on to them, Paxton basketball coach Jeff Bradley said. These kids are getting dragged along and theyre just a number to them. Theyre not anything more than a number. Thats starting crazy early.
Sami Mims was, in her mind, late. A freshman at Niceville in 2012, she had just begun playing volleyball.
By then girls were already sending out highlight tapes, she said.
High school freshmen are as predictable as the weather. There is no telling what their mood will be tomorrow, much less four years from then, a point raised by Navarre football coach Jay Walls in regards to schools offering 13- and 14-year-old kids.
Sometimes you just have to wonder, he said. How do they know?
Truth is, they dont.
The more difficult truth: They may no longer have a choice.
Its absolutely gotten nuts, Northwest Florida State softball coach Jack Byerly said. When I was at a four-year school (Auburn from 2004-2008), we brought them in senior year for a visit and they committed. Now if they dont commit to you in the eighth grade, youre behind the times.
Its crazy to me. I dont understand it. You have no idea what these kids are going to do. What were you thinking about when you were 14? Youre losing the joy of it because all of a sudden its become so competitive that its all you think about," he added. "You have these big tournaments and these big time coaches coming to watch you play. Its a totally different stage.
NCAA rules regarding athletes signing have remained rigid, antiquated. An athlete still cannot sign with a school until a year prior to them leaving for college. Maybe there is a solution on the horizon, maybe not. Neither Walls nor Bradley nor Johnson nor any of the other dozen coaches interviewed for this story posed a cure-all for the anarchy that has become recruiting.
Theres no way to really stop the escalation right now, Barton Simmons, the director of scouting for 247 Sports, said. The fact that colleges are recruiting kids that are freshmen and sophomores means that everybody has to do it.
You cant really sit on the sidelines because you dont believe in it," he added. "In a perfect world, youd go after a kid after his senior year because you get the full body of work and the kid can make a sound decision but of course thats not how it works."
Note to Readers:
This series began marinating in my head when I was working for a paper in Maryland and covered an athlete who had received offers to play basketball for every ACC school as a freshman. With our schedule easing over the summer, I had time to dig into this new world of recruiting, and down the rabbit hole I went. Nearly two dozen coaches, athletes and parents were interviewed for this series, each providing a new perspective on the volatile process that has become recruiting.

        <title>Mythbusting Vibrio</title>
        <Link>http://www.nwfdailynews.com/local/mythbusting-vibrio-1.494396</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>By JENNIE McKEON | Daily News
Published: Saturday, June 27, 2015 at 05:42 PM.
The headlines about the "flesh-eating" bacteria that waits for you at the beach are over-hyped.
"There's a few misnomers," said Ryan Mims, public information officer for the Florida Department of Health in Okaloosa County. "Those headlines cause a lot of panic, but if you're a healthy individual and practice good hygiene there's a low risk of you contracting vibrio vulnificus."
Here's the facts about vibrio:
First, what is vibrio vulnificus?
Vibrio Vulnificus, or vibrio, is a bacterium that is normally found in warm saltwater. Coastlines throughout the U.S. can be a host for vibrio. There's two ways to contract vibrio, said Mims. First, by entering saltwater with open wounds and second, by ingesting undercooked shellfish and oysters. So far this year, Santa Rosa County has had one case of vibrio. Walton and Okaloosa County have not any cases.
How do I know if I have vibrio?
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of vibrio is acute illness, which can begin one to three days after exposure or as late as seven days in a small percentage of cases. If exposed by an open wound, you may see increased swelling, redness and pain at the site of the wound. You may also notice swelling and redness on arms and legs with blood-tinged blisters and low blood pressure or shock.
"It's not a flesh-eating bacteria," Mims said.
There is a chance of amputation in severe cases, but if treated in a timely and effective manner , those who recover should see no long-term effects, Mims added.
How do I prevent vibrio?
Don't immediately fret if you get a paper cut at the beach. Vibrio is preventable.
"It can be a serious disease and even lead to death, but if you take proper care, your risk should be minimal," said Dr. Carina Blackmore, deputy state epidemiologist in a video on the DOH-Okaloosa website.
With that being said, those with underlying health conditions and compromised immune deficiencies, especially those with chronic liver disease, have a higher risk of contracting vibro, said Blackmore. Perform first aid before wounds become infected and keep wounds covered with dry, clean bandages. And cook your shellfish thoroughly. Oysters can also be carriers if the bacteria is present in their environment, but can only legally be harvested in from waters free from contamination.
Safety and oysters
Follow these tips from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when cooking at home for safe meals
When you purchase oysters the shells should be closed. Throw away any oysters with shells already opened.
In the shell: After the shells open, boil live oysters for another 3-5 minutes. (Use small pots to boil or steam oysters. Do not cook too many oysters in the same pot because the ones in the middle may not get fully cooked. Discard any oysters that do not open during cooking).
In a steamer: Add oysters to water that is already steaming and cook live oysters for another 4-9 minutes.
Shucked Oysters:
Boil or simmer shucked oysters for at least 3 minutes or until the edges curl.
Fry at 375 degrees for at least 3 minutes.
Broil 3 inches from heat for 3 minutes.
Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes.

DeFUNIAK SPRINGS  Twenty people were taken to area hospitals Friday after authorities say a church school bus traveling on Interstate 10 veered off the highway and hit a tree.
The crash was reported at 3:10 p.m. just west of State Road 331 near DeFuniak Springs, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
The bus was one of three vehicles from a church in Louisiana that were heading east on I-10, said Bryan Pierce, a battalion chief from Walton County Fire Rescue. He was not sure why the bus left the road.
Twenty people were taken to hospitals, although none of them suffered life-threatening injuries, Pierce said.
Seven were taken to Healthmark Regional Medical Center in DeFuniak Springs; one was taken to Twin Cities Hospital in Niceville; seven were taken to Sacred Heart on the Emerald Coast in Miramar Beach; and five were taken to North Okaloosa Medical Center in Crestview.
About 40 people were in a second bus and a passenger van that were traveling with the bus that wrecked. They were taken to DeFuniak Springs Community Center for the night, according to Pierce and the Walton County Sheriffs Office.
Many of the people who were hurt were youths. The bus driver and chaperones were adults, Pierce said.
The wreck closed one eastbound lane of I-10.
We did back up traffic for miles, Im afraid, Pierce said.
FHP was investigating the crash, but had released no details Friday night.
Walton County sheriffs deputies and DeFuniak Springs police and firefighters assisted at the scene.

        <MainBody>Police called for fight at Tom Thumb

NICEVILLE - Police were called for a fight at Tom Thumb between two women during a custody exchange.
Niceville Police officers were called around June 10 for a disturbance at Tom Thumb, according to the call log. The disturbance started out as a verbal argument during a child exchange.
The man's ex wife and his current wife had an argument that became physical in the parking lot, the log said. The current wife put her arm up to "keep the ex wife out of her face" and the ex wife grabbed her arm and scratched her.
The man left both women at Tom Thumb and took the children home before going to the police department, according to the log. No charges were filed because both women were found to have an equal part in the fight.

        <MainBody>Man claims paraphernalia belongs to his 'hooker girlfriend'

NICEVILLE - A 31-year-old Niceville man facing drug paraphernalia charges reportedly told officers that it belonged to his "hooker girlfriend."
The man was pulled over for a faulty tag light around 11:15 p.m. on June 10, according to the arrest report. He was allegedly "shaking a lot" and "was so shaky he threw" his license "out the window."
Niceville Police officers asked the man if there was anything in his car that would get him into trouble, because he seemed nervous, the report said. The man said there wasn't.
Police asked for permission to search the vehicle and the man agreed, telling officers that he kept his car "immaculate," and had just finished vacuuming it, according to the report. Police found a spoon with white and green powder and a cotton ball that was "saturated with powder" under the driver's seat.
When the man saw the spoon, he told officers it belonged to his "hooker girlfriend" and that she'd left it in his car, the report said. He also allegedly told officers that he'd told her not to leave the rest of the pill on the spoon and to lick if off the spoon instead.
He is charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.
His next scheduled court date is June 30.

One escaped murderer fatally shot; other is on run
Authorities search an area in Constable, N.Y,. for convicted murderers Richard Matt and David Sweat on Friday. Police shifted a focus of their three-week search closer to the Canadian border.

Published: Friday, June 26, 2015 at 05:06 PM.
MALONE, N.Y.  One of two convicted killers who staged a brazen escape from an upstate maximum-security prison and had been hunted for three weeks was shot and killed Friday, but the other is still on the run.
An official with knowledge of the manhunt said Richard Matt was killed and David Sweat is still on the run. The official wasn't authorized to talk about the development publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo says Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall, squirmed through pipes and escaped early on June 6 from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, near the Canadian border.
Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy in Broome County in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss.
A civilian worker at the prison was charged with helping the killers flee by giving them hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools.
Prosecutors said Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailoring shop instructor who got close to the men while working with them, had agreed to be their getaway driver but backed out because she felt guilty for participating. Mitchell pleaded not guilty on June 15 to charges including felony promoting prison contraband.
Authorities said the men had filled their beds in their adjacent cells with clothes to make it appear they were sleeping when guards made overnight rounds. On a cut steam pipe, the prisoners left a taunting note containing a crude caricature of an Asian face and the words "Have a nice day."
Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said they apparently used tools stored by prison contractors, taking care to return them to their toolboxes after each night's work.
Authorities also said Mitchell had discussed killing her husband, Lyle Mitchell, as part of the plot.
"Joyce Mitchell tells us that was discussed between her and Matt and that upon their escape they were going to return back to Joyce Mitchell's home at which time Matt and Sweat were going to kill her husband," Wylie said.
Lyle Mitchell's lawyer, Peter Dumas, said June 18 that his client was shocked by word of the plot and that Joyce Mitchell had told her husband she couldn't go through with it and the inmates threatened to harm him.
"Toward the end, Joyce had told Lyle  and we have no reason to doubt it  that she told Sweat and Matt that she wasn't going to go through with it," he said. "At that point, they threatened her by threatening Lyle, saying they were going to have someone on the outside do something to him or someone on the inside when he was back at work do something to him, so I think it was a point of control."
Lyle Mitchell was cooperating with authorities and wasn't facing charges.
On June 24, authorities charged Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer with promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct. Officials said he gave the two prisoners the frozen hamburger meat Joyce Mitchell had used to hide the tools she smuggled to Sweat and Matt. Palmer's attorney said he had no knowledge that the meat contained hacksaw blades, a bit and a screwdriver.
Dannemora, built in 1845, occupies just over 1 square mile within the northern reaches of the Adirondack Forest Preserve and is surrounded by forest and farmland. The stark white perimeter wall of the prison, topped with guard towers, borders a main street in the village's business district.
The escape was the first in history from Clinton Correctional's maximum-security portion. In July 2003, two convicted murderers used tools from a carpentry shop at Elmira Correctional Facility to dig a hole in the roof of their cell and a rope of bedsheets to go over the wall. They were captured within three days, and a subsequent state investigation cited lax inmate supervision, poor tool control and incomplete cell searches.

Century plant
All she wanted was a bloom from her plant.
Unfortunately for Mickey Patterson, those blooms stood at least 20 feet in the air atop a century plant that she had placed in her yard in 1972. After years of waiting, the plant started putting up its massive stalk in March as it began its first and only blooming.
I thought if that thing had limbs I could climb up and cut a bloom, said the 94-year-old Fort Walton Beach resident.
But it didnt. Instead she called the Ocean City-Wright Fire Department, who brought out a fire truck equipped with a bucket, and lifted Patterson high enough up to cut a bloom herself.
Ive waited to pick that bloom for 43 years, remarked Patterson Thursday, as she showed off the large and unusual looking bloom to family and friends for photographs. It was worth it all.

Shelter-in-progress gets first guest
Richard Whittington was the first official resident of One Hopeful Place, which will open this fall. He stayed in a camper at the old sewage plant at the organizers request.

FORT WALTON BEACH  Richard Whittington fell asleep Thursday night in a small camper parked at what will become the areas first permanent cold night shelter.
Whittington, who has been living in his van since 2012, was the first official resident of the facility that will become One Hopeful Place.
The 61-year-old stayed at the plant, which is at the end of North Beal Extension, at the request of Community Solutions, the nonprofit developing the shelter.
The Community Development Corporation had stipulated in its grant that someone had to stay on site before the end of June to verify the sites worthiness and to make sure organizers were on pace.
Whittington was selected by local homeless advocates in the community.
I think its marvelous, said Whittington, who moved onto the streets after his mother died and he lost her home. The only drawback I see is its so out of the way.
Transportation can be such a fragile thing, he added. It can come and go on a whim.
The first phase of the shelter  a cold night shelter  is expected to be complete by the end of October. Subsequent phases will expand the facility.
Whittington works as a telemarketer, which helps him keep his car and pays for his basic needs. He doesnt make enough to get off the streets and hasnt had luck getting more substantial employment.
He says he hopes he doesnt have to use One Hopeful Place when it opens, but guesses he might still be on the streets.
The location is remote, he said, but beautiful
It was quiet, he said. It cooled off and was marvelous. You could hear the frogs and crickets. The rainfall on the roof put me to sleep. It was great.

EGLIN AFB  For two years researchers at Google have been working on a project using balloons to send wireless signals to underserved corners of the world.
Google describes it's "Project Loon" as "a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space, designed to connect people in rural and remote areas, help fill coverage gaps, and bring people back online after disasters."
The project marked the second anniversary of its inception by moving into the massive McKinley Climatic Laboratory.
VIDEO: See a Google video of the balloon concept.
"The McKinley Climatic Lab provides testing for commercial companies throughout the year," base spokeswoman Sara Vidoni said. "This testing ensures our engineers, machinists and staff remain well-equipped and prepared for when a military test needs to be accomplished. While in the facility, the customer sets the parameters needed to test the limits of their item and our team creates the weather conditions that will make that happen."
Vidoni added that while the main chamber at the McKinley Climatic Lab routinely tests items down to -65 degrees Fahrenheit, for the Google balloon test the chamber was lowered down to -83 degrees.
In an interview with Wired magazine, Google engineer Mahesh Krishnaswamy described the lab as a "giant refrigerator in Florida."
The lab's ability to produce sub-zero temperatures, high winds, rain and other challenging weather allows Google to simulate the conditions that its balloons might encounter while flying through the stratosphere.
"Our earliest tests started back in 2011, using a weather balloon and basic, off-the-shelf radio parts," a post on the company's Google+ page explained.
"These tests showed that balloon-powered Internet might just work, but the team knew that weather balloons wouldnt be a long term solution since they arent built to last in the stratosphere."
The Internet giant waited two years to get access to the McKinley lab. According to Krishnaswamy, the wait was worth it.
Weve never been able to look at the balloon in the cold, he told Wired. This allows us to get up close and personal at these temperatures  . The idea is to try and get a good understanding of how the materials behave.

Supreme Court rules gay marriage legal nationwide
The crowd reacts as the ruling on same-sex marriage was announced outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, Friday. The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the US.

Published: Friday, June 26, 2015 at 10:32 AM.
WASHINGTON  Same-sex couples won the right to marry nationwide Friday as a divided Supreme Court handed a crowning victory to the gay rights movement, setting off a jubilant cascade of long-delayed weddings in states where they had been forbidden.
"No longer may this liberty be denied," said Justice Anthony Kennedy.
The vote was narrow  5-4  but Kennedy's majority opinion was clear and firm: "The court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry."
The ruling will put an end to same-sex marriage bans in the 14 states that still maintain them, and provide an exclamation point for breathtaking changes in the nation's social norms in recent years. As recently as last October, just over one-third of the states permitted gay marriages.
Kennedy's reading of the ruling elicited tears in the courtroom, euphoria outside and the immediate issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples in at least eight states. In Dallas, Kenneth Denson said he and Gabriel Mendez had been legally married in 2013 in California but "we're Texans; we want to get married in Texas."
In praise of the decision, President Barack Obama called it "justice that arrives like a thunderbolt."
Four of the court's justices weren't cheering. The dissenters accused their colleagues of usurping power that belongs to the states and to voters, and short-circuiting a national debate about same-sex marriage.
"This court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent. Roberts read a summary of his dissent from the bench, the first time he has done so in nearly 10 years as chief justice.
"If you are among the many Americans  of whatever sexual orientation  who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision," Roberts said. "But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it."
Justice Antonin Scalia said he was not concerned so much about same-sex marriage as "this court's threat to American democracy." He termed the decision a "judicial putsch." Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also dissented.
Several religious organizations criticized the decision.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said it was "profoundly immoral and unjust for the government to declare that two people of the same sex can constitute a marriage."
Kennedy said nothing in the court's ruling would force religions to condone, much less perform, weddings to which they object. And he said the couples seeking the right to marry should not have to wait for the political branches of government to act.
The 14th Amendment to the Constitution requires states to allow same-sex couples to marry on the same basis as heterosexuals, he said
"The dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right. The nation's courts are open to injured individuals who come to them to vindicate their own direct, personal stake in our basic charter," Kennedy wrote in his fourth major opinion in support of gay rights since 1996. It came on the anniversary of two of those earlier decisions.
"No union is more profound than marriage," Kennedy wrote, joined by the court's four more liberal justices.
The stories of the people asking for the right to marry "reveal that they seek not to denigrate marriage but rather to live their lives, or honor their spouses' memory, joined by its bond," Kennedy said.
As he read his opinion, spectators in the courtroom wiped away tears when the import of the decision became clear. One of those in the audience was James Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court fight.
Outside, Obergefell held up a photo of his late spouse, John Arthur, and said the ruling establishes that "our love is equal." He added, "This is for you, John."
Obama placed a congratulatory phone call to Obergefell, which he took amid a throng of reporters outside the courthouse.
Speaking a few minutes later at the White House, Obama praised the decision as an affirmation of the principle that "all Americans are created equal."
The crowd in front of the courthouse at the top of Capitol Hill grew in the minutes following the ruling. The Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C., sang the "Star-Spangled Banner." Motorists honked their horns in support as they passed by the crowd, which included a smattering of same-sex marriage opponents.
The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration. But county clerks in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas began issuing licenses to same-sex couples within hours of the decision.
The cases before the court involved laws from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Those states have not allowed same-sex couples to marry within their borders, and they also have refused to recognize valid marriages from elsewhere.
Just two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law that denied a range of government benefits to legally married same-sex couples.
Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor formed the majority with Kennedy on Friday, the same lineup as two years ago.
The earlier decision in United States v. Windsor did not address the validity of state marriage bans, but courts across the country, with few exceptions, said its logic compelled them to invalidate state laws that prohibited gay and lesbian couples from marrying.
There are an estimated 390,000 married same-sex couples in the United States, according to UCLA's Williams Institute, which tracks the demographics of gay and lesbian Americans. Another 70,000 couples living in states that do not currently permit them to wed would get married in the next three years, the institute says. Roughly 1 million same-sex couples, married and unmarried, live together in the United States, the institute says.
The Obama administration backed the right of same-sex couples to marry. The Justice Department's decision to stop defending the federal anti-marriage law in 2011 was an important moment for gay rights, and Obama declared his support for same-sex marriage in 2012.
The states affected by Friday's ruling are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, most of Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States.
Gay and lesbian couples already could marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The court's 5-4 ruling means the remaining 14 states, in the South and Midwest, will have to stop enforcing their bans on same-sex marriage.
The outcome is the culmination of two decades of Supreme Court litigation over marriage, and gay rights generally.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, just as he did in the court's previous three major gay rights cases dating back to 1996. It came on the anniversary of two of those earlier decisions.
"No union is more profound than marriage," Kennedy wrote, joined by the court's four more liberal justices.
The four dissenting justices each filed a separate opinion explaining their views.
"But this court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent. Roberts read a summary of his dissent from the bench, the first time he has done so in nearly 10 years as chief justice.
Justice Antonin Scalia said he is not concerned so much about same-sex marriage, but about "this court's threat to American democracy." Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also dissented.
The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration. But some state officials and county clerks might decide there is little risk in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
The cases before the court involved laws from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Those states have not allowed same-sex couples to marry within their borders and they also have refused to recognize valid marriages from elsewhere.

10:15 a.m.
The Supreme Court ruling that grants same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide comes on a date with legal significance.
Two previous rulings by the high court also came on June 26. Both were also written by Justice Anthony Kennedy 
In 2003, the court issued its ruling in the case Lawrence versus Texas, striking down state laws that made gay sex a crime.
And on the same date in 2013, it struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law in the case U.S. versus Windsor.

NICEVILLE - A 21-year-old Niceville woman is in custody after a warrant was issued due to charges that she attacked her boyfriend with a stiletto.
The woman, who is not being named to protect the victim's identity, was arrested on June 7.
The attack occurred on March 28, around 6:30 p.m., according to the arrest report. She and her boyfriend were reportedly living together in a room at Tisa's Friendly Inn.
The woman hit her boyfriend in the head with the heel of a four-inch stiletto shoe, the report said. He was treated for a three-inch wound to his head.
The wound went through the skin stopping at the skull (approximately three centimeters deep) and required six staples to close, a doctor reported to Niceville Police officers. A witness told police that the woman repeatedly said, "I did not mean to hurt him."
She is charged with aggravated battery causing great bodily harm.
Her next scheduled court date is July 27.
