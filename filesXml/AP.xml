SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi has defended his office's decision to release a Mexican man who was in the U.S. illegally and who is now suspected in the killing of a woman at a sightseeing pier.
Mirkarimi said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency should earlier have issued an arrest warrant for Francisco Sanchez.
"ICE knew that he had been deported five times," Mirkarimi said. "You would have thought he met a threshold that he required a court order or a warrant. They did not do that."
Prosecutors on Monday charged Sanchez with murder in the death of Kathryn Steinle, who was shot and killed last Wednesday as she and her father took a walk on the popular Pier 14.
Steinle's killing has brought criticism down on this liberal city because Sanchez had been deported repeatedly and was out on the streets after San Francisco officials disregarded a request from immigration authorities to keep him locked up.
San Francisco is one of dozens of cities and counties across the country that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The city goes so far as to promote itself as a "sanctuary" for people in the country illegally.
In a jailhouse interview with a TV station, Sanchez, a 45-year-old repeat drug offender, appeared to confirm that he came to the city because of its status as a sanctuary.
The case has prompted a flurry of criticism from ICE officials, politicians and commenters on social media, all of whom portrayed the slaying as a preventable tragedy.
"Most of the blame should fall squarely on the shoulders of the San Francisco sheriff, because his department had custody of him and made the choice to let him go without notifying ICE," said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which wants tougher immigration enforcement.
Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, blamed sanctuary practices and the Obama administration, saying: "The tragic murder of Kate Steinle once again underscores the need to end these reckless policies."
Mayor Ed Lee issued a statement saying city policy was never intended to protect "repeat, serious and violent felons." He asked for federal and local agencies to review what happened.
California Attorney General Kamala Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney who is running for U.S. Senate, cautioned that when it comes to immigration, "our policy should not be informed by our collective outrage about one man's conduct."
Many other San Francisco politicians stayed quiet as mourners held a vigil at Pier 14 on the downtown waterfront, where the 32-year-old Steinle was gunned down, seemingly at random. She had recently moved to San Francisco.
While many cities have scaled back cooperation with ICE, few have gone as far as San Francisco.
For more than two decades, San Francisco has been considered a sanctuary for people in the U.S. illegally.
The city's sanctuary law prohibits city employees from helping federal authorities with immigration investigations or arrests unless required by law or warrant. That said, the ordinance does not prohibit local law enforcement from informing ICE that they've arrested someone in the country illegally for a felony offense or who has prior felony convictions.
From jail, Sanchez told a KGO-TV reporter in a mix of Spanish and English that he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt while sitting on a bench at the pier.
"So I picked it up and ... it started to fire on its own," Sanchez said, adding that he heard three shots go off.
Asked if he came to San Francisco because of its sanctuary status, he said yes.
"I only want to say that if the court wants to find me guilty, I wouldn't get mad," Sanchez said during the interview, in which he appeared confused and spoke incoherently at times.

        <MainBody>BRUSSELS (AP)  The latest on the Greek financial crisis (all times Brussels local):
___
2:30 p.m.
Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan says Greece should do something relatively simple to turn things around. Take a look at his nation.
Arriving at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers to discuss the Greek crisis, Noonan said Ireland was also able to work with its debt load to make it more manageable, He suggested Greece could also come forward with debt proposals, even if they would be different from Ireland's.
"There is not a one size fits all that we are looking at," he said.
For many, Ireland is the poster child of the austerity prescription laid out by bailout creditors over the past few years.
Ireland is forecast to post the strongest economic growth in the 28-nation EU this year.
___
2:10 p.m.
Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb has summed up just what is on the line financially for his small country in the Greek negotiations  a whopping 10 percent of Finland's annual budget.
On his way into a meeting with his peers in the 19-country eurozone, Stubb said Greece owes Finland 5 billion euros  a big dent in its budget of 50 billion.
It's also equivalent to 2.5 percent of Finland's annual GDP, he said.
"So a lot is obviously at stake," he said.
Stubb says the meeting is not aimed at kicking Greece out of the euro, but that it's up to Greece's leaders to come up with credible proposals to secure a bailout deal.
"We need to see some political will, a change of attitude on the part of the Greek government in order for this to work," Stubb says.
___
1:50 p.m.
Lithuania only started using the euro currency this year and doesn't want the 19-country single currency club to start losing members now.
Lithuanian Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius said a Greek exit "is not an option for us," as arrived for the meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels to discuss a possible new bailout deal for Athens.
Sadzius said he believes common ground can be found. Greece's new finance, Euclid Tsakalotos is set to unveil new proposals to his peers in the eurozone.
"In politics, there is always room for compromise," said Sadzius. "We believe that the eurozone should expand rather than contract."
___
1:30 p.m.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says Berlin still opposes an actual debt cut for Greece as he arrived at a meeting with his counterparts in the 19-country eurozone.
Schaeuble said he's waiting with interest to hear the ideas of the Greek government but stressed that without an aid program, there is "no possibility to help Greece within the framework of the eurozone."
Germany is reluctant to consider a debt cut for Greece. The Greek government wants debt relief for the country to be near the top of bailout discussions. That doesn't necessarily mean an actual reduction in the amount owed  it could take the form of extending the country's repayment schedule.
Schaeuble said actual debt cuts are banned under European rules.
___
1:05 p.m.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone's top official, says the pressure is on Greece to come up with fresh economic proposals that meet the requirements of its partners in the single currency bloc.
Arriving for talks with his peers in the 19-country eurozone, Dijsselbloem said the Greek government has "a major interest" in bringing forward "serious and credible" proposals that are needed if Greece is to get another bailout.
Greece is running out of time to secure a deal that will help its banks reopen and avoid a disorderly euro exit.
The eurogroup president also said the resignation of Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's outspoken finance minister over the past few months of the protracted bailout discussions, would not necessarily make a difference. Varoufakis has been replaced by the more mild-mannered Euclid Tsakalotos.
"It is not about persons," Dijsselbloem said. "It is about where we stand after the 'no' referendum."
___
12:45 p.m.
If new Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos has revised proposals for a fresh bailout of his debt-ridden nation to show his peers in the 19-country eurozone, he was keeping them close to his chest as he arrived for talks in Brussels.
A day after being sworn in to replace Yanis Varoufakis, who quit after Sunday's referendum 'no' vote, Tsakalotos hurried into the meeting venue without speaking to reporters.
On Monday, he conceded: "I won't hide from you that I am very nervous and very anxious."
And in something of an understatement, Tsakalotos said after being sworn in, "I am not taking over at the easiest moment in Greek history."
___
12:10 p.m.
Dutch State Secretary for Finance Eric Wiebes says Greek representatives need to come up with a serious package at the meeting of eurozone finance ministers if fresh bailout talks are to make any progress.
"I hope they bring a very serious proposal in their luggage," Wiebes said as he arrived an hour early for the start of the meeting in Brussels. "Because it is only worth continuing to talk on the basis of a very serious proposal. I can't imagine the proposal would be less serious than the proposal that was already on the table."
Wiebes, a junior Dutch minister, attends the eurogroup meetings because Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem is the group's chairman.
The Greek government is expected to make fresh proposals at the meeting in order to secure a bailout deal so it avoids leaving the euro.

11:55 a.m.
Rarely, if ever, has any leader gone to Brussels for a summit with as much as stake as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
With his country on its economic knees and facing the prospect of a disorderly exit from the euro, Tsipras knows that Greece's future for years if not decades could hinge on how talks later pan out.
Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, spelled out what's at stake.
"The Greek economy is in danger not just of imploding but of falling into a nightmarish dysfunctionality where what we consider as the normal economic functions of society collapse," he said. "This is a recipe for anarchy and social disorder."

11:30 a.m.
As Europe's leaders gear up for an emergency summit on Greece, the big euro sculpture in front of the former European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt is being given its first overhaul after 13 years.
The blue sign surrounded by yellow stars has become a popular photo motif for visitors.
The long-planned work started Monday, coinciding with the aftermath of the Greek referendum that many fear could lead to the first exit of a country from the 19-nation currency.
Workers took down the blue and yellow glass Plexiglas plates that cover the sculpture, which are to be replaced. New lighting also is to be installed, and work is due to be completed by Friday.
The sculpture by Ottmar Hoerl is owned by a private group, the Frankfurt Culture Committee.

11:10 a.m.
While Europe's leaders headed for Brussels for what could be a make-or-break summit for Greece's future in the euro, Greeks continued to struggle with the strict controls on their bank withdrawals.
Amid signs that the banks were fast running out of cash, there are growing concerns about what will happen to people's savings. Banks have been shuttered for over a week and cash withdrawals have been limited to 60 euros a day.
Giorgos Stathopoulos, a 46-year-old civil servant said many ATMs had run out of 20-euro notes, effectively reducing the daily limit to 50 euros.
"The problem is for those of us who don't have big deposits, what happens with our savings, that is the concern," he said.
And Giorgos Kafkaris, a 77-year-old pensioner, is hopeful about improvements. "I believe something better will happen," he said.
___
9:35 a.m.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has tempered expectations of a swift solution to the Greek crisis, saying "a solution is not going to appear overnight."
Juncker told lawmakers at the European Parliament in Strasbourg that any solution later at a meeting of the eurozone's 19 leaders in Brussels would likely be "overly simplistic."
He said one of the purposes later is to "restore order to the situation." He also displayed his anger at attacks on the European Union's executive branch.
"I think it is unacceptable for the European Commission to be deemed terrorists by the Greek government," he added.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and new finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos are on their way to Brussels for meetings aimed at restarting bailout talks.
"Quite clearly the ball lies in the court of the Greek government," said Juncker.
___
9:10 a.m.
European stock markets have opened solidly ahead of an emergency meeting of eurozone leaders in Brussels, where Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to reveal fresh proposals to the country's creditors.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.4 percent while the Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares rose 0.2 percent.
With Greece's banks shuttered and cash reserves run dry, time is running out for a bailout deal. Some investors hope the resignation of Yanis Varoufakis on Monday may well help smooth discussions.
Still, few are optimistic and many analysts think that a Greek exit from the euro remains possible.
"It seems untenable that Greece can slide out of the Eurozone with barely a whimper being heard in financial markets, but right now that's what it looks like," said Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct.
___
8:50 a.m.
Germany's biggest-selling newspaper knows who it wants to see at Tuesday's emergency summit of eurozone leaders in Brussels: the Iron Chancellor.
The Bild daily's front page Tuesday featured an image of Chancellor Angela Merkel in a Prussian-era spiked helmet. "No new billions for Greece," its headline read. "Today we need the Iron Chancellor."
That's how Otto von Bismarck, the 19th-century leader under whom Germany was unified, was known.
___
8:40 a.m.
Germany's EU commissioner says he's optimistic that a new Greek finance minister and opposition parties' backing for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras could smooth negotiations between Athens and its European creditors.
Tsipras' polarizing finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, resigned Monday and was replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos. Three opposition parties offered backing for Tsipras in the bailout negotiations.
Commissioner Guenther Oettinger told Deutschlandfunk radio Tuesday that Tsakalotos "doesn't have the same attitude as his predecessor. He knows the figures, the facts, he knows our reform proposals ... and he knows that we are flexible."
German officials insist that, even after its voters rejected more austerity in a referendum, Greece must accept conditions for any new aid.
___
8:19 a.m.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls says his country will do everything possible to keep Greece in the eurozone, saying its exit would be a "risk for global economic growth."
In an interview with the RTL radio network Tuesday, Valls denied that Greece's "no" vote was a rejection of Europe or its values but rather an expression of pride. He called on Greece's prime minister to put forward a plan and said France would be open to rescheduling Greece's debt.
Valls says: "The eurozone must stay coherent, reliable. Europe is not just a currency. It is a conception of the world."
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is headed Tuesday to Brussels to negotiate a rescue deal with European lenders.

BRUSSELS (AP)  With his country struggling to stave off financial collapse, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will try to convince European creditors to agree on a new bailout program when they meet Tuesday for an emergency eurozone summit.
Tsipras is set to offer a new plan of economic measures to creditors that he hopes will restart negotiations on getting new loans for his country. The situation is urgent  without a deal, Greece's banks could go bust within days, the first step in the country's potential exit from the euro currency union.
Greece's financial distress became more acute late Monday when the European Central Bank refused to increase assistance for Greek banks, which are not due to reopen until Thursday.
A hastily arranged meeting of eurozone finance ministers, which will be Euclid Tsakalotos' first as Greek finance minister, is slated for the afternoon in Brussels. A full summit of leaders will then follow.
European officials were cautious about the prospects for progress.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Union's executive Commission, indicated a comprehensive deal for Greece was unlikely to be reached Tuesday.
"Were we to come up with a solution today, it would be an overly simplistic solution," he told European lawmakers ahead of the meetings. "What we're going to do today is talk to each other, understand each other, show tolerance to each other and restore order to the situation."
The eurozone's top official, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said that the pressure was on Greece to present an acceptable deal, since its position was increasingly dire financially.
"The Greek government has a major interest in coming forward quickly with serious and credible proposals," said Dijsselbloem, who is the Dutch finance minister and chairs meetings with his eurozone counterparts.
The upcoming talks follow Tsipras' bigger-than-expected win in Sunday's bailout referendum, when 61 percent of Greek voters rejected measures creditors had proposed last week in exchange for loans.
In a sign he may be willing to compromise, Tsipras appointed a new finance minister to lead talks with creditors.
Tsakalotos, a 55-year-old economist, has replaced Yanis Varoufakis, who constantly clashed with his peers.
"I won't hide from you that I am very nervous and very anxious," Tsakalotos said after being sworn in Monday. "I am not taking over at the easiest moment in Greek history."
Greek banks are running out of cash even after the government shut them last week and placed limits on how much depositors can withdraw or transfer.
Normal commerce is now impossible in Greece. Small businesses, lacking use of credit cards or money from bank accounts, were left to rely on cash coming from diminishing purchases from customers. But Greeks are holding tightly onto what they have. And suppliers are demanding that businesses pay cash up front.
Giorgos Kafkaris, a 77-year-old pensioner, was among Greeks standing in line to withdraw cash at an Athens ATM on Tuesday.
"I came to get the 120 euros, I can't take more. The good thing is we had sorted things out earlier and we had 200-300 euros set aside," he said. "I'm waiting for something better for all of us. I believe something better will happen."
The euro was down 0.7 percent ahead of Tuesday's meetings, though stock markets were relatively stable in Europe. Greece's stock market remains closed since last week amid the bank closures.
Tsipras has previously indicated he's willing to raise taxes and cut some spending provided the country gets some debt relief.
European officials are split on the issue of whether to grant Greece easier debt repayment terms  with lead eurozone lender Germany still reluctant.
Greece has been granted two bailout programs worth a total of 240 billion euros ($266 billion) in loans from other eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund. But the spending cuts and tax increases demanded as a condition for the loans have hit growth, causing an economic depression and pushing unemployment to 25 percent. The government, meanwhile, has been slower than hoped in making the economy more competitive and selling state assets to raise money.
James Nixon, chief European economist at Oxford Economics, said there's "a narrow trajectory from here that sees an emboldened Greek parliament accepting the need for reform in return for a debt write-down."
"The next 48 hours will be crucial."

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP)  A bomb blast in Nigeria's northern university town of Zaria killed 25 people Tuesday including a 2-year-old toddler, the Kaduna state governor reported, the latest in a string of deadly bombing and shooting attacks by the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group.
Gov. Nasir el-Rufai urged citizens to avoid crowded public places including mosques and churches as the militants widen and accelerate the pace of attacks that have killed some 300 people in a week. Boko Haram may be responding to an Islamic State group order to commit more mayhem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The blast targeted government headquarters in the historic Muslim town as civil servants assembled to welcome a new chairman, El-Rufai said in an email to The Associated Press.
"Terrorists detonated explosives that killed and injured several persons ... (with) 25 fatalities including a 2-year-old," el-Rufai said.
Thirty-two wounded victims are being treated at the university teaching hospital, he said.
Boko Haram wants to install an Islamic state across the West African nation of about 170 million people divided between a predominantly Muslim north and Christian south. The extremists say democracy has brought nothing but woes to Nigerians plagued by endemic corruption that keeps Africa's biggest oil producer and richest economy mired in poverty.
Nigeria's police force Monday night announced increased security around mosques and churches after Boko Haram assaults on Sunday killed more than 60 people in a mosque and posh Muslim restaurant in central Jos city and at an evangelical Christian church in northeastern Potiskum town.
The attacks come just five weeks into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim and former military dictator who has vowed to crush the 6-year-old insurgency that has killed more than 13,000 people and driven 1.5 million from their homes.

JERUSALEM (AP)  Ten years ago, a small group of Palestinian activists had a novel idea: Inspired by the anti-apartheid movement, they called for a global boycott movement against Israel as a nonviolent method to promote the Palestinian struggle for independence.
Long confined to the sidelines, the so-called BDS movement appears to be gaining momentum  so much so that Israel has identified it as a strategic threat on a par with Palestinian militant groups and the Iranian nuclear program. While Israel says the movement is rooted in anti-Semitism, its decentralized organization and language calling for universal human rights have proven difficult to counter, resulting in a string of recent victories that have alarmed Israeli leaders.
"We are now beginning to harvest the fruits of 10 years of strategic, morally consistent and undeniably effective BDS campaigning," said Omar Barghouti, one of the group's co-founders. "BDS is winning the battles for hearts and minds across the world, despite Israel's still hegemonic influence among governments in the U.S. and Europe."
The BDS movement  named for its call for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel  began as an idea by 170 Palestinian civil society groups worldwide in 2005. It has grown into a global network of thousands of volunteers lobbying corporations, artists and academic institutions to sever ties with Israel.
Its members include campus activists, church groups and even liberal American Jews disillusioned by Israeli policies.
Most worrying for Israel, some of the group's core positions toward products made in West Bank settlements are starting to be embraced by European governments. Although the EU says it opposes boycotts of Israel, it is exploring guidelines for labeling settlement products, which many in Israel fear could be a precursor to a full-fledged ban. Settlement products, which make up a tiny percentage of Israeli exports, include wines, dates and cosmetics.
At a time when peace efforts are frozen and show no sign of getting back on track under a new hard-line government, Israelis fear such sentiment will increase.
"The concern is that there will be a spillover to a much wider phenomenon that will become mainstream and erode support for Israel," said Emmanuel Nahshon of Israel's Foreign Ministry.
The BDS movement has three goals: to end Israel's occupation of territories captured in the 1967 Mideast war, to end discrimination suffered by Arab citizens of Israel, and to promote the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to family properties lost in the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948.
For Israel, this last position is nothing less than a call for its destruction. Israel opposes the Palestinian "right of return," saying a massive influx of refugees would mean the end of the country as a Jewish state. The international community favors a "two-state solution" creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel, and even Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has indicated willingness to compromise on the refugee issue under a final peace deal.
Barghouti, a U.S.-educated engineer who also holds a graduate degree at Israel's Tel Aviv University, said the BDS movement is "completely neutral" on the political solution to the conflict. But he said he represents the Palestinian "consensus," and any deal that "undermines our basic rights under international law and perpetuates the colonial oppression" is unacceptable.
As for his attendance at a university he asks others to boycott, he said Palestinians "cannot possibly observe the same boycott guidelines as asked of internationals," adding that the "indigenous population" is entitled to all services they can get from the system.
Israeli leaders consider the movement to be the latest in a history of antagonists out to destroy the Jewish people.
"We are in the midst of a great struggle being waged against the state of Israel, an international campaign to blacken its name," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recently. "It is not connected to our actions. It is connected to our very existence."
The BDS movement is led by a West Bank-based national committee with representatives from around the world, which sets guidelines but allows local branches to decide their own strategy. It focuses on battles with a reasonable chance of success. So some of the biggest companies active in Israel, such as Microsoft and Intel, have not been targeted.
Battles have taken place in U.S. food co-ops and city councils. The movement has helped organize several boycotts by U.S. and British academic unions and has made inroads on American campuses. Roughly a dozen student governments have approved divestment proposals.
Entertainers, including Roger Waters, Elvis Costello and Lauryn Hill have refused to perform in Israel. The BDS movement also claims responsibility for pressuring some large companies to stop or alter operations in Israel, including carbonated drink maker SodaStream, French construction company Veolia and international security firm G4S.
Last month, Britain's national student union joined the movement. Last week, the top legislative body of the United Church of Christ voted to divest from companies with business in the Israeli-occupied territories, following a similar move by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) last year. The Episcopal Church and Mennonite Church USA also considered divestment proposals recently, with the Episcopals rejecting it and the Mennonites deferring action for two years.
Perhaps the biggest blow was last month's announcement by the chief executive of French mobile phone giant Orange that he wanted to end his partnership with Israeli carrier Partner Communications. He cited his desire to improve business in the Arab world. Although CEO Stephane Richard later traveled to Israel to apologize, Orange and Partner announced plans to unwind their deal.
The idea of boycotts is extremely sensitive in Israel. The Nazis launched a nationwide boycott of Jewish businesses and artists  often accompanied by acts of violence and anti-Semitic slogans  in the 1930s Germany ahead of the Holocaust. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries pressured companies doing business with them to shun Israel.  Currently, Israel is fending off attempts by the boycotters to compare Israeli policies in the West Bank to South African apartheid.
"The attacks on the Jews were always preceded by the slander of the Jews," Netanyahu recently said.
BDS activists deny being fueled by anti-Semitism, saying their battle is against Israel, not Jews. They point to a small but growing number of Jewish supporters, including the "Jewish Voice for Peace," whose 9,000 dues-paying members support a boycott of Israel.
Naomi Dann, JVP's media coordinator, said the stance stems from frustration over failed U.S.-backed peace efforts. She said that while the group recognizes the Jewish attachment to Israel, it can't come at the expense of Palestinians.
"It's not about destroying Israel," she said. "But full equal rights and a democratic society are more important than preserving the Jewish character of the state."
It remains difficult to quantify the BDS movement's actual achievements.
Leading global companies, including Microsoft, Google, Apple and Intel, maintain operations in Israel. Major entertainers, including Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga, Madonna and Rihanna, have performed in Israel in recent years.
A February report by Israel's Finance Ministry concluded the BDS movement has had a negligible economic impact. But it outlined some worst-case scenarios, including EU government-led boycotts or cancellation of free-trade agreements. Likewise, a recent study by the Rand Corp. said that while the BDS movement "has not yet had a significant negative effect" on Israel, it is growing. It noted Israeli leaders' fears it could have "substantial detrimental effects" on the economy.
Last month, Jewish billionaires Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban led a Las Vegas fundraiser to fight the BDS movement at U.S. universities. Israel's justice minister, Ayeled Shaked, instructed her ministry to prepare "legal steps" against the movement. This week, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton said she opposed the BDS movement.
David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Policy for Near East Policy and former member of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's peace team, said Israel must show it is serious about the creation of a Palestinian state to slow the momentum.
"You can reduce its scope, its impact by making clear when the prime minister ... says he supports two states for two people that he is not then going to say Israel will settle in what will be a future Palestinian state," he said.
