What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's arrest

Freddie Gray died in police custody a week after he was arrested
A transport van carrying Gray made several stops before arriving at a police station
A previously unknown stop was revealed to reporters on Thursday
(CNN)
New information released Thursday adds complexity, and even more questions, to the already confusing picture of what happened to Freddie Gray after his arrest.
The transport van that carried Gray made a previously unknown stop along its route from where he was arrested to the police station. It was one of four stops police now are saying the van made.
What they haven't said yet, and what remains under investigation , is how Gray suffered a fatal spinal cord injury. He died while in police custody exactly one week after his April 12 arrest.
Many believe the key to understanding what happened to Gray is understanding what happened inside the van.
When he was placed inside it, he could talk, according to videos and to Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez.
"And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe," Rodriguez said.
Here's a closer look at what we do and do not know about that controversial ride:
Initial arrest
What we know: A police officer makes eye contact with Gray and another individual in a high-crime area of Baltimore. Gray and another person bolt, and the officer, along with others, gives chase.
Gray is stopped and "gave up without the use of force," according to Rodriguez.
Police call for a transport van, and officers drag him to it. Video shows Gray screaming in apparent pain. He asks for an inhaler, which he did not get.
What we don't know: Video from the arrest does not show the entire incident. It starts with Gray already on the ground. We don't know what happened before the cameras started rolling.
First stop
What we know: The van makes its first stop at 8:46 a.m. An officer asks the driver to stop so they can finish paperwork and put Gray in leg shackles. He is described by the driver of the van as "irate," according to Rodriguez. Gray was still able to move and talk at this point. We also know that Gray was not seat-belted in the van, as per police policy.
What we don't know: Was he actually irate? Was Gray injured during the stop? Several witnesses saw what happened, and have spoken to investigators. We don't know yet what they said.
Second stop
What we know: This previously undisclosed stop was discovered from a privately owned camera, Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis told reporters, without elaborating.

Story highlights
Johnita Due: The anger and frustration I saw in 1980 Miami is repeated in 2015 Baltimore
She says teaching the power of nonviolent protest is essential
Johnita P. Due is assistant general counsel for CNN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.
(CNN)
I will always remember when things turned. I was 12 years old, and my younger sister and I were with our parents attending a peaceful demonstration in downtown Miami near the courthouse. We were there to protest the acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of unarmed motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie. I had learned the word "acquittal" just that day. It meant they wouldn't be held responsible.
Community leaders were gathered at the front, speaking to a crowd that was in shock and full of anger and despair. The trial had been covered extensively, and nobody could believe that the fatal beating -- with the extent of the physical wounds to McDuffie's head and body -- could be justified or excused. I started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd. There was shouting and cursing. Bottle throwing. Then a car was turned over and set on fire. That was Miami 35 years ago, but it could just as easily have been Baltimore this week.
Johnita Due
The Miami riots of 1980 were the first major "race riots" since the wave of riots spread across the nation in the 1960s.
Harlem 1964: Police shooting of 15-year-old James Powell. Watts 1965: Arrest of 21-year-old Marquette Frye for drunken driving. Newark 1967: Police beating of John Smith while under arrest. Detroit 1967: Police raid on a "blind pig" after-hours bar. Then the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, and Baltimore and 125 other cities erupted in flames.
The immediate catalysts for the waves of riots in the 1960s before the death of Dr. King were police action, or, more specifically, perceived unjust police action .
That was true in Miami in 1980 after the acquittal of the police officers. And the same in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers for the beating of motorist Rodney King. Wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the start of the Los Angeles riots .
And now we have Baltimore 2015, with the death of suspect Freddie Gray in police custody.
My parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement, and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement. It was the images of young people all over the country -- often facing physical danger, discipline from their parents and suspension from school -- that propelled the civil rights movement into the national spotlight.
Juxtapose decades-old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in Birmingham and Selma with Tuesday's images of Baltimore youths throwing rocks at police, and you wonder what has happened.
A child's questions
As a 12-year-old girl in Miami, I didn't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods, and risk going to jail, by rioting. I was afraid because I didn't see my father for days as he and other community leaders walked the streets to try to restore calm. I was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the African-American community, causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels.
But two months ago, I agreed to moderate a panel at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights called "Riot -- The Voice of the Unheard?" The occasion was to mark the Atlanta premiere of "Detroit '67," a play written by Dominique Morisseau and directed by Kamilah Forbes that chronicled the journey of a family as they lived through the turmoil of the Detroit '67 riot, including the joy and love they found with one another.
The play and the panel were programmed by Kenny Leon's True Colors Theatre Company, a nonprofit devoted to presenting artistic interpretations with diverse voices so that individuals and institutions can have a shared platform in their quest for understanding in American society. Inspired by the mission, I had recently joined the board. Although pegged to the past, the purpose of the panel was to examine how current events relating to police actions against African-American men could potentially lead to rioting and what could be done to prevent it.
I learned that some questioned whether riots are actually purposeless and uncontrolled violence, or whether they are purposeful uprisings against individuals and institutions.
I learned that those who participate in riots often feel hopeless and dehumanized, both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots.
I learned that riots in the 1960s played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda, often by galvanizing local and national government officials to work with peaceful community, church and civil rights leaders to address the root causes of riots. This is a controversial part of our civil rights history that has been sanitized.
'It is a time for action'
At the conclusion of the 1967 Detroit riot, President Lyndon Johnson condemned the violence but said in his address to the nation that: "This is not a time for angry reaction. It is a time for action, starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities. The strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the street. ..."
His administration convened the Kerner Commission to examine the 1965-68 riots, and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness, poverty, a lack of political power, unfair housing, police brutality and inferior schools.
After the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, the Christopher Commission was established and concluded that racial profiling and excessive force, unjust treatment in the criminal justice system, poor housing, and the lack of jobs and education were triggers for the riots.
After all of these riots, the affected city, state and national governments enacted plans and programs to address some of these underlying conditions.
Maybe the Baltimore youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in Watts in 1965. As recounted in "The Great Rebellion" by Kenneth Stahl, Dr. King went to Watts to try to calm tensions, and a hostile youth said to him:  "We won."
King challenged him: "How have you won? Homes are destroyed, blacks are dead in the streets, stores you shop from for food and clothes are destroyed."
The young man replied, "We won because we made the whole world pay attention ... the police chief and mayor had never been here. We made them come."
'The language of the unheard'
Dr. King would say near the end of his life: "It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard."
When I learned that Baltimore high school students planned a purge based on the movie "The Purge," in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes, it suddenly made sense. They thought they wouldn't be held responsible for their crimes. They thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word "acquitted" I learned the day of the Miami riots. But they got it wrong.
They will forever live the repercussions of their actions, regardless of the impetus.

Mosby, 35, who comes from a long line of police officers, including her grandfather, four uncles and her mother, assumes a key role in the latest case to draw national attention to the issue of relations between police officers and the communities they are sworn to serve.
"My grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in Massachusetts and one of the things he instilled on us is the importance of public service," Mosby said in a campaign video.
Marilyn Mosby comes from a long line of police officers, including her grandfather, four uncles and her mother.
Freddie Gray's mysterious death has turned the largely black city near the nation's capital into a tinderbox where mostly peaceful demonstrations on Monday erupted in pockets of looting and rioting in the hours after Gray's funeral.
A 10 p.m. citywide curfew was put into effect two days ago, and National Guard troops have joined Baltimore police in an attempt to maintain order.
On Thursday, as police handed their investigative files over to the state attorney's officer a day earlier than planned, supporters of the former insurance company lawyer expressed confidence in Mosby's ability to handle the volatile case.
What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's arrest
'We have much more confidence in her'
"We're enthusiastic about the new prosecutor," said William "Billy" Murphy Jr., a former Baltimore judge who is now the lead attorney for Gray's family. "She comes to the office with a belief in the integrity of these kinds of investigations. We have much more confidence in her than we have in the police because there's never been any level of confidence, nor should there be, in the police investigating themselves."
Mosby confirmed in a statement Thursday that she had received the police's investigative report. She said that while police have regularly briefed her office on their findings, her team has been conducting its own independent probe into the April 19 death.
45 CVS workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores
"While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings, but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified," Mosby said. "We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system."
Mosby is married to Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby, who represents areas of West Baltimore where riots erupted earlier this week. The couple have two young daughters.
"She's my wife," Nick Mosby told CNN on Thursday. "She's a strong woman. She was built for this ...  I was at church service the other day and they were talking about being at the right place with the right person at the right time. I know her heart has always been convicted to ensure that justice will be served fairly and equally across the board."
Cousin's death brought exposure to criminal justice system
During her campaign, Mosby spoke about the broad daylight shooting death of her 17-year-old cousin on her front doorstep.
"I learned very early on that the criminal justice system isn't just the police, the judges and the state's attorney," she said. "It's much more than that. I believe that we are the justice system. We, the members of the community, are the justice system because we are the victims of crimes."
Mosby said her cousin's 1994 murder was her first introduction to the criminal justice system.
"Having to go to court and deal with prosecutors," she said. "Having to go to court and see my neighbor who had the courage and audacity to cooperate with the police ... to testify in court and the way the district attorney's office treated my family is something that inspired me."
Mosby, who grew up in Boston, is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major city in the United States, according to the state's attorney's website.
At the age of 6, Mosby was accepted in a school desegregation program in Massachusetts. She later participated in a study of the civil rights movement.
"After having that awesome experience I knew I wanted to be an attorney," she said during her campaign.
A. Dwight Pettit, a civil rights attorney and Mosby supporter, said he believes she will "deliver on doing it right, and getting it right. I'm confident in that."
"She's very dedicated and part of what she campaigned on was bringing integrity to the office, and so I believe that she will move in a methodical way," he said. "And I think that she will follow where the evidence leads. I do not think she will follow just public opinion."
Prosecutor said it's time to rebuild trust
When she was sworn in as chief prosecutor earlier this year, Mosby brought up the lack of trust between the community and police.
"Our time to repair that trust, to come together collectively as a community to start to break down the barriers to progress in our communities is now," she said.
Mosby added, "As a black woman who understands just how much the criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color, I will seek justice on your behalf."
Mosby is African-American, as are Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts and other leading Baltimore officials. Although about 63% of Baltimore's population is black, they face stunning disparities when it comes to income, employment, poverty, housing, incarceration and overall health.
The people on Mosby's transition team included former Mayor Kurt Schmoke, former congressman and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume and Murphy, who is now representing Gray's family.
Schmoke, a former state's attorney and Baltimore's first African-American mayor, said Mosby's background will buy her time with a tense community anxious for justice.
"I actually think that the level of patience will actually increase primarily because the state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, was recently elected," he said. "She has a level of credibility with the community that will allow for that patience. I can't say how long, but I do think that people will give her a little bit more time to do it right rather than to do it fast."
Mosby defeated Gregg Bernstein as state's attorney in a 2014 election.
"Baltimore prosecutors get to see it all in court -- we've got the toughest job in America," she said in a statement after the election.
Mary Koch, another attorney for Gray's family, said the new chief prosecutor has her work cut out for her.
"The family wants the truth and they want it to be arrived at very carefully and that's not going to be an easy job for Ms. Mosby," said Koch, adding: "That's her job. That's the job she took on."

Gray died  on April 19 after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody a week before
"He could have been a comedian," a neighbor says
Baltimore  (CNN)
Before the world heard his name chanted in the streets, before his cries echoed across televisions and sparked protests in Baltimore, Freddie Gray was struggling to make a life for himself.
The 25-year-old  lived in a red brick row house with a white metal bar in the Gilmor Homes neighborhood.
Neighbors say he was friendly and there were no signs of his long rap sheet.
"He was so funny. Any time you're looking for a laugh, you're going straight to Freddie," Raheem Gaither told The Baltimore Sun. "We're all from the same neighborhood. All of us here are family."
Gray loved football and had always wanted to play tight end but was too small, his friend William Stewart said.
"He could have been a comedian, for real, but nah. Now look at him," Gaither told The Sun.
Run-ins with the law
Gray died on April 19 after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody a week before. His death sparked protests against police in Baltimore, which later spread to major cities nationwide. Court documents said Gray was arrested after running away from police.
As questions about his fatal injury remain, more details are emerging about his past.
According to court documents obtained by CNN, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray. Five of those were still active at the time of his death.
Drug charges
Most of the cases were drug-related, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. He was due in court on a possession charge on April 24.
Gray had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, said Maryland Department of Corrections spokesman Gerard Shields. In February 2009, he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver. Shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved.

Relative: Drugs supported his family
Gray was paroled in 2011 and went back to prison again two years later for drug possession. After serving a month, he was released in June 2013.
His brother-in-law, Juan Grant, said drugs helped Gray support his family.
"When people come to buy narcotics or gamble or anything and they put their money in your hand, what makes you so bad?" Grant asked. "He had responsibilities. Responsibilities don't stop because you don't have a job."
A glimpse into his early life
As a child, Gray's life was marked with financial hardship from the beginning.
His mother and stepfather raised him and his siblings in a home so squalid, they won a settlement from the landlord over lead paint exposure, The Baltimore Sun reported.
Gray and his sisters had damaging levels of lead in their blood, leading to myriad educational and medical issues , the paper reported.
That's according to a lawsuit filed in 2008 against the owner of the home the family rented for years.
The case was reportedly settled before it went to trial, but documents from the lawsuit give an insight into Gray's early life.
He and his sisters were born "preemie," their mother said in a deposition , according to the paper. Gray lived in the home at the center of the lawsuit from ages 2 to 6.
During a 2009 deposition, the newspaper reported, Gray's mother was questioned and reportedly said that she couldn't read, had never been to high school and had a daily heroin habit, but that she stopped using it after she entered treatment.
During his own deposition, Gray spoke about peeling paint and said he was put in special education classes. His sisters testified that they had to repeat grades.
What we know, don't know about Gray's arrest
Gray's family life
Eighteen months before Gray died, his brother was the victim of street violence, family friends told CNN. He died.
It's unclear how many siblings he has, but he has a twin sister, Fredericka Gray.
"It hurts my heart to know that she lost one son to street violence and another due to police brutality," said Kiona Mack, a family friend.
Gray also had a girlfriend whose child he helped care for.
"He sat in there and watched the kid, he took this little child to school every morning that his girlfriend had to work," said  Grant, his brother-in-law.
As his family mourns and a scarred community seeks answers, more protests are planned nationwide.

        <MainBody>Philadelphia police clash with protesters backing Baltimore protests
Demonstrators in Jerusalem say they're inspired by U.S. protests
(CNN)
Across the world, demonstrators are taking to the streets to support Baltimore protesters and to complain about police brutality in their own towns. In the United States, the protests took place Thursday in Philadelphia and Cincinnati.
The protests will probably continue, at least into the weekend.
Demonstrations in Seattle ; Portland, Oregon ; and Oakland, California , are scheduled for Friday, which is also May Day, or International Workers Day -- often used to call attention to issues affecting the working class and minorities.

Philadelphia
A protest started Thursday afternoon in front of city hall. Aerial video showed several hundred people gathered. As the crowd swelled, it moved toward Rittenhouse Square.
Police and protesters clashed about 7:45 p.m., apparently when the group tried to block the entrance to I-95. CNN's Poppy Harlow reported police had said they would move against anybody who tried to do that.

"We just wanted to walk down the freeway," one demonstrator told Harlow. "As soon as we walked up they started pushing us with their nightsticks and had their baton ready. They had their horses and all that other [stuff] they do trying to intimidate us. ...
"We're angry because of this system we've lived in forever. We want equality of justice."
Police said two arrests were made. They estimated several hundred people participated at the demonstration's peak.
According to tweets from CNN's Lawrence Crook , protesters sat down in the middle of Broad Street, blocking traffic. Some protesters were arrested. Later the crowd marched to the federal prison building and chanted, "You are not alone."
Harlow said inmates in the prison flicked their lights on and off in recognition.
"We want equality of justice," one protester told Harlow.

Earlier in the evening, protesters surrounded a police car, but they didn't rock the vehicle and police didn't move on the crowd, philly.com reported . The crowd also stopped a public bus.
"There really have not been any major issues as they have continued to express their First Amendment rights and have marched throughout different parts of the city," Mayor Michael Nutter told CNN's Anderson Cooper. "People want answers and justice. I understand that. Answers should be provided."
Cincinnati
Hundreds gathered in downtown Cincinnati at Hamilton County Courthouse to show unity with the protesters of the Freddie Gray incident in Baltimore.
After listening to speakers, the group began marching  toward Police District 1 Headquarters several blocks away.

Jerusalem
Several hundred people gathered Thursday to protest police brutality after a video surfaced showing two Tel Aviv officers beating an Israeli soldier.
The soldier was of Ethiopian origin, as were most of the demonstrators. CNN reporter Ian Lee said several demonstrators told him they were inspired by protests in the United States.

On Wednesday, demonstrations took place in Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis, New York,  Washington, and Ferguson, Missouri.
New York
A police official said 143 people were arrested Wednesday night, mostly for blocking traffic and refusing to clear the street.
The protest started as several hundred people converged on Union Square for what was billed as an "NYC Rise up &amp; Shut It down with Baltimore" rally.

New York police were out in force, pushing protesters back. Police used zip tie restraints on nearly two dozen people in the streets after a small scuffle.
The New York Police Department also handed out fliers and used loudspeakers to tell protesters and pedestrians to stay on the sidewalk.
"It came to a point where they had the loudspeakers going. They started making arrests quickly," said CNN iReporter Michael Kande . "It was pretty crazy and hairy there for a bit."
Demonstrators then moved through the city and had several shouting matches with police.
Washington
"All night, all day, we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray." That's the chant heard from about 500 protesters in the nation's capital Wednesday night.

The mood there was almost festive, as songs by Public Enemy like "Fight the Power" played while sign-language interpreters translated the music and the chants. The protests moved to the White House, but didn't disrupt traffic.
Eugene Puryear, the organizer of one of the groups involved in the protest, the DC Ferguson Movement, said the march was called to show solidarity with the residents of Baltimore and to bring attention to police brutality as a national issue.
Minneapolis and Denver
Several hundred people gathered in Gold Medal Park in Minneapolis for a rally organized by the group #BlackLivesMatter. The Minneapolis group has held similar events in the past in response to what it says is police brutality across the country.
Violence broke out in downtown Denver on Wednesday night during a demonstration by about 100 people. Police in riot gear with military-style weapons and sticks  used pepper spray on the crowd. Protesters said they were angry about police brutality around the country, including the case of Freddie Gray.
Shortly after 7 p.m. there was a minor scuffle in Civic Center Park. Police said they used force only after one of their officers was pushed to the ground. The Denver Post reported at least five protesters -- including one whose face was bloodied -- were arrested on the scene.
In all, 11 people were arrested. Charges included assault of a police officer, robbery, resisting police, disobedience to lawful orders, obstructing roadways and interference.

Ferguson
Violence marked protests that took place Tuesday night in Ferguson, Missouri , where three people were shot, city police reported.
But police said they didn't do the shooting. A 20-year-old man was arrested and the three victims were in stable condition -- two with wounds to the neck, one in the leg, police said.
Police said about 300 people marched, with protesters throwing rocks at police, damaging four police cars and setting trash and debris on fire near the intersection of Northwinds Estates Drive and West Florissant Avenue.
Chicago
Hundreds of people marched on Tuesday from police headquarters through the Southside, CNN affiliate WGN reported . One arrest was made, for reckless conduct. Protesters talked about police violence and the death of Rekia Boyd, killed by an off-duty officer in 2012. The officer was acquitted last week.
CNN's Alexandra Field, Elizabeth Landers, Lorenzo Ferrigno and Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report.

        <title>Singer Nathan Morris embraces homeless Senate worker</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/PXrpqfvLvzI/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Meet the homeless man who works in the Capitol 03:04
PLAY VIDEO
"It killed me to hear your story. I had to come up here, I had to meet you and I had to pull all my resources in to try to help take care of you, man," Morris added.
He took out his phone to show Gladden how much people had already donated.
By then, the funding effort was only three days old, but had already raised more than $21,000.
"Just from small donations -- $20, $35, $10, $15 -- and this is just people giving from the kindness of their heart," Morris said, pointing to the website on his phone.
"That's a good thing," responded a near-speechless Gladden. The Boyz II Men singer said his first priority is getting Gladden off the street.
"Try to get him back on his feet. You know, try to take some of the burden off him having to worry about where he's going to sleep at night," explained Morris.
When Gladden first told us about his story, CNN asked why he didn't go to a homeless shelter instead of sleeping at a D.C. metro stop each night.
He told CNN shelters are like a "prison," and unsafe. Gladden, a diabetic, said his insulin had been stolen in homeless shelters by people hoping to use it to get high.
But Morris told Gladden about a halfway house of sorts he found, run by the Coalition for the Homeless, geared for men just like Gladden -- people who have jobs but have trouble saving enough money to get a place to live.
Morris says the facility requires those who come to save 30% of their income while they stay there. He said he hoped to use the funds raised to help Gladden to pay that 30%.
Senate restaurant workers demand higher pay
But that won't solve the bigger problem. Gladden's base salary is about $11 an hour, and he takes home only $360 dollars a week. Some of his colleagues in the Senate cafeteria make the minimum wage for federal contractors, $10.10 per hour, and they want at least $15 an hour, what they call a livable wage.
RELATED: Food worker, janitors walk out on U.S. Senate
The Senate privatized its dining services in 2008, and awarded the contract to Restaurant Associates, a British-owned company based in New York that serves many well-known institutions, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to the Kennedy Center in D.C.
The contract is up at the end of the year, and CNN is told by sources familiar with the talks that Senate Rules Chairman Roy Blunt, whose committee is responsible for the contract, is already in negotiations to re-up with Restaurant Associates.
After seeing CNN's story about Gladden, however, top Democrats, like Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is the ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, began to pressure Blunt to call on Restaurant Associates to increase cafeteria workers' minimum wage to $15 an hour.
And Gladden -- once reluctant to talk about being homeless -- is now eager to share his story, hoping it helps colleagues in less dire circumstances but still in need of higher wages.
"We got a lot of workers in there that have a problem, like losing their homes and can't keep up their mortgage because they're not making enough money," Gladden said.
"There's no reason why you should feel like you're a disgrace to this country," Morris told Gladden. "The people in there making the laws are the disgrace."
Baltimore riots shine light on poverty
With unrest occurring in nearby Baltimore, the realities and consequences of poverty and desperation in cities across the country are making headlines.
Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison told CNN's "New Day" Thursday that he hopes people look beyond the mayhem in Baltimore and at the human stories, and made a point of noting "we got a guy here, working for the United States Senate," who is homeless.
Gladden says he was heading down the wrong road from a young age, in large part because he didn't have anyone to steer him in the right direction. He has a lot of talent he never fulfilled. He won an art contest that got him a scholarship to George Washington University, but he dropped out.
"I didn't make all the good decisions. My choices weren't up to par, basically because I didn't have nobody near," said Gladden.
Like his new Boyz II Men friend, it turns out Gladden also sings. He says he performed in a group with friends in his D.C. neighborhood back in the day, and he sang a few bars of an oldie for Morris.
"I love you, I love you so madly, without you, I can't go on," Gladden crooned.
Morris gave Gladden another hug. "We might have to get us another member," he joked.

Face-off: Mayweather vs. Pacquiao by the numbers
By Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Chris Borg, for CNN
Updated 1310 GMT (2010 HKT) May 1, 2015
(CNN)
All eyes will be on the ring at the MGM Grand Garden arena this weekend.
It's a fight that has been years in the making. Finally Floyd "Money" Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will go head-to-head on Saturday.
Here's a look at the numbers behind the boxers:
60:40 -- revenue split in favor of Mayweather.
$300-400m -- the estimated total revenue for the May 2 bout.
38 -- Mayweather's age; two years older than his opponent.
5 -- The number of years it took to strike a deal between the two boxers.
$1.5m -- How much Pacquiao's shorts alone will be worth after six companies bid for sponsorship space.
$25,000 -- The value of the mouth guard adorned with diamonds and gold Mayweather will wear on fight night.
$1,500 -- starting price for tickets in U.S. dollars.
8 -- Pacquiao is the first and only eight-division world champion with 10 world titles to his name.
1 -- Mayweather's ranking on last year's Forbes highest-paid athletes list .
$105m -- The amount "Money" earned last year.
$180,000 -- The price ringside tickets had skyrocketed to by April 27 (5 days before the fight.)
16,800 -- Capacity at the MGM Grand Garden arena where the fight will take place.
5 -- The number of boxers Pacquiao and Mayweather have both fought. The "famous five": Juan Manuel Marquez, Ricky Hatton, Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto.
$100 -- The fee pay-per-view subscribers will shell out to watch the fight, which will be aired jointly on Showtime and HBO.
$300m -- Expected pay-per-view buys with the most sales coming from U.S., Puerto Rican and Canadian markets, according to Repucom.
$5.6m -- The winning bid for official fight sponsorship by Tecate beer.
57 -- The number of wins throughout Pacquiao's career. Mayweather has less at 47 wins, but...
0 -- Mayweather remains undefeated in his fight career (Pacquiao, on the other hand, has suffered 5 losses.)
Meanwhile Floyd Mayweather has told fans to be ready for an epic battle when he faces Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on Saturday.
With the time for talking all but done -- the weigh-ins take place at 11pm BST on Friday -- the 38-year-old American told CNN: "He's going to come and bring his best -- and his best is going to bring the best out of me.
"My job is to go out there and be Floyd Mayweather and do what I do best. Both sides have said a lot, but it's all about the two competitors."
Unbeaten in 47 professional fights, Mayweather played down claims from some quarters that he had appeared subdued in the build-up to what some are calling the "Fight of the Century."
"I feel good," he said. "I'm very, very happy. My team have done a tremendous job.
"I have grown and matured over the years. I'm not far from 40 years old, and I have been in this sport as a professional for 19 years. You outgrow some things.
"I know I can fight, and I know the guy I am fighting. It is not an easy task, but this is my job. This is what I chose to do."

 Coy Wire (@CoyWire) April 29, 2015
Pacquiao said he was "ready for the challenge" and had "peace of mind."
But the 36-year-old Filipino southpaw admitted that his 65th -- and most eagerly-awaited -- professional fight would be "different," adding: "I'm excited, and I'm sure the fans will love it.
"It means a lot to me to be representing the Philippines -- people are excited to watch this fight.
"I don't have a prediction, but I will do my best to make the fans happy. They deserve a good fight. They are paying more than double than for a regular fight."
Getting a ticket for the MGM Grand has proven to be a difficult and massively expensive undertaking, with the price of a ringside seat rocketing.
As Mayweather put it: "Tickets are going for between $8,000 and $400,000 to $500,000. You know, we call this the billionaire boys' club."
But plenty have stumped up big bucks to be there, with Tony Buzbee, an attorney who paid $74,000 for a pair of 12th-row seats, telling CNN: "It's going to be a once in a lifetime type of fight, and I'm going to be there just for the event of it all.
"Growing up loving sports, to be in a position where I can go to this type of event... it's just wonderful."
Pacquiao fan Mark Sarmiento, who paid $7,500 to be there, agrees.
"It was a little out of budget but once I got it, it sunk in -- I'm pretty much going to this fight," he said.

Bridgegate criminal proceedings in court Friday
Updated 1310 GMT (2010 HKT) May 1, 2015
JUST WATCHED
'Bridgegate' report leaves questions 01:44
Washington (CNN)
A former ally of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is set to appear Friday in federal court to answer to charges that he coordinated the shutdown of the George Washington Bridge, according to a report out this week.
David Wildstein, a former official at the New York and New Jersey Port Authority official, is expected to plead guilty to the federal charges, according to a Bloomberg Business report . Wildstein would become the first person convicted in the investigation into the September 2013 lane closures, which were allegedly carried out as political retribution.

The U.S. Attorney's office announced "a proceeding of interest in a criminal matter" related to the investigation before U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton at a Newark courthouse scheduled for 11 a.m. on Friday. After that, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, Port Authority Inspector General Michael Nestor and an FBI official will address the issue at a 1 p.m. press conference.
That investigation has also focused on Christie, who appointed Wildstein to the Port Authority position, and the governor's staff. Federal prosecutors reportedly interviewed Christie over the Bridgegate affair late last year.
Christie has repeatedly denied any involvement in or advance knowledge of the lane closures.
It is not yet clear whether Wildstein struck a plea deal with prosecutors to give them more information into how the scandal unfolded.
Wildstein is not the only link to Christie in the scandal.
Christie fired his former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly after an email she sent to Wildstein calling for "traffic problems in Fort Lee" surfaced.
Christie also cut loose one of his top advisers, Bill Stepien, who was expected to play a key role in an eventual Christie presidential campaign, after Stepien's name also popped up in email exchanges linked to the bridge closures.
The controversy surrounding the closures deeply damaged Christie's standing within the national GOP and raised doubts about his viability in the presidential race, but the governor has continued to prepare for a bid and has given little indication that the scandal will dissuade him from the race.

Who's who in Christie bridge scandal  E-mails suggest Regina Egea, then a senior staffer and the governor's point person to the Port Authority and other agencies, was aware of concerns the George Washington Bridge lane closures were not part of an ongoing traffic study as the Christie administration initially claimed. She's now Christie's incoming chief of staff and has also been subpoenaed by the state Assembly committee.

I have, for some time, believed that the chefs doing the most interesting work in America -- chefs who are in fact redefining what "American food" means -- are Korean.
When I go out for dinner with non-Korean chef friends, all they want these days is Korean food. They get excited by the deep, tangy, spicy funk of kimchi; thrilled by the little plates of pickles and snacks that accompany the main courses; intrigued by what is, to them, often a whole new spectrum of flavors.
Date night with my wife? Korean barbecue. And God help me, among a very small circle of friends -- all of them sworn to secrecy, and on all of whom I possess horrifying and incriminating photographic evidence that ensures their eternal silence -- I have, after much soju, actually gone to Korean karaoke.
ONLY Korean, by the way. What makes it so special, other than the guaranteed anonymity, are the accompanying videos. The Sex Pistols' "Anarchy in the UK " (my wife's regular showstopper) plays along with images of two honeymooning Koreans in a rowboat on Lake Geneva. Iggy and the Stooges' "I Wanna Be Your Dog" (my big finisher) doesn't even have a dog in its video: two teenagers, holding hands at the mall.
So it was a no-brainer that as soon as I could, I'd go back to South Korea and do what Koreans do so well: eat lots of great food, drink lots and lots of beer and soju and other alcoholic beverages -- and then do silly shit that you would never do if you weren't with Koreans.

        <MainBody>Obama takes fundraising to Air Force One
Marana, Arizona (CNN)
In December 1953, an airplane named the "Columbine II" was on a flight over New York City, identified by air traffic controllers simply as "Air Force 8610." With President Eisenhower on board, it nearly collided mid-air with a commercial airliner also flight-numbered 8610. The near-tragedy prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to designate a call sign for any aircraft that the president of the United States is aboard. The Columbine II became the first Air Force One.
Today it sits on a patch of desert land, where grass struggles and gopher holes dot the arid ground -- baking. And the owner of a Virginia aviation company wants to fly it home.
"It's an airplane with an incredible amount of history," Karl Stoltzfus, the chairman of Bridgewater, Virginia-based Dynamic Aviation said. "At the end of the day it's an airplane that should be preserved for the public to appreciate."
Stoltzfus and his associates have spent weeks in Arizona inspecting the Lockheed Constellation's four engines, cataloging and replacing parts, and trying to determine whether it could ever fly again. They think it can, and last week, committed to purchasing the plane. The asking price was $1.5 million, though Stoltzfus would not confirm the final sale price.
"We want to purchase it and refurbish it and bring it back to Bridgewater [Virginia] and have it for public display," Stoltzfus said.
The Columbine II is the only privately-owned presidential aircraft in the United States. A rancher and pilot named Mel Christler bought it in a 1970 military surplus auction. The Air Force never told him that the aircraft he wanted to use for crop dusting was Dwight D. Eisenhower's first presidential plane.
"He was getting ready to scrap this airplane [in 1980], and the Smithsonian had been doing some research into aircraft that had carried presidential entourages around and contacted him and asked him if he knew what he had," Christler's grandson, Tim Crowley said.
"My grandfather was a world war two veteran. ... He just felt that since it's an important part of our history, that he had to preserve it."
The plane was never scrapped, but Christler couldn't pull together enough money to restore it. In 1990, a Wyoming rancher named Harry Oliver partnered with Christler to restore the plane to flying conditions.
"[Christler] said, 'Harry, I've given up. I can't afford to keep her any longer and nobody seems to be interested in saving her, and I think I'll put her through the smelter.'" Oliver recalled. "And I told him you know, we can't do that. It's a little bit of our history."
So the pair reassembled the plane in the fall of 1990 and flew it to Eisenhower's hometown of Abilene, Kansas in honor of what would have been the 34th president's 100th birthday.
Ike's plane hasn't flown since 2003. This month, Stoltzfus and his colleagues ran the engines for the first time in 12 years. And soon, the Columbine II may fly again.

This Boeing VC-137C is the first custom-built jet to serve as Air Force One. Codenamed Special Air Mission -- or SAM -- 26000, the airliner witnessed more presidential history than any other -- ranging from the tragic to the hilarious. It sits in the Presidential Gallery at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio . The gallery was closed to visitors in May 2013 because of forced budget cuts.

SAM 26000 may be "the most important historical airplane in the world," said Air Force historian Jeff Underwood. It supported a mission to open U.S relations with China and flew to secret Paris peace talks during the Vietnam War. But it's probably most closely tied to President John F. Kennedy, who first used it in 1962.

At Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, the president's casket was offloaded onto an ambulance from SAM 26000, where it had been placed in the rear of the cabin. "The crew didn't want President Kennedy's casket to travel in the cargo hold," said then-flight engineer Joe Chappell on C-SPAN in 1998 . "So they made room for it in the passenger compartment." To create the extra space, Chappell said he helped remove two rows of seats and a separating wall.

The president's brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, was anxious to board the plane after it arrived. Shown here with the first lady, RFK "leaped up" the airline stairs in a rush to console Mrs. Kennedy, according to historian Steven Gillon. He "pushed his way down" the aisle past President Johnson "without saying a word." Johnson "fumed that Kennedy would board the plane without even acknowledging him," Gillon wrote in "The Kennedy Assassination, 24 Hours After."

Someone in Western Australia was left red faced -- and possibly with a ruined high -- Thursday after police executing a search warrant on a house in Coolbellup, south of Perth, found a weed smoker's "to do" list.
The unnamed person had apparently written out in careful detail a list of activities to tick off for their coming Saturday, including at the end plans to "go home and get a stick" and then "chop up and get stoned".
Unfortunately for the person concerned, Murdoch police force found the list during the search and posted it on Twitter, leading to guffaws all round on the social media platform.
The force later responded to incredulous queries as to whether the list was indeed genuine.
"Yes, the to do list was authentic," the force tweeted. "I don't think any of us here could make it up if we tried! #nosenseofhumour."

Anna Stirr: Massive earthquake is a devastating blow to Nepal, and it will take years to recover
Nepal's musical traditions can help buoy the resilience and spirit necessary to rebuild
Anna Stirr is assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. She is a musician and ethnomusicologist specializing in Himalayan performance and cultures. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

Living on the fault line that has produced the world's highest mountain ranges, the people of Nepal knew there would be a major earthquake someday.
Yet last Saturday's heartbreaking losses still come as a devastating blow, from which Nepal will take years to recover. As the world pitches in to help with immediate relief, thoughts are also beginning to turn to long-term recovery. In the aftermath of the quake, Nepal's musical traditions can help buoy the resilience and spirit necessary to rebuild the country.
Anna Stirr
When they could finally reach each other by phone, flutist Nirmal Singh related his experience of the earthquake to his uncle in Hawaii, who relayed his story to me. Nirmal was performing at a Hindu devotional gathering when the ground began to shake.
After a moment of shock, he grabbed the bag holding all his bamboo flutes and fled the stage, seeking shelter in the open with other musicians and audience members alike. They watched helplessly as Kathmandu crumbled around them. In that moment, they felt their hearts crumble, too.
One day, he will perform music again
Several days later, Nirmal remains in a makeshift camp near the performance site, reeling from the earthquake's devastation. He is trying to get up the courage to walk the five or so miles to his apartment, thinking of the devastation he will pass along the way, and fearful of what he might find when he gets home. Heavy-hearted, he doesn't feel like playing music yet. But he takes comfort in listening.
Nirmal comes from a family of flutists and flute makers. His uncle, fellow flutist and flute maker Ram Kumar Singh, told me he believes music and art will be necessary for the healing process. "When we see and hear Nepali cultural sounds and images, it creates a mood for the victims to be more positive and to unite. Folk music and arts are the medium that creates a feeling of humanity. It totally ignores differences like ethnicity and political parties."

For the last several years, Nepal's government has been trying to restructure the state after a 10-year civil war (1996-2006). Amid well-meaning efforts to right decades of wrongs against marginalized peoples, ethnic identity politics have become a sticking point, and the major political parties have created a stalemate by refusing to compromise.
While marginalized groups fight for long-denied rights and representation, others use the threat of national disintegration to uphold their power and the status quo.
A way to further unity among people of Nepal
Regardless of their own ethnicity or political affiliation, musicians often embrace politics of a different sort. Their claims that music transcends differences are only partly true. Just as often, music and other performing arts celebrate difference, asserting proud identities associated with the country's 126 registered ethnic groups, 123 spoken languages, and many regional and religious affiliations. Yet they do this in the spirit of social inclusion, appealing to notions of common humanity. The politics of music becomes a politics of humanistic unity, rather than antagonistic power plays.
This may sound a bit utopian. But in artists' and ordinary folks' musical responses to the quake, this prevailing discourse about music and unity may help avoid some of the problems that have occurred after other natural disasters. The power struggles over access to aid following the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Sri Lanka threatened neighbors' peaceful co-existence.
Nepal will face similar challenges in the coming weeks, as relief efforts strive to distribute resources equitably under difficult conditions. The extent of damages in hard-hit rural areas still remains to be determined.
So far, reports paint a picture of a country rallying together to survive. In another Kathmandu camp, writer Sanjeev Pokharel tweeted his delight at hearing his neighbors in the next tent singing. Music's symbolic social harmony lives on. Laments provide shared catharsis, the continuation of local traditions sounding elements of hope.
In 2006, the Nepali folk band Kutumba played for programs about disaster relief. I was a guest performer, as was Barta Gandharva, a young singer and sarangi fiddle player. "Let's be safe from earthquakes!" Barta sang to a crowd in the ancient town of Sanothimi, a few miles east of Kathmandu. This town was all but destroyed in the last major earthquake of 1934, and on Saturday was once again reduced to rubble.
That day in 2006, we called elders up to the stage, and they told us their memories of the 1934 earthquake. "Everything was broken," said one old man. "Our hearts still cry, remembering." For a few moments he appeared lost in his sadness, years of hardships etched in the lines on his face. Then he, too, began to dance to the music.

        <MainBody>More protests scheduled for Friday in Baltimore and other cities
Police reveal additional previously unmentioned van stop, arousing protester suspicions
New accounts make the mystery of Freddie Gray's death more complex, contradictory
Watch a CNN special report, "Police Under Fire," at 9 p.m. ET/PT Monday.
(CNN)
Frustrated by what they consider an unsatisfying trickle of answers, those angry over the death of Freddie Gray plan protests from coast to coast Friday.
At least four rallies or marches are planned in Baltimore alone, with other demonstrations scheduled in Chicago, New York, Seattle, Dallas, San Francisco and Oakland, California.
The mother of Trayvon Martin, the African-American youth killed in 2012 by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, plans to attend one of the Baltimore rallies, the Rev. Jamal Bryant of Baltimore's Empowerment Temple said in a tweet.
Authorities pleaded for patience Thursday after police said they'd finished their investigation but wouldn't publicly release their findings. Police turned their files over to prosecutors.
Some Baltimore businesses join fight for change
"We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system," Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Thursday.
For the most part, that patience held Thursday night. Marches were peaceful in Baltimore, although police in Philadelphia clashed with protesters as officers tried to prevent them from blocking a highway.

Police statement raises more questions
While the police investigation is complete, Mosby's office said her office will conduct its own inquiry.
"We are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified," she said.
Also upcoming: an autopsy report from the medical examiner's office that could help explain what happened.
As of now, the mystery of how the 25-year-old died has only grown more complex.
Police revealed Thursday a transport van carrying Gray made an additional stop after his arrest April 12.  Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said the stop was recorded by a privately owned video camera, arousing suspicion among protesters who wondered why it was not previously mentioned.
The video belonged to shop owner Hwang Jung, who said police copied the footage. The original was lost when his store was subsequently looted, he said.

The new stop, Davis said, came between the first and second stops. Before it surfaced, police had spoken of three stops before arriving at the police precinct -- one to put leg irons on Gray, a second "to deal with Mr. Gray," and a third to pick up an additional prisoner.
That second stop remains under investigation.
Also Thursday, three new accounts surfaced on how and where he sustained the severe spine injury that led to his death on April 19.
One indicated that it may have been during his arrest, while two others suggested it may have happened during the ride to the police station where an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. He died a week later.
Was it in the van?
Gray may have been mortally injured in the van, according to a report by CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington. The police investigation did not find he died from injuries caused during his arrest, the station reported, citing "multiple law enforcement sources briefed on the police findings."
Gray slammed into part of the police van, which apparently broke his neck, the investigation found. A head injury matches up to a bolt in the van, the report said, which did not mention how the injury may have happened.
An official in the state's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner wouldn't comment to CNN on the report, citing the ongoing investigation.
Police have said that Gray had not been properly fastened into the van.

 Miguel Marquez (@miguelmarquez) May 1, 2015
Gray may have inflicted the injuries upon himself, according to a second report, which cited an account of a police interview with a man placed into the van after Gray.
The man told investigators he thought Gray "was intentionally trying to injure himself," according to The Washington Post , citing a Baltimore police investigation document.
Police said the man told them he could hear Gray "banging against the walls" of the van, according to the newspaper.
Gray family attorney Mary Koch discounted that theory Friday on CNN's "New Day."
"Given the medical injuries that Freddie Gray suffered, ultimately it would take a lot for me to believe that he would have done that to himself," she said.
Was it during the arrest?
But the account of a woman related to one of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest appeared to contradict the two media reports.
She said that the officer believes Gray was injured during his arrest, although he does not know this for sure. She spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity and said the officer didn't ask her to give the interview.

Do body cameras prevent excessive force? 02:28
Washington (CNN)
The Department of Justice is launching a $20 million pilot program funding body cameras for police officers in the wake of renewed protests over police treatment of minorities.
It's a rare concrete step towards criminal justice reform from the administration, and it comes as Americans are taking to the streets to speak out against yet another case in which an African American man died in police custody under controversial circumstances.
The program would award $20 million in as many 50 grants for police departments to buy the cameras and train officers on their use, with about a third of the funds going to small law enforcement agencies. Officials have also allocated $1 million for the Bureau of Justice Statistics to develop a program to study the impact of the cameras.
RELATED: Hillary Clinton calls for mandatory body cameras
Critics say President Barack Obama hasn't taken enough action to respond to issues with law enforcement.
While the White House launched a policing task force earlier this year, in response to initial protests in Ferguson, Missouri, the panel didn't recommend the use of body cameras in its report proposing reforms to law enforcement. But camera footage has proved pivotal in a number of recent controversial incidents involving police, including the death of South Carolinian Walter Scott at the hands of a white police officer. That officer was charged with murder after an eyewitness video caught him firing multiple shots at Scott's back as he turned and ran from police.

Home runs exist beyond the realm of sluggers in Major League Baseball -- a few racehorses hit them too.
The metaphor is used so often to describe the boom or bust nature of investing in thoroughbreds that the baseball term has reached the racecourse.
Follow @cnnsport
Hitting home runs when buying into horses is a lot like buying penny stocks, shareholders aim to reap multiple rewards for their initial capital, or face the reality that their investment is a dud.
Carpe Diem, the third favorite for Saturday's Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, is one horse with a home run habit.
Purchased one year ago for $1.6 million by co-owners WinStar Farm and Stonestreet Stables, the colt has already produced a staggering 400% return on paper for his investors.
A pair of wins in prestigious Grade I races shot his market value up to $8 million -- and there could be more to come.
Should Carpe Diem win the "Run for the Roses" on Saturday, Elliot Walden, president of racing operations at WinStar, estimates he could be worth as much as $15 to $20 million.
"It's hard to say this when you are spending $1.6 million for (a horse) but basically they are business decisions," he said of WinStar's purchasing strategy.
"It's not like you would expect a return on an investment where you can materialize four, five or eight percent. It's either going to be a home run or a failure."
Carpe Diem feeling good coming off the track @ChurchillDowns . Ready for Saturday! #SeizeTheDerby WATCH: https://t.co/GpPfExXPTj
 WinStar Farm (@WinStarFarm) April 29, 2015
Carpe Diem, to be ridden by John Velazquez in the Derby, is, in a way, more of a solid investment.
He was purchased for a premium from a pinhooker -- a trader in young horses aiming for a profit -- because of his famous pedigree. The three-year-old was sired from famous race winner Giant's Causeway and Rebridled Dream.
Depending on his performance on track, a stallion from a regal bloodline can fetch in stud between $5,000 to $100,000 per mare 100 times a year for up to 20 years. The annuity can eventually mitigate -- and sometimes far surpass -- the upfront costs of a thoroughbred.
But Carpe Diem's owners are also running a dark horse in the Kentucky Derby, thanks to the persuasive powers of Jerry Brown, president of Thoro-Graph, a performance tracker and consultant to racehorse investors.
Brown successfully convinced Walden to invest a minority stake in Upstart, a thoroughbred with a relatively modest bloodline who is an outsider going into the famous race at Churchill Downs.
For an entire year Brown has been tracking what he considered to be impressive finishes by the colt, even though he wasn't always winning.
"This horse is not only really good, but really concealed," said Brown, "which is where I come in."

Riding on the tails of major releases that circled the globe, Romeo Santos and Enrique Iglesias dominated the 2015 Billboard Latin Music Awards presented by State Farm, taking home 10 and nine awards, respectively.
Santos was the top winner of the evening, grabbing 10 awards -- including artist of the year -- during the ceremony, which was broadcast live on the Telemundo network from the BankUnited Center in Miami. Santos also won for songwriter of the year, producer of the year, Hot Latin Songs artist of the year and for Top Latin Album and tropical album of the year for Formula, Vol. 2.

After securing his first award, Santos thanked all the musicians who collaborated with him on his album, naming Carlos Santana, Nicki Minaj and Drake.
After winning the big award for artist of the year, he said he'd forgotten to name-check someone "very important. I had the great privilege of recording with a man I admire so much. More than an artist that I admire, he is like a brother to me. Thank you, Marc," he said. Marc Anthony blew him a kiss from the seats.
And in addition to the fans, Santos thanked the DJs that promote his music by playing his songs and he named some of the big ones -- Alex Sensation, DJ Lobo, DJ Africa, DJ Fabulare.

Iglesias' "Bailando" won Latin pop song of the year, digital song of the year, streaming song of the year, Hot Latin Song of the year, vocal event, and airplay song of the year. The track featuring Descemer Bueno and the Cuban group Gente De Zona spent a record-breaking 41 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.
Iglesias' awards also included Latin pop songs artist of the year, solo and Latin pop album of the year for Sex and Love. He made like an airplane and flew onstage to grab his first two awards. "I want to thank my fans for their support and love all these years," he said, recognizing also his label and producer as he held onto both awards with tight fists. "Thank you Miami. Thank you Latin America. Thank you Mexico. Thank you world!"
He went onstage again a little later to receive his five awards for the hit "Bailando." Iglesias was joined by Bueno and members of Gente De Zona. "This is for all Cubans, those in Cuba and those who are here," Bueno said.
Billboard Latin Music Awards 2015: Daddy Yankee performs
Newcomer J Balvin, who for the first time was a finalist at these awards, took home three trophies including new artist of the year.
"Colombia," he yelled when he went on stage, cradling his awards. "Thanks first to God and to the people who support me, to the radio, my team... Mother! This is for you." He added, "it is a new era for urban music. Reggaeton is getting bigger than ever."
Banda Sinaloense MS de Sergio Lizrraga also received at hattrick of awards. Carlos Santana and Wisin each won two awards, and there was a brace of posthumous honors for Jenni Rivera.
Santana, who was also feted with the Spirit of Hope Award for his work with the Milagro Foundation, performed with his pal Juanes, who presented him with the award he quickly dedicated to his daughter, Angelica Faith, and labor leader and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta, who he called the "patroness of justice and truth."
"I invite all of you to change the world with your own light," said the spiritual Santana. "May the heavens open up and the angels bless each and every one with a deep awareness of your own light."
The legendary guitarist and Juanes -- looking a lot like a younger version of Santana with his black hat -- opened with "Black Magic Woman" and followed with verses from "La Flaca" and "Juntos."
Billboard's Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to singer/songwriter Roberto Carlos, the iconic -- and best-selling -- Brazilian act whose songs represent more than three generations of listeners throughout Latin America. Carlos, who performed a medley of his songs -- marking the first time he ever sang on national television in the U.S. -- was given his award by another icon, Marc Anthony.
"This award honors artists whose outstanding careers have influenced several generations," Anthony said. "Tonight, this honor is given to a man with an admirable and moving voice, a true master whose talent has left forever a mark on the world of music and in our hearts."
Carlos performed a menagerie of his three biggest songs, beginning and ending with "Amigo" and singing verses of "Amada Amante" and "Detalles" in between.
Later, Anthony went back on stage to receive the award for the best tour.
"This award means I had the honor of finding myself with my public day after day, night after night," Anthony said. "I dedicate it to my children for the sacrifice of having a father who travels so much, giving myself each night to my fans. He added, "what an honor. I hope to be here in 10 years, getting the same award because I was born to do this."
Sony Music swept in the label categories, winning 11 awards, including Hot Latin Songs label and imprint of the year and Top Latin Albums imprint of the year. Universal Music Latin Entertainment won five label awards, including airplay label of the year and Top Latin Albums label of the year.
Sony/ATV Music Publishing won publishing corporation of the year, while indie Mayimba Music won publisher of the year.
The awards, which featured a dizzying array of acts, opened with a performance by Marc Anthony with Gente de Zona. Anthony was immediately followed by Nicky Jam -- who has taken the new urban Latin music world by storm with his comeback -- wearing a cap where he identified himself as a Paisarricano, embracing both his Puerto Rican roots and his adopted Colombian home.
One of the other highlight performances was historic. Luis Fonsi joined Afrojack and Ne-Yo in what proved to be the first time that EDM would be featured on a Hispanic network.
"Over the years, the Billboard Awards has been known for being at the forefront, and this one of those moments when we will mark the path for others to follow," Fernandez said.
In other standout performances:
Spanish singer Natalia Jimenez, formerly of La 5a Estacion, strutted out in a colorful dress and flowered crown looking like an Aztecan queen. She wore the same crown to accept her award for female artist of the year.
Carlos Vives was joined by Wisin and Daddy Yankee (both in the sunglasses that seemed de rigueur for male urban Latin performers) for a rousing performance of "Nota de Amor" that had the audience on their feet dancing.
When the curtain opened on Romeo Santos, the night's big winner, he was on a gilded throne that seemed appropriate for the King of Bachata -- and the king of the night.
Ana Gabriel and Lucero dressed in matching glittery black lace to sing songs from the tribute album that Lucero made with Ana Gabriel's songs.
The ceremony took pause for reflection, and for a call to action, when Fernandez highlighted the earthquake in Nepal that left 5,000 people dead and millions affected.
"This is indeed a night of celebration, however we could not fail to mention the devastating earthquake that shook Nepal," he said. "Everyone can help remake this nation, donating to the International Red Cross with a click at www.redcross.org."
The Billboard Latin Music Awards were the culmination of the Billboard Latin Music Conference, which took place April 27-30 at the Ritz Carlton South Beach. Finalists and winners to the awards are determined by their performance on the Billboard charts.

'Bubble girl' is allergic to life

Living with mast cell disease 04:02
Story highlights
Brynn Duncan has mast cell disease, which causes her to be allergic to almost everything
Duncan has a feeding tube and is on constant doses of antihistamine
Easley, South Carolina (CNN)
The cracker or the bite of ice cream -- Brynn Duncan still isn't sure which one sent her into anaphylactic shock that day. Her food allergies change so frequently, keeping track is almost pointless.
It was just another day with another massive allergic reaction.
She can always tell when one is coming on. "I just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom." Her labradoodle, Moose, starts alerting, licking her hands frantically.
"I'll feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach, and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling. And we have to treat it really fast."
On that particular day in March, multiple EpiPens didn't slow the reaction. The paramedics who arrived to take Brynn to Greenville Memorial Hospital, or "Hotel Greenville" as she likes to call it, knew her well. When she asked for her security blanket, they knew to hand her her smartphone.
"New day, new crisis," Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong. It might as well be. When you're allergic to life, a near-death experience is no big deal.
Center of attention
Less than a week after her trip to the hospital, Brynn, 21, is back at home in Easley, South Carolina. She lies on her back, her head near the foot of her bed, chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port.
Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. The disinfectant burns, and Brynn's blood pressure hits 150/102. Her heart rate rockets to 128.
"The meds we have to give her to keep her alive, she reacts to," Melissa says, shaking her head. "Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. "

Brynn was seemingly a normal kid -- until she wasn't. Yes, she was a fussy baby. Yes, she got sick often as a child, Melissa muses out loud -- but what kid doesn't? Brynn was also incredibly energetic, always the center of attention. Her father, Barry, jokingly rues the day she learned to talk. She started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11. That was the same year doctors diagnosed Brynn with IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome .
"She's always been --" Melissa Duncan pauses.
"High maintenance!" Brynn fills in with a laugh.
It wasn't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that Brynn had her first serious allergic reaction. The next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors' appointments.
Brynn saw specialist after specialist. The gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis, or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles. A cardiologist said she had POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes, her blood pressure dropped, leaving her light-headed and nauseated. A Wake Forest doctor diagnosed her with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints.
After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. They found a specialist online, Dr. Lawrence Afrin, who at the time was working in Charleston. They waited nearly nine months to see him, but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life-changing.
Causes of mast cell disease
Scientists don't know yet what causes mast cell disease. Researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior, but the mutations vary from one patient to the next. Because of this, scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life. But genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations.
Mast cells are the regulators of your immune system. They're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites, or when you come into contact with an allergen. They basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong.
Until recently, the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis, which is characterized by "abnormal proliferation and activation" of the body's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways.
But in the last few years doctors such as Afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number.
"It's like I'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction," Brynn explains simply.
Fruit, vegetables, milk, soy, nuts, smoke, perfume, the sun -- you name it, Brynn is allergic to it. But it's not really about the specifics; the allergens change depending on how "angry" her mast cells are that day, she says. On good days, she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes. On bad days, even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain.
Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. "Oh God, no," Afrin says when asked. "No, no, no, no."
But mast cells are located in your connective tissue, including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine. They can affect every system in the body, Afrin says, so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms Brynn experiences.
You have to ask yourself, he says: "Is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different, independent problems? Or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on?"
Of course, having a diagnosis didn't make living with mast cell disease any easier.
In 2012, Brynn was admitted to the hospital 30 times. She started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful, violent muscle contractions that are "scary to see and scary to experience." On multiple occasions, doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction.

"I've seen doctors and nurses step back, kind of like 'What is this?'" Barry Duncan says.
Every time she went to the ER, Brynn was given a large dose of steroids to calm the inflammation. She's now steroid dependent -- and likely will be for life.
"We could be here for days, and you still would not understand all the inner workings of Brynn and all of her medical issues," Melissa Duncan says. "But I think the underlying one is the mast cell disease, which is a beast, and continues to become a bigger beast, day by day."
Living in a bubble
Brynn spent her 19th birthday in the hospital. An allergic reaction made her miss a zip lining trip for her 20th. On December 31, her 21st birthday, when many young adults would be out celebrating the legal drinking age with friends, she was at home still recuperating from Christmas. She had joined the holiday festivities by eating a special pizza -- made with fake bread and fake cheese.
"It's nasty," Barry Duncan says with a laugh. "It's the worst pizza you've ever tasted." But "for her, the worst pizza you've ever had ... tastes really good."
Opinion: Funding a cure for food allergies
Brynn dreams about real stuffed crust pizza sometimes. And mozzarella sticks. Occasionally she lets her spunky attitude drop, and you see that she understands the effect her illness has on those around her.
Her parents have spent weeks sleeping in cramped hospital chairs. Her younger siblings have missed vacations and school ceremonies; they've learned how to inject Brynn with an EpiPen, and how to hold her limbs still during a dystonia episode.
"There's a lot of guilt that goes along with having a chronic illness," Brynn says. "You feel like a burden. And people can tell you you're not, but no matter what, in your head, you feel that you are."
A photo posted by Brynn Duncan (@brynnkaitlin) on
Mar 26, 2015 at 7:18pm PDT
She has moments when she gets jealous of her high school friends who are doing all the things she can't -- attending college, moving out, finding boyfriends. She and her new friends, others with chronic illnesses she met online, have a saying: "Single and ready to mingle -- as long as you have good health insurance."
And with a giggle, the dark moment passes. Skyping with her friends keeps her spirits up. She's prolific on Instagram , with more than 5,300 followers, and writes regularly on her blog, which is called " Brynn's Bubble ."
"A lot of people with this disease ... do, in a sense, have to live in a bubble, because it's really difficult to get the symptoms under control," Brynn says. "You spend a lot of time alone. And it can be very isolating. But thanks to social media, I haven't felt alone."
Over the last two years, Brynn and her family have made progress in managing her disease. She was one of the first patients in the nation to be put on a continuous IV of antihistamine. Intravenous immune globulin, or IVIG, therapy , when a healthy donor's plasma is used to boost a patient's immune system, cut in half the number of drugs she needs.
Of course, she still needs a lot -- a compounding pharmacy delivers a box to her house once or twice a week. The meds make her brain foggy. She punctuates conversations with "Where'd that thought go?" But that doesn't stop her from talking. She plans to keep talking until mast cell disease receives the attention she feels it deserves.
"'You don't look sick' -- that's one of the comments that I get a lot. Or they say, 'At least it's not cancer,' and that's another hard one, because these illnesses can be just as devastating," Brynn says. "The difference is they're not understood. And the only way to change that is to somehow bring awareness to it."
Early in her taekwondo career, Brynn's instructor told her that she could win a match before it even began -- just by staring down the opponent. She plans to fight mast cell disease the same way.

He's come a long way from the floppy-fringed teenager who defied football stereotypes to become a global fashion icon.
David Beckham turns 40 on Saturday, entering a new era in the metamorphosis of his incredible earning power.
He once sported a Jean-Paul Gaultier sarong, but now his catwalk appearances are more likely to be in support of wife Victoria's blossoming fashion design career, as he dons classic suits befitting the increased status of his business ventures.

Beckham reportedly earns more since his 2013 retirement from football than when he was a highly-paid player at some of the world's biggest clubs.
But has the man dubbed "Golden Balls" reached too far away from his core values with a couple of his latest ventures, promoting alcohol -- as a player he always insisted he was not a drinker -- and being associated with a casino chain?

He took home $75 million in the past year according to a 2015 Forbes list of non-active athletes , helping launch a niche single-grain whiskey with drinks giant Diageo and partnering Las Vegas Sands -- which has gambling operations in the U.S. and Asia among its resorts -- as he beat his previous high of $51 million.
"I don't think it's a good move," says former Saatchi and Saatchi advertising executive Alex Fynn , who believes father-of-four Beckham should stick to what made him so popular in the first place -- sports, fashion and family-oriented entertainment.
"When he started off, he was a celebrity endorser -- but because most of the attributes that he personifies have been so positive, he was able to become a brand in himself," says Fynn, who has been a marketing and media consultant to top sports teams and ruling bodies since leaving Saatchi in the mid-'90s.
"It's a great problem when you go into areas that are not related to your specific area of competence or renown. He has core values which are so much more widespread than most celebrities. He should stick to that -- there's no need to link himself to extraneous products or services."
Beckham's representatives insist the relationship with Las Vegas Sands is primarily about helping establish the group as a travel destination while the link with Diageo reflects the former England international's appeal to mature fathers rather than teenagers.

The other half of Brand Beckham, widely credited for turning her husband from soccer's shy boy-prodigy into a pioneering "metrosexual," is now garnering serious respect in the fashion world.
Having found pop fame in the '90s as pouty Posh in the Spice Girls, she has reinvented herself as a designer, and in December 2013 was guest editor for the French edition of style bible Vogue.
"They are a brilliant composite brand, Posh and Becks," says British society commentator Peter York. "They're in Hollywood and Holland Park. They've become very much more knowing, very much more elegant.
"The great thing is, they're hitting 40, you've got to do things a different way," adds York, co-author of the influential aspirational guide "The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook " and writer of the recently released " Authenticity is a Con ."
"You've got to be able to transition into things that are a bit more solid and not just about singing or showing your body off. The only danger is being spread too thin."

But can Beckham, a man whose tattooed, near-naked body has been posted on giant advertising billboards around the world, be taken seriously as a business leader in his own right?
"To a certain extent, I think Beckham is currently 'lost in transition,'" says British sports business expert Simon Chadwick.
"He is still very popular and is presumably able to continue drawing upon the revenue opportunities that were created during his playing days.
"But as his tribulations in Florida demonstrate, his reputation as a player alone is unlikely to sustain him in the long term when it comes to the harsh realities of business."
Beckham's bid to set up a new Major League Soccer franchise in Miami, made possible by a $25 million clause in his playing contract when he joined Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007, has been beset by delays since it was announced 14 months ago.
Despite the delays, the Beckham camp are confident they're close to finalizing an investor group and that by 2018 the Miami franchise will be up and running.
Fynn believes it is the right move for Beckham, in contrast to working with a casino group -- "which should be resisted."
"The MLS is a successful operation, football in America is growing at club and national team level, and the opportunity of being involved in a U.S. franchise is an extension of his playing career," he says.

York says club ownership could expose Beckham to "fantastically dodgy third-raters who are there to exploit people in silly deals" but that he and his wife have always been "very good" at finding the right people to advise them.
Career opportunities
Victoria's Spice Girls career was groomed by pop Svengali Simon Fuller, the "American Idol" creator whose 19 Entertainment agency has been largely responsible for shaping David's financial fortunes.
With Fuller's guidance, Beckham -- as well as trying to make a hit of the niche Haig Club whiskey -- is now developing his own-branded products and partnering with retailers such as H&amp;M.
"The Beckham brand captured the early 21st-century zeitgeist, which played out well across the world," says Chadwick.
"It was the epitome of the metrosexual male: ambitious and successful; good husband and father; sexy and well dressed; sensitive and caring while remaining masculine.
"He defined a new type of athlete brand which, even now, has yet to be duplicated in the same way -- the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo simply haven't been able to duplicate the brand proposition that Beckham has been now for almost two decades."
However, it is now time for the ex-Manchester United and England star to create "Beckham Mark II," says Chadwick, an upgrade which "moves him on from the 'Class of '92,' the Spice Girls and Real Madrid."
"I think he's still largely trading on the equity of his 'Beckham Mark I' incarnation. If he isn't to become the new Pele of his era -- signing whatever lucrative deal comes his way -- then Beckham and his advisers need to create a more compelling, contemporary and relevant brand proposition," Chadwick claims.
"For the first time in many years, I think Brand Beckham lacks clarity and focus."
As proof of that strategic inconsistency, Chadwick points to Beckham's work at the 2012 Olympics and the UN, which positioned him as a sports diplomat, while his MLS project suggests he wants to be a sports entrepreneur.
"The problem is, he can't be everything to everyone, and he (and his advisers) therefore need to create a clear, tightly-defined and well-accentuated brand proposition in the same way as the Beckham of 10 years ago was," adds Chadwick.
It's an argument that is rejected by Beckham's people who point to a coherent strategy built around Beckham as a creative director in promoting a number of brands, his role at Miami, as well as his ever increasing charity work, which he views as a key part of the legacy he wants to leave for his children.
Earlier this year Beckham launched a charitable collaboration with UNICEF -- the world's leading organisation for children -- providing help to kids in danger zones across the globe.
"My number one priority is the '7' fund," Beckham told CNN at the launch in London.

Simply the Becks
While Beckham has been criticized for his associations with gambling and alcohol  -- though curiously a British advertising standards body ruled he is no longer considered a role model for children when rejecting a viewer complaint -- he has made further inroads into the Asian market.
As well as being the face of Sands China, which has casino operations in Macau among its divisions, in 2013 he signed a multimillion-dollar deal to become a goodwill ambassador for the Chinese Super League.
"I think it's a risky thing," says York. "It's quite difficult to crack China. It can take a long time and a lot of money, and there's a lot of competition in that market."
However, Fynn believes Beckham is a perfect fit for the Chinese market if he sticks to football and is not being used by the national federation -- which has cracked down on corruption at all levels in recent years -- to "cover up past mistakes."
"They love Premier League football and although it's some years since he played in the Premier League, he's associated with the best of English football," says Fynn, who also writes soccer books, most recently 2014's " Arsene and Arsenal ."
"More than that, he's a world superstar over and above his limited playing ability. If you go back to the impact he had at Paris Saint-Germain, he was only a bit-part player but he gave the club a sense of credibility and popularity that had hitherto been lacking."

'Extreme intelligent self-consciousness'
York believes the Beckhams have shown over the years they have the skills to adapt to new challenges.
"When he started, British footballers weren't known for being very articulate, but he was particularly inarticulate -- people talked about him as if he was stupid," York explains.
"Even though he was living a modern life, he seemed to be part of the old cockney world. He didn't talk Estuary (a refined southern English accent), he talked cockney -- 'we was, you was.' Now he can hold his own on a platform. He knows his way around. An extraordinary confidence.
"Because of that, because he's more able to express himself, you know that really he's pretty canny," adds York, who in August will perform a new one-man event, "A Show for the Nicer Type of Person," at the Edinburgh Fringe festival.
"He's learned to vamp a camera like a model does, how to use his body, how to be happily objectified and make money from it. He knows what he's doing at every point, in the way that someone who's a professional model does, and more.
"He didn't used to -- he was just a nice-looking footballer who wore nice-looking footballer suits -- then he became this heavily-inked, much-undressed person. It's like being an actor or model, you have to learn extreme intelligent self-consciousness."

Miami acid test
The Miami venture -- in which Beckham is a co-owner with Fuller and Bolivian businessman Marcelo Claure -- could be crucial to the future of the family brand.
"It would give them a way of transitioning into early middle age in a right way," says York. "He's done everything commercial you can do in sport except own a team."
Fynn hopes the franchise will be more successful than Beckham's soccer academies in London and Los Angeles, which closed within five years of their 2005 launch.
"Possibly not enough care and attention was given to the concept for it to be successful," he says.
The expansion franchise has twice been denied in its plans to find a downtown venue for a new stadium, and its entry date into the MLS has yet to be confirmed.
"The next two or three years are therefore likely to be an acid test of just how proficient Beckham is as an entrepreneur, leader and manager," adds Chadwick.
What is not in doubt is Beckham's place among the entertainment elite. He will reportedly fly his friends -- including Hollywood heavyweight and fellow motorbike aficionado Tom Cruise -- to Morocco for his birthday celebrations.
As the old saying goes, "Life begins at 40."
Only time will tell if that proves to be true for Brand Beckham.

(CNN)
If this car could talk, it would describe a road to fame with all the twists and turns of a Hollywood plot.
The original of only six models ever built, it was the first American car to beat Ferrari on its own turf, was once engulfed by flames in Daytona, was driven around Los Angeles by a music celebrity, and then sat for 30 years in a storage unit -- leading many to believe it had been lost.
The extraordinary vehicle was the brainchild of an American car legend, who used it to win championships and shatter speed records. Once retrieved from its dusty alcove, the car sparked a multi-million dollar legal battle for its ownership.
Today, 50 years after it was built, the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe prototype finally sits in its rightful place -- a museum founded by its current owner.
A car with a mission
As the name suggests, the car was created by  American automotive entrepreneur, Carroll Shelby , who wanted to beat Italian designer Enzo Ferrari.
He had already done so as a driver with Aston Martin, wining the prestigious FIA World Sportscar Championship in 1959, a series that the "prancing horse" was otherwise dominating.
Shelby at Le Mans in an Aston Martin, 1959.
But in 1963, years after Shelby had hung up his racing gloves, he wanted to win as a constructor -- with an American car, at that.
Shelby modeled his dream machine on the basis of a previous racer he had developed, the AC Cobra Roadster .
He hired designer Pete Brock to shape the car for maximum speed -- something it would need on the legendary 3-mile Mulsanne straight at Le Mans , the most important race in the championship.
Thus was born the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe prototype, made with modest means compared to today's standards, in a shop in Venice, California.
At the time, American cars weren't very competitive, says Fred Simeone, the current owner of the car and founder of the Simeone Museum , where it's currently displayed.
"If you look at the history of sports car racing, America had contributed very little by then compared to England, Italy, Germany and even France," he said.
The Daytonas were about to change that. They fared well during their maiden year, 1964, with a standout win in their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans -- "The Superbowl of racing," Simeone calls it. But although they outclassed Corvettes, Lolas, Porsches, and Alfas, the Daytonas still finished the championship behind the mighty Ferrari GTOs .
In 1965, Shelby finally took first place -- the first ever American racing team to do so -- taking 9 of 12 events in their class, with crucial wins in yet more legendary races, such as the 24 Hours of Daytona itself, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, and the grueling 1,000 km race at the Nurburgring Nordshcleife, a 14-mile forest road track that legend driver Jackie Stewart would later nickname "The Green Hell."
Shelby had beaten Ferrari. The legend of the Cobra Daytona Coupe was born.
Enter the "CSX2287"
The car that Shelby had built in Venice remained the only one made in America. Five more were sent as frames to Modena, Italy -- right under Ferrari's nose -- where the bodywork was completed expertly and quickly.
The CSX2287 on fire at Daytona.
That prototype car, chassis number CSX2287, was therefore already special.
It was also lucky, surviving a fire while refueling in Daytona in 1964 -- an incident which cost the race, but not the car.
And to many, it was beautiful -- complete with Le Mans stripes, two white bands that ran the length of the car over the Viking blue paint, a pattern that has since become iconic and is strongly associated with the Cobras designed by Shelby as production cars for Ford.
Its style had substance to match. After winning the 1965 championship, the car, somewhat retired from racing, had still a lot of speed left in it, and got a chance to prove it.
Speeding on salt
On November 6, 1965, the CSX2287 had not been raced for months, but the opportunity presented itself to haul it to the Bonneville Salt Flats to race against the clock and write history.
Over four days, the car set 23 national and international speed records, reaching a top speed of 187 miles per hour.
The CSX2287 at the Bonneville Salt Flats, driven by five-time land speed record holder Craig Breedlove.
That was the last roar of the lion. Shelby then sold the original Daytona -- at this point little more than a tired old prototype -- to Jim Russell, founder of a toy car company called Russkits, for $4,500.
And that's where the weirdest part of the story begins.
The wall of (engine) sound
The Daytona soon landed in the hands of eccentric music producer Phil Spector , 26 years old at the time. He scribbled the car's records with house paint on the doors -- ridiculously exaggerating them -- and started driving it around Los Angeles.
This wasn't the first time the car was seen outside a track, as Shelby himself did several test runs in Marina del Rey with a manufacturer's plate.
But lightning quick as it was, it cost Spector so many tickets that his lawyer eventually suggested he get rid of it. Added to that, it was far from a smooth ride and became hot as hell after just a few miles.
This was no Sunset strip cruiser, but an angry thoroughbred racer, after all.
Spector wanted to fix these issues, but the cost was so high that he was allegedly offered to scrap it for $800 instead. Luckily he knew better, and sold it to his bodyguard, George Brand, for $1,000.
Brand gave the car to his daughter, Dorothy, who then did the unthinkable -- she hid it away in a California storage unit.
Hidden treasure
Precisely as to why Dorothy Brand made the conscious decision to just store the Daytona, dutifully paying the rent every month for 30 years, nobody knows.
Over the years, interest mounted around the car and she received several offers for it, but always refused. "She would rebuff anybody who presented themselves as interested in the car," said Simeone.
Carroll Shelby himself went to see the car, but she wouldn't even open her door for him
Fred Simeone
"Carroll Shelby himself went to visit her to see the car, and she wouldn't even open her screen door to talk to him. It was widely known she had it, but it was also widely known that you couldn't communicate with her... people had given up going for it."
"A very realistic offer"
As a result, the CSX2287 remained untouched from 1971 to 2001.
The car in its current condition.
With the help of a lawyer and car dealer, Martin Eyears, a retired neurosurgeon, and collector, Frederick Simeone, finally managed to convince Dorothy Brand to sell him the car for an amount he'd rather not disclose, but believed to be around $4 million.
"It was persistence and timing, the right place at the right time that produced the sale, and a very realistic offer," he says.
In 2008, he founded the Simeone Automotive Museum in his native Philadelphia, where the car now sits among 65 other classic racers.
"My criteria for collection are a significant history, original condition, American origin whenever possible, and beauty. At the time of purchase, in 2001, the only car that I didn't have that fit all those criteria was the Cobra Daytona Coupe, so I really wanted it very badly," he says.
What happened next is the darkest part of the story -- "I hate to tell it, this is a happy story and the bottom of it is a downer. She [Brand] willed the proceeds of the sale to her mother and then set herself on fire. That was after the deal had been done."
A difficult aftermath
Dorothy Brand's shocking demise sparked a legal battle around the car that lasted for months. "The aftermath of the sale was was more difficult than the sale itself, because when word got out among the motoring community that the car was discovered and was being purchased by a private party, a lot of people desperately tried to buy it, and asked a judge to put it up for public sale," says Simeone.
The aftermath of the sale was was more difficult than the sale itself
Fred Simeone
Even Phil Spector, through his lawyer Robert Shapiro -- famous for having been one of O.J. Simpson's defendants -- claimed ownership by saying he never actually sold the car to his bodyguard, but only gave it to him for safekeeping.
"Everybody was gonna wanna have a story," says Simeone, "But the judge concluded rightfully that it had already been sold legitimately."
Modern legend
It's difficult to say how much the car is worth today, 14 years after that sale.
The other five Daytonas -- those produced in Italy -- are all in the hands of private collectors, with one sold at auction in 2009 for $7.5 million. It's safe to assume that the CSX2287 would fetch significantly more, since it's the first prototype, it's the last Daytona to have been in competition, and -- unlike the others -- it's still in its original state, with no parts replaced and no repainting done.
The CSX2287's interior today, in its original, unrestored condition.
"The car was in excellent condition out of storage, all of the original bits were there, no missing parts," says Simeone.
"Only the front end was banged in, so we had to hammer that out because it was simply too ugly. The rest of the paint was dull but intact and all we had to do was get rid of the oxidation, and it came out very decent. The only things that we had to replace ended up being brake lines and a few bits of wiring."
Phil Spector's five years of ownership did not mess it up too much either. "He just had upholstery put it, that's all, and he put some writing on the side of the car, with house paint, but we were able to get that off," says Simeone.
The cars runs well, even on its original tires, and has been driven many times for shows and demonstrations, even though it's no longer raced.
"We get into a little trouble with some people who think it should, but it's pointless and we'd risk damaging it. We want to preserve it for future generations," added Simeone.
A place in history
The CSX2287 was the very first car -- and one of only seven so far -- to be included in the National Historic Vehicle Register , putting it in the same class as American icons like the Statue of Liberty and the Space Shuttle.
It was constructed on a shop floor and designed on a sheet of butcher paper

It was also named Car of the Year in 2014 at the International Historic Motoring Awards , the Oscars of classic automobiles -- the first ever American car to even get nominated for the award.
"It was constructed on a shop floor and designed on a sheet of butcher paper, right at the end of an era when something could be built so simply and win on an international level," said Mark Gessler, president of the Historic Vehicle Association .
Strikingly designed and with a history that reads like a Hollywood script, this car is the stuff of legend.
"The iconic forerunner of a winning breed," as Simeone defines it, which kick-started America's short but glorious dominance in road racing.
The CSX2287 Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe is on display at the Simeone Automotive Museum , in Philadelphia.

"The Fight of the Century"  There is nothing more exhilarating than watching two masterful contenders skillfully dance their way around the ring as they attempt to best each other in the "sweet science." So as Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather prepare to duke it out on Saturday, CNN takes a look at the best bouts in the history of boxing.

Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier III (Oct. 1, 1975)  Where better to start than one of the most famous clashes of all-time -- The "Thrilla in Manila." On October 1 1975, U.S. boxer Muhammad Ali took on his nemesis Joe Frazier for the third time in a brutal battle just outside the Philippine capital.
Amid the soaring temperatures, the pair slugged it out for the world heavyweight title. Often hailed as one of the greatest fights in sporting history, the pair known for their tumultuous rivalry went at each other with renewed fervor.
Finally after 14 rounds, Frazier's trainer called time despite "Smoking" Joe protesting from his corner. The 25,000-strong crowd erupted following the announcement with Ali himself quoted as saying: "I didn't realize he was so great. He's a real, real fighter."

Diego Corrales vs. Jose Luis Castillo (May 7, 2005)  Perhaps few would have picked this boxing moment as a top bout in the lead up to the fight. But there is no doubt it has become something of a classic in the years since. Castillo started strong in his pursuit of the WBC lightweight title in Las Vegas on May 7, 2005.
Throughout the first nine rounds, the duo eagerly traded punches, during which time Corrales was knocked to the canvas twice. In an incredible feat of resurgence, the down-but-not-out yet thoroughly-bruised boxer landed a series of succinct shots that left Castillo hung out to dry on the ropes in the tenth round, after which the referee ended the fight.

Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns (Sept. 16, 1981)  Dubbed "The Showdown," the stakes were high going into the World Welterweight Championships in 1981. Sugar Ray Leonard  was the WBC champion while Thomas Hearns remained undefeated going into the fight and owner of the WBA crown.
The two landed punch after punch for 12 rounds by which point Leonard's trainer Angelo Dundee wailed to his fighter:  "You're blowing it, son!"
"Sugar" found renewed vigor in his legendary trainer's desperate calls erupting with a force Hearns could not have expected and threw him against the ropes. It was enough as Leonard continued to repeatedly pummel Hearns in the 14th before the referee ended the night's festivities at Caesars Palace.

Erik Morales vs Marco Antonio Barrera I (February 19, 2000)  Both light of foot, these two Mexican fighters went head-to-head on February, 19, 2000 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Morales started the bout strong landing a series of unrelenting punches on his countryman.
But things took a turn in the fifth when Barrera managed to summon some strength from within to offer up an incredible combination of punches leaving Morales shaken and wobbling against the ropes.
Later in the 12th, Barrera served up a beating and the first knockdown of Morales' career, who was forced to retreat to the ropes in an attempt to stay upright. The outcome was eventually determined by a 12th-round split decision in favor of Morales with the crowd criticizing the result.

Micky Ward vs Arturo Gatti I (May 18, 2002)  The first from the epic trilogy between Ward and Gatti took place on May 18, 2002.
The pair traded savage blows from the bell. The mutual beat down didn't abate for nine rounds, by which point Ward had a fair few cuts to his face. But he'd managed to knock Gatti, who was suffering from an increasingly swollen left eye, to the floor and won by majority decision in the 10th.

Jack Dempsey vs. Luis Angel Firpo (Sept. 14, 1923)  It was to be the first time an Argentine boxer would vie for the World Heavyweight title. Unfortunately it was not the night for Luis Angel Firpo, aka the "Wild Bull" of Pampa.
Dempsey's title defense before a crowd of 80,000 at New York's Polo Grounds was a short but perhaps not too dignified affair. Firpo was knocked to the canvas seven times... in the first round. Dempsey was announced winner in the second round by KO after dropping Firpo 11 times in total.  The bout lasted just three minutes and 57 seconds.

Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Meldrick Taylor (March 17, 1990)  A brutal battle billed as "Thunder vs. Lightning" -- this clash is arguably one of the most contentious bouts in boxing history with an dramatic ending like no other.
Chavez threw countless punches to no avail as Taylor's speed allowed him to delicately evade each attempt. But when he did connect, Taylor certainly felt it.
Exhausted by the fierce pace, Taylor was wiped out by the 12th, even falling as he tried to deliver a blow. Chavez seized his moment and unleashed with one minute of boxing prowess on his weakened challenger, who eventually succumbed, dropping to the floor.
Here's where it gets murky. Fight ref Richard Steel asked if Taylor could continue. Some argue Taylor nodded an affirmative response. But with no verbal answer, Steel declared Chavez winner by TKO with a staggering two seconds left on the clock.

Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns (April 15, 1985)  Hearns makes another appearance in this best bouts round up -- this time for his fight against Marvin "Marvelous" Hagler and what many consider the "best opening round ever."
Hagler, who had a history of slow starts, unleashed an aggressive slew of jabs and uppercuts from the off. "Hitman" Hearns returning with his own brutal blows. By the end of the first round, Hagler's face was covered in blood from a particularly unrelenting series of punches from Hearns. But he remained determined.
The pace continued in the second but the pair couldn't do this all night. After eight minutes, Hagler took down the "Hitman" for good with a third-round KO winning the WBC middleweight title, WBA world middleweight title and the IBF middleweight title.

Joe Louis vs. Billy Conn (June 18, 1941)  Billy Conn had given up his light heavyweight crown to take on Joe Louis on a summer's night in 1941 at the Polo Grounds. Conn also known as "The Pittsburgh Kid" started strong and began to outbox the heavy favorite and title defender, Joe Louis.
The pair continued to exchange punches with Conn up by two by the 12th. However things took a turn in the 13th when "The Pittsburgh Kid" got cocky. Thinking he could end things, he went for the KO but in the process exposed his defence. An exhausted Louis took advantage and fought back with a powerful right a minute into the round. The titleholder finished things a few moments later with a series of well-placed blows and Conn went down.

This is the mega-fight. Possibly the biggest fight of our lifetimes, a blue-moon opportunity to see two of the world's greatest fighters go toe to toe. It's Ali-Frazier for the modern era, with media coverage dwarfing even that most famous of fights.
It's rare that boxing, that most mercurial of sports, has the opportunity to unify the belts. The victor on Saturday in the much-anticipated bout between Filipino legend Manny Pacquiao and Floyd "Money" Mayweather will be the undisputed world champion, and stand to walk away with more than just a share of the reported $300 million purse.

(CNN)
No, wait. Actually, social media makes you depressed .
Have we mentioned that social media can drive you crazy? Well, maybe not, but it probably drives researchers crazy.
The thing is, social media isn't some separate entity apart from human beings. Social media IS human beings, and therefore, social media is what you make of it. It's something to keep in mind, because even though the modern forms are new and shiny -- Facebook was founded in 2004, Twitter in 2006 -- the concept is as old as human relationships.
For example, if you view Facebook through a half-empty glass, it may feel like an endless land of one-upmanship where everybody is doing better than you. On the other hand, if you look at it as a tool for building supportive relationships, it's a great place to find sympathy, encouragement and connection.
And it is a tool, says Margaret Duffy, a communications professor at the University of Missouri who oversaw a study of college students and Facebook engagement . (Facebook was chosen because "about 100% of college students" are on the platform, Duffy says with a chuckle.)
10 ways to get happy
"Just being a heavy user of social media, like Facebook, doesn't mean you're likely more vulnerable to depression," she says.
Social media can have effects on mental health. Studies have shown that getting "likes" for Facebook posts actually results in a release of dopamine , a brain chemical associated with pleasure. Moreover, sad or moving posts can promote release of oxytocin, the "love hormone," which makes us feel protected.
Even the way we use it makes a difference.
In Duffy's study, "surveillance use" of Facebook -- that is, lurking and deliberately seeking out posts that may feed insecurity -- "was a significant indicator of the potential for depression," says Duffy of her study.
So how can social media make you happy? Here are some recommendations:
1. Don't let the Internet get you down.
Easier said than done, we know. Social media is everywhere, almost everyone is on it, and if you want to make yourself unhappy, simply imagine that the rest of the Internet is having a better time in your absence.
"Social media is almost like a game," writes Adrienne Erin on Socialnomics . "We are all at war with one another for likes and favorites and we compete by posting pictures of our expensive dinners, vacations and social interactions."
But if you're going to be on social media, there are ways to improve your mood.
Happiness, one study says , can be viral.
And when you just need to hit a reset button, try Make Everything OK .
2. Data is your friend.
Our virtual lives often seem separate from our actual lives, but every little bit of ourselves we put out there actually provides indicators on how we're feeling, both physically and mentally.
Adam Sadilek, a computer scientist at the University of Rochester, has helped create a model that can show the spread of disease by scanning Twitter data.
"Our model then predicts if and when an individual will fall ill with high accuracy, thereby improving our understanding of the emergence of global epidemics from people's day-to-day interactions," he writes .
Doesn't sound cheerful? How about this: Scientists also used Twitter to determine when we were happy . (Moods are lowest first thing in the morning.)
The upshot is that the huge amount of data we're creating on social networks can help us become healthier -- or allow others to intercede if we're not.
3. Put the phone down. And especially put your children's phones down.
For all the connection social media can provide, it can't replace simple face-to-face contact -- even these days, when video messaging is as convenient as, well, clicking a phone.
(And we know how anxious you get when you're away from your phone.)
But it can really take a toll on youngsters. In a study from Stanford on girls age 8-12, "those who say they spend considerable amounts of time using multimedia describe themselves in ways that suggest they are less happy and less socially comfortable than peers who say they spend less time on screens," The New York Times observed .
The study is by no means conclusive, but it does offer food for thought, Lyn Mikel Brown, an education professor, told the newspaper.
"The clear message is also how important it is for parents to create opportunities for girls to unplug, to live a balanced life, and increase quality face-to-face time with the people important to them," said Mikel Brown.
It all sounds like common sense -- but then, so does most advice on social well-being. Which is why some of the shrewdest words on the subject have nothing to do with social media at all.
"Don't waste your time on jealousy," wrote Mary Schmich in a famous Chicago Tribune column that became the song "Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)." "Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself."
And when you're in doubt, there are always dog videos , cat videos and dancing videos .

        <title>Police: Jimmy Savile abused 22 students at school</title>

        <MainBody>Story highlights
Jimmy Savile abused at least 22 pupils at a former girls' school, a Surrey police report says
Since Savile died in 2011, he has been exposed as a serial sex abuser and pedophile
The abuse at Duncroft school occurred during visits by the TV star in the 1970s, police say
London (CNN)
At least 22 pupils and a visitor at a former school for troubled girls in southeast England were sexually abused by the late British TV star Jimmy Savile in the 1970s, a report by Surrey police has concluded.
The report said that at least 46 offenses of abuse occurred, including one rape, at the Duncroft Approved School in Staines, a town to the west of London.
An initial police investigation into Savile's behavior at Duncroft, a school for socially vulnerable girls, began in 2007 and ended with Savile being interviewed under caution in 2009, when he denied the allegations of 14 pupils.
A second investigation, dubbed Operation Outreach, was launched in 2012 after a documentary by UK broadcaster ITV revealed that Savile -- once one of the most beloved people in Britain, a radio DJ and television star with big hair, a big cigar and an even bigger attitude -- was a serial sex abuser.
Since then Savile, who died in 2011 , has become one of the most reviled figures in the country as it becomes clear that he sexually abused untold numbers of people over decades.
The latest revelations about his abuses at Duncroft school come on the heels of other reports detailing assaults by Savile on children, hospital patients or those with mental health problems .
Operation Outreach found that Savile visited Duncroft at least 16 times between 1974 and 1979, and that he stayed overnight at the school on at least two occasions.
He was likely to have taken the pupils out unaccompanied by staff on several occasions and was given "significant" access to the school's grounds and buildings, which appears to have been unrestricted and largely unsupervised, the report said.
Pupils were abused in multiple locations throughout the school, including the principal's office, and in vehicles brought to the school by Savile, police found.
Of the 23 victims, "ten were abused on a single occasion by Savile," the report says, and "thirteen were abused on at least two occasions."
The four types of abuse listed in the report are rape, assault by penetration, causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and sexual assault.
The school was closed from late 1979 until 1982, and shut its doors for good in 1991.
As well as seeking to establish the scope of Savile's offenses at the school, Operation Outreach also looked at what was known by former members of staff there -- and whether any had committed offenses as a result.
Surrey police submitted a file last year to the Crown Prosecution Service on two of those former staff members, but the agency decided not to bring criminal charges on the grounds there was no realistic prospect of conviction.
In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Cundy said Surrey police "has always accepted there are things which should have been done differently" in the force's original 2007-2009 investigation.
But he added those inquiries "predated much of what we now know about Savile and his pattern of abuse."

Washington (CNN)
The House voted, as expected, to block a D.C. law banning discrimination by employers against employees who have had abortions. on Thursday night but the measure is unlikely to have any effect before the law takes effect this weekend.
All but 13 Republicans voted for the resolution of disapproval, which passed on a largely party-line, 228-192 vote, while just three Democrats voted in favor of it. The measure got a high-level Democratic opponent on Thursday with Hillary Clinton's campaign weighing in, calling it a move to "overrule the Democratic process" in a statement to CNN.
The bill would roll back a D.C. law approved in December that bars city employers from taking punitive action against employees for using abortion services or birth control. Under the Constitution, Congress can nullify laws passed by the Washington city council, but it's required to weigh in within 30 days after the measure has been sent to Capitol Hill.
RELATED: House Republicans secure vote in bid to block D.C. abortion law
That deadline comes Friday, and both the House and the Senate must pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent the law from going into effect this weekend.
The effort was launched by Republican presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz weeks ago, but prior to this week its future was uncertain as House leadership had been reluctant to line up a full vote.
Under pressure from members in the conservative Republican Study Committee, however, House leadership scheduled a Thursday night vote on the law. Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the RSC, praised the move and described the bill as a religious freedom issue in a statement.
"We first flagged this issue when the D.C. Council passed the law and have been resolute in our belief that Congress has the right and the responsibility to act in defense of our constitutional freedom of belief," he said. "This is not about one city, but rather about preserving the First Amendment right to religious liberty for all Americans."
Despite its easy passage in the House, however, there's no indication the Senate will take it up, and the White House issued a veto threat against the GOP measure on Thursday.
Democrats have decried the move as flagrant congressional overreach into the lives of Washingtonians, and D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes-Norton slammed it as "wildly undemocratic" in a floor statement on the vote.
"This resolution is wildly undemocratic, it is a naked violation of the nation's founding principle of local control of local affairs, and is profoundly offensive to D.C. residents. This resolution uniquely targets my district, but every member will get to vote on it except for me, the District's elected representative," Norton said.
RELATED: Hillary Clinton's gender tightrope
Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri struck a similar tone in her statement to CNN, calling it an effort to "overrule the Democratic process" in D.C. and promising Clinton would do better by women.
"Hillary Clinton has fought for women and families and their right to access the full range of reproductive health care without interference from politicians or employers," Palmieri said. "Hillary will fight to make it easier, not more difficult, for women and families to get ahead and ensure that women are not discriminated against for personal medical decisions."
Team Clinton's move to weigh in on the measure is a clear signal that the former secretary of state won't shy away from the perennial controversy surrounding abortion rights as she makes her second presidential bid.
While Republicans continue to push restrictions on abortion rights, Democrats see the issue as a political winner as they believe it appeals to a key portion of their base -- single female voters. And this time around, Clinton has embraced her gender, focusing heavily on women's rights and the prospect of becoming the nation's first female president.

Could you govern the UK?

Build Your Own British Government
British voters go to the polls May 7, but it doesn't look like any party will get a majority, so the men who want to be prime minister will have to wheel and deal to get a coalition together.
Can you build a coalition government to run the country?

Story highlights
Labour and the Conservatives look like they're fighting to a draw
Whoever comes top on May 7 will need to work with other parties to become prime minister
Think you can do it? Give it a try!
London (CNN)
Traditionally, the British liked their politics simple: There were two big parties, either one won most of the seats in the House of Commons at election time, and the party leader became prime minister.
That's how it worked for Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.
It doesn't work like that any more.
The center-right Conservatives and center-left Labour party are still much bigger than any other party, but in 2010 neither one got enough seats in the Commons to govern on its own, and David Cameron had to make a deal with the Liberal Democrats to get his Conservative party into power.
It looks like election results are going to be even more fragmented in elections on May 7, with Labour and the Conservatives apparently heading toward a stalemate, Liberal Democrat support collapsing, and the Scottish National Party on the rise.
Normally, the leader of the biggest party gets the first crack at building a coalition, but whether that's Cameron or Labour leader Ed Miliband, they will have their work cut out for them.
Think you can do it? Give it a try yourself. If you succeed, we'll show you all the policies your coalition government is committed to -- whether they agree with each other or not.
Good luck!

Ethiopian food may still be a niche cuisine across the globe, but that might not be the case for long. From Washington, D.C. to London, Ethiopian restaurants are earning awards and accolades. Inside the country, the traditionally hearty cuisine is also being given a gourmet twist.
Scroll through the gallery below for an overview of some of the best Ethiopian fare, from traditional wots to fusion flare.

Gourmet Ethiopia  Antica Restaurants &amp; Farm in Addis Ababa is one institution that has started experimenting with Ethiopian ingredients. Chef Yohannes Hailemariam has created several fusion dishes, including a lasagne made from teff.

Teff  Much of Ethiopian cuisine centers around teff, a popular grain. Ethiopian farmers winnow the crop to separate the seeds from the stalks. The seeds are then taken to the local mill. Because it is gluten-free, teff is growing in popularity abroad.

Injera  Teff is used to make injera, a tangy, spongy flat bread that is served with many dishes in Ethiopia, such as the variety of vegetarian and meat-based wots, or stews. The teff is fermented to give the bread its signature sour flavor.

Ethiopian pizza  Hailemariam has also created an Ethiopian version of pizza, which also uses teff. Because teff is gluten-free, the dough doesn't have the same elasticity of traditional pizza dough. To combat this, he adds a touch of wheat flour and extra egg. He uses African ingredients and cooks the pizza in a clay oven.

Berbere  Many of Ethiopia's rich stews are seasoned with berbere, a heady spice mix that blends garlic, red pepper, coriander, cloves and a variety of other ingredients. Tibs, a beef or lamb stew, is made from a paste using berbere, onion and clarified butter.

Coffee  Ethiopia is widely considered the birthplace of coffee, and as such, it's no surprise that the beverage plays heavily in Ethiopia's culture, tradition and economy. Guests are often treated to a coffee ceremony, and coffee accounts for about 25% of Ethiopia's export earnings.

"There are a lot of people out there who are looking for someone like Elizabeth Warren and are really interested in those issues," Devine said. "I think when Bernie starts talking about those issues in his own way, it is going to be a lot easier for someone like him to get their support, than someone like Clinton, O'Malley, Webb or Link Chaffee."
Devine added: "I view those people as tremendous targets of opportunities for a candidate like Bernie Sanders."
Although liberal organizations aren't backing Sanders, he does have a small but devout following in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, critical states in the presidential nomination process. Sanders regularly draws well at small house parties and town halls across both states, bringing out people who see him as their Clinton alternative.
RELATED: Bernie Sanders jabs Hillary Clinton on trade
A majority of Democratic voters, though, don't feel this way. In a March CNN/ORC poll, Sanders garnered 3% of the vote compared to Warren's 10%. When you remove Warren from the poll, Sanders jumps by 2 points to 5%, but Clinton jumps by 5 points to 67%.
"I like his views, I like him a lot," said Timothy Horrigan, a liberal New Hampshire representative, before listing all the ways Bernie isn't Elizabeth.
"She is more plausible as a president," Horrigan said. "They have similar messages but they have different styles, and her style appeals to a lot of people. She is sort of like Hillary without all the baggage and just a stronger progressive message."
Many in the progressive movement are uncomfortable with questions about why they are supporting Warren over Sanders.

"We don't have more to say beyond the statement I sent earlier," a spokesman for Move On said after CNN asked a number of questions on the issue.
There is some hope in the liberal movement that the focus on Warren and the issues she represents will help Sanders, too.
Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Wednesday that Warren "has been a galvanizing force for economic populism" and is someone who is "symbolic of the rising economic populist tide in America."
RELATED: Bernie Sanders might not have to pick a side
"Those are just the facts," the liberal organizer added.
By implication, though, Sanders is not that. Though Green said the independent senator is "very much in line with the goal that many progressives have," he acknowledged that Sanders' 2016 campaign would need to ride the "economic populist tide" that Warren symbolizes for many liberals.
"The rising economic populist tide can be ridden by many people," he said. "And I think that any politician who is smart will try to ride that tide."

        <MainBody>U.S. based Majid Rafizadeh says his mother in Damascus called him asking for medical help
She described symptoms reminiscent of those suffered by his aunt before she died, he says
Rafizadeh says Syria's war impacts sufferers of non-communicable and chronic disease
Majid Rafizadeh is a political scientist and scholar, focusing on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy. Rafizadeh is the president of the International American Council and is on the boards of the Harvard International Review and Harvard International Relations Council. He is originally from Iran and Syria.  Follow him @majidrafizadeh . The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author's.
(CNN)
"Can you please ask a doctor in America why my left eye has drooped and my lower lip has sagged? People tell me that there are good doctors in America."
My 62-year-old mother was asking me for help. She is living in a small apartment in the old district of Damascus. Her voice was garbled over the phone. It was the first time I could hardly understand her slurred words due to the dysarthric speech.
The tremble in her voice worried me, because her sister, Anisah, didn't survive last year. There was no access to a practitioner or hospital for her. My aunt had shared similar symptoms which -- combined with her heart disease and type 1 diabetes -- led to her fatal stroke.
Majid Rafizadeh
I ached to reach through the phone and embrace my mother, to promise her that I would provide her the care that she had once provided for me.
Syria is facing a health crisis, but not the kind you might see on the front page.
While most media focus on the prevention of communicable diseases such as polio , very little attention is paid to the non-communicable diseases that are ravaging the health of internally displaced people. Many displaced Syrians are facing debilitating disease such as heart conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other chronic health conditions.
The hospital in my mother's neighborhood of Damascus has been shut down. Many doctors and practitioners have fled the country to escape from the perpetual violence . The remaining hospitals in other neighborhoods are either controlled by the rebel groups or ISIS.
Knowing that there is treatment for my mother not far away is even more painful. It may not be a great geographic distance for her to cross, but it is the largest risk that she could take. As for many Syrians, my mother's religious sect  means she would be placing her life and freedom on the line if she were to enter rebel-controlled areas.
While so many suffer with untreated illnesses the mainstream media's main focus appears to be on communicable disease and the vaccination rate since the outbreak of the civil war.
How can a modern nation surrounded by other modern nations have an entire health care system ripped from the grasp of its ailing citizens?
Majid Rafizadeh
The WHO estimates that of almost two million children born since the war there is only a 50% vaccination rate. Some previously eradicated contagious diseases have returned . While this may be valid information there are other statistics that are not being reported.
According to the International Diabetes Federation , in 2014 there were 875,700 adults with diabetes in Syria. It says there were also 8,013 deaths due to the condition.
In 2012, the WHO ranked heart disease and stroke Syria's second and third leading causes of death in Syria -- behind, inevitably, conflict.
These conditions are serious and can be fatal -- especially without treatment. However, with medication and regular medical attention many sufferers can recover or live many years.
But in Syria,accessing the necessary medication or treatment is nearly impossible. According to Physicians for Human Right s, by June 2014 Almost 500 doctors or medical staff had been jailed or killed and an estimated 15,000 doctors and medical professionals had fled for their own safety.

FDA approves new drug to dissolve chin fat

The Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug that can eliminate neck fat without surgery.
Story highlights
The Food and Drug Administration approves Kybella, which causes the cell membranes of fat under your chin to go away permanently

This news may mean the end for the ultimate selfie killer, the double chin. The Food and Drug Administration will now let you say bye-bye to nasty neck fat and hello to a jawline that doesn't jiggle. The agency approved the first drug that can eliminate neck fat in most people without surgery.
The drug, known by its commercial name of Kybella, is a deoxycholic acid made by Californa's Kythera Biopharmaceuticals . This is the same acid your body produces to help it absorb fat. It takes only a few minutes for a licensed dermatologist to inject it under the jawline right into your fat tissue.

The drug immediately goes to work on your wattle, destroying the cell membrane of what doctors call "submental fat," causing it to burst and go away permanently. That's great news for patients seeking improvement in an area many people consider a real problem. About 68% of people surveyed by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery in 2014 named excess fat under the chin and neck one of their top concerns. Many people say they think a double chin makes them look older than they actually are.

Maybe that will make the pain of getting up to 50 injections in a single treatment go down a little bit easier. The good news is it takes only a few days to heal, and there are no bandages necessary to make you look like a Dickensian Jacob Marley's ghost. But it may take several sessions to eliminate all your problem areas.
The FDA approved the drug after the manufacturer submitted 19 clinical studies involving nearly 2,600 patients. The tests showed the drug worked to eliminate moderate to severe chin fat. Currently, the only other way to delete your double chin is to have surgery , having the fat removed with traditional liposuction. In the past, a drug called Lipodissolve, also known on the streets of Beverly Hills as "lunchtime lipo," prompted an FDA warning letter in 2010 that suggested that treatment could cause permanent scarring and skin deformities.
Side effects for a small number of patients in the Kybella drug trials included nerve injury in the jaw that lead to a lopsided smile or facial weakness. It also may cause bruising, swelling, redness and some pain in some patients. Insurance does not cover this treatment.
Cosmetic infidelity: A new way to cheat
While this drug may be a success for your neck, don't expect to see it dissolving fat in other problem places, the FDA warns.
"It is important to remember that Kybella is only approved for the treatment of fat occurring below the chin, and it is not known if Kybella is safe or effective for treatment outside of this area," Dr. Amy G. Egan, deputy director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.
The drug should be commercially available in June, the company said. Just in time for summer vacation selfie season.

How paradise became the fattest place in the world

They're remote and beautiful. A place many long to escape to for sun, sea and serenity. But the Pacific islands have another reality for the residents living there -- a life based on imported food, little exercise and remote access to healthcare.
The result? The most obese nations in the world.
'A deadly epidemic'
"One third of the world is either overweight or obese right now," says Emmanuela Gakidou, professor of Global Health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Gakidou's recent paper used data from countries across the world to identify the global burden of obesity and trends seen in different populations. "The Pacific islands have a lot of countries with very high levels of obesity," she adds.
Among the top 10 most obese countries or territories globally, nine are Pacific islands, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), making this paradise the fattest region of the world.
"Up to 95% of the adult population are overweight or obese in some countries," says Temo Waqanivalu, program officer with the WHO's Prevention of Non-communicable Diseases department. As a Fijian Native, Waqanivalu has worked on the issue for over a decade and seen the epidemic evolve first-hand, aided by the cultural acceptance of bigger bodies as beautiful. "In Polynesia the perception of 'big is beautiful' does exist," he says. "[But] big is beautiful, fat is not. That needs to get through."
Percentages for obesity range from 35% to 50% throughout the islands, according to the WHO. The Cook Islands top the ranks with just over 50% of its population classified as obese.
"It's a deadly epidemic," says Waqanivalu.
Measuring up
Obesity is measured through an individual's body mass index (BMI) and a measurement above 30kg/m is defined as clinically obese.
Pacific islanders tend to have a naturally big build, says Jonathan Shaw, associate director of Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Australia. "With Pacific islanders, their frame is typically bigger," he explains, "but that still doesn't account for the obesity we see."
Poor diets and reduced exercise have become a major public health concern for the region as they are not only a cause of obesity -- associated diseases are also rife, such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes, the latter of which has a known genetic basis among locals.
"This is a population with a genetic predisposition and when exposed to Western lifestyles results in high rates of diabetes," says Shaw. "[This is] undoubtedly caused by high rates of obesity."
The epidemic began through the tropical region turning its back on traditional diets of fresh fish and vegetables and replacing them with highly processed and energy-dense food such as white rice, flour, canned foods, processed meats and soft drinks imported from other countries. One of the root causes of the change is the price tag.
"All over the world, poor quality and highly energy-dense food is the cheapest," says Shaw. As demand for healthier alternatives remain low, their market is small.
This is exemplified by fishermen often selling the fish they catch to in turn purchase canned tuna. "[You] can buy a few meals with what you get selling fish," says Waqanivalu.
The new food environment locals find themselves living in has accelerated the trend towards consuming processed food. "It's significantly cheaper," adds Waqanivalu. "It's cheaper to buy a bottle of coke than a bottle of water."
As with other regions of the world, increased urbanization and sedentary office cultures have further aided the rise in obesity among Pacific islanders.
"A lot of physical activity was in the domain of work," says Waqanivalu, referring to fisherman heading out to sea and others working their land on plantations. "The concept of leisure-time activity is new," he says.
The tropical climate desired by sun seekers is less attractive to those needing to keep fit.  "In tropical countries there is a desire to avoid physical work and even walk," says Shaw. "We're all driven to conserve energy."
All in the genes?
Some scientists believe that Pacific island populations have evolved to maintain their larger build -- a concept known as the "Thrifty Gene" hypothesis. For this region of the world, the concept is based on the fact Pacific islanders once endured long journeys at sea and those who fared best stored enough energy in the form of fat to survive their journey.
"We have the remnants of those people ... and their metabolism as well," says Waqanivalu. The increased risk of obesity among native Pacific islanders is shown on the islands of Fiji, where the population has a more mixed ethnicity. The country stands at the lower end of the region's spectrum with 36.4% of the adult population classed as obese. Just more than half of the Fijian population are native iTaukei, with the remainder mostly of Indian origin, according to the CIA World Factbook. "That explains the lower rates," says Waqanivalu.
The naturally higher BMI of the people in the region has, however, prompted calls to increase the cut-off for the level of BMI denoting obesity in the Pacific region from 30 to 32 kg/m. A lower cut-off has been suggested for Asian populations based on the same premise, as Asian countries -- including Korea, Myanmar and Cambodia -- make up the majority of the lowest 10 countries globally in terms of obesity..
Childhood consequences
After the global trends in obesity seen in her study, Gakidou's real concern is the rates her team saw in children in the Pacific. "The rate for children is high ... about one in five children [are obese]," she says.  "This has repercussions in the long term."
Repercussions include diabetes, which is already a burden on health services in the region. "The concern in children would be early onset of diabetes," says Gakidou.
The WHO has made a series of recommendations to improve the situation and is implementing them through policy changes in the countries. "Type II diabetes is emerging in young children 10-11 years old," says Waqanivalu, who has also heard reports of a child as young as seven years old being affected. "[It's the] tip of the iceberg in children."
But Waqanilu is confident his department is making some progress through recommendations such as increased taxation on soft drinks, improving trade in the region, controlled marketing of products targeting children through schools, and policies to promote healthier diets and exercise.
"The whole food environment needs to be changed," he says. This has been the ambition of the Healthy Islands Vision -- initiated by the ministers of health for the Pacific island countries in 1995 -- which aims to combat obesity and diabetes among its health priorities.
Health systems also need strengthening to better handle the consequences of obesity. "We have definitely made steps but need to make strides for this to be sorted in our time," says Waqanivalu.

When people think Ecuador they think the Galapagos and while those enchanted islands are incredible there's a lot more to this Andean country.
Adventure seekers will love the active volcanoes, Romeos will make the most of the cheap red roses and fine chocolate and anyone with a sense of the fun won't want to miss the chance to stand astride the hemispheres with one foot planted on either side of the equator.
1. The official "Middle of the World" monument is in the wrong place
Ecuador is named after the equator that runs through the country.
One of the must-do tourist attractions is to stand astride the line that marks the middle of the world -- just make sure you pick the right spot.
The "Mitad del Mundo" monument was built in 1979.
It's an impressive 100-foot statue about 15 miles outside Quito and has a bold yellow line supposedly marking the line of zero degrees latitude.
The only problem is that it's actually 240 meters off. We know this thanks to accurate GPS readings that many of us carry around in out pockets.
A new tourist site has been created, this one with a red line that marks the planet in two and a sign that proudly declares: "Latitude: 00 00' 00" calculated with G.P.S.
2. Coca leaves are a great cure for altitude sickness
Quito is at 2,800 meters above sea level and it's not uncommon to feel short of breath or have a mild headache when you first arrive.
Symptoms of altitude sickness can be worse if you head higher into the Andean mountains without acclimatizing.
Drinking plenty of water and avoiding alcohol and caffeine would ease the symptoms.
And Diamox works well, but takes two days to kick in.
Coca leaves -- sold in small neighborhood stalls -- are a useful quick fix, as is coca tea.
Just remember to ditch any coca leaves before you fly home -- it's illegal to bring them into the United States and many other countries.
3. Roasted guinea pigs are a delicacy
Known in the local Kichwa language as cuy, the furry little creatures are flattened and roasted whole over an open fire.
You won't find them on every restaurant menu in Quito.
This is a premium priced specialty dish served in only a handful of the capital's eateries and in the countryside.
A whole roasted guinea pig costs about $20-$25. It has a gamey flavor not unlike rabbit and is usually served with potatoes and corn.
Cuy are so highly prized that a mating pair is considered a valuable wedding present in the countryside.
4. Ecuador is the world's largest exporter of fine cacao beans
Much like wine, chocolate reflects the terroir or flavors of the region where it's grown.
Ecuador's diversity of terrain, rich volcanic soil and location on the equator make for fine growing conditions.
Plant the same Arriba bean in Ecuador and Africa and the Ecuadorian cacao will have a more complex, refined taste.
As the demand for more flavorful chocolate has risen, so Ecuador has become a hot destination for chocolatiers and tour operators are getting in on the act.
Metropolitan Touring recently teamed up with Pacari chocolate to launch a two-day tour into the Amazon to visit a cacao farm, see the harvesting process and even get involved in grinding the beans and making artisanal chocolate over an open fire. (+593 2 298 8312)
5. Roses are cheap
It costs $2.50 for 25 long-stemmed red roses.
Direct from the greenhouses, 25 can be grabbed for as little as $2 -- making it cheap for anyone to be a Valentino.
The rose industry only started about 20 years ago, but within a decade it was third only to oil and bananas.
With ideal rose-growing conditions, Ecuador is also ahead of the game in terms of producing new varieties.
6. Ecuador has one of the highest densities of volcanoes in the world
Ecuador sits on the so-called "Ring of Fire" on the edge of a very active tectonic plate.
Just south of Quito two parallel chain of Andes that cross Ecuador from north to south rise in dramatic peaks.
This stretch of summits is known as "The Avenue of the Volcanoes" and it's worth getting a window seat as you take off from the capital to witness the spectacle of the snow-capped volcanoes.
Tungurahua just south of Quito has been one of the most active volcanoes on the planet for the last few years.
In Kichwa its name translates as "Throat of Fire" and it has been erupting since 1999, most recently last April when it let rip a spectacular plume of ash several kilometers high.
7. Ecuadorians pay to have their children beaten with nettles
Not some form of child abuse but a traditional healing practice said to purify the soul.
A kind of detox, it's available for adults as well as kids.
The folk remedy involves stripping down to underwear and being whacked with nasty stinging nettles to chase out negative energy.
Next the healer deploys a good thrashing with a bundle of herbs, including laurel and mint, to help soothe the sting.
Finally, there's a rub down with rose petals.
Casa Gangotena (Bolivar Oe6-41 y Cuenca, Quito; +593 2400 8000), which prides itself on offering authentic local experiences, can arrange the half-hour ordeal for $40.
8. The sharks are friendly
Seriously.
Sharks in the Galapagos are so well fed that there's no need for a cage to swim alongside them -- and that's a real buzz.
This includes all sharks, not just the native Galapagos reef shark which can reach three meters in length, but also whitetip reef sharks common throughout the archipelago.
Even the more formidable hammerhead sharks are safe.
They're not interested in a human lunch because there are such rich pickings to be had in the crystal clear waters.
While Galapagos sharks eat mainly fish, the more powerful ones have been known to eat other sharks, sea lions, turtles and iguanas.
9. Those headhunting stories are true
Tribes in the Amazon once cut off their enemies' heads in the battlefield and "shrank" them.
A tribe called Shuar who live in the region of the Amazon basin that straddles Ecuador and Peru continued the practice until the 1950s.
Shrinking heads was a complicated procedure associated with deep spiritual beliefs and traditions.
Only those with a strong stomach need read on.
The first step involved peeling the skin away from the skull, using a knife to work the flesh away from the bone.
The skull was then discarded and the head boiled for 30 minutes -- which shrank it to about one-third its size.
Anyone with a macabre interest in mini-heads can see some at the Intinan Museum (Manuel Cordova Galarza, Quito; +593 2-239-5122).
10. The Panama hat is actually from Ecuador
So why is a traditional toquilla straw hat from Ecuador called a Panama?
The straw came from Manabi on the west coast of Ecuador, which is where Eloy Alfaro was born.
He went on to become the Ecuadorian president from 1842 to 1912 and made his fortune making toquilla hats.
He exported them to Panama where the lightweight hats were ideal in the tropical sun and were snapped up by workers and U.S. engineers building the Panama Canal.
When U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was photographed wearing one during a visit to the canal the shot went viral -- in a 1904 sort of way -- and demand for a "Panama hat" surged.
The hats are still a classic summer staple, but sadly for Ecuadorian producers the name has stuck and even in Quito they are advertised as Panama hat.
11. Voting is compulsory
Ecuador introduced compulsory voting for all citizens aged 18 to 65 years old in 1936. Only the illiterate are excused.
Voters are given a certificate to show they've fulfilled their civil duty -- without it they can't get married or buy property unless you have a very good excuse or pay a hefty $50 fine.

IRAN NUKE DEAL
Monkey wrench: The GOP (and some Democrats) want Congress to have a say in the debate over a possible nuclear deal with Iran. But the actions yesterday of two Republican senators could torpedo a bill that would do just that. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio want votes on their amendments to, in their view, toughen up the legislation. If the amendments became a part of the bill, it would lead to an almost-certain presidential veto. If that happened, Congress could be cut out of any role in approving the still emerging agreement with Iran. Cotton's amendment deals with Iranian nuclear facilities; Rubio's wants Iran to recognize Israel's right to exist. GOP leaders are now mulling what to do next, so action on the bill may not take place until later next week.
Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton says he wants a vote on his amendment.
U.S. NAVY
Naval escort: U.S. commercial ships will now get a military escort through the Strait of Hormuz. The Pentagon announced this yesterday, in response to recent harassment of U.S. commercial vessels by ships from Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Not every commercial ship will necessarily be accompanied by the Navy, but this is a big change from past U.S. military posture in the Strait. The Pentagon hopes to reduce the risk of confrontation, since any Iranian seizure of a U.S.-flagged vessel could provoke an international incident.

        <title>Nepal quake victim stops breathing on flight</title>

        <MainBody>CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta was aboard an aid flight when a woman's pulse stopped
Sabina Lama was injured when a ceiling fell on her during the Nepal earthquake
Gupta gave her a 'cardiac thump' when she couldn't be roused
Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)
"Please take her," people cried over the roar of the helicopter propellers as the flight was about to take off from one of the Nepali districts worst-hit by the earthquake.
The Indian helicopter had just dropped aid to people forced to fend for themselves for days after the quake, in Sindhupalchok, east of the capital Kathmandu.
CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and a crew were aboard the flight, packed with instant noodles and tarps being delivered to people who no longer had -- or trusted -- a roof over their heads.
The pilots hadn't expected to take on any passengers, but as they were about to take off, a woman lying on a makeshift straw stretcher was thrust toward the door.
Her name is Sabina Lama.
Soldiers carry Sabina on a makeshift straw stretcher in Kathmandu, April 30, 2015.
Emergency on board
Sabina, 18, was a new mother,  and as Gupta examined her it soon became clear she had no feeling or movement in her legs.
She'd been badly injured during the quake.
But no one expected what happened next.
Minutes into the flight, Sabina stopped breathing.
"We could no longer detect a pulse -- either in her wrist or in her neck. I checked her pupils, and tried desperately to rouse her, as we blasted over the countryside," Gupta recounted.
There was no defibrillator on the helicopter that could be used to give a jolt to kick-start her heart, no fluids, no first aid kit, no medical equipment to deal with an emergency such as this.
Sabina would die without proper medical care.
With few options left, Gupta delivered a sharp blow to her chest.
"It is aggressive -- but I just delivered a 'cardiac thump,' a quick, strong hit to the chest in a last ditch effort to shock Sabina's heart back into action."
It wasn't clear if it was the blow that did it, but either way, Sabina came back.
Dr. Sanjay Gupta checks Sabina's pulse on board a helicopter flight from her quake-hit village, April 30, 2015.
Flight to safety
Sabina's pulse returned as the helicopter raced to a makeshift hospital high in the mountains where the crew picked up an IV drip to give her fluids.
It was tied to the ceiling of the helicopter using a disposable face mask.
More patients piled in as the helicopter headed to Kathmandu Airport, where ambulances were waiting with stretchers, medicine and other life-saving supplies.
Amid the chaos, parts of Sabina's story emerged.
On Saturday, she had been taking her six-week-old son to the health center in her village to get his scheduled vaccinations when the earthquake hit.
As the earth shook, part of the ceiling collapsed, miraculously missing her baby, but delivering such a violent blow that she lost use of her legs.
Her husband is now caring for the little boy as his mother receives the help she needs.
She's just one of more than 13,000 people injured in an earthquake that has killed more than 6,000 people, and devastated a nation.

        <MainBody>U.N. report alleges child abuse by French soldiers 02:43
Story highlights
French soldiers are accused of sexual abuse of children in the Central African Republic
French President Francois Hollande says he "will be merciless" if the claims are proved
A U.N. staffer has been suspended over the leak of an internal U.N. report on the allegations
Paris (CNN)
Hungry, homeless young boys in the Central African Republic were forced by French soldiers to perform sex acts on them in return for food or money, the director of an advocacy group said Thursday, citing a confidential United Nations report on alleged abuses.
Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free World, told CNN the report detailed testimonies from six children interviewed last year by staff from the U.N. children's agency UNICEF and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The children give harrowing accounts of their own experiences and abuses they had witnessed, and they recounted the experiences of friends of theirs, she said. "There are a few cases where a boy describes the sodomizing of a friend by soldiers who are threatening to beat him if he tells anyone about what they are doing," Donovan said.
The allegations concern French soldiers deployed to the Central African Republic as peacekeepers.
The abuses were allegedly committed against a dozen children at a displaced persons' camp at M'Poko International Airport in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, between December 2013 and June 2014.
The shocking allegations have prompted French President Francois Hollande to promise strong action if they are confirmed.
"If some soldiers behaved badly, I will be merciless," he said in comments broadcast by CNN's French affiliate BFMTV.
"If this information is confirmed, there will be exemplary sanctions."
Donovan said one boy recounted how a soldier who he'd asked for food had asked him to perform oral sex in exchange. When the boy refused, the soldier asked him to find a woman who would, she said.
Another boy told how a soldier took him inside an army base, overriding the objections of a guard, and sexually abused him there.
Donovan said the soldiers gave them small amounts of food, water and sometimes some cash in return for sex, adding, "The children were severely traumatized by the events."
The report was sent to her in recent days at AIDS-Free World, Donovan said, but she was not at liberty to say by whom. The advocacy group shared it with the UK's Guardian newspaper, which reported on the allegations late Wednesday, saying the report had "confidential" stamped on every page.
The document already had been leaked to French authorities last year.
A U.N. staffer has been suspended over the leak, a statement from the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday.
The unnamed staffer is accused of providing an unedited version of the internal U.N. report to French authorities before it even reached senior management in the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Rape and sodomy claims
According to the statement from Ban's spokesman, the alleged offenses occurred before a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic, known as MINUSCA, was set up.
The interviews for the U.N. human rights investigation were conducted between May 5 and June 24 of last year, Donovan said.
The French troops were there under the authority of the French government, she said. But U.N staff still should act to protect children if they uncover evidence of sexual abuse and exploitation, she insisted.
"Certainly, the children should expect that the United Nations will not only protect them, but also provide the services which are so desperately needed by children who have been forced to have oral sex by a man with a gun in return for food," she said.
A French Defense Ministry spokesman told a news conference in Paris on Thursday that the army had not gone public about the case previously because a judicial inquiry was ongoing.
"Obviously, if these facts were proven, as you know, they are totally against our values, the values held by the French army," said Col. Gilles Jaron, adviser to the Army's Joint Chief of Staff. "Of course if these facts were proven, firm sanctions would be implemented against those responsible."
Pierre Bayle, a spokesman for French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the minister had "decided there would be zero tolerance on all that is sexual violence."
Bayle added, "We're not trying to hide the facts, we are verifying the reality of the facts. We cannot say anything for now."
'Intolerable offense'
The French Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that it had received the testimonies of Central African Republic children accusing French soldiers of exploitation and abuse in late July 2014.
"Given the detailed nature of the evidence and the extreme seriousness of the allegations, the Minister of Defence has responded by taking all necessary measures to ensure that the facts and possible criminal and disciplinary responsibilities can be established quickly," a statement from the ministry said.
An investigation was ordered, and the Paris prosecutor's office also opened an inquiry, which is ongoing, the statement said.
"The Minister of Defense has taken and will take all necessary measures to enable the establishment of the truth. If the facts should be proven, it will ensure that the strongest possible sanctions are imposed against the individuals responsible for what would be an intolerable offense to the values of the soldier."
The U.N. statement said the suspended U.N. staffer's actions in handing the report to French authorities "constitutes a serious breach of protocol, which, as is well known to all OHCHR officials, requires redaction of any information that could endanger victims, witnesses and investigators."
The staffer has been suspended with full pay while an investigation is carried out into the OHCHR's handling of the matter, the statement said.
"Our preliminary assessment is that such conduct does not constitute whistleblowing."

        <title>Nigeria: 160 women, children rescued from Boko Haram</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/a1tnL59eP5I/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Nigerian army spokesman: Some of those rescued "are psychologically disturbed"
A female hostage and a soldier were killed during the rescue operation, the military says
Amnesty International: Boko Haram has kidnapped over 2,000 women and girls since last year
Kano, Nigeria (CNN)
Nigerian troops rescued an additional 160 women and children from Boko Haram within days after they found hundreds of other hostages, the military said Thursday.
"We are still working to verify the actual number of the rescued hostages, but I can say they include around 60 women and 100 children," said army spokesman Sani Usman.
A female hostage and a soldier were killed during the rescue operation at Sambisa Forest, a base for the Islamist extremists.
Troops are moving into other parts of the forest and have destroyed nine militant camps, the spokesman said.
"Many of those kidnapped have undergone psychological trauma and indoctrination," he said.
Second rescue in a week
The rescue announced Thursday came the same week the military said it rescued another group of hostages in a different operation in the same forest. Shortly after troops saved 200 girls and 93 women Tuesday, Usman said they were not the Chibok girls whose abduction last year sparked worldwide outrage.
It was not immediately clear if any of those rescued in the most recent operation are among the Chibok girls.
That mass abduction of more than 200 girls in April 2014 from a school in the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok sparked a social media movement, #BringBackOurGirls. There's been no sign of them since. Last year, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau not only bragged about abducting the girls, but said he would "sell them in the market" like slaves .
Usman said the 160 figure for the latest batch of rescues is "an estimation, because more are coming in as operations continue."
As to their backstories, the Nigerian army spokesman added, "Some of them are psychologically disturbed and giving contrary information due to trauma, so we can't say where they're from yet."
Those rescued Tuesday were at least initially in "operational areas and not yet cleared for accessibility by health workers," according to Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency.
Officials have sent basic food and sanitary supplies, said agency spokesman Manzo Ezekiel.
Victims need support
Such mass rescues have been rare, though kidnappings unfortunately have not been, thanks to Boko Haram.
But the Islamist militant group has been on the defensive in recent weeks, as troops and vigilantes have moved into Sambisa Forest and raided its camps.
Boko Haram has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.
Rights groups applauded the rescues, but they urged troops to ensure the victims get the support they need.
"This development is just cause for celebration and undoubtedly an immense relief to the women, girls and their families. But this is just the tip of the iceberg; there are thousands more women and girls, and men and boys who have been abducted by Boko Haram," said Netsanet Belay,  Africa director at Amnesty International.
More than 2,000 women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram since last year, according to Amnesty International.
CNN's  Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano, Nigeria, and CNN's Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Christian Purefoy and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

Story highlights
Tulsa County sheriff says reserve deputies must partner with certified deputies
Reserve deputy Robert Bates shot and killed a suspect he meant to subdue with a Taser
(CNN)
The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has made changes to its reserve deputy program, which has come under scrutiny since a 73-year-old in the program fatally shot a suspect he meant to subdue with a Taser.
Sheriff Stanley Glanz said in a press release that reserve deputies cannot patrol alone. They must be partnered with certified deputies.
He also said the reserve program "advanced classification" will be postponed while every reserve deputy's training is audited.
Robert Bates was classified as an advanced reserve deputy on April 2, when he was backing up other deputies and shot and killed suspect Eric Harris.
Bates has said he meant to grab his Taser but pulled out his pistol instead. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree manslaughter.
Training has become a major issue since the shooting, with the victim's family alleging Bates didn't have the proper training but was allowed to wear a uniform because he donated vehicles and other equipment to the Sheriff's Office.
An internal inquiry by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in 2009 concluded that Bates was shown special treatment and that training policies were violated regarding his role with the agency.
The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Sheriff's Office denied the allegations in the newspaper's report. It also declined a CNN interview to respond to the claims.
The Sheriff's Office says it has 126 reserve deputies on the force.

        <title>Nepal earthquake: Mountain villages are cut off</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/DBcM4yCJmHo/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Seven days in and the specter of the Nepal earthquake only grows.
The capital, Kathmandu, is in ruins.
In the countryside, not too far from the quake's epicenter, mountain villages are cut off from almost everything. Landslides block the roads and no significant aid is on the way.
The road to Keura
Keura is one of those villages.
Roads will only get you so far in the Himalayas northwest of Kathmandu. They're muddy, and they're dangerous.
On the road to Keura, there are some pockets of hope.  A makeshift aid distribution center has been set up along the route.
Volunteers like retired American paramedic Stacey Baker are doing what they can to help.  Any other assistance is hours away.
"A lot of people are coming down for provisions and food and stuff like that," Baker said. "We think the sicker people that need to be seen can't get here."
Baker, who was in Nepal on vacation, treated one of her sickest patients of the day. A tiny baby, who arrived feverish and lethargic, cries for attention.

Back in Kathmandu, search and rescue teams continued to scour the city's rubble Friday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities. Another 72 people were reported dead in India and 25 in China.

Lots of new options are coming to LAX in 2014
(CNN)
Whenever someone starts talking about the "good ol' days" of air travel, remind them about eating at old school airports.
Back then, a meal at the airport meant horsing down a candy bar from the gift shop and wrestling with a vending machine for a can of soda.
Nowadays, large, medium and even some smaller airports provide legitimately good restaurants, with enough interesting offerings and atmosphere to make that three-hour layover just a little less hellish.
There's still room for culinary upgrades -- as noted below, some airports haven't yet figured out that sitting on planes makes us hungry and irritable -- but the best places to eat in the country's busiest airports (ranked by passenger traffic, per FAA statistics) generally range from good to great.
20. Honolulu International ( HNL )
Eating healthy at the airport 02:43
PLAY VIDEO
What Hawaii offers in fun and sun, its marquee airport lacks in decent food options.
Your best bet: Eat before you hit the road.
If you must eat at HNL, opt for a sit-down meal at Stinger Ray's; it's the only place with a restaurant-like feel to it. Hard to go wrong with the nachos or pulled pork sandwich.
Surf and turf at Anthony's Restaurant in Seattle-Tacoma International.
19. Seattle-Tacoma International ( SEA )
Anthony's Restaurant started as a single seafood joint in 1969. Now the company consists of 22 locations and a private fleet of fishermen.
Each location -- yes, even the one in the Central Terminal -- serves seasonal Pacific seafood and shellfish from the Northwest, Alaska and Hawaii. The mountain blackberry cobbler is an addictive Cinnabon alternative.
18. Fort Lauderdale International ( FLL )
The Food Network finally cooked up the most obvious way to cash in on its success: It opened a restaurant.
Fans can stop by Food Network Kitchen in Terminal 3 and choose Florida-inspired dishes from the grab-and-go menu (Caesar salad with key lime dressing) or the made-to-order menu (including a club sandwich with, you guessed it, key lime mayo).
Of course, the TVs play the likes of Guy Fieri and Bobby Flay all day long.
17. Orlando International ( MCO )
Orlando airport seems to be unaware of the current revival in airport restaurants. Nonchain options are limited.
The Food Network Kitchen in Fort Lauderdale International promises "classic fare and local flavor," plus Guy Fieri on TV.
You can try your luck with a latte at ZaZa's Cuban Coffee or the sliders at Johnny Rivers' Grill and Market. But you might be just as happy going with what you know at Qdoba, Burger King or Outback.
16. Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County ( DTW )
The venerable kid staple gets a makeover at PB&amp;J near Gate A1. The menu offers preset gourmet peanut butter and jelly combos, as well as an option to customize your own.
"The Exceptional is the most popular sandwich," says Fares Saah, one of the airport's food court managers. It comes loaded with peanut butter, honey and bacon on cinnamon swirl bread. "People are always surprised by the combination, but there have been no complaints."
Handmade noodles and free playtime on iPads at Shoyu in Minneapolis-St. Paul International.
15. Minneapolis-St. Paul International ( MSP )
At upscale noodle and sushi shop Shoyu, you use an anchored-down iPad to order your meal.
Once you've picked your food, you can continue to play with the iPad or you can watch the chefs make Japanese noodles in the open kitchen. Pork belly pot stickers, Thai lettuce wraps, sushi and noodle bowls are all on the menu.
14. Newark Liberty International ( EWR )
You're in New Jersey, but you can eat like you're in New York. OK, the Grand Central Oyster Bar in Terminal C may lack the atmosphere of its New York City sister, but, hey, you're in an airport. The food, especially the crab cakes and fried calamari, is still equally good.
13. San Francisco International ( SFO )
There's real, upscale comfort food at Cat Cora's Kitchen near Gate 55. The Iron Chef uses organic and fresh ingredients with a health-conscious mindset.
Highlights include the steak tacos, lobster mac and cheese or baked jalapeo poppers stuffed with creamy feta cheese and breaded with panko crumbs.
The cocktails are stiff and refreshing, too, like the cucumber martini or the Love and Haight (chili-infused tequila with blood orange juice, lime juice and honey).
12. Miami International ( MIA )
You may recognize chef Lorena Garcia from her Taco Bell commercials, but fast food burritos notwithstanding, she really has made some good career moves.
Her airport outpost, Lorena Garcia Cocina (Concourse D), serves Caribbean jerk chicken, shrimp ceviche and baked breakfast empanadas that come out of the kitchen fast, but not suspiciously fast.
The restaurant also includes a Bacardi Mojito Bar, where you can order (very) tall drinks before facing the departure lounge.
11. John F Kennedy International, New York City ( JFK )
Chef Andrew Carmellini's New York restaurants -- The Dutch and Locanda Verde -- are always packed.
Can't be bothered? Stop by Croque Madame in Terminal 2 and grab his food to go. On offer: French-inspired open-faced sandwiches, crepes and made-to-order salads.
El Bravo at Phoenix Sky Harbor International: famed for locally made tamales and hearty combo plates.
10. Phoenix Sky Harbor International ( PHX )
Ask any Phoenician where to find the best tamale and they'll point you to El Bravo in Sunnyslope. No time to get there during your trip? Check in at the airport early and snag one there.
The family team makes its famous green chile tamales at its original outpost every morning and drops them off, so you're getting quality.
"People will try one for lunch and like them so much they'll buy a dozen frozen ones to take home," says Monique Othon, whose grandmother created the original recipe.
9. Philadelphia International ( PHL )
In town, Chickie's &amp; Pete's is a go-to spot for watching sports and it's no different in PHL. It's not just for Eagles fans, either. With four airport locations, its TVs offer a multitude of sports and teams.
"It's not uncommon for us to have international soccer league games on for our foreign travelers," says co-owner Pete Ciarrocchi.
If you don't care about the games, there's always the crabfries: crinkle-cut fries dusted with salt and spicy crab seasoning, served with a side of cheese sauce.
8. George Bush Intercontinental, Houston ( IAH )
Urban Crave has the look and feel -- and trendy menu -- of a real restaurant, it's just smaller, and in an airport.
At Gate C33, one of the restaurant's most popular orders is the 10-inch all-beef "haute dog." We like the Sonoran Dog, which comes wrapped in bacon and topped with mayo, mustard, ketchup, tomatoes, onions, jalapeos and salsa verde. The 10-ounce inside-out burger has bacon and cheddar on the inside of the patty.
7. McCarran International, Las Vegas ( LAS )
The recently opened Terminal 3 features 14 new gates and seven new restaurants. The best one: The Village Pub, which has locations all over Las Vegas.
The family-owned restaurant offers beer-battered fish and chips, fried chicken and handcrafted beers from Vegas. There's even a convenient beer window so you can grab a pint and play the slots right until fly time.
So meaty! Brookwood Farms BBQ at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
6. Charlotte Douglas International Airport ( CLT )
The meaty aromas emanating from Brookwood Farms BBQ waft all the way to the security lines, where they taunt hungry travelers. The restaurant has an onsite smoker and whatever doesn't get cooked there gets smoked at Brookwood's 80,000-square-foot facility nearby.
"We have 200 yards of barbecue pits with a capacity to smoke 100,000 pounds of meat per night," says Craig Wood, a vice president at the company.
Not surprisingly, the pulled pork -- which is blended with tangy Carolina vinegar barbecue sauce -- is the best-seller.
You'll have to wait until 2014 for Umami Burger at LAX.
5. Los Angeles International ( LAX )
Late last year, LAX finally announced plans to add 15 eateries to Tom Bradley International Terminal. Between now and 2014, hot spots, including Umami Burger, 800 Degrees and Michael Voltaggio's sandwich shop ink.sack, will open.
Until then, your best bet is Pinks, which specializes in hot dogs but also has a pastrami burrito and cheese fries on the menu.
4. Dallas/Fort Worth International ( DFW )
If you've got a morning flight, Cereality at gate C6 is like Chipotle, but with cereal instead of burritos.
The more obvious Texas choice is barbecue. Family-owned Cousin's Bar-B-Q (at Terminals B and C) also offers locations outside the airport and has 30 years of experience cooking ribs and sausages.
3. Denver International ( DEN )
If you're a Denver transit traveler who likes to knock back a few before hitting the  skies, there's the New Belgium Hub (Gates B80). The food here is fine, but it's the beer selection -- from the eponymous local craft brewery -- that keeps tables full. Fat Tire Amber Ale and Ranger IPA are popular. Of course, so is Coors Light.
Rick Bayless specialties at Tortas Frontera in Chicago O'Hare International.
2. Chicago O'Hare International ( ORD )
Chef Rick Bayless is known for his Mexican food and has several restaurants in Chicago. The only problem? Most of them are closed on Sundays and Mondays.
But his Tortas Frontera restaurants (in Terminals 1 and 3) are open every day, giving travelers a chance to try his tortas, molletes and fresh-made guacamole.
Bayless stands by his food so confidently that he lists food suppliers on his website , accounting for everything from antibiotic-free chicken to the sour cream.
Gourmet at the airport: One Flew South keeps it classy in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International.
1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International ( ATL )
Passing through the busiest airport in the country? You could support a local franchise and get a chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-A.
But One Flew South in Terminal E is the airport's first upscale restaurant.
On the menu: pecan-dusted scallops, pork belly sliders and a house-cured salmon bruschetta.
Once you're nice and stuffed, you can fall into a food coma in a private 7-by-8 foot room at Minute Suites ($32 for the first hour), located at Concourse B, Gate B15.

If you were one for overstatement, you'd say the successes of the American melting pot are best exemplified in the humble sandwich.
For generations of immigrants to the United States, one way to make their new home more palatable was to bring with them tastes of the old country.
Consider the inspirations for the all-American hamburger and hot dog in the German cities of Hamburg and Frankfurt.
Eggplant Parmesan arrived with Italian immigrants.
The first corned beef started coming over from Ireland in the 1600s, while two centuries later, Jewish Romanians introduced pastrami to their new world.
Now, all these once foreign tastes are considered staples of the American sandwich diet.
But times are changing, not just demographically, but also hoagie-logically.
The dominance of the BLT and grilled cheese is being challenged by a wave of newcomers to the States. But which one will eventually take its place in America's sandwich pantheon?
You might not be able to find all the following sandwiches at your local deli, but keep an eye out for them on menus; they're a taste of what's to come in American sandwiches.

(CNN)
Everyone loves a good get-back-up, Rocky-style story.
But inspirational tales don't always have to star a guy in shiny shorts -- or a big city like Philadelphia.
Sometimes the best against all odds tales are real ones, taking place in unsung towns, led by regular citizens energized to resuscitate once thriving destinations just as they appeared flat on the mat.
Even big, star-studded cities face struggles and off decades, but what's kept Main Street, USA alive amid interstates, mega-malls, national chains and closed stagecoach routes? The heart and hard work of historic rebound towns like these.
Coronado, California: The little peninsula that could
Then: A storied SoCal getaway for adventure-seeking aristocrats and their servants stretching back to the Victorian era, Coronado suffered in the late 20th century with a 35 percent vacancy rate along its historic main drag, Orange Avenue, leaving locals wondering how to prevent this pretty peninsula on the far side of San Diego Bay from drowning.
Now: One of the country's most successfully revitalized coastal resort communities draws crowds of vacationers and window shoppers over the boomerang-shaped San Diego-Coronado Bridge onto streets lined with flowers and fully restored classical revival-style buildings.
Wow: The iconic Hotel del Coronado (aka "The Del") remains one of the world's grandest landmarks and most resilient beach hotels, with a who's who guest list of celebs and dignitaries several generations long.
Paducah, Kentucky
Paducah, Kentucky: Small town with big art
Then: In the 1980s, historic Lower Town was 20 square blocks of once-beautiful homes blighted by crime and neglect. Its commercial center sat 70 percent vacant.
Now: More than $100 million in investment later, those same blocks are home to a vibrant arts and small business community that's now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With brick- and tree-lined sidewalks that attract more than $200 million in annual tourist income, the town underwrites an Artist Relocation Program that's drawing resident artists and international visitors, and is considered a national model for utilizing the arts for municipal resurrection.
Wow: Held each May, the Lower Town Arts &amp; Music Festival was recently tapped among the state's top spring festivals, featuring Western Kentucky's best art, music, theater and food.
New Iberia, Louisiana: Reborn on the bayou
Then: Founded by the Spanish in 1779 (originally called Nueva Iberia) and home to five brick factories in the 1890s, this vintage bayou town's main street was a barren row of boarded-up shops not long ago, with its decaying landmark art deco theater, the Evangeline, looking like the sad inspiration for a forgotten Jim Carrey movie.
Now: New Iberia's latest renaissance has yielded a Great American Main Street Award and a revitalized commercial district featuring hot (and hot) Cajun eateries, rows of new shops and the beautifully restored Evangeline (now Sliman) Theater -- home to Louisiana Live Cajun and "swamp pop" concerts.
Wow: High points of a town tour include the pin-up antebellum mansion, Shadows-on-the-Teche , and the original Tabasco factory and 250-acre Jungle Gardens on Avery Island, just seven miles down the road.
Frederick, Maryland
Frederick, Maryland: After the flood... cute shopping!
Then: Once a hospice for Civil War casualties, this proud Colonial-era city endured late 20th-century battle fatigue after getting sidestepped by a new interstate, losing its retail core to outlying shopping malls and being hit by a massive flood in the mid-1970s that turned nearly 100 acres of its historic downtown into a temporary swamp.
Now: Frederick is revived, with a nearly chain-proof red brick commercial district lined with indie shops, destination restaurants and weekenders from D.C. and Baltimore (both about an hour away) escaping here instead of the other way around.
Wow: Stroll along Carroll Creek Park's pedestrian bridges and brick pathways lined with public art and it's hard to believe this green space was originally a flood control project.
Ely, Nevada: The mettle of nowhere
Then: Originally a Pony Express station, this remote Nevada town's mineral mining fortunes boomed and busted through the 20th century, taking their biggest toll during the 1970s copper market crash.
Now: Copper is back, as is gold mining, but Ely's latest boom is as a weekend escape between Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City (the nearest major town, 241 miles away).
Way out on Highway 50 (aka The Loneliest Road in America), you'll find wallet-friendly Wild West imagery like the Hotel Nevada &amp; Gambling Hall (from 1929), the Jailhouse Casino's Cell Block Steak House (fine dining behind bars) and several land-of-the-lost state parks about as busy as the moon.
Wow: You can augment the Western experience by boarding an authentic steam-powered train on the Ely-based Nevada Northern Railway for a 90-minute chug through the Silver State's timeless outback.
DeLand, Florida: Classic revivalist
Then: Conceived in the 1870s as an "Athens of Florida" (emphasizing education and culture) by baking soda baron Henry DeLand, the small but big-thinking central Florida community gave rise to grand Victorian homes and Stetson University before succumbing to financial hardship, deteriorating neighborhoods and 75 percent downtown vacancy in the mid-1980s.
Now: After a magical civic recovery an hour from Disney World, downtown DeLand's rows of shops, restaurants and museums along Woodland Boulevard and Indiana Avenue include the restored 1921 art deco Athens Theater , nearby Artisan Alley and a revived Garden District that inspired an award-winning documentary about urban renewal.
Wow: Housed in the basement of an old bank building, the Mainstreet Grill has been voted DeLand's best restaurant for more than a decade, and serves a "Spectacular Sunday Brunch Buffet" to prove it.
Libertyville, Illinois: Revival, take two
Then: Established as a bedroom community for Chicago's elite in the early-mid-20th century, Libertyville receded into drab suburb status in later decades. Its first stab at revitalization in the 1960s -- a poorly conceived series of modernization projects dubbed Operation Face-Lift -- led only to more boarded-up storefronts over the next 20 years.
Now: Unveiling its old Victorian facades and regaining its roots as a homey, Midwestern Americana detour from the big city, Libertyville's four-block epicenter along Milwaukee Avenue (35 miles from the Loop, and a world apart) is lined with boutiques, foodie shops and an important microbrewery ( Mickey Finn's ) on Windy City pub hop maps.
Wow: If it's Thursday between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., it's Farmer's Market time (June-October) on Church Street across from Cook Park -- a tradition for more than three decades.
El Dorado, Arkansas: Raising the boom
Then: Home to a 1920s oil rush that brought high hopes, rows of new buildings and 30,000 people to "Arkansas' Original Boomtown," the golden opportunity of El Dorado's namesake gave way to the Great Depression and perpetual economic hardship. By 1980, the town's commercial district was barely ticking.
Now: Thanks to one huge civic mobilization, mass restorations, a new $14.4 million conference facility and a roster of annual festivals, El Dorado has recouped its reputation as "the pride of south Arkansas." The once desolate downtown is now lined with more than 65 specialty shops, eateries, inns and the state's only operating art deco theater.
Wow: Each May, the Bugs, Bands &amp; Bikes festival features thousands of revving motorcycles gathered for a bike show/parade and a two-day Battle of the Bands -- all seasoned with hundreds of pounds of the region's best crawfish.

6 best places to be a cowboy (for a while)
Jennings Brown, for CNN Travel
Updated 0800 GMT (1500 HKT) May 1, 2015
Wyoming's Doublerafter Cattle Drives offers "real deal" Western experiences.
Story highlights
Plenty of genuine cowboy experiences are available to travelers
Bandera, Texas, is the self-proclaimed Cowboy Capital of the World
Repairing trucks is part of today's cowboy experience
Real cattle drives are part of the deal at Wyoming's Doublerafter Cattle Drives
To many, the spur-booted buckaroo in the ten-gallon hat may represent a time gone by. But the American cowboy is still alive and well -- and it's not too late to join his (or her) rangeland ranks.
Across the West -- and even in New England -- real ranches, rodeos and cattle drives aren't just preserving the frontier spirit, they're actively practicing it.
Many are open to the adventuresome traveler.
Ranches, cattle drives, bull riding -- the life of the late-1800s Western superhero is available to all travelers (with good health insurance).
Cowboy Level: Urban
Bandera, Texas
The self-proclaimed Cowboy Capital of the World is stocked with guest ranches and real ranches, welcoming dudes (according to Merriam-Webster, "a city dweller unfamiliar with life on the range") as well as legitimate ranch hands.
It's practically impossible to pass through town without seeing a rodeo. Horses tied to hitching posts aren't uncommon.
There are more than a dozen guest ranches to choose from, but among the most historic is Dixie Dude Ranch, which has lured wannabe wranglers since 1937. An overnight trail ride includes chuck wagon meals and storytelling by the campfire.
The cowboy authenticity ends where the massage therapy and pool begin.
Possibly the best experience in Bandera is at Arkey Blue's Silver Dollar Saloon -- one of Texas' greatest dance halls. There are always a few cowboys drinking Pearl beer and listening to live music, often played by Arkey himself.
Hit town for the National Day of the Cowboy on July 27 and you'll be in for a treat. As you might expect, the town puts on a hell of a hootenanny.
833 Dixie Dude Ranch Road, Bandera, Texas; 830-796-7771; www.dixieduderanch.com ; www.banderacowboycapital.com
Cowboy Level: Hired Hand
Chico Basin Ranch (Colorado)
If you want to be less of a dude and more of a dust-kicking cowpoke, consider the 87,000-acre Chico Basin Ranch.
Located 35 miles outside of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Chico Basin is a true working ranch where guests perform every task that experienced cowboys must do in order to keep the ranch functioning. That includes repairing trucks, equipment and fences; constructing gear in the leather shop; and branding and moving cattle.
Most of the work is done on horseback.
Chico doesn't offer many comforts, so guests get the true working cowboy experience.
But if visitors need a relaxing activity after a hard day's work, they're welcome to go fishing on one of the ranch's five lakes.
22500 Peyton Highway S., Colorado Springs, Colorado; 719-683-7960; www.chicobasinranch.com
Zapata Ranch (Colorado)
At Colorado's Zapata Ranch, guests herd bison as well as cattle.
Like Chico Basin, Zapata Ranch in Mosca, Colorado, is owned by The Nature Conservancy, but it's run by the state ranch management company Ranchlands, so there's a strong emphasis on sustaining one of the most ecologically diverse regions in America.
The ranch itself stretches through forests, wetlands, sand dunes and verdant pastures.
All visitors get a hands-on cowboy experience, not only moving cows, but also herding about 2,000 buffalo from pasture to pasture to help sustain the land.
Guests also fix barbed wire fencing, tend to giant center-pivot irrigation sprinklers, and learn how modern practices are being fused with classic cowboy traditions to help preserve one of America's greatest assets.
5305 State Highway 150, Mosca, Colorado; open March-October; 719-378-2356; www.zranch.org
McGinnis Meadows Cattle &amp; Guest Ranch (Montana)
Since the 1980s, more and more cowboys have been adopting Natural Horsemanship practices, made famous by the film "The Horse Whisperer."
At McGinnis Meadows in Libby, Montana, horse lovers learn the practices championed by Buck Brannaman. The method works with the natural instincts of the animal, building trust and mutual respect.
After learning how to "whisper," you and your horse will track, pen and drive cattle.
6220 McGinnis Meadows Road, Libby, Montana; 406-293-5000; www.mmgranch.net
Cowboy Level: True Grit
Doublerafter Cattle Drives (Wyoming)
Legit nomads can ditch the working ranch routine for a real deal cattle drive.
For six days, you can ride through the mountainous rangeland of Wyoming, moving cattle to greener pastures through terrain too rough and restrictive for anything with wheels.
Each night you'll set up 1800s-style canvas wall tents, eat grub cooked in a Dutch oven and entertain each other by the campfire.
The professionals warn guests to expect the unexpected -- from brush fires to stampedes to impromptu rodeos.
After nearly a week in the saddle you'll be ready for a steady seat. And you can enjoy one at the famous cowboy saloon, The Mint Bar, in Sheridan, Wyoming, where most groups spend their last night.
P.O. Box 490, Ranchester, Wyoming 82839; open June-September;  307-655-9539; www.doublerafter.com
Let R Buck (Connecticut)
In the time it takes to read this sentence, you've left the gate at Let R Buck and been thrown off your first bull.
Working the rangeland can be as gratifying as it is grueling, but for some bronc busters, nothing compares to the adrenaline rush of riding a 2,000-pound beast for eight never-ending seconds of glory.
At Let R Buck bull riding school in North Canaan, Connecticut, you can learn about the mighty bull, its body language and how to stay on it for about the same amount of time it takes to read this sentence.
After six days of classes, you're ready to ride at a professional rodeo.
210 S. Canaan Road, North Canaan, Connecticut; 860-824-7700; www.cnobull2tuff.com

Pueblos and powwows in New Mexico highlight Native American culture
Baseball, football and the Derby made the cut -- yes, we love sports
What would the country be without soul food?
We tried to resist including Burning Man, but failed
(CNN)
Last year we published a list of quintessential Americana experiences. You can find it here .
They weren't necessarily the most patriotic, obvious or agreeable choices. NASCAR, bourbon, state fairs, Vegas, what's not to love? Apparently, plenty.
There was scandal. There was outrage. There was name calling.
Because we're gluttons for punishment -- or maybe just because we think we actually can please all of the people all of the time -- we're back for round two.
Here's our Volume II of the most authentically American experiences this country has to offer.
1. Seaside boardwalks
Boardwalks have been enhancing beachside amusement since long before the Drifters' released their classic "Under the Boardwalk" in 1964.
The first boardwalk was built in Atlantic City in 1870, when a railroad conductor was asked to find a way to prevent sand from filling shorefront hotel entryways.
The innovation remains America's favorite wooden path, showing up everywhere from Monopoly, which was inspired by "America's Favorite Playground," to the HBO series "Boardwalk Empire," which takes place in Prohibition-era Atlantic City.
Of course, you don't have to travel to Jersey to experience the joy of a lumber-pathed stroll; there are more than 60 boardwalks split between America's coasts.
Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, includes roller coasters, carnival attractions, Nathan's Famous hot dogs and other slices of Americana. Out West, the Venice Boardwalk in California offers bodybuilders, artists, trinket sellers, magicians and boutique shops a place to be seen.
Taos Pueblo
2. Pueblos and powwows
One of the most inspiring American experiences is witnessing the culture of the first Americans come alive in a spectacle of swirling, pulsing color.
Every April, approximately 3,000 Native American dancers and singers from roughly 700 tribes come together in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to compete and celebrate their heritage. The teams blend traditional style with modern, innovative techniques, so the result is more than just living history, it's the evolution of a culture that most Americans think has all but died away.
In the same area are many pueblo sites that provide tours of cave dwellings and indigenous architecture.
Perhaps the most memorable is Taos Pueblo, 2 hours northwest of Albuquerque. This village of adobe buildings has been continually occupied by Native Americans for more than a thousand years.
Taos Pueblo , 120 Veterans Highway, Taos, New Mexico; open 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m.; closed for about 10 weeks in late winter and early spring; $10 for adults; 575-758-1028
Gathering of Nations , University of New Mexico Arena, Avenida Cesar Chavez, Albuquerque, New Mexico; 505-836-2810
3. Wrigley Field, Chicago
Forget national pastime -- to some Americans, baseball is a national religion. Wrigley Field in Chicago, regardless of denomination, is their Vatican.
Boston's Fenway Park has two years on Wrigley (the former was built in 1912), but Fenway has had more significant updates. Like a giant video display installed in 2000, and extra seats and luxury boxes that have been added time and time again.
By contrast, Wrigley has remained fairly true to its roots. It's a classic jewel box design -- green seats, open roof, exposed steel, brick, stone -- with ball-swallowing ivy-covered walls.
There's truly no better place to watch a game if you want a direct link to nearly a century of baseball history. If you're in Chicago during the off-season, no worries. The park provides 90-minute tours year-round.
Wrigley Field , 1060 W. Addison St., Chicago; tours $24 for individuals; 773-388-8270
LSU at. Alabama: earplugs not included.
4. College football, anywhere (though Alabama ain't bad)
Let's not kid ourselves. Football is the true national sport of the 21st century.
While it doesn't get much more American than the Super Bowl, we'd argue that the most enjoyable, purest way to experience the unique American-branded mixture of militant strategics, refined athleticism, brute force and exploitation of young labor is at a college football game.
Best to get there early enough to tailgate. Bonding with strangers, drinking and grilling beforehand is 72.4% of the experience.
Pretty much any stadium will do, but a game experience doesn't get much better than at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, home of the reigning national champion Alabama Crimson Tide. (Yes, we know, the barbecue is spicier and the cheerleaders are hotter at your team's stadium, but we had to draw the line somewhere and "national champs" earns you the top spot on lists like this.)
Bryant-Denny Stadium , 920 Paul W. Bryant Dr., Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
5. Kentucky Derby
There's one more sporting event we have to include on the list.
Sure, other countries have their horse races. But those competitions weren't founded by the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Also, those races don't have a traditional drink made of bourbon (mint julep), nor do they encourage everyone to dress like a flamboyant Southern aristocrat. We're talking bow ties, seersucker, bold pastels and spectacular hats that put British royal wedding attendees to shame.
Churchill Downs , 700 Central Ave., Louisville, Kentucky.; May 3-4, 2013; single day general admission $25-40; 502-636-4400
6. Burning Man
The first Woodstock Music &amp; Art Fair in 1969 was one of the most pivotal moments in American cultural history. Five-hundred-thousand people came together to celebrate drugs, weirdness, creativity, individualism, beauty and sticking it to the Man.
What's the direct descendant of Woodstock? Before you say Bonnaroo, Coachella, Lollapalooza or any other trendy music festival -- each of which is run by the Man -- let us stop you.
The world's largest festival of artistic expression is Burning Man.
The weeklong event held every year in the Black Rock Desert of northern Nevada is difficult to describe. As the website puts it, describing Burning Man is "like trying to explain what a particular color looks like to someone who is blind."
Essentially 50,000 creative spirits gather in one of the most desolate areas in the continental United States to wear bizarre clothes, make art, do drugs, experience a new form of communal living, have a hell of a lot of fun and let their freak flags fly.
Burning Man ; August 26-September 2, 2013; 415-863-5263
Kinda small for second helpings, but OK, we'll keep eating.
7. Soul food
It's difficult to pin down the most American of foods. Almost every candidate has roots in other countries, but, of course, that's what makes them American.
Soul food makes the top of the list because it's delicious, unapologetically artery-clogging and it brings us face to face with our turbulent past.
African-American slaves on Southern plantations were often given scraps and leftovers to eat, and had to make do with whatever vegetables they could grow nearby and with little care, as so much time was spent working. From these restrictions arose some of the finest recipes in American cuisine.
There are thousands of spectacular soul food restaurants -- many of the best are in the South -- but Sylvia's in New York is maybe the most well known.
Sylvia's , 328 Lenox Ave., New York; 212-996-0660
8. Juke joints
While we're in the region, one of America's great art forms, Blues music, grew up in the juke joints of the South. Jukes arose after emancipation, taking the form of shacks and private houses where African-Americans gathered to listen to and play music, gamble and dance.
A few classic juke joints still remain, some along Highway 61, aka the Blues Highway, which stretches from New Orleans to the town of Wyoming, Minnesota, an American experience in and of itself. Po' Monkey's, opened in 1963 outside Merigold, Mississippi, is considered one of the last remaining original jukes. It's only open Thursdays, and it's not easy to get to, but the music and crowd make it worth the trip.
Po' Monkey's ; Po Monkey Road, Merigold, Mississippi; 662-843-2712
Who says the suburbs don't have culture?
9. Outdoor Christmas light displays
Sure, other countries have Christmas lights (or fairy lights, in the UK), but no one else takes it quite as seriously as Americans.
The lighting of the approximately 80-foot tall Norwood spruce at Rockefeller Center in New York is practically a national event. But the greatest displays of holiday spirit can be seen in more rural areas. Take Magical Night of Lights in Lake Lanier, Georgia, which consists of seven miles and millions of lights, or the six-mile long Oglebay Winter Festival of Lights in Wheeling, West  Virginia.
Magical Night of Lights , 7000 Lanier Islands Parkway, Buford, Georgia; 770-945-8787
Winter Festival of Lights , 465 Lodge Dr., Wheeling, West Virginia; November 8, 2013-January 5, 2014; Sunday through Thursday until 10 p.m. and Friday and Saturday until 11 p.m.; 800-624-6988
Sunday morning at Joel's place in Houston (Lakewood Church).
10. Megachurches
Americans know how to make praising Jesus memorable. Just look at Gospel music and tent revivals.
In modern times you needn't look much further than Gospel brunches (wash away your sins from the night before with spiritual songs and mimosas) and megachurches.
Those giant boxes of worship are where thousands of Christians gather not simply to pray and praise, but in many cases to eat, shop and work out.
The United States has more than 1,300 of them, and more than 50 draw a weekly attendance between 10,000 and 45,000.
The mega-ist of American megachurches is Lakewood Church in Houston, led by senior pastor Joel Osteen. Every week his message is broadcast to 7 million viewers in more than 100 countries.
Lakewood Church ; 3700 Southwest Freeway, Houston; 713-635-4151

Stale, contaminated nuts and pretzels served in a culture dish are standard fare in most bars.
But some establishments across the country aren't only taking their countertop cuisine to new levels -- bomboloni, gougres, croque monsieur! -- they've decided to give it to patrons on the house.
Gratis bar food may be a dying tradition in some quarters, but we found a number of joints that don't care about cost or mess, opting to dry your whistle before they wet it. Here are ten of the finest, for starters. Serve us up your own favorites.
1. Crunch-fried hominy
Yardbird Southern Table &amp; Bar, Miami
While fried chicken is the star at this James Beard-recognized Southern indulgery, the crunch-fried hominy is the snack that keeps drinkers sated, free of charge.

        <title>America's most luxurious airport layovers (yes, they exist)</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/D-16BwAkoII/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Enough with the Admiral's Lounge free coffee. It's 2013 -- let's fly like it
Miami International has one of the best public art collections anywhere in the country
A golf simulator in Detroit Metropolitan offers virtual shots at the famed 18 hole at Pebble Beach
Boston Logan has genuinely great food
(CNN)
Not so long ago, having a layover between flights was like having skin graft surgery between root canals.
That's begun to change.
With airport amenities classy enough to impress a card-carrying Kardashian, you might even consider yourself lucky to have a few hours to spare between legs these days -- provided you know where to make your next connection.
From bare bones basics like spa services to sustainable gourmet cuisine crafted by celebrity chefs and designer boutiques that wouldn't be out of place on Rodeo Drive, some American airports offer travelers an experience better than certain destinations.
San Francisco International Airport (SFO)
A $383 million renovation in 2008 turned this airport (most notably, Terminal 2) into an all-in-one luxury destination for shoppers, foodies and art aficionados.
Travelers, tourists and locals flock to the SFO Museum . Opened 1980, it was the first museum of its kind located in an international airport and it has only grown since then, having spread throughout all four terminals.
From modern photography to Pan-Asian ceramics, a rotating array of exhibitions is designed to intrigue a cross-section of visitors.
For those with a tot in tow, there's also a children's museum, complete with art classes and even an aquarium (Terminal 1).
The new packet of salty peanuts for the 21st century is caviar, available to go at Simply Gourmet in Terminal 1, along with various truffles, meats and cheeses.
Over in T2, Napa Farms Market is a hybrid gourmet food shop/cafe/takeout/wine store curated by Steve Carlin of the famed Oxbow Market. There's also wine bar Vino Volo.
Once you've had your fill of sustainable Californian cuisine, Napa Valley wine and San Francisco culture, the International Terminal houses Gucci, Burberry and Swarovski shops as well as an Xpress Spa, in case you need a quick rubdown.
Originally installed in JFK Airport in 1960, the famed Carybe murals ("Gateway of the Americas" by Brazilian artist Carybe) are now on display in MIA.
Miami International Airport (MIA)
Taking the museum-in-airport trend to the next level, MIA too boasts an impressive art collection , one that's reflective of the South Florida community.
In fact, Americans for the Arts declared it one of the best public art projects in the nation.
And while the dining options fall short of "fine," the best offerings are fresh, delicious and capture the city's festive spirit.
Casual Cuban spot Ku-Va (Terminal D) is renown for its ropa vieja and mojitos on the go.
On the celebrity chef-helmed side, Lorena Garcia Cocina (also Terminal D) offers ceviche, empanadas and other Latin-influenced fare, much of it scratch-made daily.
But where MIA really excels is shopping.
Beyond high-end standbys like Hugo Boss, Emporio Armani and Thomas Pink, Terminal G boasts Jack Georges , purveyor of maniacally handcrafted leather goods.
Likewise, Terminal D is home to Coco Bay , where ladies of taste can take some laid-back Miami home to their closets.
The piece de resistance is The Shoppes at Ocean Drive .
A first-of-its-kind retail concept, this 10,000-square-foot luxury mini-mall is curated with Miami's iconic Ocean Drive magazine. Inside you'll find the highest-end apparel and accessories to make those last-minute souvenirs seem thoughtful, and an epic gourmet shop that even sells South Florida's famous stone crabs to go.
If all this luxury proves too exhausting, there are three spas on site with services ranging from a 10-minute manicure to a cellulite-reducing galvanic massage at Jetsetter Spa (Terminal H).
Logan International Airport, Boston (BOS)
Not as overtly luxurious as SFO or MIA, Boston's Logan has its share of topnotch offerings, especially in the eating category.
Terminal A has Legal Test Kitchen , a saucy offshoot of the Legal Seafood empire, where innovative technology combines with top-notch ingredients for a trendy and ever-evolving menu with a killer wine list.
Meanwhile, James Beard Rising Star Chef Todd English serves his signature Argentinean, European and American fusion at Bonfire Restaurant in Terminal B.
Juicy steaks and succulent tacos are crowd pleasers.
English also had a hand in developing Ozone, a contemporary cocktail lounge that offers light bites.
Then, of course, there's Legal Seafoods itself (Terminal C), where New England's old school, fish-centric fare is the focus. These days, it comes with an allergy-friendly twist.
At the entrance to Terminal E, Dine Boston welcomes a new, locally acclaimed chef every three months as part of its visiting chef program. Not only does it keep the menu exciting, a stamped receipt grants diners access to priority security lines.
Shopping options aren't vast, but Northeasterners from New York to New Hampshire can't get enough of jewelry designers Alex + Ani , whose Terminal B store glistens with sparkly goods.
You can shoot a game of pool at  the Virgin Atlantic Club House in JFK.
The Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse (JFK)
OK, so John F. Kennedy Airport as a whole could use an overhaul, but trust Richard Branson to be ahead of the curve.
His 10,000-square-foot Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse in Terminal 4 cost $7 million to build and the results rival any hip, metropolitan hotel when it comes to style and atmosphere.
Signature cocktails invented by top-shelf mixologists and beers tapped from New York's best microbreweries are served to travelers lounging in designer Eames, Saarinen and Jacobsen chairs.
Fusion fare is available from the in-house brasserie, which serves smoked haddock frittatas for breakfast and curry spiced grilled tilapia thereafter.
For the travel-haggard, stylists from New York's famed Bumble and Bumble salon (where they use their own products, as well as Dr. Haruschka and Truefitt &amp; Hill) are on hand in case you need a haircut or blow dry, and spa services include a free 15-minute massage for paying customers.
There are also Mac workstations and a billiards table.
With the lone exception of extended spa treatments like deep facials and aromatherapy oil massages, it's all complimentary for Virgin Business Class and Gold Members.
Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW)
A high-end whimsy is at play in the recently renovated McNamara and North Terminals, making parting with your money in the Motor City far more voluntary than it used to be.
Before a glass of northern Michigan red at Vino Volo , layoverers can swing on the PGA Tour Shop's virtual golf simulator in the Central Link Area of the McNamara Terminal, offering a virtual shot at the famous 18 hole at Pebble Beach.
Fashion forward types, design junkies and car aficionados alike will enjoy browsing in the first Porsche Design store in any airport worldwide, which opened in late 2012 in the McNamara Terminal.
DTW is home to a handful of well-reviewed, high-end restaurants, the most novel of which is PB&amp;J (McNamara Terminal), where peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are made to order. Gourmet additions like bacon and honey (on freshly baked bread of your choice) bring this grammar school classic up to food snob altitude.
Ralph Lauren's daughter's first airport outpost of Dylan's Candy Bar arrives shortly in McNamara Terminal, presenting patrons with a Sophie's choice between angel food and red velvet cakes to go.
And finally, Be-Relax Spa in the McNamara terminal offers massages, facials, oxygen therapy and manicures.

Working class beverage goes upscale, with beer-themed vacations rivaling wine tours

Trapp Family Lodge offers a beer holiday with "The Sound of Music" overtones
(CNN)
Beer doesn't readily inspire plans for opulent vacations or deluxe retreats the way its alcoholic rival, wine, does.
But as "microbrews" have become "craft beers" in recent years, the level of sophistication surrounding beer culture has also been elevated.
While the proletarian potable is still most commonly found guzzled in sports bars and on front porches, the United States is now filled with exclusive beer-themed getaways that are as upscale as the wine-iest holiday.
From cushy resorts that have a brewpub on site to working brewery farms with bespoke lodging, "beercations" combine relaxing destinations exalting the endless combinations derived from water, malt, yeast and hops.
Here are 10 ways to experience the world of ritzy suds.
Woodstock Inn Station and Brewery, North Woodstock, New Hampshire
In the center of White Mountain National Forest's recreational wonderland is a combination brewery and inn that's quickly outgrown its modest roots.
After 17 years serving house-made (and award-winning) favorites such as Pig's Ear Brown Ale and Pemi Pale Ale, Woodstock Inn Brewery is expanding into a new building that will house a bottling line and event space.
Comprised of six buildings spread throughout North Woodstock's downtown area, each of the inn's 36 rooms is designed with rustic furnishings and home-style dcor inspired by the breathtaking scenery surrounding the small town.
Book a trip during frequent Brewer's Weekends and you'll get an all-inclusive, beer-themed holiday complete with beer-pairing dinners, commemorative swag and a full day in the brewhouse learning how beers are made.
Woodstock Inn Station and Brewery , 135 Main St., North Woodstock, New Hampshire; 603-745-3951; from $97 per night
The 2,700-acre property outside Stowe hosts "Sound of Music" reunions.
Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe, Vermont
While Maria von Trapp's memoir on the Trapp Family Singers was being fictionalized into the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "The Sound of Music," Maria, "The Captain" and their clan were busy welcoming guests to their Trapp Family Lodge in snowy New England.
Today, the 2,700-acre property outside Stowe hosts "Sound of Music" reunions and remains managed by third generation von Trapps.
There's been one important addition -- a lager brewery.
Trapp Lagers was the brainchild of Johannes von Trapp, the only son of Maria and Georg Ritter von Trapp who, along with Johannes, helmed the resort for decades.
In 2010, Johannes followed through on a longtime dream and built a traditional Austrian microbrewery that makes helles, amber and dunkel lagers year-round for the lodge's guests.
With a major brewery expansion in the works and a Beer Lover's vacation package on the menu, you can visit the Alps (sort of) without leaving the States.
Trapp Family Lodge , 700 Trapp Hill Road, Stowe, Vermont; 800-826-7000; from $225 per night
Norwich Inn/Jasper Murdock Alehouse, Norwich, Vermont
Like its namesake English city, Norwich has a long established brewing tradition.
When the Norwich Inn was founded in 1797, there were no commercial breweries in the state -- beers were made in small batches at taverns and served to guests such as future president James Monroe, who dined here while on a horseback tour of the then-frontier.
The inn's beer history was revived in 1993 when a microbrewery was built on site and Jasper Murdock Ales was born.
Named after the location's first owner, Jasper Murdock makes and bottles award-winning English-style beers available only at Norwich Inn's alehouse.
A mile and a half from Hanover, New Hampshire, the historic Dartmouth area hotel has 38 rooms across three buildings, all outfitted with fireplaces, warm towels and WiFi.
For the full beer effect, you can visit during the annual Brewer's Weekend or stay anytime with the "Ales at the Inn" package (your night's stay comes with a pour, a bottle and a commemorative glass by which to remember it all).
Norwich Inn , 325 Main St., Norwich, Vermont; 802-649-1143; from $169 per night
The Woodstock Inn Station and Brewery offers a series of suds-inspired spa treatments.
The Lodge at Woodloch, Hawley, Pennsylvania
In what may be a first for both the wellness and craft beer industries, this globally recognized spa and resort has rolled out a series of suds-inspired spa treatments that blend stress remedies with ingredients from beers made by one of the East Coast's top breweries.
In addition to standard body scrubs, massages, facials and salon services offered at this lavish spa set on 70 acres in eastern Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, there's now a special package of  treatments created in collaboration with the owner of Dogfish Head Brewery in nearby Delaware.
Visitors can stay in one of the Lodge's veranda suites or a neighboring family friendly resort, with spa options including the Royal Revival (a hops, barley and honey exfoliation, plus beer bath inspired by Dogfish Head's Midas Touch ale) or the Mud and Suds Pedicure, a beer foot soak paired with a glass of its muse brew, Palo Santo.
The Lodge at Woodloch , 109 River Birch Lane, Hawley, Pennsylvania; 570-685-8500; from $299 per night
The Brewery Creek Inn, Mineral Point, Wisconsin
In the 150 years since Cornish lead and zinc miners fled Mineral Point in search of California gold, cheap rents and peaceful surroundings have made the place a haven for artists and craftsmen.
So when Minneapolis expats Jeff and Deb Donaghue launched their Brewery Creek project in 1998, they allowed themselves some creative room, with three businesses in mind.
First is the Brewery Creek Inn, which occupies two restored cottages on historic Shake Rag Street and five rooms in a converted 1850s limestone warehouse off the town's main drag.
Second is Brewery Creek Brewing Co., a craft brewery located in one of the inn's buildings.
Third is the Brewery Creek pub and restaurant, a local watering hole and almost year-round kitchen that serves seasonal brews and fare.
Equal parts small town B&amp;B and living history museum, Brewery Creek offers do-it-yourself room service and a brewery that churns out nothing but European beer styles (biere de garde, Scottish porter, dunkelweiss), allowing visitors to experience this quaint pre-Civil War town with a cold one in hand.
Brewery Creek Inn , 23 Commerce St., Mineral Point, Wisconsin; 608-987-3298; from $149 per night
Fredericksburg Brewing Company -- a B&amp;B that offers complimentary beer, not breakfast.
Fredericksburg Brewing Co., Fredericksburg, Texas
The oldest brewpub in Texas is also the state's first B3, a term coined by vacationing beer geeks who noticed a growing number of B&amp;Bs with attached breweries.
Fredericksburg Brewing Co. likes to call its invention a "bed and brew" -- 11 individually styled rooms poised just above the restaurant, a night's stay that entitles you to four free samples of house-made beer.
Though other breweries have since moved into this Hill Country town, this German-inspired B3 maintains a top-notch beer selection with a helles lager, porter and red ale that consistently garner medals at national and international competitions.
After a night in the Admiral's Quarters or Cowboy Room, you can stay cool in the brewpub's climate controlled beer garden or browse historic downtown Fredericksburg -- where sidewalk consumption is legal -- while knocking back a fresh beer.
Fredericksburg Brewing Co ., 245 E. Main St., Fredericksburg, Texas; 830-997-1646; from $129 per night
Saratoga Resort and Spa/Snowy Mountain Brewery, Saratoga, Wyoming
What the tiny city of Saratoga lacks in population it makes up for in locally made beer.
Buried inside the massive Saratoga Resort and Spa is the Snowy Mountain Brewery, one of the oldest brewpub operations in the state.
In 2009, after a several year hiatus, during which its brewing equipment lay dormant, the resort's owners hired brewmaster Steve Simpson. It has since maintained a steady tap list of nine house beers, from Saratoga witbier to Citra IPA.
Whether you stay at the resort during Wyoming's short summers or harsh winters, you'll have your pick of outdoor activities from hunting, fishing and golfing to cross-country skiing and ATV adventuring. You can also soak in Saratoga's natural hot springs, which are corralled on the grounds into a public 70-foot pool and four smaller teepee-covered pools.
Saratoga Resort and Spa/ Snowy Mountain Brewery, 601 East Pic Pike Road, Saratoga, Wyoming; 800-594-0178; from $165 per night
Bonaventure Hotel/Bonaventure Brewing Co., Los Angeles
When the Bonaventure Hotel opened in downtown Los Angeles in 1976, it was considered the pinnacle of postmodernism.
An oasis of luxury in the center of urban LA, the building features a central atrium flanked by four clovered-room wings and walkways lined with specialty shops, boutiques and restaurants serving food from around the world.
Amid the opulence and global grandeur sits the Bonaventure Brewing Co., a brewpub on the hotel's fourth-floor outdoor pool deck.
In 1998, the hotel's proprietors crane-lifted a 10-barrel brewery onto the property and turned Bonaventure's poolside restaurant into Downtown LA's only brewpub.
Today, as the city's craft beer options grow with the national trend, BBC (as it's known locally) remains a brewing bastion, sitting so far removed from street level that many Angelenos don't even know it exists.
But get a room at the luxury hotel and enjoy a Marathon pale ale on The Patio (an outdoor lounge with unparalleled views of the surrounding city) and you'll feel at home with the Hollywood elite.
Bonaventure Hotel/Brewing Company, 404 South Figueroa St., Los Angeles; 213-624-1000; from $169
Edgefield is popular for its summer concert series -- Stevie Wonder, Adele, Sigur Ros and others have played.
McMenamins Edgefield, Troutdale, Oregon
Mike and Brian McMenamin are known throughout the Pacific Northwest for taking the definition of "pub" to its most impressive extremes.
In addition to restaurants that serve McMenamins' custom beer, and brewpubs where that beer is made, they've also converted elementary schools into multibar compounds, and turned various old properties into music venues, hotels and family friendly resorts built around golf courses and soaking pools.
Their most ambitious project was one of their earliest -- Edgefield was an old farm that had fallen on hard times.
In 1990 the brothers turned it into an expansive home for the company's upscale and experimental attractions.
A 20-minute drive from downtown Portland, Edgefield has a distillery, winery, brewery, spa, movie theater and outdoor music venue, in addition to 10 restaurants and bars, two three-par golf courses, gardens, a gift shop and several live-in artisans whose clay and glasswork are available for purchase.
Edgefield has become locally popular as a site for weddings, and the summer concert series (Stevie Wonder, Adele, Sigur Ros, among others have played) has an enormous following.
With so much to do at Edgefield, it's hard to know where to begin, but grabbing a pint of Hammerhead ale and wandering through one of America's most unique beer-centric destinations is a good start.
McMenamins Edgefield , 2126 S.W. Halsey St., Troutdale, Oregon; 503-669-8610; from $120 per night
Best Hong Kong beer purveyors
Hop 'N Bed at Chatoe Rogue, Independence, Oregon
Looking to bring a winery-type experience to beer lovers, Pacific Northwest stalwart Rogue Ales opened its micro-hopyard and barley farm in 2010.
Visitors explore the grounds and taste brewed-on-site beers from the exclusive Grow Your Own series.
The farm -- which also has a pumpkin patch, vegetable garden and scores of animals -- is located on nearly 50 acres adjacent to the Willamette River, making day trips from Portland or Salem a cinch.
For full immersion in the day-to-day operations of an environmentally sustainable beer operation, Rogue Farm's Hop 'N Bed, a new B&amp;B inside the property's 100-year-old farmhouse, gives guests access to facility tours, as well as the tasting room overlooking land that for multiple generations has grown some of the world's most sought after hops.
Directions to Rogue Farms are available by land, air and sea, letting you plot your trip by private plane, kayak or car. Valet is free for cyclists and horse riders.

        <MainBody>Lindblad Expeditions and partner National Geographic make Alaska cruises smarter
Azamara Club Cruises' Panama Canal trip hits 26 ports
Massive Oasis of the Seas has 25 restaurants and seven themed "neighborhoods."
(CNN)
For not-so-intrepid travelers, cruises are perfect.
Outside of getting yourself to the departure port, you don't need to plan anything to have a successful trip.
To make that ocean-going vacation as effortless as possible, we've assembled a list of the cushiest cruises departing from the United States.
Lindblad Expeditions: doing whatever it takes to keep the martinis cold.
Linblad Expeditions, Alaska cruise
With 340,000 miles of some of the Western Hemisphere's most awe-inspiring coastline, you'll realize why the U.S. government dished out $7.2 million to take Alaska off Russia's hands.
True, the scenery had little to do with the controversial purchase then known as "Seward's Folly," but it's now one of the country's greatest assets.
One of the most engaging ways to explore this national treasure is with Lindblad Expeditions and its partner, National Geographic.
Experts in marine biology, geology and botany take travelers out into the ocean on smaller crafts and provide an intimate look at glaciers, grizzly and marine life.
An underwater hydrophone allows guests to listen to the songs of whales, orcas and dolphins.
Linblad Expeditions ; +1 800 397 3348; starts at $5,990
Celebrity Cruises, Immersive Wine Cruise
If you want to do the wild West Coast without walking on an ice floe, Celebrity's Immersive Wine Cruises take you to British Columbia, Seattle, San Francisco, Monterey and San Diego, and visit some of the finest wineries in the Pacific Northwest.
The tasting doesn't end when cruisers leave dry land -- sommeliers are available to help passengers choose from about 500 selections of wine on board.
Celebrity Cruises ; +1 888 245 4254; starts at $800
Marveling at a marvel -- the Panama Canal.
Azamara Club Cruises, Panama Canal Cruise
Azamara Club Cruises offers a trip that departs from one U.S. coast and arrives on the other, by passing through the Panama Canal.
Along the way, the ship hits 26 ports in 12 countries, including Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico, Colombia and Jamaica.
At each destination, Azamara provides longer, more immersive excursions than most other cruise lines.
The most memorable part of the trip is coasting through 58 miles of waterway that wouldn't exist if tens of thousands of workers hadn't risked or given their lives to build it.
Azamara Club Cruises ; +1 877 999 9553, call for pricing
Queen Mary 2: was your last trip to Europe this comfortable?
Cunard, Queen Mary 2, transatlantic cruise
In 2004, the Queen Mary 2 became the first transatlantic passenger liner built in 35 years.
Its classic design and decoration embody an adoration of world travel that predates even her predecessor, the half-sized Queen Elizabeth 2, which reigned from 1969 to 2008.
While the eastbound cruise departing from New York City only makes a stop at Southampton, UK, before arriving at Hamburg, Germany, the majestic ship's spa, theater, library, ballroom and planetarium keep you stuffed with things to eat, see and do throughout the nine-day cruise.
Cunard ; +1 800 728 6273; from $1,600
American Queen Steamboat Company Mississippi River Cruise
You don't even have to leave the country for some of the world's most luxurious boating excursions.
Each five- to 10-day trip on this Victorian-decorated vessel recalls antebellum heydays, complete with large orchestra music, stops at historic cities, southern family cooking and lectures from an onboard "riverlorian."
Various themed trips are offered.
"Southern Culture" is a match for the history buff; "Fall Foliage" is good for those who want nothing more than to sit in a rocking chair and be mesmerized by natural beauty.
American Queen Steamboat Company ; +1 800 749 5280; from $950
Royal Caribbean, Oasis of the Seas
If you want to cruise purely to enjoy a massive adult wonderland, Royal Caribbean has made a seafaring behemoth of activity for you.
The 225,282-ton Oasis of the Seas is so gargantuan it contains 25 restaurants, 2,394 crew members and seven themed "neighborhoods."
There's Central Park (a garden lined with restaurants, bars and shops), The Pool and Sports Zone, Vitality at Sea Spa and Fitness Center, Boardwalk (theater, pool and rock climbing), Royal Promenade, Youth Zone and Entertainment place.
There's also a zip line, water park, casino, theater, mini-golf course, ice skating rink and basketball court.
Travelers can choose trips to the Bahamas or Caribbean, but what's the difference when you're on the world's greatest mobile theme park?
Royal Caribbean ; +1 866 562 7625; from $369
You're no longer at sea level -- you're 300 feet above it.
Royal Caribbean, Quantum of the Seas
Come November 2014, Royal Caribbean will be unveiling a boat even grander than the Oasis -- the Quantum of the Seas.
In addition to many of the fun features found on Oasis, Quantum will have a surf wave simulator, a skydive simulator and bumper cars.
But the grandest, and possibly weirdest addition is a glass-walled observation capsule that sits on the end of a 135-foot arm, which juts occupants past the edge of the ship so that they can hang 300 feet above sea level.
Royal Caribbean ; +1 866 562 7625; from $839

        <title>Yank royalty: 7 outrageous American castles</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/mL1E9jY9isI/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>The U.S. is home to a melting pot of "royal" domiciles
All these palatial estates are open to the public
Edsel Ford's home is a 60-room, 20,000-square-foot masterpiece on Michigan's Gold Coast
'Iolani Palace is the only former official residence of a reigning monarch on U.S. soil
(CNN)
For a country that ditched monarchical rule, America has some of the most intriguing "castles" in the world.
OK, maybe not castles in the classic sense.
To visit a fortress where ancient monarchs slept on stone pillows and knights bickered about grails, you'll still have to fly across the pond.
But for a different sort of castle -- the kind redefined by Gilded Age names such as Vanderbilt and Ringling, by proud Polynesian monarchs or by the occasional heartbroken Latvian-Floridian stonemason -- the United States is home to a melting pot of historic domiciles that would blow an 11th-century Scottish king's mind.
Here we crown seven favorites whose gates are open to gaping plebeians.
King of Cottages: The Breakers (Newport, Rhode Island)
Story: In 1893 Cornelius Vanderbilt II, heir to the New York Central Railroad, commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to design this palatial summer home inspired by 16th-century Genoan palazzos.
The largest and grandest of Newport's famous "cottages" (colossal leisure homes erected by America's turn-of-the-century baron class), the Breakers was created in just a few years by a team of 2,500 craftsmen from around the world.
Specs: Located on a 13-acre cliff-side estate overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, the 70-room house covers 126,000 square feet from attic to basement to mezzanine.
Standout rooms include a 22-carat gold-leaf-adorned Great Hall stretching 50 feet in every direction (including overhead) and a two-story, alabaster-columned dining room featuring enormous Baccarat crystal chandeliers and a table for 32.
Stopping by: Now in the hands of the Preservation Society of Newport County, the Breakers is one of the five most-visited homes in the country. One-hour audio tours cover about 20 rooms on the first and second floors.
The Breakers , 44 Ochre Point, Newport, Rhode Island; +1 401 847 1000; admission $19.50
Biltmore: ultimate expression of sibling rivalry
Little Brother Complex: Biltmore (Asheville, North Carolina)
Story: George Washington Vanderbilt II clearly had bigger ideas than simply one-upping older sibling Cornelius (of the Breakers) with this massive, 1890s French chateau plunked on the edge of North Carolina's Smoky Mountains.
But when you use the same architect to dwarf your big brother's Newport fortress, there's probably some family competition etched into the blueprints.
Specs: America's largest privately owned residence occupies 175,000 square feet (or more than four acres) of floor space -- with 250 rooms, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces, three kitchens, an indoor swimming pool, gymnasium and a bowling alley in the basement.
Estate holdings include original Renoir paintings, Napoleon's chess set, a 25,000-volume library and a pair of John Singer Sargent portraits of the Hunt and Biltmore landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, the man behind New York's Central Park.
Stopping by: The 8,000-acre estate receives more than a million annual guests.
Five specialty tours of the house include a "behind the scenes" glimpse at some of its lesser-visited areas -- including the butler's pantry and Biltmore's catacomb-like sub-basement. Private bus rides through the property are also available.
Biltmore , One Lodge St., Asheville, North Carolina; +1 800 411 3812; admission varies seasonally from $44 to $69
Forlorn Fortress: Coral Castle (Miami)
Story: Heartbroken 26-year-old Edward Leedskalnin would never love another woman after 16-year-old Agnes Scuffs broke off their engagement a day before their wedding.
Over the next 28 years, the eccentric Latvian-American artisan would -- as a testimony to lost love, it's been said -- dedicate his life to single-handedly sculpting a massive castellated compound comprised of locally harvested coral rock.
Now on the National Register of Historic Places, the place has been called "America's Stonehenge" and still leaves engineers wondering how a short, 100-pound fellow with a fourth grade education did all this using homemade hand tools and unrequited love.
Spect: Within its eight-foot-high, three-foot-thick walls, Coral Castle uses approximately 1,100 tons of coral rock -- including a stone sculpture garden with Flintstones-style furniture (500-pound rocking chairs that work), a nine-ton gate that moves with ease and a home-carved Polaris telescope.
Stopping by: Just north of Homestead in South Miami, the Coral Castle Museum is open every day, with audio stands that broadcast in several languages and guided tours also available.
Coral Castle , 28655 South Dixie Highway, Miami; +1 305 248 6345; admission $15
Edsel Ford's crib: still running smoothly.
Auto Heir's Opus: Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House (Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan)
Story: Edsel Ford, lone son of auto titan Henry, would become president of Ford Motor Company by age 25, posing him the challenge of living up to his father's hulking legacy while setting his own bar over the next quarter century.
In addition to legendary cars like the Lincoln Continental, Edsel would build an English Cotsworld-style family estate that -- for sheer style, taste and grandeur -- tops dad's Fair Lane digs in nearby Dearborn.
Specs: A bold blend of classic European and modern (1930s) styles, the 60-room, 20,000-square-foot house designed by famed architect Albert Kahn is set on 87 lakefront acres in the heart of southeast Michigan's Gold Coast.
An extensive collection of art, period furniture and antiquities includes two Cezanne oil paintings, an original Diego Rivera and stained-glass window medallions dating to the 14th century.
Stopping by: Standard 50-minute guided tours explore the home's major rooms, including the English-baronial-style gallery and a contrasting art deco room done by eminent industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague.
Behind-the-scenes and special interest tours delve deeper into the property and its stunning grounds.
Edsel &amp; Eleanor Ford House , 1100 Lake Shore Road, Grosse Pointe Shores, MI; +1 313 884 4222; admission to all areas $15
California Headliner: Hearst Castle (San Simeon, California)
Story: Hearst Castle's predecessor was Camp Hill, a tract of ranchland on the central California coast acquired by 19th-century mining magnate George Hearst for family campouts.
After inheriting the property in 1919, George's son -- newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst -- reportedly told noted architect Julia Morgan, "We're tired of camping out in the open ... I would like to build a little something."
Specs: More than 28 years and 80,000 square feet later, the estate boasted the 115-room Casa Grande and three Mediterranean Revival-style guesthouses, with 27 acres of gardens.
Borrowing from just about every classic European style, castle highlights include the spectacular Neptune pool, an indescribably ornate main library (one of two on the property), Mr. Hearst's private Gothic suite and one of the world's most extensive (and manically collected) stashes of art and artifacts.
Stopping by: Now a California State Park, the property offers four separate tours covering various floors of Casa Grande and the areas of the estate.
A special Evening Tour (spring and fall only) lets visitors experience the mansion at twilight while docents play out the roles of 1930s houseguests and staff.
Hearst Castle , 750 Hearst Castle Road, San Simeon, California; +1 800 444 4445; admissions start at $25
Ca' d'Zan: three rings of entertainment? Try 56 rooms.
Greatest Showpiece on Earth: Ca' d'Zan (Sarasota, Florida)
Story: Inspired by their favorite Tuscan villas and Venetian palaces, circus tycoon John Ringling and his wife, Mable, built a 1920s Mediterranean Revival-style dream home that would become known as "the last of the Gilded Age mansions" -- and the best place for a Gatsby-style party in southwest Florida.
Falling into state hands (and some neglect) after Ringling's death in 1936, the huge waterfront mansion overlooking Sarasota Bay entered its second heyday with a recent $15 million restoration effort.
Specs: The 36,000-square-foot, five-story (plus full basement) property totals 56 rooms, including 15 bathrooms.
It's adorned with Gothic arches, Mexican onyx columns, priceless 17th-century tapestries and a custom-made 1892 Steinway piano in the two-story great court, dolloped with an 81-foot Belvedere tower.
Stopping by: Docent-led tours of the mansion's main living space and a special Private Places tour through less frequented areas run daily.
After the house tour, you can see the estate's famous art museum, which houses one of the nation's finest collections of 17-century Baroque works.
Ca' d'Zan , 5401 Bay Shore Road, Sarasota, Florida; +1 941 359 5700; admission $25
Yes, we've got thrones, too. ('Iolani Palace)
Royal Relic: 'Iolani Palace (Honolulu)
Story: The only former official residence of a reigning monarch on U.S. soil, 'Iolani Palace was Hawaii's grandest symbol when it was completed in 1882.
Occupied by Hawaii's last two monarchs before American annexation, the palace would subsequently be used as a Red Cross dressing station and the state's first capitol building.
Today, the National Historic Landmark is a museum open to the public.
Specs: Filled with imported furnishings, royal gifts and art from around the world, the 34,104-square-foot royal abode featured late-19th-century technological luxuries like electric lighting (installed in 1887, four years before the White House) and telephones.
Highlights include the Grand Hall, lined with portraits of Hawaiian monarchs, the crimson-gold Throne Rome where King Kalakaua hosted grand balls and state dinners, and the Blue Room, which features a giant portrait of King Louis Philippe of France received in 1848.
Stopping by: Docent-led and guided audio tours let guests explore 'Iolani Palace's first and second floors.
Guests can peruse Hawaiian regalia exhibits in the basement gallery and explore the spacious grounds, which include the old royal barracks and Coronation Pavilion where Kalakaua was crowned king in 1883.
'Iolani Palace , 364 S. King St., Honolulu; +1 808 522 0822; guided tours $21.75, self-led tours $14.75

        <title>How to be a New Yorker: 11 tips for faking it</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/g8bG8PENi4Y/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Resist urge to break into that Frank Sinatra song. Then read this list
Know when to take a cab and when to take the subway
Don't look up -- ever
Don't fawn over celebs, except for one
(CNN)
New York: It's the city that gave the world Martin Scorsese, the Ramones and proper bagels (thanks, local tap water).
While most visitors will never experience all its boroughs -- indeed, they'll likely fail to go south of Houston Street -- there are certain characteristics that will land you in good stead from Chelsea to Coney Island, or at least stop New Yorkers from urging you to get on your tractor and ride back to Iowa.
Memorize them and begin your deception.
1. A New Yorker doesn't necessarily come from Manhattan
Thanks to Woody Allen, the world sees all New Yorkers as apartment-dwelling self-obsessives who are unable to operate automobiles.
Nonsense!
While the Woodman offers eerily accurate portraits of Manhattan -- and certain chunks of Brooklyn -- the other boroughs have their own unique character, including neighborhoods full of single family homes with yards and readily available free parking.
That said, since as a tourist you won't come anywhere near these areas unless you fall asleep on the subway ...
2. For your purposes, a New Yorker is from Manhattan
It's a world of skyscrapers and parking garages that cost as much as an Ivy League education, with the result that while automobiles are virtual necessities in the rest of the United States, a New Yorker casually revealing that he owns two cars is a display of wealth akin to taking a Faberge egg from your pocket and making it into an omelet.
Returning to the skyscrapers ...
3. A New Yorker never looks up
"King Kong" is highly unrealistic. Not because of the ape climbing the Empire State Building, but the fact that New Yorkers noticed.
"You guys from Iowa or Idaho?"
New Yorkers do not look up. Ever.
Most of us are deeply proud of our skyline, but haven't actually looked at it since a second grade class trip to the Statue of Liberty.
Why don't New Yorkers look up? Because ...
4. A New Yorker never stops moving forward
Tourists find New York a place of endless wonder (Times Square in particular seems to enchant them), to the point that sometimes they're walking along and they just need to freeze right in the middle of the sidewalk and take a photo of Guy Fieri's restaurant.
Worse, they're strolling through Grand Central Station and notice that the ceiling has stars painted on it!
This makes actual New Yorkers apoplectic, for...
5. A New Yorker is always rushing to catch a subway or a bus or a train
The vast majority of New Yorkers rely on the vagaries of public transportation and they know when the subway doors close just as you arrive it may mean you get the next one in two minutes or that you never see home again.
This is worst-case scenario, but with track construction and train re-routings and the dreaded "Police are investigating a crime at the 59th and Lexington Station" announcement, best not to risk it.
Because if there's a subway standstill and you're not near a bus route, you have to take a cab and ...
Many New Yorkers have refined needs.
6. A New Yorker doesn't take cabs
Exceptions to this rule: someone's had so much to drink they can't remember their subway line or you live in Queens and need to get to LaGuardia Airport.
Even expense accounts or unspeakable personal riches don't justify cabs, as by then you should have graduated to a town car. Which brings us back to the subway ...
7. A New Yorker knows subway etiquette
If you see someone having trouble standing because of age, injury or an infant, give them your seat.
That said, if the 64-year-old woman who still trains for marathons every weekend feels like being on her feet, do not think chivalry compels you to forcibly bench her.
Also, if a subway car pulls up and you notice two-thirds of it is packed and the last third is empty, everyone's not too stupid to walk to the end: they just smell something you don't yet. If you're not prepared to brave the stench, save yourself the embarrassment and stay with the crowd.
Since you're already saving by taking the subway ...
Someone hand this man a giant beverage.
8. A New Yorker sees no shame in 99-cent pizza
While every New Yorker has their favorite pizza place -- often, they have a favorite for each borough, such as Grimaldi's in Brooklyn or Sac's in Queens -- it's also accepted that city life is both costly and rushed. As a result, grabbing a slice from 2 Bros or one of NYC's other dollar vendors is perfectly acceptable.
Unless it's Papa John's (the line has to be drawn somewhere). One final financial tip ...
9. A New Yorker knows not to rent a car in New York
Things in New York tend to be pricey, so you'll feel ripped off, then you're smacked with the state's brutal 19.875% special sales tax rate on rental cars.
Yes, New York actually sort of justifies the gouge by implying, "Hey, actual New Yorkers aren't stupid enough to pay this."
The result is finding yourself stuck in rush hour wondering if it would have been cheaper just to buy a vehicle.
More reasonable rentals can be had by taking Metro-North to Connecticut or NJ Transit to New Jersey. New Jersey is, of course, the home to New York's two confusingly named NFL teams, which leads us to ...
10. A New Yorker understands the implications of rooting for the Giants/Yankees versus the Jets/Mets
In the last 25 years, the Giants have won three Super Bowls and the Yankees five World Series. The Jets and Mets combined for zero titles, with most seasons more grim than glorious.
To compensate, the Jets/Mets have done their best to provide off-field entertainment, like Jet Coach Rex Ryan making foot-fetish videos with his wife and then-Met outfielder Vince Coleman lobbing firecrackers at fans.
Ask yourself: "Would I rather gloat or complain?" then pick your teams accordingly.
And should you happen to meet Jet QB/butt-fumbler extraordinaire Mark Sanchez ...
Give him a hug, he won't mind.
11. A New Yorker views celebrities as regular folk, only worse
Whereas in other cities commoners fawn over the beautiful people, New Yorkers show their respect by going out of their way to let them know that they may have put out some OK songs with Led Zeppelin, but that doesn't give them the right to take two seats at the bar, Robert Plant.
So, if you see someone you recognize from TV, don't be intimidated: just march right up and demand to know what possessed them to make "The Love Guru."
Unless the celeb is Woody Allen, in which case give him a hug and a wet kiss. (Don't worry, he loves it.)
Follow these tips and you'll be passing yourself off as a local in no time.
And even if you fail, remember: A tourist in New York is still better than a local in Boston.
