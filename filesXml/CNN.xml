The McComb family is not giving up hope.
Laura and Jonathan McComb and their two children were at a cabin in Wimberley, Texas, on Saturday night when the skies opened, dumping record-breaking rains. Water soon swept the house downstream. Jonathan McComb was found, but the whereabouts of his wife and children remain a mystery.
"We never lose hope," said his father, Joe McComb. "But I think reality is setting in that there is probably a good chance that it might not be the outcome we're hoping for. But you never give up hope."
He said he suspects a loose tree fell and knocked his family's cabin off its pilings, eventually causing it to be swept downriver.

"I don't know how many miles downriver ... the house went," Joe McComb said. "When the bridge hit the house, it took the top part of the house off. That's when all the family members got scattered."
As the house was moving, Laura McComb called her sister, Julie Shields.
"A little after 1 o'clock in the morning, she called me and said: 'I just want you to know the ceiling has caved in, and the house is floating down the water, and tell Mom and Dad that I love them. I love you, and pray,' " Shields told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360."
She described her sister as a good wife, a loving mother and as someone who is loved.
At least 26 people have died as a result of the storms that have ravaged parts of Texas, Oklahoma and northern Mexico since the weekend. At least 15 people are still missing, including 13 in Hays County, not far from the Texas capital of Austin.
Houston hammed by rain
More than 11 inches of rain fell in some spots of Houston overnight into Tuesday -- inundating byways and highways, slowing first responders, knocking out power and generally bringing the southeast Texas metropolis to a standstill.
According to the authorities in Houston, five people died and at least two more are missing.
Want to help victims?
"We got hammered," Houston Emergency Management Coordinator Rick Flanagan told CNN's "New Day," echoing sentiments by many others in the region in recent days. "We had cars that were stranded, mobility was stopped ... signals didn't work. It was just a madhouse."
It still is. While the sun appeared Tuesday, more rain remains possible. And even though some parts of Houston were "high and dry," others were not, Mayor Annise Parker said.
"The sun is shining out here right now and the city is slowly getting back to normal, but this is a little bit of a situation of a tale of two cities. Much of Houston was unaffected by the weather, but the parts that were affected by the weather were very severely hit," she told reporters.
Underpasses, patches of highways and areas near waterways such as the San Jacinto River, Cypress Creek and Buffalo Bayou, already strained by weeks of heavy rain, remain inundated.
"The defining feature of Houston is the small rivers that run through the city," Parker said. "Many of them went over their banks and began to flood neighborhoods."
The result of the flash floods and river overruns is "lots and lots of abandoned cars" and large pools of standing water, making for a logistical and traffic nightmare in the nation's fourth most populated city.
The mayor said that as many as 4,000 properties in Houston may have suffered "significant damage," although the assessment is complicated by all the water.

"We've seen flooding before, but not nearly to this extreme," said Gage Mueller, a Houston resident for the past 40 years and a Houston Rockets employee who stayed overnight at the Toyota Center because it wasn't safe to go home. "It rains and it rains and it rains, and there's really nowhere for the water to go. ... It's ridiculous."

The nightmare in Houston echoes that in other communities in Texas, Oklahoma and northern Mexico in recent days -- all from the same deadly, powerful, persistent storm system.  And it's not over.
In Mexico, the epicenter for this severe weather has been the border city of Ciudad Acua, where a tornado killed 13 people. Acua is across the Rio Grande from Del Rio, Texas, about 155 miles west of San Antonio.

In the United States, it's been Hays County, where up to 400 homes washed away this weekend.
The Blanco River there surged from 5 feet to over 40 feet -- which is more than three times its flood stage --  in less than two hours, sending raging waters through communities like Wimberley.
Storm, search continues
The storm moved eastward, bringing rain and more danger to Louisiana and Mississippi. So that meant slightly less rain as the day wore on in Texas, though this reprieve should be short-lived; 2 to 3 more inches of rain could fall as the week wears on.
The problem with this system isn't just the heavy rain -- this is, after all, late May along the Gulf Coast -- but that it's lingered and that it's after weeks of regular, intense precipitation.
"The water is rising very rapidly in certain regions," Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told CNN. "People need to understand the power of this water. It can wipe you away very quickly."
Alyssa Renee Ramirez of Devine, Texas, died after floodwater swept away her car.
Thus, the storm and the threat it poses continues. So, too, does the mourning of families like those of Alyssa Renee Ramirez , a star athlete and student council president at Devine High School who died early Sunday while driving home from her senior prom.
"She had an infectious smile. Anytime you saw her, you couldn't help but smile, no matter what kind of mood you were in," said friend Alyssa Schmidt, who was with Ramirez at the prom. "I remember telling her to be safe and just to have fun."

        <MainBody>Witness: Aurora theater shooting was a 'nightmare' 02:26

"I was like a deer in the headlights. I froze. I wasn't able to process what was going on. So I sat there and stared at it (the shooter)," she said. Avra estimated he was just 20 feet away when a friend pulled her to the ground.
Kevin Quinonez recalled dialing 911 as he crouched behind the seats on top of his girlfriend, trying to protect her.
Prosecutors played his chilling 911 call in court:
Operator: "What is your emergency?"
Sounds of loud gunfire.
Operator: "I can't hear you."
More loud gunshots.
Operator: "I can't hear you. What's your address?"
(Inaudible)
Quinonez and his girlfriend were among the lucky ones who survived.
3. Prescription medicine in Holmes' apartment
While Holmes' defense team has not cross-examined any of the survivors who have taken the witness stand, they did question an Aurora police detective who searched Holmes' apartment.
Detective Thomas Wilson collected several items from the apartment on Paris Street on the day after the shooting.
Wilson seized receipts, a wall hanging, a vehicle title and a backpack, among other evidence -- mostly mundane, everyday items that most college students would have hanging around.
However, there were a couple of items the defense chose to point out, some medications collected from a medicine cabinet in Holmes' bathroom. They included sertraline and clonazepam, both apparently prescribed by an L. Fenton, according to the prescription labels.

"And you recognize that L. Fenton to be the psychiatrist at CU," defense lawyer Katherine Spengler questioned, emphasizing that Holmes had sought mental health help while he was a grad student at the University of Colorado.
"Yes, ma'am," Wilson responded.
Sertraline is typically used for depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks and social anxiety disorder, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Clonazepam may be used to treat seizures, panic disorders and anxiety.
It's unknown exactly why Holmes' had been prescribed these medications. In opening statements, the defense asserted that Holmes lives with schizophrenia.
Dr. Lynne Fenton is expected to testify at some point.
4. Holmes changes his hair color to orange/red
Holmes' rented that apartment for about 14 months, from May 2011 until the shooting in July 2012.
Joan Leslie Holley owns the apartment building and testified that Holmes specifically requested a top-floor apartment. In his application, she said Holmes described himself as "quiet" and "easygoing."
She never had any problems with Holmes and said he always paid his rent on time, sometimes early.

Maryalice Arre would collect the rent checks monthly, in person.
"He was polite, had a soft demeanor," she testified, even when he came in on June 29, 2012, with his appearance changed.
"I remember him walking in and having changed his hair color.... It was an orangey-red and not as neat. It was kind of wild," Arre recalled. "I said, 'James, you changed your hair color!' He just said, 'Oh yeah.' He didn't make a big deal about it."
"Other than the change in hair color did you detect anything different in this guy?" District Attorney George Brauchler asked.
"No," Arre responded.
5. Holmes applied for unemployment
By the time Holmes paid that last month's rent, he had already dropped out of grad school and applied for unemployment benefits.
Lead FBI investigator Jeremy Phelps testified that Holmes filled out an application for benefits on June 14, 2012.
Phelps said Holmes wrote on the application that he had been making $2,166.67 a month, working 40 hours a week as a graduate student at the University of Colorado.
He said he "quit" his work at the university just the day before, according to the application.

Reason given: "pursuing other interests and lack of passion for research topics," Holmes wrote on the application, according to Phelps.
He said Holmes wrote that the duties were "too social" and that he "attempted to change demeanor" but was unable to change his shy personality.
What did Holmes do to help his situation?
"Sought counseling from student mental health center," Phelps read from Holmes' application.
As court wrapped up for the week, prosecutor  Brauchler signaled to the court that Holmes' mental health would be a focus of testimony in the weeks ahead.

Story highlights
Notebook is key piece of evidence in which James Holmes discusses motive, possible methods and wonders about life's meaning
Holmes said he first considered killing people more than 10 years before July 2012 attack
His lawyer focuses on passages in which he talked existentially and how he fought his "divided" self
(CNN)
James Holmes for years thought of how to kill a large number of people, according to a notebook he kept before a 2012 mass killing in a Colorado movie theater.
"The obsession to kill since I was a kid, with age became more and more realistic," he wrote in the notebook, which he sent to a psychiatrist before the assault and which became part of the evidence in Holmes' mass murder trial Tuesday.
The book is seen as a key piece of evidence. Prosecutors are trying to prove Holmes meticulously planned his crime, while the defense has said he was having a psychotic episode when he opened fire at the premiere of the Batman movie "The Dark Knight Rises."
Aurora Police Sgt. Matthew Fyles read excerpts from the notebook on Tuesday, some of the words describing how Holmes listed pros and cons of several different types of attacks and venues.
"The obsession to kill since I was a kid, with age became more and more realistic," Colorado theater shooting suspect James Holmes wrote in a notebook.
He ruled out striking an airport because he didn't want people to think he was a terrorist.
"Terrorism isn't the message," he wrote. "The message is, there is no message."
Holmes wrote that people would erroneously believe the failures with women or with jobs led to the July 20, 2012, rampage that took the lives of a dozen people and wounded scores more.
"Both (failures) were expediting catalysts, not the reason. The causation being my state of mind for the past 15 years," he wrote.
Holmes, 27, a former doctoral student in neuroscience, is standing trial on charges of capital murder and other offenses. He is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 more. He faces 165 counts. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty.

While the prosecution had Fyles talk about the plans for the attack in the notebook, the defense focused Tuesday on Holmes' existential thoughts and questions. He asked about the meaning of life and the meaning of death, and at other times he wrote the question "Why?" over and over.
In one part of the notes, Holmes talks about his "divided" self.
"The real me is fighting the biological me," he wrote.
He said the first obsession with killing came more than 10 years before, then he discussed how he fought his thoughts with no success.
"So anyways, that's my mind. It is broken. I tied to fix it. I made it my sole conviction but using something that's broken to fix itself proved insurmountable," he wrote.
Holmes used the notebook to discuss the different ways to kill.
He first wrote of fantasizing about using nuclear bombs or a biological agent.
"Most recently (I considered) serial murder via a cellphone, stun gun and folding knife at national forests," he wrote.
Holmes decided instead on an attack at a mass gathering despite knowing there was a "99 percent" chance he would be caught.
In the notebook, Holmes diagrammed the individual theaters and even noted that a police station was just three minutes away. Holmes apparently visited the theater two weeks before the night of the shootings, a detective testified in 2013.
Holmes listed three options on how to conduct the shooting, when to begin the attack and weighed the possibilities.  Holmes considered theaters 12, 10 and the theater he ended up in, 9.
Fyles said the notebook began on Page 27 and is 29 pages long.
The notebook was initially addressed to his mom, dad and sister, but he eventually sent it to his University of Colorado psychiatrist, Dr. Lynne Fenton.
CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.

"I hope that there is not a slowdown and what kind of message that sends to the community and to the government if that's the case," Batts said.
The numbers are up, Batts said, because "multiple people" have been "shot in groupings ... leading us to believe there is a gang nexus to the shootings that have taken place."
'We can't tolerate this'
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake found the trend distressing and said additional police would be sent to communities with the most crime.
The mayor held an emergency meeting Sunday with police commissioner and command staff to address escalating violence, the station reported.
"We can't tolerate this ... on any level," the mayor said, according to the outlet. "My hope is the police will have the support they need from the community to be able to get some answers and bring some of these individual(s) to justice."
Police Commissioner Batts said getting answers and community help won't be easy, the station reported.
"We can't demand that of citizens. We have to go out and earn their trust," Batts said, according to the affiliate.
'Tragedy unfolding in our backyard'
Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of NAACP, said the community and the police need to work together to reduce the violence. The NAACP, a civil rights group, is headquartered in Baltimore.
"Well, this is a tragedy unfolding in our backyard, the hometown of the NAACP," Brooks said. "We don't know why we see this horrific spike in murders and shootings.
"There is no excuse, none whatsoever for any kind of slow down or work stoppage," Brooks said. "The officers have taken an oath, and that oath is not to be abdicated."

But CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said officers may be thinking twice about taking risks and showing aggressive policing in the wake of prosecutors filing charges against so many officers in the Gray case.
"These are legitimate concerns that the police have of being backed, trying to stop these murders that are in the streets," said Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director.
He also urged the community and police to engage in a discussion about public safety.
"This is a crisis that's being manufactured, I think, by the fact the community is not supporting the police," Fuentes said.
Overall this year, police report that Baltimore's homicides amount to 108 so far this year, compared with 79 at the end of May 2014, police figures show. There have also been 205 nonfatal shootings so far this year, compared with last year's figure of 115, the affiliate said.
CNN's Wesley Bruer and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.

RELATED: Judge considers 'rolling' release of Hillary Clinton emails
The lawyer noted that the State Department had already produced 296 emails responsive to the House Select Committee on Benghazi on May 22.
"The department will strive to produce as many documents as possible on each production date, and will file a status report one week after each production to inform the court of the number of pages posted," the filing said.
Mizer wrote that the department is "keenly aware of the intense public interest" in the documents and is "committed to reallocating further resources to accommodate the additional effort required by rolling productions so that it can still complete the production on or before the department's initial proposed deadline of January 15, 2016."
Last week, federal Judge Rudolph Contreras, of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, asked the government to propose a schedule involving the release of documents on a rolling basis. Contreras is hearing a Freedom of Information lawsuit brought by journalist Jason Leopold of Vice News.

Leopold's lawyer, Ryan James, issued a statement on Tuesday night praising the June 30 date, but not the 60 day break between releases.

In an interview, he said he would file a response Tuesday night seeking the rolling production every two weeks beginning June 30, 2015, and ending no later than January 31, 2016, "to ensure as much information as possible is accessible to the public as quickly as possible, and before caucusing begins February 1, 2016."
The court will take the orders under consideration.

What's wrong with the Iraqi army?

Iraqis refute 'will to fight' condemnation 02:54
Story highlights
Experts: Building the Iraqi army from scratch created a host of challenges that affect the army today
Sunni, Shia divides and a lack of a clear goal is a problem for Iraqi troops, experts say
(CNN)
In the United States, servicemen and women learn the Soldier's Creed during basic training. It's simple and direct, and makes clear a warrior's cardinal sin in one line: "I will never quit."
Other modern armies have similar statements of faith. The idea of dropping weapons and running away from an enemy tends to shock.
Defense Secretary Ash Carter told CNN that the Iraqi army showed "no will" to fight . To some, his words suggested weakness and cowardice.
But a number of scholars and military experts say the problem with the Iraqi military is far more complex.
Starting from scratch
Think about what it would be like to fire every senior employee at a company and leave the interns in charge.
In 2003, Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling was in Baghdad. He was meeting with Iraqi counterparts when his assistant passed him a note. It said that then-President Bush's envoy to Iraq Paul Bremer had announced that the Iraqi army would be dissolved.
Those with any experience were out, and so, too, were those in civil service. The idea was to get rid of anyone with a government job who belonged to Saddam Hussein's Baath Party.
That meant thousands of people. Most Iraqis people joined the party just to get on in life -- there was just no other way for many. They pledged their loyalty even if they didn't truly mean it just to have a job, to feed their families. Party affiliation didn't necessarily mean a person was loyal to Saddam or did bad things in his name.
Ultimately, firing all military members meant throwing away what had been a highly capable professional military, one that predated Saddam.
The dominoes began to fall.
"That was at least part of the insurgency we started seeing in 2003 and 2004 -- many of the people we started fighting were disgruntled former fighters who knew how to plant bombs and fire weapons," Hertling said.
Firing all the Baathists made rebuilding Iraq very hard, he said.
"We were trying to build schools and couldn't hire teachers because they were members of the Baathist party," he said.
Electrical workers, water system professionals -- you name it -- they weren't eligible for employment. Day to day life was a chore and distrust of the U.S. and its allies mounted.
Playing Sunnis against Shiites
Military recruitment has been a challenge. U.S. troops had to start with the basics. They were trying to teach young Iraqi men to aim, Hertling recalled, a new concept for many who had traditionally employed the "pray and spray" technique -- sticking a rifle on a berm and firing randomly.
While fresh recruits were learning to be professional soldiers, leadership had to be drawn in also. But Hertling and Mansoor said their effort was undercut beginning in 2006 when Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite, was sworn in as prime minister. Al-Maliki set about replacing Sunni commanders with Shiites loyal to his government, they said.
"You lose all trust in the leadership," said Hertling. "That is extremely difficult to rebuild."
"I think they (Iraqi soldiers) are confused about what they are fighting for," said Marina Ottaway, a senior scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center's Middle East Program. "You can be well trained and have the equipment you need and it doesn't matter if you aren't clear what your goal is."
If you're a Sunni and you've seen the kind of favoritism of the al-Maliki government, why would you trust that the new government of Haider al-Abadi, also Shiite, won't fill military posts with political appointees from his own ethnic background?
"A lot of Sunnis aren't convinced that ISIS is worse than the government," Ottaway said. "You shouldn't underestimate the resentment among Sunnis toward Baghdad."
On their own
Shortly before American troops withdrew, top officials praised the Iraqi military's prowess. Then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta spoke about "sustained progress" in December 2011 in Baghdad.
"The Iraqi army and police have been rebuilt and they are capable of responding to threats; violence levels are down; al Qaeda has been weakened; the rule of law has been strengthened; educational opportunities have been expanded; and economic growth is expanding, as well," he said at the time.
But Col. Peter Mansoor, the founding director of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Center, worried at the time. There was no institutional foundation for creating solid soldiers down the road, no way to foster new generations of troops. Iraq had no West Point, no ROTC program, no Pentagon.
Iraq "really could have used military advisers well past 2011," Mansoor told CNN Tuesday. "They could have kept check."
A battlefield leadership vacuum
As part of his anti-ISIS strategy, President Barack Obama has ordered hundreds of military advisers to the region.
The hope is that will offer some professional direction, but experts believe leadership must come from within the Iraqi community.
"Why do soldiers fight? They join because they believe in a higher cause -- protecting religion, their nation, defending against a foreign nation," Mansoor said. "But why do soldier stay and fight? Soldiers aren't individuals. They are part of a unit. And that unit is led by a commander. If they don't trust their commander ... if there is no leadership, there is nothing."
It's still unknown if and how commanders are being held responsible for troops refusing to fight ISIS in Ramadi .
When no one is looking
By the summer of 2014, Maliki's grip on power was coming loose. There was a new enemy in Iraq and as ruthless as al Qaeda -- the Islamic State seemed to have developed its strategy from a slasher flick.
When Mosul fell to ISIS in 2014, it was not because ISIS outnumbered Iraqi troops. The troops just dropped their guns and split -- a move that seemed to initially puzzle just about everyone.
It became clear by the end of last year, however, that the troops the U.S. trained had more severe problems than imagined.
Al-Abadi announced that he had discovered at least 50,000 "ghost soldiers" -- members of the armed forces who pay off their commanders with a portion of their salaries so they don't have to man their posts. Fake names turned up on military rolls, he told Parliament.
The prime minister promised a deeper investigation, and said he expects more bogus names will be found.

Sen. Rand Paul is standing by his opposition to the National Security Agency's bulk collection of phone data, saying his position is "about protecting us against systemic bias."
"It's not about the President. It's not about members of my party. It's about the law," the Kentucky Republican said Tuesday night.
His comments came during a brief speech at the Strand Book Store in New York City, where Paul was signing copies of his newly released third book, "Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America."

        <MainBody>What NOT to do in a snowstorm
(CNN)
Texas and Oklahoma are praying for a respite following four days of epic rainfall that has killed 14 people. Another 13 people died in Ciudad Acua, Mexico, when a ferocious tornado ripped through the border town of 180,000.
And after what must have been a hellish Memorial Day weekend for some Texans and Oklahomans, forecasters say the nasty weather -- which left streets in Houston flooded, bayous cresting and tens of thousands of residents without power -- is en route to Louisiana. There, it could dump as much as a half-foot of rain on the southern and central portions of the state.
"This continues to be an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation," the National Weather Service said.

        <MainBody>13 killed as tornado rips Mexican border city
Ramirez is one of more than 25 people in two countries killed by the same storm system.
Thirteen of those deaths happened in Ciudad Acua, Mexico , a historic border city best known internationally as the setting for Robert Rodriguez's films "El Mariachi" and "Desperado," and George Strait's song "Blame it on Mexico."
While rain and flooding were to blame for the four confirmed deaths in Oklahoma and two in Texas, it was a rare tornado that caused the most havoc in Acua. Three children were among the dead, said Mayor Evaristo Lenin Perez, and another 200 people were injured.

Photos from the scene, which sits right across the border from Del Rio, Texas, showed cars blown upright and leaning against homes. The twister flipped over school buses and damaged about 400 homes.
One resident, walking around the damaged area, said he saw part of a car that had been tossed to the summit of a hill.
"You can also see another truck that was flung by the wind into the side of the hill," Homero Iracheta said.
Firefighter among four killed in Oklahoma
Seven of the 13 U.S. deaths happened in Texas, including Alyssa Ramirez, officials said.
Those are in addition to six deaths in Oklahoma, including a 37-year-old man in Sapulpa and a woman in Tulsa, who died after her car hydroplaned Saturday.
In Claremore, a firefighter got swept into a storm drain while attempting a high-water rescue Sunday.
And in Blue, a tiny Oklahoma community about 10 miles east of Durant, Sandra Callicoat Swinney, 48, died when a tornado touched down and tore apart her mobile home, Bryan County Chief Investigator Nathan Calloway told CNN affiliate KXII .
"We all wish that we could report that there were no injuries, and especially no fatalities," Calloway said.
Unfortunately, that wasn't true in Calloway's native Oklahoma, in neighboring Texas or northern Mexico.
'Pure love and happiness'
Before she headed to prom his past weekend, Ramirez spent time hanging out with friends as they flipped through their yearbooks, reminisced about their four years in high school together and laughed.
"That was always what you got with her, was just pure love and happiness," Schmidt said.
Roberta Ramirez says her family is still trying to make sense of the fact that her niece won't be able to pursue her passions, though she hopes that Alyssa's friends continue to follow their own as they mourn.
"The best way to honor her and others that have died in these terrible storms," Roberta Ramirez said, "is to do their best they can and live their own dreams."

Washington (CNN)
Presidential candidate Rand Paul has christened himself a different kind of Republican, and now he's embracing a unique moniker: tree hugger.
In a new book released on Tuesday, Paul said he composts and believes in clean air and clean water. Paul notes that he has planted giant sequoias in his yard and repurposed old trees used for a fort to build compost bins.
"None of this is at odds with wanting out government to be smaller, with wanting our regulatory bodies to protect both our land and water," Paul wrote in his third book, "Taking a Stand: Moving beyond partisan politics to unite America."

George Steinmetz photographs beautiful landscapes from his motorized paraglider
His love for desert regions started in the 1980s while hitchhiking in the Sahara
(CNN)
Several years ago, in Gadhafi-controlled Libya, George Steinmetz found himself hidden in a kind of "safe house" where he was assembling his personal aircraft.
The secrecy surrounding his unusual trip had nothing to do with international intrigue or espionage. Steinmetz was simply trying to get a look at the landscape in a very different way.
You see, Steinmetz -- a professional photographer -- captures stunning images of the world from a unique perspective: up.
Way up, in fact, flying hundreds of feet high in a portable, motorized paraglider.
"In a lot of countries it's impossible to get permission," Steinmetz said. But his aircraft is so small and lightweight, he doesn't need airfields to land and take off. That lets him keep a low profile.
"If you're not using an airfield, and you take off early in the morning, by the time they figure out what's going on you've landed and you're gone," he said.
In Libya, Steinmetz hid the flying machine under tarps in the back of a Land Cruiser. "Then we drove into the desert and went flying," he said. "As long as we were in an unpopulated area, we had no problem."
Photographer George Steinmetz
Why Libya? This man loves the desert.
Take a look at his breathtaking aerial images, and you'll feel it. You'll see light dancing off multicolored sand and dust as it stretches across a landscape that sometimes includes mountains and wildlife. From high above, natural patterns on the earth's surface form a fascinating artistic design.
The desert captured Steinmetz' heart in the 1980s, when he hitchhiked through the Sahara as a 20-something college student. The beauty of the region sparked an idea: "Wouldn't it be amazing to see this land from the air?"
In 1997, he purchased a paraglider and began a 15-year, round-the-world odyssey combining photography and aviation.
"I learned to fly just for this project," Steinmetz said. "What I love to do as a photographer is to show people things that they haven't really seen before. And these desert environments from the air, they've never been photographed that way."
What I love to do as a photographer is to show people things that they haven't really seen before.
Photographer George Steinmetz
He started in the African nations of Niger and Chad. Then he took his flying machine to the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in Asia and the Atacama Desert in South America. He finished up the project three or four years ago in a Himalayan region called Ladakh, where arid valley farmers rely on glacial water from nearby mountain peaks.
"One of the more interesting things about desert environments is how people and animals can survive in the very limits of existence, and find very creative ways of finding water and cultivating food in the desert," he said.
Creating spectacular photographs is hard enough. But try doing that while flying a motorized paraglider. Nonetheless, Steinmetz sees himself as "a photographer who flies -- and not a pilot who takes pictures."
His contraption weighs less than 100 pounds. It has no fuselage. No windshield. No wheels. To take off, Steinmetz attached himself to a parachute wing, straps a motor to his back and starts running.
George Steinmetz on his motorized paraglider. "It sounds like a big moped," he said.
"It's not easy," he said. "It's a little bit tricky and it's really quite hectic. It's not like an airplane, where you just push the throttle forward. You have to watch out for your kneecaps."
If all goes well, the parachute wing grabs the wind and he's airborne.
"It's like a big leaf blower with a parachute," Steinmetz joked.
Portable? Yes. The parachute wing folds easily. The motor disassembles into a small package. It's all small enough to check as standard baggage on a commercial aircraft, he said. When you get to your destination, the whole thing assembles in about an hour.
Up in the air, it's not exactly quiet. "It sounds like a big moped," he said.
One of his rules for flying is to stay near a safe landing point at all times, "because the motors are not that reliable." That rule helped Steinmetz avoid a potential disaster over Lake Natron along the Tanzania-Kenya border.
As he flew away from the water's edge, he began to think about the real danger of having to ditch in the lake. "The lake is really rich in a caustic form of soda," he said. "If you land in it, it burns your skin. It's kind of like landing in battery acid."

So he returned to shore.
"I ran out of gas during the landing," he said. "It turned out there was a problem with the carburetor and it was going through fuel three times as fast as normal. If I had stayed out there to take pictures, I would have gotten really messed up.
"Your gut instinct tends to save your butt."
The next day, Steinmetz went up with a small plane and pilot who helped him capture an amazing photo of the brilliant red lake from about 800 feet up. Look closely at the image -- No. 3 in the gallery above -- and you'll see the shadow of the chartered Cessna 206.
Steinmetz has had a few scary flights. But he said desire usually outweighs fear: "Once I get up in the air, sometimes I think, 'What the hell am I doing up here?' Then I remember I have a camera around my neck, so I think, 'If you're going to die, at least die taking a picture!'
"I'll start taking pictures. Then I'll think about pictures instead of the fact that I'm 500 feet above ground with nothing between me and eternity."
He sees the paraglider as just another photographic tool that will help him capture the image he envisions. Now, he's interested in newer technology.
"I just bought a drone," he said. "There are things I can do with drones that I can't do with a paraglider."
But when it comes to exploring, Steinmetz believes in the power of a human photographer being present in the sky.
"It's really about exploring places," he said, "and I love exploring the world from the air."
George Steinmetz is an American photographer based in New Jersey. You can follow him on Facebook and Instagram . His aerial images are part of a project at Expo Milan called "Nine Photographers for the Planet." The other photographers in the exhibition are Gianni Berengo Gardin, Irene Kung, Joel Meyerowitz, Martin Parr, Sebastiao Salgado, Alessandra Sanguinetti, Ferdinando Scianna and Alex Webb.

Diabetes Fast Facts
Updated 0106 GMT (0806 HKT) May 27, 2015
(CNN)
Here's a look at diabetes , a disease that affects millions of people in the United States.
Diabetes is characterized by high levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. The disease can lead to serious complications such as blindness, kidney damage, cardiovascular disease, limb amputations and premature death.
Facts:
Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.
There are several types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes.
Prediabetes occurs when blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Before developing Type 2 diabetes, people almost always have prediabetes. Research has shown that some long-term damage to the body may occur during prediabetes.
Type 1 diabetes develops when the body's immune system destroys pancreatic beta cells, the only cells in the body that make insulin. This form of diabetes usually strikes children and young adults. Only 5-10% of people with diabetes have Type 1. Risk factors for Type 1 diabetes may be autoimmune, genetic, or environmental. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells do not use insulin properly. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and in adults, it accounts for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. It is associated with older age, obesity, family history, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. It is more common in African Americans, Latino Americans, American Indians, and Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, although still rare, is being diagnosed more frequently.
Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance diagnosed during pregnancy. It affects about 4% of all pregnant women. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes doesn't mean that a woman had diabetes before she conceived, or that she will have diabetes after giving birth.
Other types of diabetes result from genetic conditions, surgery, medications, infections and other illnesses. Such types of diabetes account for 1% to 5% of all diagnosed cases.

A federal appeals court handed Texas and 25 other states that oppose President Obama's immigration actions a victory
The Obama administration had asked that they be able to carry forward with the actions during a legal battle
Washington (CNN)
A federal appeals court on Tuesday denied a request from Justice Department lawyers to allow President Barack Obama's controversial immigration actions to go into effect pending appeal.
The decision is a victory for Texas and 25 other states that are challenging the Obama administration's actions, which were blocked by a District Court judge in February. Tuesday's decision means that while the issue is appealed, eligible undocumented immigrants will be unable to apply for the programs aimed at easing deportation threats.
"Because the government is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its appeal of the injunction, we deny the motion for stay and the request to narrow the scope of the injunction," according to the 2-1 decision by a panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Related: What immigration ruling means for Obama
At issue is the implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and the expansion of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program that permits teenagers and young adults who were born outside of the United States, but raised in the country, to apply for protection from deportation and for employment authorizations.
Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman, said the judges in the Fifth Circuit "chose to misinterpret the facts and the law" in their ruling denying the request for a stay.
"President Obama's immigration executive actions are fully consistent with the law," Hoffine said. "The President's actions were designed to bring greater accountability to our broken immigration system, grow the economy, and keep our communities safe."
The White House said Justice Department lawyers are evaluating the ruling and considering next steps.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the ruling, calling it a "victory for those committed to preserving the rule of law in America."
"Telling illegal aliens that they are now lawfully present in this country, and awarding them valuable government benefits, is a drastic change in immigration policy," he said in a statement. "The President's attempt to do this by himself, without a law passed by Congress and without any input from the states, is a remarkable violation of the U.S Constitution and laws."
Pro-immigration reform groups said they were disappointed by the ruling, but not willing to throw in the towel.
"The immigration actions will help our economy, our community and our families. Each day this injunction remains in place we all suffer the consequences," said Karen Tumlin of the National Immigration Law Center.
Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University Law School prof, downplayed the significance of Tuesday's decision.
"The court of appeals merely held that the district court did not err when it held that Texas had standing to sue," he said. "The true test will be on the merits of the case. That could be a few years down the road, after a trial."
And Elizabeth Wydra, of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, who filed a brief on behalf of bipartisan group of former members of Congress, notes the administration could decide the issue is important enough to go straight to the Supreme Court just to get the programs unblocked pending appeal.
"Given the strong public interest in getting DAPA off the ground as soon as possible, the administration will almost certainly go straight to the Supreme Court," she said. "It will file this request with Justice (Antonin) Scalia, the justice assigned to the Fifth Circuit, but he will very likely refer the matter to the entire Court for all of the justices to consider."
U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas blocked the programs in February, holding that the administration had failed to comply with the procedural requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act, a federal statute that sets out rules for the way that federal agencies can establish regulations.
The law provides an avenue of review for an agency's action and requires it to engage in a "notice and comment" procedure before it issues rules.
In court papers, the administration argued that it was not issuing rules, but instead, a "general statement of policy," which is exempt from the "notice and comment" requirement. It said that the Judge Hanen was wrong to grant the states standing -- or the legal right -- to bring the suit.
The opinion was written by Judge Jerry Smith, appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, and joined by Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod, a George W. Bush appointee. Judge Stephen A. Higginson, who was appointed by Obama, dissented.

Story highlights
There is high risk of overdose with flakka, which can lead to violent behavior, hyperthermia and superhuman strength
The chemical in flakka is similar to a key ingredient in "bath salts," which were banned in 2012
Flakka and "bath salts" could be more dangerous than stimulants such as cocaine
(CNN)
It goes by the name flakka. In some parts of the country, it is also called "gravel" because of its white crystal chunks that have been compared to aquarium gravel.
The man-made drug causes a high similar to cocaine. But like " bath salts ," a group of related synthetic drugs that were banned in 2012, flakka has the potential to be much more dangerous than cocaine.
"It's so difficult to control the exact dose [of flakka]," said Jim Hall, a drug abuse epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. "Just a little bit of difference in how much is consumed can be the difference between getting high and dying. It's that critical."
A small overdose of the drug, which can be smoked, injected, snorted or injected, can lead to a range of extreme symptoms: "excited delirium," as experts call it, marked by violent behavior; spikes in body temperature (105 degrees and higher, Hall said); paranoia. Probably what has brought flakka the most attention is that it gives users what feels like the strength and fury of the Incredible Hulk.
Deadly High: How synthetic drugs are killing kids
Flakka stories are starting to pile up. A man in South Florida who broke down the hurricane-proof doors of a police department admitted to being on flakka. A girl in Melbourne, Florida, ran through the street screaming that she was Satan while on a flakka trip. Authorities in the state are warning people about the dangers of the drug.
Florida seems to be particularly hard hit by flakka overdoses.
Hall said that there are about three or four hospitalizations a day in Broward County in South Florida, and more on weekends. It is unclear why the Sunshine State is a hotbed for flakka abuse; "it's a major question in our community," Hall said.
Cases have also been reported in Alabama, Mississippi and New Jersey.
Flakka, which gets its name from Spanish slang for a beautiful woman ("la flaca"), contains a chemical that is a close cousin to MDPV, a key ingredient in "bath salts." These chemicals bind and thwart molecules on the surface of neurons that normally keep the levels of mood-regulating neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin, in check. The result is to "flood the brain" with these chemicals, Hall said. Cocaine and methamphetamine have similar modes of action in the brain, but the chemicals in flakka have longer-lasting effects, Hall said.
Although a typical flakka high can last one to several hours, it is possible that the neurological effects can be permanent. Not only does the drug sit on neurons, it could also destroy them, Hall said. And because flakka, like bath salts, hang around in the brain for longer than cocaine, the extent of the destruction could be greater.
Another serious, potentially lingering side effect of flakka is the effect on kidneys. The drug can cause muscles to break down, as a result of hyperthermia, taking a toll on kidneys. Experts worry that some survivors of flakka overdoses may be on dialysis for the rest of their life.
Like most synthetic drugs, the bulk of flakka seems to come from China and is either sold over the Internet or through gas stations or other dealers. A dose can go for $3 to $5, which makes it a cheap alternative to cocaine. Dealers often target young and poor people and also try to enlist homeless people to buy and sell, Hall said. These are "people who are already disadvantaged in terms of chronic disease and access to health care," he added.
It is unclear at this point whether flakka is more dangerous than the "bath salts" that came before it. But it does have one advantage over its predecessor: it has not been banned -- yet.
"Flakka largely emerged as a replacement to MDVP [in 'bath salts']," said Lucas Watterson, a postdoctoral researcher at Temple University School of Medicine Center for Substance Abuse Research.
Although the Drug Enforcement Administration has placed a temporary ban on flakka, drug makers can work around this ban, such as by sticking a "not for human consumption" label on the drug, Watterson said. It will probably take several years to get the data necessary to put a federal ban on flakka, he added. And a ban can be effective, at least in discouraging potential users.
"The problem is when one of these drugs is banned or illegal, the drug manufacturer responds by producing a number of different alternatives," Watterson said. "It's sort of a flavor of the month."

        <MainBody>Galapagos volcano eruption threatens rare pink iguana 03:15
Story highlights
Smoke spews six miles into the air
Mountain is home to world's only population of pink iguanas
Park service says tourism not threatened.
(CNN)
Nature erupted in all its glory this week, spitting fire, spewing smoke 6 miles into the air and threatening a species on the islands where Charles Darwin first began to develop the theory of evolution.
Early Monday morning, the Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island -- the highest volcano in the archipelago -- erupted for the first time in 33 years, the Galapagos National Park service said.
The lava glowed orange through the night as it coursed down the mountainside.
World's only pink iguanas
Wolf volcano, which rises more than 5,500 feet above the sea, is home to the world's only population of pink iguanas, whose habitat is now threatened by the eruption. The pink iguanas share the mountain with yellow iguanas and giant tortoises.
The eruption, inspiring in its beauty, has created concern that the ecosystem Darwin studied may be damaged.
Darwin, an English naturalist, arrived in the islands in 1835 at the age of 26. His observations of different species in the archipelago's rich ecosystem led him to develop the theory of natural selection -- one he wrote about, most famously, in the book titled "On the Origin of Species," published in 1859.
The Galapagos Islands straddle the equator 563 miles west of mainland Ecuador, to which they belong.
The park service said the eruption does not, at the moment, pose a threat to tourism.

        <MainBody>Saudi Arabia's military power
Above the South China Sea (CNN)
The Chinese navy issued warnings eight times as a U.S. surveillance plane on Wednesday swooped over islands that Beijing is using to extend its zone of influence.
The series of man-made islands and the massive Chinese military build-up on them have alarmed the Pentagon, which is carrying out the surveillance flights in order to make clear the U.S. does not recognize China's territorial claims. The militarized islands have also alarmed America's regional allies.
Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell told CNN's Erin Burnett Wednesday night that the confrontation indicates there is "absolutely" a risk of the U.S. and China going to war sometime in the future.
READ: China cautions U.S. Navy on patrols
A CNN team was given exclusive access to join in the surveillance flights over the contested waters, which the Pentagon allowed for the first time in order to raise awareness about the challenge posed by the islands and the growing U.S. response.
CNN was aboard the P8-A Poseidon, America's most advanced surveillance and submarine-hunting aircraft, and quickly learned that the Chinese are themselves displeased by the U.S. pushback.
RELATED: Behind the scenes: A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup
"This is the Chinese navy ... This is the Chinese navy ... Please go away ... to avoid misunderstanding," a voice in English crackled through the radio of the aircraft in which CNN was present.
This is the first time the Pentagon has declassified video of China's building activity and audio of Chinese challenges of a U.S. aircraft.
A depiction of where exactly China is building islands out of nothing, 600 miles off the coast of its mainland.

The aircraft flew at 15,000 feet in the air at its lowest point, but the U.S. is considering flying such surveillance missions even closer over the islands, as well as sailing U.S. warships within miles of them, as part of the new, more robust U.S. military posture in the area.
Soon after the Chinese communication was heard, its source appeared on the horizon seemingly out of nowhere: an island made by China some 600 miles from its coastline.
The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims over an area that includes fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. China is increasingly showing that even far from its mainland, it sees itself as having jurisdiction over the body of water.
Wednesday's mission was specifically aimed at monitoring Chinese activities on three islands that months ago were reefs barely peaking above the waves. Now they are massive construction projects that the U.S. fears will soon be fully functioning military installations.
China's alarming creation of entirely new territory in the South China Sea is one part of a broader military push that some fear is intended to challenge U.S. dominance in the region. Beijing is sailing its first aircraft carrier; equipping its nuclear missiles with multiple warheads; developing missiles to destroy us warships; and, now, building military bases far from its shores.
That's exactly what Morell warned may be coming if China continues down its current path. He warned on CNN that "there's a real risk, when you have this kind of confrontation, for something bad happening."
READ: What is a littoral combat ship?
He added that China's aggressive growth hints at a broader trend as the Asian economic superpower continues to expand its influence and strength --one that Morell said could "absolutely" lead to war between the U.S. and China.
"China is a rising power. We're a status quo power. We're the big dog on the block ... They want more influence," he said. "Are we going to move a little bit? Are they going to push? How is that dance going to work out? This is a significant issue for the next President of the United States."
War is "not in their interests, (and) it's not in our interests," Morell acknowledged.
"But absolutely, it's a risk," he said.
"I'm scratching my head like everyone else as to what's the (Chinese) end game here. We have seen increased activity even recently on what appears to be the building of military infrastructure," Capt. Mike Parker, commander of the fleet of P8 and P3 surveillance aircraft deployed to Asia, told CNN aboard the P8.
"We were just challenged 30 minutes ago and the challenge came from the Chinese navy, and I'm highly confident it came from ashore, this facility here," Parker said of the Chinese message for the U.S. plane to move away, as he pointed to an early warning radar station on an expanded Fiery Cross Reef.
In just two years, China has expanded these islands by 2,000 acres -- the equivalent of 1,500 football fields -- and counting, an engineering marvel in waters as deep as 300 feet.

In video filmed by the P8's surveillance cameras, we see that in addition to early warning radar, Fiery Cross Reef is now home to military barracks, a lofty lookout tower and a runway long enough to handle every aircraft in the Chinese military. Some call it China's "unsinkable aircraft carrier."
In a sign of just how valuable China views these islands to be, the new islands are already well protected.
From the cockpit, Lt. Cmdr Matt Newman told CNN, "There's obviously a lot of surface traffic down there: Chinese warships, Chinese coast guard ships. They have air search radars, so there's a pretty good bet they're tracking us."
The proof was loud and clear. The Chinese navy ordered the P8 out of the airspace eight times on this mission alone.
Each time, the American pilots told them calmly and uniformly that the P8 was flying through international airspace.
That answer sometimes frustrated the Chinese radio operator on the other end.
Once he responds with exasperation: "This is the Chinese navy ... You go!"

This is a military-to-military stand-off in the skies, but civilian aircraft can find themselves in the middle.
As was heard on the first of several Chinese warning on the radio, the pilot of a Delta flight in the area spoke on the same frequency, quickly identifying himself as commercial. The voice on the radio then identified himself as "the Chinese Navy" and the Delta flight went on its way.
The more China builds, U.S. commanders told CNN, the more frequently and aggressively the Chinese navy warns away U.S. military aircraft.
Over Fiery Cross Reef and, later, Mischief Reef, fleets of dozens of dredgers could be seen hard at work, sucking sand off the bottom of the sea and blowing it in huge plumes to create new land above the surface, while digging deep harbors below.
"We see this every day," Parker said. "I think they work weekends on this because we see it all the time."

The Book of Numbers:  Is the name a misnomer?
Story highlights
Laura Bernardini likes numbers. The Book of Numbers? That's a different story.
She says Numbers reads like an extension of the many rules found in Leviticus
Laura Bernardini is director of coverage in CNN's Washington bureau. The views expressed in this column belong to Bernardini.
Laura Bernardini
(CNN)
This is week eight of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read week one , week two and week three .
This weekend, I ran a leg of the Vermont City Marathon. I hadn't really trained and didn't want to do it. But I had promised my sister Julia I would run. I had to honor that, even if I wasn't ready.
That is how I feel about Book of Numbers.
Because I promised to read every word of the Bible this year, I am trudging through this book, just as the Israelites wandered the desert waiting to get to the Promise Land. In a way, we're both in the same spot: A little dry, a little dusty, mainly waiting for what's next.
I will stay course, but to be completely honest: The Book of Numbers is boring. I have been pretty unfocused through these first 18 chapters.
For the first time, I have read a page or two less and promised to read the rest the next day. When I do that, it doesn't get better.
I should like Numbers. My previous life at CNN had me producing for John King and helping with the "Magic Wall" during the 2008 and 2012 elections. Census data is my friend. And the numbers given in the first few chapters surprised me (which gave me false hope for the rest).
I had not imagined, for example, that the Israelites numbered into the hundreds of thousands. I had envisioned a few dozen. I hadn't thought about there being that many slaves in Egypt. I also hadn't realized that they waited in the desert as long as they did.
While they waited, apparently, they had a lot of time to make up the rules of their new society -- and that's where my problem with Numbers begins.
The rules that define the Book of Leviticus continued in Numbers, which may have been part of the reason for my boredom -- more of the same. In fact, some chapters are just long lists of rules. Snooze. (Good thing I didn't go to law school, I guess.)
Then there is a lengthy section about the importance of the first-born. As a first-born, I should have cared. Yet, nope.
The clans of the Levites and the Nazerites likewise didn't light up my imagination. I felt bad  for the lepers because they were suffering and "unclean" and were expelled. Then there was the man who gathered wood on the Sabbath and was stoned for doing so, with God's approval.
And when the Israelites become impatient, they complain. A lot. Some even say that slavery in Egypt was better than the desert. Moses and Aaron try to calm the masses. But the masses don't like the message and "the whole community threatened to stone them," the Bible says.
Really? Stone Moses?
Thankfully, God intervenes and calms the crowd, who turn their attention to their next complaint.
As I meditate on the causes of my boredom, it probably stems from the fact that I didn't expect these dense, dull chapters. When I took this project on, my preconceived notion of the Bible was that it was action-packed. It's not. There are lulls.
As with  running marathons, I need to train some more. I need to focus in Numbers and try to make some sense out of this book.

It's official: WTF is in the dictionary. It's short for an informal phrase that starts with "what the ..." and is "used especially to express or describe outraged surprise, recklessness, confusion, or bemusement."
WTF joins emoji, NSFW, net neutrality, clickbait, click fraud, photobomb and other words reflecting modern life among the latest entries in Merriam-Webster's unabridged dictionary . Some 1,700 words have been included, along with 3,200 new examples to add context.
The new entries speak to what's current in the English language today, touching on technology, food, the worldwide food supply and the sharing economy.
In the world of food, we have crema: "a layer of tan creamy froth that forms on the top of freshly made espresso."
And what's not to love about chilaquiles, "a Mexican dish of fried corn tortilla pieces simmered with salsa or mole and typically topped with cheese and other accompaniments"?
Not all the dictionary's additions are that delicious.
There's colony collapse disorder, "a disorder of honeybees (Apis mellifera) that is characterized by sudden colony death due to the disappearance of all adult worker bees in a hive while immature bees, the queen bee and the honey remain and that is of unknown cause."
The collapse of hives is a challenge for worldwide agricultural research, the dictionary entry claims.
Wait a minute, did your boss just notice that you were reading this story instead of working? You're better off looking at this than porn, which is definitely NSFW: "not safe for work."

        <title>Why Democrats should welcome Sanders' move (Opinion)</title>

        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Sen. Bernie Sanders officially launched his presidential campaign Tuesday
Donna Brazile: It's good for Hillary Clinton and democracy to have strong debate on issues
Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of "Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN)
As a rule of thumb, being called a socialist isn't a good thing in American politics. But if you're brave enough to describe yourself that way? Well, that might be enough to take a little bit of the sting out of your opponents' attacks.
That, at least, is what U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont must be hoping. And by describing himself as a "democratic socialist," Sanders is showing a willingness to jump right in and wrestle with some of the big issues facing this country -- and he's doing his party a big favor in the process.
Donna Brazile
Of course, Sanders is actually an independent who caucuses with the Democrats in the U.S. Senate. In that chamber, he has been a champion for the working poor and a fierce protector of the middle class, arguing in favor of collective bargaining rights for working men and women. He has also fought to create jobs and for policies that will spur the sort of economic growth that enables all Americans to succeed.
In Sanders' mind, the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a major piece of the Obama administration's economic agenda -- is not one of those growth policies.
"At a time when our middle class is disappearing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, this anti-worker legislation must be defeated," he said . "If we are serious about rebuilding the middle class and creating the millions of good paying jobs we desperately need, we must fundamentally rewrite our trade policies. NO to fast track, and NO to the TPP."
By pushing back against the party he is so often aligned with, Sanders will force Democratic candidates such as former secretary of state and U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton to more clearly define exactly what their stances are on specific issues. And while that's the last thing any politician truly wants to do, it's something every voter should want.
And the reality is that it's good for Clinton as well as for democracy to have a really strong debate on how to keep America safe and make it stronger, including on issues such as protecting our environment, strengthening the middle class and growing our economy.
One of my good friends who worked with me on the Al Gore campaign is now advising Sanders. While he understands this is an uphill battle, the Clinton campaign cannot take this nomination for granted.
True, Sanders' odds of winning the Democratic nomination are long, to say the least -- the latest polls show Clinton way out in front of any alternative to her . But Sanders won't be the only one working to make sure that the Democratic Party offers voters the kind of debate on the issues that this country needs.
Later this week, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley will join the fray . O'Malley has scheduled a "special announcement" for May 30, and in the world of politics, we all know that announcing the announcement IS the announcement.
But until then, this is Sanders' moment. And the early signs are that despite the long odds, he might be poised to make the most of it.
"I have worked for him for many years, and he is a very serious candidate. We have already seen him break from the pack at the bottom in a number of polls," senior political strategist Tad Devine told me. "In Iowa and New Hampshire, he has moved into the upper double digits in several polls. In Washington State, there were two polls last week where he had moved into the 20s in the Democratic primary. We have raised millions online in the last couple of weeks, and I think we will have the resources to run a real campaign."
Maybe middle class voters are less worried about labels than they are about getting things done. And that starts with a serious discussion of potential solutions.
"The Democratic Party appreciates the contributions that Sen. Sanders, Secretary Clinton and other candidates will make to a healthy dialogue about the future of our party and our nation," DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said last month . "There is a distinct contrast between Democrats who are on the side of middle and working class families and Republicans who are concerned with the very rich and wealthy corporations. Over the next year, the discussions we have during our respective nominating processes will help make that choice clear."
And there will be plenty of discussions to have on many policies: the economy, health care reform, criminal justice reform, immigration and the ISIS threat.
Every time a Democratic candidate, or potential candidate, gets out there in front of the press or engages with voters, they have the chance to talk about real solutions for the very real problems that the American people face each and every day. And while it might feel a little uncomfortable sometimes having to get specific about what you would do if you're elected, voters will appreciate the contrast between serious debate and the kind of character attacks that will be coming from the Republican field.
The American people are starting to notice that one party is more interested in picking a fight rather than fighting on their behalf. Now that the Democratic candidate has become candidates, I think voters will be grateful that they are getting a real choice. And that is good for Democrats' chances in 2016 -- whoever they end up choosing.

        <MainBody>Ali Rezaian: Iran must realize there are penalties 04:07
PLAY VIDEO
With each passing day, Imani grew into a very different woman than her father had hoped she would become.
She knew she could not remain in Iran and hide her liberal and secular beliefs. Her friends scraped together enough money for her to visit one of her sisters who was living in Malaysia. While there, she applied to a university in Kuala Lumpur and was promptly accepted.
But she needed her father's permission to obtain a visa. As expected, her father refused. So she once again implored her oldest brother Mohammed to intervene.
"I told him I had two choices," she recalled. "Leave or commit suicide."
With help from her brother, her father reluctantly agreed -- but he wouldn't support her. She was on her own.
On the day she left, her father reminded her of her promise to marry. He gave her a check for the exact amount for a one-way ticket back to Iran, something Maryam called "a very ayatollah thing to do."
"It was for when I would realize that I made a mistake leaving home, would feel regret and want to get back home," she said.
As her father predicted, life in Kuala Lumpur was hard. She had had everything done for her since birth. Now she had to take care of herself, including learning to shop for groceries.
Her father wouldn't take her calls. But finally, she said, she felt alive. For the first time she was free to think and speak her mind.
READ: Netanyahu: Iran must recognize Israel's right to exist in deal
"I never realized how lonely I was in Iran until I left," she said. "My family believed it was dangerous that I was becoming a different person. But I was not close to the person I was meant to be."
It was a year before she went back to Isfahan for a visit. Her father gave her the cold shoulder for two weeks before they finally reconciled.
After earning a masters degree in Kuala Lumpur, Imani went on to conduct research in Norway, Finland and Portugal and take cultural diplomacy courses in Berlin.
Today Imani is the founder and president of the Oslo-based Centre for Cultural Diplomacy and Development, which promotes democracy and tolerance and offers entrepreneurship programs for women and youth in the Middle East.
Engaging Iranian and Israeli youth
One of the center's flagship programs is the Iran-Israel Friendship Dialogue, engaging youth from both countries in a cultural dialogue, bringing them to meet in countries in the West. She is planning a visit to Israel sometime in the near future, a trip few Iranians have made.
"There are a lot of similarities between Persian and Jewish culture," she said. "I think by working together we can build a future instead of looking into the black holes of the past."
Josh Hantman, a former Israeli diplomat, heard her speak at Harvard last month and welcomed her message.
"I was blown away," he said. "What a fighter."

She hopes to replicate the Israel-Iran program with people from other warring nations.
"I want to help make peace," she said. "If you work with your enemy, they will become your partner."
Mehdi Khalaji, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who met Imani when she was in Washington last month, said her story is all the more unusual for her gender.
"I have heard the stories of many, many people who rebelled against their religious families. But they were the stories of sons, not daughters," said Khalaji, who like Imani has a father who is an ayatollah and who left Iran after adopting a more secular worldview.
"It is the first time I heard someone like her take this position -- leaving not only the family or the city, but the country," he noted. "And she not only left the country geographically, but in terms of her mind-set."
On Wednesday, Imani will deliver her message of coexistence before the Oslo Freedom Forum, a brainstorming session of human rights defenders, Nobel Laureates, scholars and students.
Although he can't show support for her choices, Imani said she knows deep down her father loves her. They still talk, but the conversations are strained. He always begs her to come back and get married.
She still has the check her father gave her when she left home. She says she will never cash it but rather will keep it as a reminder of where she comes from. And how far she has come.

For Jeb Bush , combating Alzheimer's is more than a political issue -- it's a personal endeavor.
Recently the likely presidential candidate has revealed a familial connection with the disease, saying publicly that his mother-in-law, who's 95, suffers from dementia.
"Every time I see her, it's the first time. She's so sweet," he told a voter after an event in Dubuque, Iowa, earlier this month. "She's always excited to meet my wife's new husband."
Bush has certainly known his mother-in-law, Josefina Gallo Esquivel, for a long time. He and his wife, Columba, have been married for 41 years.
"She's a gift from God," he said a few days later, talking about Esquivel. "She's the most beautiful woman I've ever met."

Story highlights
Hillary Clinton is facing new criticism after she omitted a company Bill Clinton has used as a conduit for his consulting work from her financial disclosure.
But it doesn't appear the Democratic presidential frontrunner violated any ethics rules.
Washington (CNN)
Hillary Clinton is facing new criticism of her family's wealth and financial entanglements a week after she released financial records that omitted a company Bill Clinton has used as a conduit for his consulting work.
The former president was personally involved in setting up WJC, LLC, according to state filings obtained by CNN. (WJC are the initials for William Jefferson Clinton). It appears to exist in order to offer Clinton the tax and legal benefits of a limited liability company -- a standard business structure -- even though it had no employees or assets and only functioned as a pass-through for payments for his work.
Hillary Clinton didn't list it in her personal financial disclosure this month, and the company's existence was first reported by The Associated Press on Tuesday and confirmed in documents obtained by CNN.
"President Clinton set up a commonly used mechanism to manage his personal business affairs. All of the income has been reported and is accounted for. Anyone trying to paint this as anything more than that is playing politics," said Angel Urena, Bill Clinton's spokesman, when asked why WJC, LLC was set up.

'They didn't say why:' Gov't phone calls shut down Sudan newspapers
By Don Melvin, CNN
Updated 0004 GMT (0704 HKT) May 27, 2015
Journalists angry about a Sudanese government crackdown on newspapers protest Tuesday outside the National Press Council.
Story highlights
Six newspapers ordered Monday and Tuesday to shut down
HRW: Sudan's rights record "abysmal"
Editor blames coverage of child molestation
(CNN)
The daily meeting Monday at the Al-Khartoum newspaper had just broken up. It was about 1 p.m. People were on their way back to their desks.
Then the editor received a call. It was the government, according to Ibtisam Affan, co-publisher of the newspaper, saying the paper had to shut down. At once.
"They didn't say why," Affan said. "They didn't give us any clue why they were doing this."
But there no question of disobeying. Sudan, Affan said, is a police state. The newspaper's infrastructure could be confiscated. Those who fail to comply risk jail.
Six papers ordered closed in two days
If there is comfort in numbers, the journalists at  Al-Khartoum have plenty of company.
Journalists protest outside the National Press Council Tuesday against Sudan's recent crackdown on newspapers.
On Sunday, the press runs of nine newspapers were confiscated, Affan said.
Then on Monday, according to the group Journalists for Human Rights, four papers, including Al-Khartoum, were ordered to close for "unnamed reasons." And on Tuesday, the human rights group said, two more newspapers were ordered to shut their doors.
Journalists demonstrated Tuesday in Khartoum against repression and in favor of press freedom.
"The 'red lines' we have to stay away from are almost too many to count," a journalist working in Sudan told CNN. "Don't write about Darfur; don't write about inflation and the cost of living. Don't report on the opposition. You live in fear every day, that they will shut you down."
The journalist asked not to be named for security reasons.
The Sudanese government did not respond Tuesday to phone calls seeking comment.
Reputation for repression
Sudan, a northeast African country about one-fifth the size of the United States, has a reputation for repression. In February, two months before the national elections in April, authorities seized the print runs of 13 newspapers in a single day, according to Journalists for Human Rights.
And in the balloting, which the opposition boycotted, President Omar al-Bashir won re-election, walking away with what the government said was more than 94% of the vote.
Outside groups offer a grim assessment of the country's respect for freedom.
"Sudan saw no progress in its abysmal rights record in 2014," the watchdog group Human Rights Watch reported this year. "Security forces repeatedly suppressed protesters demonstrating against government policies; and authorities continued to stifle civil society and independent media."
A suspected motive
While the government has offered no explanation for closing the newspapers, Affan thinks she knows the reason. Private schools owned by people close to the government have had numerous instances of sexual harassment and molestation -- sometimes, Affan said, involving children as young as 3, 4 or 5 years old.
An NGO has been running workshops on how to prevent abuse. And newspapers, including Al-Khartoum, have written about the problem.
"We started writing about this, and there are a lot of police cases," Affan said. "And apparently Mr. President didn't like this. He thought we were tarnishing the reputation of the Sudanese people."
And when will  Al-Khartoum be allowed to resume publishing?
"No clue at all," Affan said. "We are waiting."

Heatwave death toll climbs to over 1,100 02:19
Story highlights
More than 1,100 people have died in a weeklong heat wave in India
Monsoon rains are forecast in a week, but there's little respite expected otherwise

(CNN)
Stifling heat has killed more than 1,100 people in India in less than one week.
The worst-hit area is the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh, where authorities say 852 people have died in the heat wave. Another 266 have died in the neighboring state of Telangana.
India recorded its highest maximum temperature of 47 degrees Celsius -- 117 degrees Fahrenheit -- at Angul in the state of Odisha on Monday, according to B.P. Yadav, director of the India Meteorological Department.
Hot, dry conditions are being made worse by winds blowing in from Pakistan's Sindh province across the northern and central plains of India. "This extreme, dry heat is being blown into India by westerly winds," Yadav said.
The high temperatures are expected to continue for another two days before any respite, the meteorological department warned Tuesday. However, the agency said that another hot spell would likely soon follow.
Among the worst-hit states are Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the south. The northern states of Rajasthan and Haryana are also reeling from the intense summer as is India's capital, New Delhi, Yadav said.
Heating taking toll on the poor
Many of the dead are reported to be poorer people, beggars and the homeless as well as construction workers who are expected to work on building sites in direct sunlight.
About one-third of the country's 1.2 billion people have access to electricity, meaning millions are enduring the blistering heat without relief.

For those who do have electricity, power has dipped in and out as extra demand to run fans and air conditioning has put pressure on the system, said CNN Mumbai correspondent Mallika Kapur.
Many people without ways to cool their homes are seeking shelter in shops and malls -- anything to escape the heat, she said.
Rain forecast
Temperatures have been at a sustained high over the past few days, with little change even at night, and are expected to remain high for days, CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said.
India's monsoons will provide some relief, but the rains are projected to arrive in one more week. Once they hit India's southeastern coastline, they will likely take a few more weeks to reach the drier northern parts of the country.
State authorities have been advising people to stay indoors and drink water.

Experts say that hot conditions should not usually lead to this many fatalities. But many of the affected areas in India are humid, which worsens the level of stress caused by excessive heat.
Heat waves are not uncommon in India. Studies suggest they are likely to get more intense and more frequent.

        <title>Why was I spared from Amtrak train 188's crash?</title>

        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Troubled by questions about fate and God, CNN's religion editor turned to religious, nonreligious experts
All the spiritual experts agreed on one thing: He was asking the wrong questions.
(CNN)
"i think the Amtrak i just got off just crashed in philly."
I texted that note to my wife on the night of May 12. Less than an hour earlier, I had been riding Amtrak Train 188. I got off, as usual, in Wilmington, Delaware, one stop before Philadelphia.
The train left late from Washington, and the air conditioner was wonky, but the trip had been otherwise ordinary. I walked home from the station and glanced at Twitter, where I saw this:
 Patrick J. Murphy (@PatrickMurphyPA) May 13, 2015
My friends and family know I commute via Amtrak, so I posted short messages on social media to let people know I was OK. I was a bit rattled because I'd been sitting in the front of the train. It looked, from the few images I could find, like  the first two cars had caught the brunt of the damage.
But my life hadn't been in danger and I hadn't witnessed any harrowing scenes. I don't believe in fate, I wrote half-seriously on Twitter, but maybe I should.
Soon, notes like this starting rolling in.
@BurkeCNN @CNNWire you might be in Wilmington, but you've arrived at Providence
 G. Jeffrey MacDonald (@gjmacdonald) May 13, 2015
Others suggested that God had spared me or angels had saved me, and I should be grateful. Which I am. But to whom? And for what?
As a religion reporter, I'm usually on the other end of those questions. Just this month, I wrote a story about how Buddhists and Hindus view natural disasters like Nepal's devastating earthquake . Now my questions had boomeranged back.
As the Amtrak crash casualties became more clear -- eight dead; many more badly injured -- I didn't feel lucky or saved. I felt sick.
The morning after the wreck, a friend asked how I'd slept.
"With a bottle of bourbon and two Tylenol PMs," I joked.
The truth is, I hadn't slept at all.

By Thursday, the trains were running again between Wilmington and Washington, and I walked back to the station. Passing a newsstand, I saw the faces of the victims displayed on front pages. An unsettling wave of sadness, empathy and guilt washed through me, flushing my face and welling in my eyes.

Laura Finamore, Jim Gaines, Abid Gilani, Bob Gildersleeve, Derrick Griffith, Rachel Jacobs, Giuseppe Piras and Justin Zemser. With each obituary, my sadness deepened, as did my questions. They were all relatively young. Some had been sitting in the very car I'd left a little while before the crash. Why had their lives been so cruelly cut short? Why hadn't mine? Was it providence, fate or dumb luck? And what should I do now?
One of the advantages of being a religion reporter is that you meet people who have thought deeply about those kinds of questions. I decided to call six: a Catholic priest, a Buddhist writer, an atheist philosopher, an imam, an evangelical author and a rabbi. I explained my situation, told them what was troubling me and asked for advice.
Though they come from very different traditions, each agreed on one thing: If I want answers about life and death, I should start by asking the right questions.
A God who suffers
The Rev. James Martin is a Jesuit priest and prolific author. Always quick with a pithy quote and deeply knowledgeable about the inner workings of the Catholic Church, Martin is a trusted source to my tribe of religion reporters.
The questions I asked during this interview, though, were different from any other.
I told him that I was bothered by the idea of providence -- the suggestion that God had spared me and not eight others. Martin agreed, and said that while he believes God is in control, it's foolish to assume we know the master plan.
"But just because we don't understand God, doesn't mean we shouldn't believe in God."
At times like these, Martin continued, he counsels Christians not to think of God as an all-powerful puppeteer directing worldly events, but to focus on Jesus, who took on human form, along with all its joys and sorrows.
The Jesuit, who recently wrote a book about Jesus , cited two examples of Scripture.
In the first, from the Gospel of Luke, Jesus was told about Galileans who had been murdered by Pontius Pilate while worshiping. Jesus turns their implicit question -- how could God let this happen? -- back on the questioners.
"Do you think these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no!"
Likewise, Jesus said, the 18 people who died when the Tower of Siloam tumbled down were no more guilty than any other Jerusalemites.
In other words, crashes and catastrophes happen, and they don't reflect on either the valor or sinfulness of the victims. Nor do they reflect on those who escaped intact, like me.
Still, Jesus is saddened by death and mourning, Martin continued, citing the Gospel of John. After learning that Lazarus, his follower, had died, Jesus wept. (Jesus later raised Lazarus from the dead, the Bible says.)
"We don't have a God who is far off," Martin said. "We have a God who suffers with us, and through us."
Before we ended our conversation, the priest encouraged me not to ignore the connection I feel to Train 188's victims. Maybe, he suggested, I'm being called to do something on their behalf.
The Buddha's mustard seed
My next call was to a Buddhist writer I've often turned to with questions about applying the Buddha's teachings to modern American life.
Daniel Clarkson Fisher said some Buddhists draw a straight line between karma and fate, the idea that we reap in the future what we've sown in the past. Others might call my experience on Train 188 an "auspicious coincidence." A lucky break, basically.
But the Buddha dissuaded followers from musing on metaphysics, Fisher said. By way of example, he cited the Parable of the Poisoned Arrow, in which a stricken man asks so many questions about the source of his suffering that he neglects to treat it.
"But in my case, aren't the questions themselves the wounds?" I asked.
"Sure," Fisher answered. "And I'd actually be concerned if you weren't thinking about them."
As a young man, he continued, he'd been panicked by death, haunted by fear. After seeing "Kundun," Martin Scorsese's movie about the Dalai Lama, he began to study Buddhism.
Reading through Buddhist scriptures, Fisher wrote in an essay , he came across the story of Kisa Gotami, a mother mourning the death of her child.
She asks the Buddha to revive her son, and he agrees, provided Gotami can bring him a mustard seed from a home that has never experienced loss. Making the rounds, she realizes that no household is free from suffering.
As Fisher writes, the parable is about perspective. "The moment you think only of yourself, the focus of your whole reality narrows. The moment you think of others with a sense of caring, however, your view widens."
In other words, it's fine to ponder the fragility of life -- in fact, Fisher encouraged it. But I shouldn't become so consumed with questions that I ignore the suffering of others.
Scoundrel logic
After talking to two believers, I decided it was time to call an atheist.
Rebecca Goldstein is a philosopher and writer whom I'd interviewed several years ago about her novel, "36 Arguments for the Existence of God." It was the kind of conversation you remember for years afterward; she was so engaging and insightful.
Raised in an Orthodox Jewish household, Goldstein now considers herself a secular humanist. (She's also a genius, according to the MacArthur Foundation .)
Goldstein said she understands and even sympathizes with the impulse to imbue traumatic events with spiritual meaning.
"It is horrible to think that the universe just doesn't give a damn about us. I think all of religion comes from that." But "metaphysical maturity" requires the recognition that the world is indifferent to our desires, Goldstein said.
The philosopher said she's been obsessed with ethics and morality since she was a young child hearing stories about ancestors who escaped from Hungary after the 1956 uprising. I asked her: Is the idea that I was somehow saved from the crash unethical?
"Yes!" she said quickly.
William James, the psychologist who studied the varieties of religious experience, called the idea that God or fate favors us "scoundrel logic," Goldstein said. It may seem harmless, but it feeds humanity's worst impulses, from Nazism to modern religious violence.
"The essence of ethics is that, to the extent that any one of us matters, every single person matters in exactly the same way," Goldstein said. "Those lives (the crash victims) mattered just as much as yours does."
"Is it still OK to feel grateful?" I asked.
Of course, Goldstein said. When we look closely at life's obstacles, from sperm meeting egg to avoiding deadly diseases, we realize how improbable, how tenuous our tiny lives are.
"You just had a dramatic experience of that," she continued. "Don't squander it!"
God willing
By the Monday after the crash, I was sleeping a little better, but I still had questions about God and fate, so I decided to call Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamid Ali, a Muslim scholar who I met few years ago.
Born and raised in Philadelphia, Ali now lives in California and is a professor of Islamic law and theology at Zaytuna College , the country's first fully accredited Muslim college.
I told Ali how disturbed I was about the death of Derrick Griffith, the train passenger who had helped countless students in his classroom in the Bronx. So many credited "Mr. G" with opening educational doors to better lives. Why would a good God rip Griffith's life away?
Ali challenged the premise of my question.
Why assume that death is the end? he asked. Does anyone except God know for sure?
"There's a working assumption that God is supposed to do whatever we want," Ali continued. "We may be displeased with something that originates from God, but what can we do about it? I can't go get my big brother and beat God up."
To illustrate his point about human ignorance, Ali cited a story from the Quran about Moses, whom Muslims consider a prophet and learned man. One day, Moses sought out Al-Khidr, an even more learned man.
Don't follow me, Al-Khidr warned Moses, you won't understand my actions.
Sure enough, in their brief time together, Al-Khidr sank a ship, killed a boy and fixed the wall of a town that refused them food.
Moses, perplexed, called Khidr evil.
You don't get it, Khidr answered.
The ship was about to be plundered by a wicked king. The boy was an infidel and would have oppressed his parents. (Islam teaches that children who die before adolescence go straight to paradise.) And the wall Khidr fixed protected the secret stash of two orphans.
God knew what was going to happen on the night of May 12, Ali said. But God didn't build the train or make it derail. So instead of trying to figure out God's motivations, Ali suggested, maybe I should learn more about Griffith's.
Three questions
I didn't know Philip Yancey personally, but I knew the evangelical author was somewhat of a specialist on questions surrounding justice and suffering. He's written two books on the topic and counseled the victims of Japan's tsunami and the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, among other sites of devastation.
I was surprised, though, at how personal the theological questions were for Yancey.
When he was an infant, Yancey told me this week, his father contracted polio while preparing for missionary work in Africa. The family's faith community tried to heal Yancey's father through prayer rather than modern medicine. Against doctor's advice, they removed him from the hospital. Within weeks, Yancey's father died.
"My mother believed he would be healed. She counted on God, and the worst thing happened," Yancey told me. "The impact of that error in theology, in thinking, impacted my life from the very beginning."
The evangelical said he spent years studying Scripture for hints, only to find that the mystery of human suffering remains just that, a mystery. In the Book of Job, for example, God flings Job's questions back at him. "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the Earth?" God asks, shutting down Job's queries.
After a near-fatal car accident several years ago, Yancey said he learned to ask more valuable questions. Strapped to a body board and told by doctors that he might die at any moment, Yancey said three thoughts popped into his head: Who do I love? What do I want to leave? And am I ready for what's next?
"When something tragic happens, we tend to look backward, and ask why it happened," Yancey told me.  "And of course that's important for people involved in the investigation.
"But as you look forward, you have to ask yourself a different question: How will you respond?"
Memory
With that question ringing in my ears, I called Rabbi Esther Lederman of Temple Micah in Washington.
"You were lucky," Lederman told me at the beginning of our chat. "And there's no good reason for that."
There's an axiom about the Holocaust, Lederman continued. Whatever we say about it, we must imagine that our audience includes the children murdered during the horrific genocide.
It was a dramatic warning against easy sentimentality and heedless celebration.
Rachel Jacobs had a 2-year-old. Derrick Griffith had a teenage son. Other Amtrak victims had children, spouses, mothers and friends as well. Whatever I write, I should imagine them reading.
I asked Lederman what a proper response might be, and she mentioned Kaddish, the Jewish prayer of mourning. Memory -- of God's covenants, of the Holocaust, of ancestors -- runs like a rushing current through Jewish life, the rabbi said. Kaddish channels that current.
By tradition, Jews who have lost a sibling, spouse or child gather with a minyan of 10 adults to recite the mourning prayer for 30 days. For deceased parents, children traditionally "say Kaddish" for 11 months. Thereafter, observant Jews will light a candle on the anniversary of their loved one's death and give to a charity in their name.
"That's how you keep them alive," Lederman said, "by bringing a little bit of their life into yours."
At such times, Lederman said, Jews commonly recall the phrase "May their memory be a blessing," which is an an echo of Proverbs 10:7.
What now?
After my conversation with Lederman, I took a few days to think about what I'd learned from the Catholic priest, the Buddhist writer, the atheist philosopher, the Muslim scholar, the evangelical author and the rabbi.
Though they came from different traditions, it seemed like each shared common recommendations: Stop looking back. Start looking forward. The most important questions don't start with the word "why." They start with "what."
The advice reminded me of Viktor Frankl's famous line in "Man's Search for Meaning."
"We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life," he said of his time in a Nazi concentration camp, "and instead think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life -- daily and hourly."
What was life asking me? To be honest, I don't know yet.
Do I still feel guilty about getting off Train 188? Yes.
I am grateful, too? Yes.
I also feel like I'm being pulled toward something new, something hazy that I can't quite see yet. Maybe it's a new way of looking at life, a new career, or a new commitment to serve others. I have a feeling the answer won't arrive on my timetable.
In the meantime, I want to honor the victims of Amtrak Train 188. In the spirit of Kaddish, on May 12 each year I'll donate to the Dr. Derrick E. Griffith Memorial Scholarship at Medgar Evers College in the names of each victim.
It's not much, I know. And it's not nearly enough to assuage the sorrow their deaths are due. But at least it will keep their memory alive in mine.
Laura Finamore, Jim Gaines, Abid Gilani, Bob Gildersleeve, Derrick Griffith, Rachel Jacobs, Giuseppe Piras and Justin Zemser.
May their memory be a blessing.

RELATED: Clinton's super PAC fundraising irks progressives
"Enough is enough. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists," he said.
Specifically, Sanders promised to spend $1 trillion to create 13 million jobs in a massive infrastructure program, to double the minimum wage to $15 an hour, to end the "greed" of the "billionaire class" by raising taxes for the wealthy and to break up the largest financial institutions in the country.
In a progressive, government-led program that would indeed represent a revolution if it was ever passed, Sanders promised a single-payer state health care system, free college tuition at colleges and universities and to reverse climate change.
The Brooklyn-born Sanders denies he is a political outlier at the fringes of mainstream politics. Instead, he accuses his fellow politicians and the media of ignoring the reality that the wealthy are doing better than ever in the wake of the worst recession in 80 years while many in the middle class are still struggling.
Since he confirmed on April 30 that he would launch a presidential run, Sanders, 73, has enjoyed a boost in the polls in the key early states.
A Quinnipiac University polls in Iowa found that 15% of likely caucus goers would back him while 18% of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire backed his campaign. Clinton however dominated the surveys, with 60% and 62% ratings in the two polls, respectively.
However, while he lags behind Clinton, Sanders, for now, is ahead of other possible Democratic long-shot candidates, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is set to make an announcement on his intentions at the weekend and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb.
The polls reflect the fact that many Democrats privately believe that Clinton is the best chance they have to hang on to the White House, and the former secretary of state is an even more prohibitive frontrunner than before she lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary race.
But Sanders, a rumpled and sometimes grumpy figure, who prides his independence and who has spent decades questioning the power of corporate barons on Wall Street may at least have the issues on his side.
The theme of income inequality is dominating the economic argument in the nascent 2016 campaign -- not just among Democrats, but it is also beginning to feature in the rhetoric of top Republican hopefuls, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.

Sanders hopes of mounting a credible campaign may rest on whether he can corral support from liberal Democrats who are pining for a run from another populist economic crusader Warren, who insists she is taking a pass on the race despite wildfire support among the party's grass roots.
In many ways, Sanders is an anti-politician. Despite serving as mayor of Burlington for four terms and winning seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, he glorifies in being an outsider, and with his wild white hair and brusque manner lacks the polish of most Washington politicians -- and presidential candidates.
Sanders will be especially closely watched for the way he handles Clinton and could pose perhaps the most risk for the former first lady on the debate stage, where he can be a tenacious advocate for his policy positions.
But he insisted that the election was not about personality clashes.
"This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It is not about Hillary Clinton. It is not about Jeb Bush or anyone else. This campaign is about the needs of the American people," he said.
But Clinton will be mindful of the fact that the first signs of vulnerability in her 2008 Democratic primary campaign came when she tripped up in an exchange with another long-shot contender, then Sen. Christopher Dodd.
One area where Sanders could make things dicey for Clinton is over the vast Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade pact which is at the centerpiece of Obama's foreign policy. Sanders and many liberal Democrats oppose the deal because they believe it will accelerate the loss of U.S. jobs to low wage economies overseas.
Clinton has yet to say whether she is for or against the proposed deal.
Sanders also had sharp words for the media, arguing that it often obsessed on trivialities and character issues, rather than the policies Americans cared about.
"Politics in a democratic society should not be treated like a baseball game, a game show or a soap opera. The times are too serious for that," he said.

(CNN)
Before the theme parks and the towering beachside condos, before the headlines about zombie cats and jokes about retirement homes, Florida was a wild (literally) place.
Foremost among its feral stretches was the area now known as Everglades National Park, which covers 1.5 million acres of marshes, lakes and sawgrass prairie.
Here crocodiles, alligators and manatees still swim in miles of rivers and streams, and more than 300 species of birds make their nests among the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere.
The Everglades was the first U.S. national park set aside for its biodiversity.
Nine ecosystems, ranging from coral-lined bays to oak tree islands, support a network of plants and animals that can't be found anywhere else on Earth.
The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, right up there with the Grand Canyon and Stonehenge.
Here are the best ways to explore Florida's proverbial "river of grass."
On foot
The Anhinga Trail is a 0.8 mile-long paved path that slinks through a sawgrass marsh and the Taylor Slough (pronounced "slew," if you're not from around here).
This is one of the most popular Everglades trails because of its accessibility -- "It's easy access for all skill levels, even those with disabilities," says Linda Friar, the park's chief of public affairs -- and because of the wildlife.
Alligator sightings are practically guaranteed, especially during the December through April dry season.
The trail is named after the anhinga, a bird that nests in the pond apple trees along the path.
This South Florida native tree produces an apple that's tasty to raccoons, squirrels and alligators, but not humans.
"There are some who say you can cook them up and make them tolerable," Friar says. "But I think they're nasty."
The Anhinga Trail , 40001 State Road 9336, Homestead, Florida; +1 305 242 7700; entry into the park costs $10 for cars and $5 for pedestrians and bicyclists. The ticket is valid for seven consecutive days.
By bike
Shark Valley's 15-mile tram and bike loop cuts through a flat-as-plywood freshwater ecosystem of sawgrass marsh and tree islands.
No need to worry about the hills.
There are no shortcuts so park officials recommend you come prepared with water, sunscreen and the desire to devote up to three hours to biking the trail.
Along the way you'll see four pits where stone was dug out to build the trail.
These man-made "gator holes" are refugees for turtles, alligators and wading birds.
Rangers recommend bikers stay at least 15 feet away from the alligators to avoid ending up as meals on wheels.
That's not always easy considering gators like to bask on the warm pavement.
Shark Valley Visitor Center , 36000 S.W. 8th St., Miami; +1 305 221 8455; bike rentals cost $9 per hour per bike. Access to the trail is included in the $10 park admission fee.
By canoe or kayak
You could spend a few hours or a few days paddling among the Everglades' marshes, mangrove islands and orchid-lined canals.
Simple living, Everglades-style.
The Flamingo Visitor Center marina, which sits in between the Buttonwood Canal and the Florida Bay, is a convenient spot to rent canoes and kayaks.
From here you can paddle to inland lakes and ponds, or launch into the open waters of the Florida Bay.
Park officials recommend you check with staff about the weather and water conditions before setting sail.
Flamingo Marina Rentals and Boat Tours , 1 Flamingo Lodge Highway, Homestead, Florida; +1 239 695 3101; canoe rentals start at $16 for two hours
By airboat
Coopertown, population eight, isn't technically a town.
But since 1945 it's been home to Coopertown Everglades Airboat Tours, the first commercial airboat operator in the Everglades.
Down here, being shallow is a good thing.
These amazing boats, which can float on water just a few inches deep, are a convenient way to access the more remote parts of the park.
While some airboat operators offer a wilder ride, Coopertown's mission is more educational.
You'll still hit top speeds of 35 miles per hour and stop at plenty of gator holes, says owner Jesse Kennon, but you'll also learn about the plants and animals you pass along the way.
"We want people to understand this is a very special, very unique ecosystem," says Kennon.
Coopertown Everglades Airboat Tours , 22700 S.W. 8th St., Miami; +1 305 226 6048; regular tour prices are $23 for adults, $11 for ages seven to 11, free for children under seven
Overnight
You can spend the night on a private Everglades "island."
Throughout the park's mangrove estuary and the Florida Bay are 17 chickees, raised and covered platforms accessible only by boat.
The chickees have a toilet and not much else.
Some campers pitch a tent on the docks; others just bring their sleeping bags.
The chickees can be reserved day of at the Flamingo Visitor Center or the Gulf Coast Visitor Center.

        <MainBody>CNN exclusive: We wanted to fight in Ramadi 02:40
PLAY VIDEO
Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for Hashd al-Shaabi, said: "This is a continuation of the Tikrit operation. It is to cut the supply route from Baiji oil refinery in the north to Ramadi. After the call of the Prime Minister -- we answered the call."
Iraq's Ministry of Defense said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that the Iraqi security forces and Hashd al-Shaabi militia now had ISIS surrounded in Ramadi. The joint forces have also managed to cut off all strategic roads used by ISIS for resupply, it said.
The decision to mobilize the Shiite force follows a request for help from Anbar provincial officials, tribal leaders and religious clerics.
But its involvement has prompted fears it could inflame sectarian tensions, and the militia's ties to Iran has complicated the use of airstrikes by the U.S. coalition.
Close to 55,000 people have fled Ramadi since ISIS captured the city, a U.N. agency said Monday, with most of the displaced persons heading to Baghdad.
Pressure on Ramadi
Iraqi authorities have not given details of the precise makeup and number of forces involved in the new military operation.
It's also not clear when combat will begin on the ground and how soon the rhetoric may translate into concrete progress.
The Hashd al-Shaabi fighters appear to be focusing initially on efforts to cut the supply route running northeast from Anbar province toward Baiji.
They say they are working alongside the Iraqi security forces and more than 4,000 citizens from Salaheddin, which may indicate that some Sunni tribesmen are involved as well.
The operation has been dubbed Labayk Ya Hussein, or Answering the Call of Hussein. Observers say this has sectarian overtones that play to Shia elements rather than appealing to Sunnis.
The forces loyal to the Iraqi government are positioned in a semicircle to the south of Ramadi and say they may be able to increase pressure on the city from there.
Short-term win?
According to CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd, the government's willingness to make use of Shia militia groups supported by Iran alongside the Iraqi military to retake Ramadi in the Sunni heartland of Anbar province may store up future problems.
"Short term, they may win," said Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official. "The long-term solution for Iraq may not be a unified state if the only message they (Sunnis in Anbar province) get is either join ISIS, which will behead you, or support the government, which brings in rival Shia militias to oust the Sunnis. It's a very difficult political situation."
The short-term prospects for retaking Ramadi are good, he said, since ISIS and other insurgent groups tend to do well at seizing territory but keeping hold of it is a bigger challenge.
However, ISIS has demonstrated its forces are more agile than those of the government and, based on past experience, is likely to find multiple locations to attack elsewhere if its forces start to lose their grip on Anbar, Mudd said. This will push the government to split its forces between different fronts.
"Long term, I think there have to be pretty basic questions about how a Shia-led government that's supported by Iran brings in Sunnis to participate in government."
Iran queries U.S. commitment
While the U.S. defense secretary has questioned Iraq's willingness to stand up against ISIS, Tehran has questioned the U.S. commitment to the fight against the group.
One of Iran's senior military officials, Maj. Gen. Qassam Soleimani, was quoted Monday by Iran's state news agency, IRNA, as saying the United States is "doing nothing" while Ramadi has fallen to ISIS and ''war crimes are taking place.''
"Today, nobody is confronting ISIS properly except Iran, even the countries that Iran is supporting," he said in an apparent reference to Iraq.
There's little disagreement that the Iraqi forces the United States has spent billions of dollars training and equipping have so far struggled in the fight against ISIS.
But the involvement of Iranian-backed Shia forces also complicates matters for the U.S. military.
American officials have stressed that the forces on the ground are all under the command and control of the Iraqi military to avoid a situation where a U.S. airstrike accidentally hits a Shia militia group.
The U.S. military will also only launch strikes when it has its own intelligence regarding ground targets to avoid hitting civilians, CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr said.

Police officials radioed the crew to ask if anyone on board had been sick during the flight, according to air traffic audio reviewed by CNN. When the crew responded everyone was fine, everyone was evacuated from the plane and its contents were searched. Nothing was found.
One passenger said those on board didn't know anything was wrong until they landed.
"In the air, nothing. In the air we didn't feel nothing. Just when we landed and they stopped us. This is when we know that something is wrong," Eylon Benzeeb told CNN.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation into the threats.
"The plane has landed and has deboarded. There were no incidents or hazards reported on board the flight by either the passengers or its crew. The plane has been cleared," the FBI said in a statement.
United flight 63 from Madrid to Newark, New Jersey, was also searched when it landed. Again, nothing was found and the flight was cleared.
Authorities said they received threats against multiple flights, and security scrambled to deal with flights landing in numerous cities including New York's JFK, Newark, New Jersey, Buffalo, New York, and Atlanta, Georgia. Yet searches have so far have turned up nothing.
Throughout the day authorities hinted that the threats did not seem credible, but insist they have to handle every threat this way, as they just don't know when one might be real.
The first threats were reportedly called in to the Maryland State Police, which forwarded the information on to the FBI.
CNN's Pamela Brown, Carolyn Sung and Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.

Power struggle
The allegations are the latest salvo in a bid by some of King's children to wrest control of the late singer's assets, believed to be in the millions.
King had 15 children from several different relationships. Eleven children are still living.
Earlier this year, Patty King, Karen Williams and a third daughter, Rita Washington, went to court, accusing Toney -- the business manager -- of elder abuse and neglect. But a judge tossed out the case, for lack of evidence
In the weekend affidavits, Patty King and Williams requested a toxicology analysis or autopsy be conducted to determine the cause of their father's death.
On Sunday, the singer's body was shipped from mortuary to the coroner's office.
"The family has made some allegations.  I can't go into specifics," Fudenberg told CNN. "We were contacted by several of the family members' legal counsel.  They were making allegations of foul play."
A public viewing for the musician is scheduled for Friday at the B.B. King Museum in Indianola, Mississippi.  Funeral services are set for the following day.
"Our investigation will not prohibit or delay the services they have planned," Fudenberg said.

        <MainBody>Gov. Chris Christie's London tour
Washington (CNN)
The chief Republican sponsor of the Senate bill to reform the Patriot Act slammed fellow Republican Gov. Chris Christie for saying "You can't enjoy your civil liberties if you're in a coffin."
Utah Sen. Mike Lee called those comments "tantamount to political pornography" and said Christie "should be ashamed of himself."
"That's absolutely ridiculous. It's absurd," Lee told CNN's Carol Costello, referring to Christie's comments. "And if Mr. Christie wants to play a part in the national discussion regarding privacy and security he should choose his words more carefully."
Christie is strongly opposed to reforming the National Security Agency's bulk data collection program, insisting it is essential to preventing the next major terrorist attack.
The NSA collects telephone metadata on millions of Americans on a daily basis and stores that information for five years under that program and the House overwhelmingly approved a reform bill, known as the USA Freedom Act, last week.
READ: Everything you need to know about the Patriot Act debate
But Lee and his fellow proponents of that bill in the Senate are still waging the fight for reform in the Senate, where top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are arguing the same points as Christie.
"I would ask Mr. Christie how many lives has it saved? I would ask Mr. Christie how many acts of terrorism have been thwarted simply because the NSA is collecting telephone data on what your grandmother calls, - on calls that she makes or calls that she receives?" Lee said.
Reviews of the NSA program by a presidential advisory group of top intelligence, privacy and constitutional experts found no instance in which the surveillance program was "essential" to thwarting a terrorist attack.
"At a minimum any security benefit that could be achieved through this program could also be achieved through the type of program that the USA freedom act would put in place," Lee said.

The city of Cleveland and Department of Justice announced Tuesday how they are moving forward on agreed changes to the city's police force.
The consent decree is the next step after the city agreed to changes last year following a scathing report from DOJ investigators regarding patterns of civil rights violations and excessive force by the Cleveland police . It will mean years of court-supervised monitoring of the Cleveland Police Department.

In a 105-page report , Justice and city leaders unveiled reforms that included commitments to "bias-free policing" , new crisis-intervention efforts and changes to officer recruitment and discipline. The leaders called on the city to buy into the changes and embrace what they billed as a transformation in the city's policing.
"I am issuing a call of action to our entire community to support this hard work together," said U.S. Attorney Steven M. Dettelbach. "The people who may criticize the police are not the enemy -- they are part of the community."
When then-Attorney General Eric Holder announced the findings in December, the city's mayor and police chief said they were in agreement that recommended changes had to be implemented. The agreement required the city to create a reform plan.

(CNN)
Libya's Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni survived an assassination attempt on Tuesday in the eastern city of Tobruk, according to the country's official news agency.
Five unmarked cars intercepted the Premier's convoy, and a gunman inside one of the vehicles opened fire on the leader's car, according to Libya's interim government spokesman Hatem Al Oraibi as quoted by LANA, the official news agency of Libya's internationally-recognized government.
Al-Thinni was not harmed in the assassination attempt, although one of his security detail was slightly injured after jumping out of the car during the attack, Al Oraibi said, according to LANA.
Al-Thinni heads Libya's interim government that's recognized by the international community.
That government is based in the eastern city of Bayda after it fled Tripoli last summer.
Al-Thinni was in Tobruk where the internationally recognized Parliament is based and was attending a session for government questioning.
Earlier Tuesday, al-Thinni and members of his cabinet left the Parliament session after gunfire was heard outside and there was a report that armed protesters were planning to storm the building, the interim government said in a statement.
Libya has two governments and two parliaments, with one based in the east and the other self- proclaimed one based in the west in Tripoli.
The North African nation has been the scene of chaos and fighting between the various groups and militias following the 2011 revolution and NATO intervention that overthrew the regime of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed after being captured by rebels in October 2011.

        <title>Amtrak to install inward-facing cameras in train cabs</title>

        <MainBody>Amtrak train derails in Philadelphia
Washington (CNN)
Amtrak announced Tuesday that it will begin installing inward facing cameras aboard its locomotives, following the fatal crash of Amtrak 188 two weeks ago.
The first cameras will be installed aboard the regional trains that service the Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Boston corridor, as well as along the Keystone lines into Pennsylvania.
Eventually the cameras will also be installed on Amtrak's high-speed Acela trains, with the goal of getting cameras on all of Amtrak's lines.
RELATED: Police investigation of Philadelphia train accident
Investigators have been frustrated by the lack of clarity about what went on inside the cab of the train that crashed. The engineer, Brandon Bostian , said he does not recall anything that happened right before the crash. Currently Amtrak only has cameras facing outwards, along with a so-called black box, or data recorder that measures locomotive and engineer actions.
A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman told CNN that their investigation is looking in to Bostian's "situational awareness," as part of the "human factors" component of the investigation. The spokesman points out that it is standard procedure to look at every possible factor.
A separate safety board member told CNN that the "only way" an operable train could accelerate would be for the engineer to push the throttle, and the train's recorder should show that throttle movement.
"We will be looking at that to see if that corresponds to the increased in the speed of the train," Robert Sumwalt, a board member, said in an interview that CNN broadcast last week.
Bostian was new to the Washington to New York run, a National Transportation Safety Board official told CNN's Rene Marsh, having been on the route for just two weeks. But Bostian had been running trains along the northeast corridor for three years which would have included, at times, passing through this very same stretch of track.
The week of the accident, Sumwalt said Bostian could not remember anything beyond pulling the whistle as he drove past the North Philadelphia station, three miles earlier.
The accident which happened minutes after the train left Philadelphia, en route to New York, left eight people dead and more than 200 injured. The train accelerated to 106 miles per hour as it approached the Frankford Junction curve, which had a speed limit of just 50 miles per hour.
The Federal Railway Administration has since ordered Amtrak to add more speed limit signs along the tracks, and Amtrak has installed technology on the northbound side that would slow a train down automatically as it enters that curve in Philadelphia if it is going too fast.

Prosecutors say Wint did not act alone
Wint has been arrested in the killings of three members of the Savopoulos family and their housekeeper
Sources say law enforcement found $10,000 in cash when Wint was arrested in Washington
Washington (CNN)
The man charged with the killing of three members of a prominent Washington, D.C. family and their housekeeper did not act alone, prosecutors said they believe.
Darron Dellon Dennis Wint made his first appearance before a District of Columbia judge Friday to face first-degree murder charges following the discovery last week of the victims in a scorched mansion.
Earlier reports identified the suspect as Daron Dylon Wint, but newly obtained court documents show that this was just one of several aliases that he apparently used; his legal name is Darron Dellon Dennis Wint.
Prosecutors alleged that Wint did not pull off the slayings and arson on his own.
The crime "required the presence and assistance of more than one person," according to the criminal complaint.
Court documents reveal that the incident began sometime after 6 p.m. on May 13, and continued through the afternoon of the next day. The fire at the mansion was reported at 1:24 p.m. on May 14, but the victims had been held against their will since the previous day.
Wint's attorney questioned the evidence, but the judge went forward with the charges and ordered Wint to remain imprisoned without bond.
As of Friday, no one else had been charged in connection to the killings.
D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said, "it's pretty obvious that there was coordination" in the crime, but cautioned that it remains unclear what form that help took.
Lanier told CNN: "Whether there was someone else that actually took part in the kidnapping and the murder, it's going to take time to get this evidence together, and we just don't want to jump to conclusions or draw conclusions too soon."
While five others who were arrested along with Wint had been questioned and released, investigators are interviewing others, the chief said.
A grisly discovery
The arrest came a week after the grisly discovery of the bodies of Savvas and Amy Savopoulos , and their son, Philip.
The fourth victim, housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa , was found alive at the home and taken to the hospital, where she died.
A day after they "barely missed" catching him in New York, Cmdr. Robert Fernandez of the U.S. Marshals Service said, authorities spotted Wint, 34, leaving a Howard Johnson hotel in College Park, Maryland.
They tracked, surrounded and stopped Wint, who was riding in the back of a Chevrolet Cruze, and they also stopped a small moving truck that had been traveling alongside in northeast Washington.
Officers found $10,000 in cash during the arrest, according to the criminal complaint
Three women were with Wint in the car, and two men were in the moving truck, including Wint's brother.
Though questions remain, the victims' families breathed a little easier knowing that a suspect is in custody.
"While it does not abate our pain, we hope that it begins to restore a sense of calm and security to our neighborhood and to our city," the Savopoulos family said in a statement.
Signs of trouble before the fire
The fire in the $4.5 million home in one of Washington's toniest neighborhoods, not far from the home of Vice President Joe Biden, was a story in itself.
But soon it became evident that the blaze wasn't the full story.
The victims were bound with duct tape, and they suffered from blunt-force trauma, according to a source familiar with the investigation. There were signs that Philip, the 10-year-old son, had been stabbed and tortured, according to the source.
According to court documents released Friday, the boy's body was found in a bedroom on the second floor, which sustained heavy fire damage. The body was on the charred remains of a queen-sized bed, the documents state. The fire consumed a majority of the bed frame.

Capitol Hill gyrocopter pilot pleads not guilty 01:18
Story highlights
The alarm comes two days after an incident with a pressure cooker.
Capitol Police gave the all-clear shortly after the evacuation.
Washington (CNN)
The U.S. Capitol was evacuated briefly on Tuesday after an alarm went off in the Capitol Visitor Center.
Congress is on a week-long Memorial Day recess, so the House and Senate were not in session. Hundreds of staff, reporters and tourists, cooled their heels outside for more than an hour during the evacuation. Tour guides, who sport red blazers, took off their jackets and waited patiently in the shade of trees on the East front lawn, just a few hundred yards from the entrance to the building.
"U.S. Capitol Police &amp; D.C. Fire are continuing to investigate the cause of an audible alarm. The U.S. Capitol Building and the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center are being evacuated due to the audible alarm," the spokeswoman for the Capitol Police told reporters during the evacuation, adding that "there are no signs of smoke or fire."
The false alarm comes two days after police discovered a pressure cooker emitting a gas smell in a vehicle near the annual Memorial Day concert outside the Capitol. Multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies responded to the scene over the weekend, but found nothing hazardous. The owner was taken into custody and later apologized to the local NBC affiliate station, saying he used the device in his food truck. Pressure cookers were used to create bombs used in the Boston Marathon attack in 2013.
The U.S. Capitol Police have come under criticism recently for their handling of a gyrocopter that landed on the West front lawn of the Capitol.  The pilot of that vehicle wanted to deliver a political message and didn't have any weapons with him. But his ability to fly undetected in restricted airspace and land without law enforcement alerting members and staff about a potential threat prompted key committee leaders to insist on a review of procedures.
During Tuesday's incident, multiple email alerts were sent to staffers from the Capitol Police updating them on the situation.
"The U.S. Capitol Building situation has been resolved," according to the final such message, which did not say what triggered the alarm, but told staffers to return to their offices.

        <MainBody>ISIS threat spreads fear throughout Iraq 02:36

Al-Yassiri is bitter, angry and disillusioned.  Two weeks before the fall of Ramadi, he says his unit captured an ISIS position, killing six ISIS fighters. Two are seen torched in a video. Another seven were captured, among them four foreigners, admitting they were tortured for information.
"I heard my officer interrogating one of them how they manage to plant IEDs between our watchtowers when they are just 100 meters apart?
"One replied saying, 'We flash our light toward the tower. We know there are only 28 soldiers, that they are in five hours shift rotations and there is a lack of ammo. If a soldier doesn't fire at us, we crawl and plant the bomb.' "
"We wanted to kill those seven we captured," he continues.  "But we couldn't because our commander had already informed our headquarters that they had been captured."
He bristles at the notion that Iraqi soldiers like him don't have the will to fight .  He faults the military leadership and logistical failures that left them without adequate resupply and support.
He believes that the order to withdraw was a betrayal.  The Iraqi government has said it launched an investigation to find out what went wrong and how the order was issued, but so far, no one has given a viable explanation.
"I want to quit the army, I would, if I thought I wouldn't get into trouble," Al-Yassiri says.  "I want to join the militias and go back to the fight."

Who polices the 'Ethics Police'?

Story highlights
Robert Klitzman: Controversies involving experiments have been increasing
Public knows little about work of "Ethics Police," writer says
Robert Klitzman is a professor of psychiatry and director of the Masters of Bioethics Program at Columbia University. He is author of the forthcoming book, " The Ethics Police?: The Struggle to Make Human Research Safe ." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN)
"The experiment worked," the doctor told me, "but the patient died."
The patient was my father, who was diagnosed with leukemia.  Three months earlier, the doctor said my father would probably live only three months. No effective therapy existed. Most doctors would not offer any intervention.
"We could try chemotherapy," the doctor said, "but it would be a bit of an experiment.  There's a 50 percent chance he could live an additional three to 18 months."
The doctor was upbeat, optimistic about the treatment. My father was torn. My mother thought it was too risky.  But as a newly minted doctor, I had high hopes for science.
"I think you should try it," I said.  He agreed -- largely because of me.
Three months later, his white blood count normalized, but the side effects of the treatment killed him.
Robert Klitzman
His death has haunted me ever since.  I felt let down: Science had failed to prolong his life any longer than if he had refused the experimental drugs.  I wondered whether I or the doctor should have acted differently; if the process could have been handled better; if he had been too optimistic and downplayed the risks; if he should have helped us more with this decision.
Controversies involving experiments have been increasing -- from stem cells, genomics and Ebola to pharmaceutical and social media company studies. Last year, Facebook admitted it had experimented on almost 700,000 users , seeing whether it could influence their mood without telling them.
Such studies present critical questions of who oversees science, how well they do so and whether they should do more.
Most people take for granted is that some protective mechanism -- laws or watchdogs -- ensures that experiments are ethical.  Indeed, research ethics committees or institutional review boards (IRBs) do review all human experiments. But they have become increasingly controversial.
Why? In part because they operate behind closed doors and, scientists now argue, often stymy, rather than support key studies.
Investigators commonly call IRBs "the Ethics Police" and complain that these boards unnecessarily block or delay studies. As a researcher, I, too, have sometimes been frustrated by them.
Yet despite the controversy in the field, the public knows little about them, despite how they affect all our lives.
These committees were created following revelations about the gross ethical violations in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study .  In that experiment, researchers studied African-American men in the South who had syphilis.  But the researchers, funded by the U.S. government, decided not to inform the men about penicillin when it became available as a definitive treatment.  If the men got treatment, it would destroy the experiment. In response to this grave moral lapse, Congress passed the National Research Act in 1974 , establishing IRBs.
The United States now has more than 4,000 of these boards, examining tens of billions of dollars of research each year. Large medical centers have five or six of these committees.  These boards must have at least five members, including at least one scientific member, one nonscientific member and one unaffiliated with the institution.  Typically, they include about 14 individuals, mostly researchers.  They try to minimize risks and maximize benefits in any studies and ensure researchers do not overly burden disadvantaged groups.
But complaints about them have been mounting.
This is perhaps not surprising. Since the regulations were written, science has evolved and become more complex. The NIH budget alone has increased about 15-fold. The biotech and pharmaceutical industries have burgeoned.
The problem is that the regulations have not kept up with science, and the system needs to be revised. Currently, IRBs at 50 institutions frequently need to approve a single study, but vary, and these committees often now delay important studies. Despite this, research scandals still occur.  Some subjects die unnecessarily in experiments. And many critics argue that social media companies are not sufficiently protecting your rights when they experiment on you online.
In 2011, with such criticisms in mind, the Obama administration proposed several changes, including increased use of central IRBs (or CIRBs) in multisite studies and listed 74 questions about how to alter and oversee those committees.  A revised version of these proposals was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget this February, but the content of these revisions and their fate remain unknown.
Unfortunately, these proposals have received far less attention than they should, given that they will affect tens of billions of dollars of research.
We urgently need to consider these complex issues, yet very little research has been undertaken on how exactly these committees make decisions.
With that in mind, I recently looked into the issue myself, interviewing IRB leaders around the country.  What I learned constantly surprised me.
These committees wrestle with genuine dilemmas and are constantly trying to weigh possible future risks and potential benefits of studies that have not yet been conducted, deciding exactly what scientists should tell participants, how much to trust vs. monitor individual researchers.
IRBs have "different flavors and colors," one chair told me.
Some are "nitpicky," others "user-friendly."  They are well-intentioned but base many decisions on "gut feelings" and "the smell test." Some committees are flexible and have "open door" policies, inviting researchers to attend meetings or call; others prohibit it. Other reforms are thus also essential.
It seems obvious that greater clarity and standardization are vital.
Boards that remain closed to researchers should be more open.  A body of "case law" should be built, based on documented precedents. Interpretations and applications of principles in specific cases should, as much as possible, be openly vetted.
IRB members, staff and chairs should for their part undergo rigorous training and testing using standardized protocols. IRBs also need to recognize more fully how they are involved in complex, interpretive processes and to acknowledge more fully the costs of some of their decisions to research.
As a researcher, I am still at times frustrated by review boards, but at least I now better understand perspectives. After all, they face decisions that impact everyone -- present and future patients, family members of patients and doctors. It is therefore important that we all understand these dilemmas and the possible solutions.
The ancient Roman writer Juvenal once asked, "Who will guard the guards themselves?" The answer is that we all have a role to play.

        <MainBody>Outrage after acquittal of Cleveland police officer 02:22
Causation
Causation is a necessary element of virtually all crimes and civil wrongs alleging harm.  It sounds simple, almost intuitive, but it's not.  Learned judges have struggled with the concept of causation over the centuries.  In this case, the question was: did the state prove that this individual defendant legally caused the death of the driver or passenger?
In a single-shooter case, causation is easier to prove. Here, "while there is no question that the deaths were caused by police bullets generally, the state [needed to] prove in this case that they were caused by Brelo's bullets specifically."
Indeed, when over a hundred shots are fired at a car by 13 different people, using very similar bullets, it's going to be hard to discern who exactly delivered the fatal shots.  Even though the judge in this case found beyond a reasonable doubt that Brelo fired at least one shot that by itself would have caused Russell's death, this did not satisfy the element of causation.
The state had to further prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his shot alone actually caused the death.  Brelo's shot would have certainly killed, if none of the other shots were fired.  But those other shots were fired,  and "that fact," said O'Donnell,  "precludes finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Russell would have lived but for Brelo's single lethal shot."
Was Brelo saved by the presence of other shooters? It's an interesting discussion: When a member of a drive-by shooting crew is prosecuted, conspiracy theory allows members to be convicted of murder even if a defendant only drove the car and never fired a shot.  Here, because there is only a single defendant and no conspirators, the contributed pool of bullets by his fellow officers actually caused the reasonable doubt.
Affirmative defense
The test is similar throughout jurisdictions: "Where an officer has probable cause to believe that a suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to effect a seizure by using deadly force."  J udge O'Donnell asserted that police must reasonably perceive some threat before using deadly force. The Supreme Court also recognizes that reasonableness of force is assessed from the perspective of a reasonable officer there in the moment, "rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight."  Police officers "are often forced to make split-second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving -- about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation."

Alzheimer's Disease Fast Facts
Updated 2120 GMT (0420 HKT) May 26, 2015
(CNN)
Here is some information about Alzheimer's disease, a progressive brain disorder that damages and destroys brain cells, leading to loss of memory and other intellectual abilities.
Facts:
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, which is a general term for the loss of memory and intellectual abilities.
Alzheimer's disease is fatal and there is no cure. It is a slow-moving disease that starts with memory loss and ends with severe brain damage.
Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in America.
The disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer. In 1906, the neuropathologist did an autopsy on the brain of a woman who died after exhibiting language problems, unpredictable behavior and memory loss. Dr. Alzheimer discovered the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are considered the hallmarks of the disease.
Age - The likelihood of developing Alzheimer's doubles every five years after the age of 65. For most people, symptoms first appear after the age of 60.
Family history - Genetics play a role in an individual's risk of developing the disease.
Head trauma - There is a possible link between the disease and repeated trauma or loss of consciousness.
Heart health - The risk of vascular dementia increases with heart conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.

He said that Bush currently has the financial advantage in his home state, and Rubio would eat up a huge portion of the state's donors as well, making it difficult for others to compete in the state's expensive media market.
"Short of (Florida) ... I think our message, common-sense conservative reform, could play just about anywhere out there," Walker said, reaffirming his intention to compete in the Iowa caucuses.
Florida played a pivotal role in the 2012 GOP nominating contest, giving Mitt Romney a boost that solidified his frontrunner status in the nominating fight. The state's 2016 primary is scheduled for much later, in mid-March, the earliest date allowed by the Republican National Committee for states to allocate its delegates on a winner-take-all basis.
Walker is on the schedule for Florida Gov. Rick Scott's GOP cattle-call next week, but his comments hint he may not be making many side trips to the state in the future.

(CNN)
Malaysian authorities have confirmed that the 139 graves and 28 abandoned camps discovered close to the Thai border are related to human trafficking.
Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said that Malaysian police and border guards, as part of an operation, found a burial site which contained corpses which had decomposed to the level that only skin and bones remained. The site was believed to be abandoned around two weeks previously.
Fences and sentry posts indicated that the camps held captive migrants, he said. They had been abandoned recently.
"Some of the camps found showed that they have been occupied since 2013, and the latest two camps were abandoned two to three weeks ago," Khalid told Bernama , the Malaysian state news agency.
"The police are unable to confirm whether all the graves contain human remains as the digs have not ended as yet," he said.
He added that the bodies will be sent for post-mortem analysis to determine the causes of death before they are buried.
Region-wide crisis
According to the International Organization for Migration, an estimated 25,000 Southeast Asian migrants took to seas in the first three months of 2015.
In recent weeks, hundreds of migrants have come ashore in Malaysia and in Aceh in Indonesia after making the risky journey south through the Andaman Sea.
Southeast Asian nations are facing a humanitarian crisis as thousands of migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar take to the sea in boats, hoping to settle elsewhere in the region.

Story highlights
Russia deploys 12,000 troops and numerous aircraft in snap exercise
NATO, bemoaning lack of notice, urges transparency
Dueling drills take place as tension increases along 900-mile line between Russia and West
(CNN)
You flex your muscles and I'll flex mine. Or so it seems to go in international relations these days.
Russia has deployed 12,000 troops along with numerous aircraft and weapons in a surprise military exercise in the country's northwest -- a show of strength that may be a response to a long-planned European military exercise led by Norway.
The Russian news agency Tass, quoting the country's defense ministry, reported Monday that the exercise involves as many as 250 combat planes and helicopters and 689 units of "various weapons and military equipment."
Cruise missiles will be aimed at an "imaginary enemy," the report said.
Competing spheres of influence
The seemingly competing military exercises come as tension is increasing along a range of former Soviet states -- from Moldova in the south to Latvia, 900 miles to the north -- over whether they will fall under the influence of Russia or the West.
The EU and NATO eye these states as potential members, and indeed Latvia, for example, is already a member of both organizations. But Russia views that as a threat.
Part of that struggle has involved the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and its encouragement of separatists in eastern Ukraine.
NATO: Transparency needed
The Arctic Challenge Exercise is not a NATO-led drill, but several of NATO's 28 countries are participating. And NATO is not happy about Russia's surprise maneuvers.
"We are concerned by the size, scale and frequency of Russia's snap exercises," a NATO official said. "Three of them have included over 80,000 troops. Some of them have been used to deploy troops to annex Crimea, mass forces on Ukraine's border and support the separatists."
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
The official declined to be named because of NATO policy.
She said that NATO announces its military exercises in advance -- including a large exercise this coming autumn that was announced a year ago, and to which international observers, including from Russia, have been invited.
"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discussed the importance of transparency and predictability in military activities with Russia Foreign Minister Lavrov last week," the official said, referring to Sergey Lavrov, who has been Russia's Foreign Minister since 2004.
On orders of Supreme Commander-in-Chief
Tass called the Russian exercise a "surprise combat readiness check," and said it was being conducted "to assess capabilities of the Air Force and air defense forces of the Central Military District to fulfill tasks to destroy an enemy."
A check of the Norwegian Armed Forces website showed that the European military exercise was made public some time ago, and members of the press were invited to apply for accreditation to cover the event.
Tass reported that Russia's surprise exercise was launched on the orders of the Russian Supreme Commander-in-Chief, otherwise known as President Vladimir Putin.
