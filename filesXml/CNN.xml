Grandmas, cab drivers and college kids were all making small fortunes in a frenzy of "chao gu" or stir-frying stocks -- Chinese slang for trading.
And the stock rally came at a time when the wider economy was slowing, puzzling many financial analysts. But now they say gravity is taking effect.
"China's stock market had become detached from the reality of China's own economy, and appallingly overvalued," Patrick Chovanec, managing director at Silvercrest Asset Management, posted on Twitter.
China's stock market had become detached from reality of China's own economy, and appallingly overvalued. This is gravity taking effect.

China is throwing the kitchen sink at the problem
While some analysts believe that the stock market is undergoing a much needed "correction," China's government has pulled out all the stops to support share prices.
The People's Bank of China has cut interest rates to a record low, brokerages have committed to buy billions worth of stocks, and regulators have announced a de facto suspension of new share listings.
Dong Tao, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at investment house Credit Suisse, said Beijing fears that the stock rout could undermine consumption, as people nursing losses are unlikely to go to the mall and spend.
"That creates all kinds of risks for the economy and for the financial system and this is why Beijing is worried," he said.
Investors clearly aren't convinced by government efforts. China's stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride, sometimes opening with a jump of as much as 7%, before ending the day down by that much.

How will it affect the rest of the world?
Few foreign investors have much direct exposure to these stock markets -- China still limits the amount of overseas investment.
It's ordinary Chinese that have been the biggest victims of the crash.
The real concern for those outside China is an economic slowdown and wider impact from a fluctuating stock market.
Fears of a downturn in China have already hammered the price of commodities like iron ore and copper this week.
In the longer term, this could also hurt places like Australia, which supplies of a lot of China's raw materials.

What does this mean for China's leaders?
President Xi Jinping has portrayed himself as a "strong man," going after "tigers" -- high-ranking officials -- in his relentless anti-corruption drive.
But the stock market plunge could prove a formidable challenge to China's top leadership.
"They're putting their credibility on the line and if people see that they shoot that bazooka and, you know, the market continues to fall and then they realize that the government doesn't control economic outcomes as much as they thought," Chovanec told CNN.
And the heavy-handed measures Beijing has enacted to try and halt the rout may have undermined faith in China's commitment to market reforms.
"The government wants to reverse the market movement -- this is not market-based policy. That's a big setback for the Chinese capital markets," said Dong.

Afghan officials hold talks with Taliban in Pakistan

The Afghan government says this is the start of "the first ever official peace talks"
White House: "This is an important step in advancing prospects for a credible peace"
Taliban and Afghan government representatives agree to meet again, Pakistan says
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)
The government of Afghanistan held talks this week with the Taliban in an attempt to work toward a peace process for the war-ravaged nation, officials said.
The Afghan government described the meeting as "the start of the first ever official peace talks" between the two sides.
U.S. and Chinese officials also attended the discussions Tuesday at a hilltop resort in Pakistan .
"The participants agreed to continue talks to create an environment conducive for peace and reconciliation process," the Pakistani government said in a statement Wednesday.
The next meeting is expected to take place after the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
With U.S. encouragement, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had been seeking dialogue with the Taliban.
"This is an important step in advancing prospects for a credible peace," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said of the meeting in Pakistan.
But it remains unclear how far the talks might progress.

Talks seen as a 'starting point'
As U.S. and other NATO troops are drawing down their numbers in Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgency continues to rage across wide areas of the country. The militants attempted a brazen attack on the national parliament last month.
The Afghan Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it hoped the talks "would be a starting point for the process so it could prevent the shedding of more innocent Afghans' blood and further destruction of the country."
The U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan ended last year, leaving the Afghan military to lead the fight against the Taliban. The thousands of NATO troops that remain in Afghanistan are there in a training and support role.
"The United States has been encouraging the Afghans to participate in an Afghan-led process that would bring about a political reconciliation in Afghanistan and a deescalation, if not an end, to the violence that has wracked that country for more than a decade now," Earnest said.
The head of the United Nations' political mission in Afghanistan also welcomed this week's talks.
"In the long term, peace is not a luxury, it is a necessity," said Nicholas Haysom, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Afghanistan. "I welcome the direct face-to-face engagement by the parties as the only way to achieving progress towards a negotiated agreement and ultimately the peace that Afghanistan deserves."
Analysts have suggested that the Taliban may want to delay formal peace talks in anticipation of a stronger negotiating position down the line.
Previous contacts between Afghan government and Taliban representatives, notably in the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar, have failed to bear fruit.

Hundreds of soldiers and recruits are thought to have been executed by ISIS in June 2014
Twenty-four men have been sentenced to death in connection with the massacre near Camp Speicher
(CNN)
A Baghdad court sentenced 24 men to death by hanging Wednesday over a June 2014 massacre committed by militants near the Iraqi city of Tikrit, said a spokesman for the Supreme Judicial Council.
Four others were acquitted, the spokesman, Abdul Sattar Bayrakdar, said in a statement released by his office.
ISIS claimed to have executed hundreds of recruits and soldiers captured last year outside Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near Tikrit.
Mass grave sites were uncovered when Iraqi soldiers and Shiite militias seized Tikrit, the hometown of former President Saddam Hussein , from ISIS fighters this year.
Bayrakdar said sufficient evidence had been presented for the court to convict, "including the confessions of the defendants in the investigation phase, which matched the facts and the records of forensic evidence."
The statement did not give details of who the men were, when they were arrested or whether they were affiliated with ISIS.
In the past few months, Iraqi security forces have detained dozens of people accused of having links to the massacre, mostly from Salaheddin province.
Human Rights Watch described the "Speicher Massacre" -- as it has been dubbed in Iraq -- as the "largest reported incident" where "ISIS captured more than 1,000 soldiers fleeing Camp Speicher ... then summarily executed at least 800 of them."
Based on satellite imagery and witness testimony, the rights group last year was able to identity a number of mass grave sites inside Tikrit and the presidential palace complex.
The palace complex became ISIS' headquarters after the militants occupied Tikrit. Nine months later, Iraqi soldiers and Shiite militias retook the city after a fierce battle.
The missing soldiers' families gave DNA samples to the Iraqi Ministry of Health last year so authorities would be able to match them to unidentified bodies the government might find.
Many questions remain unanswered about what happened last June and how hundreds and perhaps more than 1,000 Iraqi soldiers ended up in the hands of ISIS.

Syria accepts $1 billion in credit from Iran

The President of war-torn Syria has accepted a billion-dollar helping hand from his supporters in Iran.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad signed a law ratifying a $1 billion credit line from Iran, Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported Wednesday.
The deal, which will help Syria buy goods and fund projects, was signed on May 19 and approved by the Syrian parliament.  The agreement was between two state-owned banks, the Syrian Commercial Bank and Export Development Bank of Iran, SANA reported.
The Syrian regime in Damascus, supported by the Shiite leadership in Iran , has so far withstood a 4-year-long civil war that has torn Syria apart. But the government has lost control of large areas of the country to the Sunni extremist group ISIS .

        <MainBody>Reporter, college dean among dozens of suspicious deaths 01:13
Story highlights
A TV journalist and a college professor died over the weekend
Both were linked to an investigation into a corruption scandal
"I am scared for the lives of people connected to me," a government minister says
New Delhi (CNN)
TV journalist Akshay Singh had spent about an hour talking to the family he had traveled to central India to interview when he started losing consciousness.
Singh foamed at the mouth and fell from his chair, according to colleagues. His TV crew took him unconscious to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead.
The next day, police in New Delhi found the body of a college dean, Arun Sharma, in a hotel room.
On the face of it, the two deaths over the weekend, which happened hundreds of kilometers apart, have nothing to do with each other.
But both men are linked to a mysterious web of suspicion, death and scandal that has seized national attention in India and prompted one government minister to say she fears for the lives of those connected to her.
At the heart of the matter is a high-profile corruption case involving allegations of bribes being paid for jobs and college admissions in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
Corruption is hardly unusual in India. What's causing alarm in Madhya Pradesh is that people connected to the state's investigation into the alleged scam keep dying.
'I am a minister but still I am scared'
A former judge supervising the state's investigation has said that more than two dozen people linked to the case have died in the past two years.
Opposition politicians and activists in Madhya Pradesh allege that the number of deaths is almost double the official count.
Many of the deaths were originally attributed to causes like road accidents, suicide and illness. There's no evidence of foul play, but many Indians don't know what to believe anymore.
"I am scared for the lives of people connected to me. I am a minister but still I am scared," Uma Bharati, the water resources minister for India's federal government and a former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, said Monday, according to The Times of India, a national newspaper.
Deaths at weekend under investigation
The two men who died over the weekend both had links to the scandal, which investigators say dates back to at least 2007 and involved a nexus of politicians, bureaucrats, middlemen and bribe-paying candidates.
Singh was working on a report about the death of a suspect who had been named in the investigation. He collapsed Saturday during a visit to the suspect's family in Madhya Pradesh.
"He was making sound like he was choking on something," Rahul Kariya, a colleague who was with him at the time, said in an interview with India Today, their employer. "His left hand became stiff and his lips quivered."
Akshay's family says he had no medical illness. Had not visited a doctor in many years. Was fit. Exercised. No alcohol. No cigarettes.
 Rahul Kanwal (@rahulkanwal) July 4, 2015
Authorities say Singh had no signs of internal or external injury. But they have sent samples from his body to forensic experts to determine the cause of death.
The India Today Group has called for an independent inquiry into his death.
"The circumstances of the untimely death of TV Today journalist Akshay Singh merit a full, fair and independent inquiry," the company said. TV Today is the television arm of the India Today Group.
Shocked to hear about mystery death of fellow journalist Akshay Singh. Our best tribute would be to unearth the truth in #VyapamScam
 barkha dutt (@BDUTT) July 4, 2015
The death the following day of Sharma, a college dean from Madhya Pradesh who had been helping investigators, intensified the growing political storm surrounding the scandal.
Police say they don't suspect anything untoward in Sharma's death but they have set up a special medical board for an autopsy.
'The truth behind the deaths must come out'
The intense interest in the case is heaping pressure on Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.
He set up the special task force investigating the scandal. But critics said he hasn't done enough.
The investigation "seems to have no answers for the spate of suspicious deaths," said an editorial over the weekend in The Hindu, a national newspaper. "Worse still, State government officials have appeared callous in their responses and have attempted to just shrug off the matter."
On Monday, the opposition Congress party demanded that Chouhan be fired and the case handed over to federal investigators.
"The truth behind the deaths must come out," said Randeep Surjewala, a Congress spokesman.
In an apparent concession, Chouhan announced Tuesday that he would request a federal investigation into the scandal and the deaths.
But Chouhan, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party, rejected his opponents' attacks against him as baseless.
"Their only objective is to target me and tarnish my reputation," he said at a news conference.
More than 2,500 suspects
The scale of the investigation is vast -- it has named more than 2,500 people as suspects accused of forgery and impersonation. But about 500 of them still haven't been tracked down and arrested yet.
Under the alleged scam, candidates are alleged to have paid hefty bribes to either pass exams for state government jobs or for admission to higher-educational institutions.
In many cases, students were paid to use forged admission cards to impersonate candidates and write tests for them in connivance with officials, according to police. Funds worth millions of dollars are reported to have been involved in the scheme.
The full scale of the scandal came to light in 2013 after police arrested imposters who were taking a medical test conducted by Madhya Pradesh's professional examination board.
The board, known as Vyapam in Hindi, conducts competitive exams for admissions to medical and engineering colleges and for employment in police, forest and education departments of the state government.
The word Vyapam has become synonymous with the scandal in India.
CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported and wrote from New Delhi, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

At the same time, Hoyer agreed with Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, who has said recently that negotiators should continue discussions if needed past July 9 because "time limits ought not to be the issue here."
Corker, who will lead the Senate in examining a deal through a series of hearings and briefings, spoke for many critics Tuesday when he told MSNBC he is "very concerned about the trend" and "direction of these negotiations." He described himself as "fairly despondent" over it.
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, a California Republican, released a statement Tuesday saying "there is no push" from Congress to wrap up the talks this week. He added, "If the administration negotiates a sound agreement, it should be able to withstand congressional scrutiny for 30, 60, or even 90 or 120 days."
Democrats on the Hill beyond Hoyer seem resigned to an extended review for the Iran nuclear deal.
"I think the administration knows this is a tough issue no matter what -- a 30 or 60 day review. That's the deal that was made and we'll just have to work with them,"  New York Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley told CNN.
As for critics using the extended time to build opposition to a deal, Crowley shrugged and said, "as we say in New York - it is what it is."
The law passed in May providing for congressional review of a deal with Iran actually stacks the decks against Capitol Hill, where most in the Republican majorities of both chambers are highly skeptical of the President's ability to cut a tough and lasting deal with Iran. That's because the President would likely veto any resolution of disapproval and require opponents to muster a supermajority of 67 votes in the 100-seat Senate and 290 votes in the 435-seat House to override his veto.
That presents a daunting task, but not an impossible one, especially if the deal appears weak. In the Senate, 14 Democrats have raised doubts about the deal, meaning a veto override vote could be razor-thin if those 14 don't like the deal.
RELATED: Netanyahu warns of 'worse and worse' deal with Iran
Obama administration officials have repeatedly stressed that they'll only accept a good deal from Iran and think the public will back the result when they see what it contains.
They have also said that there is no guarantee a deal will result, as they are still seeking key concessions from Iran. In particular, they are insisting that they will not waver on the key point of putting in place a rigorous inspections and verification mechanism that would allow international monitors to review any suspicious facility throughout Iran.
Obama plans to talk to Senate Democrats about the Iran deal at a meeting with them later Tuesday.
And top leaders on Capitol Hill are getting regular briefings on the status of the negotiations, according to two Republican congressional sources.
Next week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will hold the first in a series of hearings it is planning on any Iran deal. These forums will give opponents another platform to pick apart an agreement. Kerry is expected to be invited to testify.
Heavy lobbying on the issue is also expected from interests groups like AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is influential with lawmakers from both parties and is very anxious that a nuclear Iran threatens Israel.

(CNN)
Russian police are warning the public of a new danger: Death by selfie.
The country's police force is advocating for people to take 'safe selfies' in the wake of a string of deaths. According to Russian news agency Tass, there have been more than 10 deaths and about 100 accidents from individuals striking lethal poses this year.
"A cool selfie can cost you your life," the interior ministry states in a brochure which police will hand out to students and the general public.
This sort-of selfie, taken by Russian thrillseekers On the Roofs in Hong Kong, would be frowned upon by police in their home country.
The two-page guide contains infographics that resemble road signs, most of which are based on actual incidents -- such as the case of a 21-year-old Muscovite who accidentally shot herself in the head and a teenager from the Ryazan region who died after trying to take a photograph of herself on railway tracks.
Among the precarious situations they warn against are taking selfies with animals, on rooftops and with exposed live wires.

Former UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold died along with 15 other passengers
He is remembered as perhaps the United Nations' most effective and boldest executive
Ban Ki-Moon calls for further investigation
United Nations (CNN)
The dry, tedious world of the United Nations system might have a major mystery on its hands.
The question is this: Was acclaimed former U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold murdered, instead of being a victim of a plane crash accident in 1961?
The case is back in the spotlight after Ban Ki-Moon, the current secretary-general, called for further investigation this week.
Hammarskjold died along with 15 other passengers on September 18, 1961, when their plane went down in a forest.
The Swedish diplomat was en route to broker a truce between rebels and the government, and to unite the Congo in southern Africa.
Hammarskjold, the body's second secretary-general, received the Nobel Peace Prize following his death. He is remembered as perhaps the United Nations' most effective and boldest executive during a time of Cold War tensions.
Though it was generally believed at the time the crash was not suspicious, it didn't take long for conspiracy theorists and others to say that Hammarskjold did not die by accident.
Former U.S. President Harry Truman stoked fears when he told reporters just two days after the crash, "Dag Hammarskjold was on the point of getting something done when they killed him. Notice I said, 'When they killed him.'"
Truman didn't elaborate.
Now, Ban says there's enough new information to question what has so far been determined or assumed about the crash, which occurred in what is now Zambia.
Ban, a long time admirer of Hammarskjold, said an investigation should be done after a special panel he appointed found Hammarskjold could have been targeted by air, or some other form of attack.
The panel found new information, which was assessed as having "moderate probative value" -- enough to further pursue aerial attack or other interference as a hypothesis of the possible cause of the crash.
The three-member panel interviewed new witnesses who claimed they had seen two planes in the sky that night, one of which caught fire before crashing. The report also says the local government in the region included foreign troops that may have had "air capability."
The report did rule out sabotage or hijacking as potential causes of the crash. It said new evidence was found to look at crew fatigue as a possible contributing factor.
To further deepen the mystery, any new investigation would include testimony from former U.S. national security intelligence officers.
Two of them talked with the U.N. panel and said they had listened or read radio intercepts that suggested the secretary-general's plane was attacked. The report also states that the leader's cryptography machine had been designed to allow select intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, to listen.
In a statement, Ban said a new investigation would "finally establish the facts." But the U.N. chief needs help from some of the countries that appointed him.
The United States and Britain did not fully comply with requests made by the special U.N. panel appointed by Ban.

London (CNN)
London is now in the grips what may be its biggest strike on the London Underground network in over a decade, threatening chaos for commuters and visitors to England's capital.
Crowds swarmed in and around stations Wednesday afternoon and early evening, trying to get on trains before they stopped running around 6 p.m. (1 p.m. ET). The strike is scheduled to end Thursday night.
Some 4 million journeys are typically made on the Underground each day, so when the system is down, the city comes close to grinding to a halt.
Without the trusty Tube, as the Underground system is widely known, commuters and tourists alike were forced to find their way to their destinations by bus, train, bicycle, taxi or on foot.
A time lapse video posted to Instagram on Wednesday showed commuters climbing over the walls surrounding the steps of the Oxford Circus station to try to catch the last trains home.

John Thumwood, 64, a systems consultant who works in the center of London, took the strike in stride while riding home on a packed, exceedingly hot subway train late Wednesday afternoon. He planned to work virtually Thursday, even if he'd have to cancel some meetings.
"When you're living in London that long, you just have to learn to live with it," said Thumwood, a native of the English capital.
Then he paused and added, "Of course, I think it's bloody inconvenient."

Mayor: Londoners 'understandably furious'
Extra buses and river boat services were lined up in anticipation of the strike, according to Transport for London, the body that oversees public transit across the city. But all services and the road network were expected to be very busy.
Speaking on phone-in radio station LBC on Wednesday,  London Mayor Boris Johnson said residents were "understandably furious" about the strike.
"The thing is ridiculous, and it is not a well-founded strike," he said, adding that he hoped "common sense will prevail."
The strike action was called after unions and the London Underground failed to agree on a pay deal over a new "Night Tube" service due to start in September.
Beginning September 12, when the Night Tube rolls out, there will be round-the-clock service on part of the network on Fridays and Saturdays, meaning shift workers and late-night revelers will find it much easier to get home.
But the unions say London Underground has done too little to meet its members' concerns about pay, health and safety, working conditions and promises about job cuts.

Union: We want a 'sensible solution'
One of the four unions involved in the negotiations, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, blamed "intransigence" on the part of London Underground for the strike action going ahead, despite months of talks.
Been trying to negotiate for 18 months to avoid today, but London Underground's intransigence is cause of #tubestrike http://t.co/q63GFaJzyG

"We work to keep London moving day in, day out. We're already often at work before 5 a.m. or can be found helping passengers get home safely in the early hours. We cope with an ever-increasing numbers of passengers -- 100 million more in just the last five years -- and are happy to do so," said a statement on the TSSA website .
"We don't object to working these hours, or the even longer ones due to the Night Tube. All we ask for is a sensible solution to the safety implications of the Night Tube, honest negotiations and a reasonable settlement on pay and hours."
Johnson, on the radio show, said that the Night Tube was "something that millions of people have wanted for a long time" and that Underground workers had been offered "a very, very fair deal" in exchange.

'Garage' churches challenge Pope for the faithful

Rise of evangelical 'garage churches' 02:04
Quito, Ecuador (CNN)
In the dusty streets of Atucucho, on the outskirts of Quito, it's hard to walk more than two blocks without bumping into an evangelical church.
In one cinder block church overlooking the city, parishioners sing and pray along with the Rev. Lema. Some break down in tears. Outside, children dressed in their church best play in the dirt.
These so-called "garage churches" have popped up in poor suburbs across Latin America, catering to communities that have been pushed to the periphery. Many of the pastors are local indigenous leaders.
They have become perhaps the biggest challenge for the Catholic Church in Latin America, where Pope Francis is on a weeklong, three-country tour .
According to the Pew Research Center , 92% of Latin Americans were Catholic in 1970, but that has dropped to 69%. Protestant congregations, on the other hand, are growing. The Pew data shows protestants were at 4% in 1970 and are currently at 19%.
Young people from an evangelical church make the rounds in Atucucho, Ecuador, visiting the sick and needy.
On Saturday in Atucucho, young men and women carrying Bibles make the rounds visiting the sick and elderly.
"God put us on Earth for a reason," said evangelical Lizbeth Quiroz, on her way from visiting a man who'd been in an accident. "And my reason is to visit those in need and talk to them about God."
In Atucucho, which means "Place of the Sun" in the native Quechua language, there is one Catholic Church.
But with the emergence of Pope Francis, also a champion of the poor, there is renewed enthusiasm among Catholics.
In Quito, children have been practicing a song for the first-ever Latin American pontiff. They belt out the lyrics as they snack on slices of green mango outside their school. They sing: "Welcome Pope Francis, Ecuador receives you with songs of love!"
Two girls tell us they will be going with their families to Bicentennial Park for the Pope's Mass on Tuesday.
As Pope Francis makes his first visit to Latin America, the region is also seeing a rise in Protestant congregations in 'garage' churches like this one in Atucucho.
Others say they will try to get a glimpse of him as he passes in his Popemobile.
But while the excitement is tangible, the big question is can Pope Francis get people back in the pews and stem the exodus from the Catholic Church?
According to a recent Gallup Poll, many Latin Americans believe Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina, will change the Catholic Church for the better. A total of 68% of those polled said he brings hope to the poor, including 37% of non-Catholics.
We ask the Rev. Robin Calle if there has been a noticeable impact at the El Carmelo Church in Quito, where he celebrates Mass.
"What the Pope is saying is that we need to be like Jesus and focus on the most miserable, on the most excluded," he said.
"He's generating a kind of internal movement in the church to build on that foundation. But it's too soon to talk about impact."

Nick Kyrgios was the talk of Wimbledon on Monday. His apparent decision to throw a game during his match with Frenchman Richard Gasquet drew widespread criticism and has sparked a race row back in Kyrgios' native Australia.

During his match with Gasquet, Kyrgios was hit with a code violation by the umpire for audibly swearing on court. He responded by seemingly throwing Gasquet's next service game, drawing boos from the crowd. Exasperated, Kyrgios sought comfort from the ball boy and embraced him as he offered the Australian his towel.

Back in Australia, Olympic swimming great Dawn Fraser accused Kyrgios of setting a poor example for younger players, and her comments about his ethnicity have caused outrage. Fraser suggested the 20-year-old, whose father is Greek and mother is from Malaysia, could "go back to where their fathers or their parents came from." "We don't need them here in this country to act like that," added Fraser, 77.

Australian Olympic legend Dawn Fraser has provoked outrage and allegations of racism after she told tennis star Nick Kyrgios to "go back to where (his) parents came from," following his "disgusting" on-court antics at Wimbledon.
Kyrgios, 20, was booed by the crowds in London on Monday when he apparently stopped trying to win after being repeatedly chastised by the umpire in his fourth-round match against France's Richard Gasquet.
Follow @cnnsport
In what commentators condemned as " another petulant performance ," the Australian got into trouble for swearing, then argued with the referee over whether he was taking too long to change his socks, and bizarrely hugged a ball boy before eventually losing the match 7-5 6-1 6-7 (7-9) 7-6 (8-6).
He was fined $2,000 for swearing, but escaped sanction from tournament organizers for his other actions.
Asked what she thought of Kyrgios' conduct, four-time Olympic champion Fraser told Australia's Today show: "I think it's absolutely disgusting ."
The former swimmer accused Kyrgios and fellow player Bernard Tomic -- who was dropped from their country's Davis Cup side after a verbal attack on tennis officials -- of un-Australian behavior.
@NickKyrgios don't go anywhere!! ridiculous comments from #DawnFraser ! Nick will learn from his mistakes, clearly Dawn hasn't.
 rennae stubbs (@rennaestubbs) July 7, 2015
"I am so shocked to think that he went out there to play and he tanked, he did all that tanking. That's terrible, that's not a good Australian sportsperson," the 77-year-old said, accusing today's athletes of having "too much money at an early age" and of listening to bad advice.
"They're a disgrace for Australian sportsmen and women. They should be setting a better example for the younger generation of this great country of ours. If they don't like it, go back to where their fathers or their parents came from. We don't need them here in this country to act like that."
Kyrgios retaliated by calling Fraser a "blatant racist" and posting a link to the interview on Twitter and Facebook .
Throwing a racket, brat. Debating the rules, disrespectful. Frustrated when competing, spoilt. Showing emotion,... http://t.co/QDvnaUNYxZ
 Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) July 7, 2015
Kyrgios was born in the Australian capital, Canberra, to a Greek father and a Malaysian mother. Tomic, meanwhile, was born in Germany and his parents are from the former republic of Yugoslavia.
Kyrgios' mother Norlaila, known as Nill, stepped up to defend her son, saying Fraser's "nasty racist attack" was "out of line."
I have no comments on Dawn Frasers nasty racist attack...but she is out of line. #unaustralianbehaviour
 nill kyrgios (@nillkyrgios) July 7, 2015
Fraser later offered an apology for her comments, insisting they were made on a "purely sporting level, rather than meant as an attack on Nick's ethnicity."
"I want to unreservedly apologize for any comments that I made this morning which may have caused offense to my fellow Australians including Nick and his family," she said in a statement reported widely in Australian media .
"Nick's representing Australia and I want to see him representing Australian tennis in the best possible light."
Fraser was the first female swimmer to win gold medals at three successive Olympic Games -- 1956, 1960 and 1964 -- and broke the world record in the 100 meters freestyle nine times.
Kyrgios was hailed as a rising star of tennis last year when he defeated then world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the fourth round at Wimbledon.
But he has since earned a reputation as one of the sport's "bad boys," frequently finding himself in trouble with match officials after swearing and arguing with umpires and line judges when unhappy with his performance or with calls that go against him.
At the same time, he has thrilled crowds with his extravagant shot-making and aggressive approach on court.

9 tourist attractions that are dying

Machu Picchu is one of the best known sites in the world.

The dilemma is sometimes likened to a double-edged sword.
Historical and natural sites of extraordinary beauty often draw large numbers of visitors to the countries that host them, providing a healthy tourism revenue. However, those same crowds often have a detrimental effect on the places they visit, sometimes leading to significant damage, which has in recent years sparked a debate whether tourist numbers should be capped.
"Sites all over the world are under threat at any given moment. Apart from the monuments and ancient cities in the Middle East, I would say historic districts of major cities in Asia face the highest threat due to the unchecked sprawl and development," says Stefaan Poortman, executive director of the Global Heritage Fund which aims to protect the most endangered cultural heritage sites in the developing world.
"Tourism is not regulated well enough and the massive influx is putting a strain on sites all over the world. The most well-known sites like Angkor or Machu Picchu are really swamped with tourism. Not only does it affect the sites but at a certain point, if unchecked, tourism can negatively impact the quality of life for local communities as well," he adds.
Below are some of the world's most beautiful sites that are on the brink of collapse.
Great Wall of China
Large chunks of the Great Wall of China have been damaged by huge visitor numbers and natural erosion.
Stretching for thousands of kilometers, China's mighty wall was built to defend the onslaught of attacking armies, but it's the hordes of tourists that occupy it these days. Sections of the wall are sprayed with graffiti and according to Beijing Times, 30% of the fortification has disappeared due to natural erosion and human damage.
Great Barrier Reef

The world's largest coral reef ecosystem hosts scores of marine species, but scientists say that it could become extinct as soon as 2050 due to climate change. This would undoubtedly be an environmental disaster, but would also mark the end of the multi-billion dollar tourist industry which is based around the reef, with grave consequences for the local economy.
Angkor Wat
Cambodia's Angkor Wat was visited by more than two million people in 2013.
The ruins of Cambodia's once-magnificent temple complex are now overrun with smartphone-toting tourists jostling for the best position from which to capture the spectacular sunrise. With an annual increase of nearly 20% year-on-year visitors, according to the Cambodian tourist board, more than two million people visited Angkor Wat in 2013.
"I think that many sites need to determine cultural and environmental carrying capacities, and then limit visitation numbers to sustainable numbers," says Poortman.
Sistine Chapel
The ceiling of Vatican's Sistine Chapel was painted by Michelangelo.
Michelangelo's masterful frescoes which grace the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel took four years to paint, but many of the millions of tourists who come to admire them each year are caught flouting the ban on flash photography. They also breath out carbon dioxide which damages the artworks. Last year a new heating and cooling system was introduced in order to try to combat the harmful side effects of tourism. Sensors and wall-mounted cameras also count the number of people in the chapel and regulate the temperature and humidity.
Caves of Altamira

For years visitors have been flocking to see the exquisite drawings of bison inside the caves of Altamira, close to Spain's north coast. But the constant trudge of tourists caused damage to the Palaeolithic paintings, which are over 20,000 years old, and the Spanish authorities decided to close the site to the public in 2002. Last year, access to the caves was partially reopened, and five visitors a week are chosen at random and allowed inside the caves (they also have to dress in protective clothing).
Maasai Mara
Wildlife roams freely in Kenya's Maasai Mara.
The vast expanses of the famous game reserve bring swathes of safari tourists every year. These travelers represent one of the most important sources of income for Kenya. But the large numbers of people who come to see unspoiled wildlife also put pressure on the area's resources, and the numerous lodges and camps have a negative impact on the environment as well. Poortman says that governments need to put caps to visitor numbers in places which could be seen as vulnerable.
"An important realization is that tourists are traveling to see and experience the natural and cultural assets that make a place unique. If sites no longer exist or are damaged, then ultimately the income from tourism will also fall."
Tutankhamun's tomb
Moisture from the breath of decades of visitors has caused the deterioration of Tutankhamun's original tomb.
Last April, the Egyptian Pharaoh's tomb was closed to the public after moisture from the breath of decades of visitors has caused it to deteriorate. In it's place, an exact replica was opened nearby. The copy was created by Spanish-based firm Factum Arte under the supervision of Egypt's supreme council of antiquities. The team used laser scanners and high definition printers to recreate the precise textures and colors of wall murals depicting the afterlife.
Taj Mahal
Completed in 1643, Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who is buried there alongside Jahan.
The mausoleum of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's favorite wife, Mumtaz, has stood as a symbol of enduring love since mid the 17th century. The site is visited by four million tourists each year, but it's exactly this tide of people has started to take its toll on the structure. Experts have also said that the decline in water level of the nearby Yamuna River is affecting the wooden foundation.

Endangered: Hatra, Iraq. A large fortified city in what is now northwest Iraq, Hatra is one of three sites named in 2015 to the List of World Heritage in Danger. The site was named to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1985. Hatra became powerful due to the Parthian Empire's influence and served as the capital of the first Arab Kingdom. Though Hatra survived Roman invasions in A.D. 116 and 198, the ancient city with its mix of Hellenistic and Roman architecture may not survive the current violence in Iraq.

Cecilia Flores-Oebanda says human trafficking victims can fight back and find new lives
But they need safety and security after they are rescued, she says
Cecilia Flores-Oebanda is the founder and director of the Visayan Forum Foundation in the Philippines, which helps rescue and rehabilitate trafficked women. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.
Manila, Philippines (CNN)
Our safe house for human trafficking victims in Manila was recently attacked. The attackers threw rocks, pounded on the gates and cursed at social workers. Despite an increased police presence in the area, the group returned a few days later and left with 16 women who were sheltering at the house.
"You don't know who you're messing with. Everyone will be killed, even babies!" the attackers yelled as they forced open the gates. They were aided by a masked man with a gun, dressed as a police officer.
The other women at the shelter barricaded themselves in the dormitories, clutching their martial arts training sticks for protection. Staff members risked their lives to stop the intruders from getting that far.
In what seems like a coordinated attack, assailants also stormed a government shelter in an attempt to kidnap other trafficking survivors.
Cecilia Flores-Oebanda, of the Visayan Forum Foundation, receives the 2005 Anti-Slavery Award.
Our safe house is home to women and girls who have endured harrowing abuse and who are fighting legal battles against traffickers. Here, we offer them counseling, medical and legal assistance, and access to education and skills training.
The women and girls in our care are afraid that the attackers will come back. It is unforgivable for trafficking survivors to be further traumatized. We are inspired by their courage. Because of them, we cannot and will not give up.
This brazen attack was a striking reminder that there are no piecemeal solutions to human trafficking.
Globally, more than 20 million individuals are in forced labor, according to the International Labour Organization . A United Nations report says 70% of trafficking victims are women and girls. And the traffickers are continually innovating. They have now capitalized on high-speed Internet access to force children to perform live sex acts in front of a camera for a paying audience.
This crisis can only be solved through a well-coordinated system of prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships among government agencies, civil society organizations and the private sector. Failure at any of these stages compromises the whole process.
When we think about fighting human trafficking, we always think of rescue operations -- of victims being saved from brothels, bars, factories, and plantations. In reality, this is but a small part of the work that needs to be done.
Worldwide, forced labor generates $150 billion a year. However, conviction rates for traffickers are low, especially in the Philippines. Traffickers need to know that they will be punished. Otherwise they won't stop.
But victims cannot fight their oppressors if they are living in fear. The attacks on safe houses are but one example of the many ways in which trafficking survivors and the organizations that help them are harassed and threatened. Traffickers are wealthy, organized and ready to use violence to protect their profits. We have a duty to survivors to ensure that they are not victimized a second time when they cooperate with us in the fight.
If victims believe that we can keep them safe, they are more likely to work with prosecutors and help get traffickers convicted. Otherwise, they will walk away.
After a harrowing ordeal, the 16 women taken from our safe house were finally freed, but now they are refusing to cooperate with the justice system out of fear for their safety. Fortunately, the remaining women and girls are working with Visayan Forum and government prosecutors to strengthen the case against the traffickers.
We need increased protection for victims and the service providers that assist them. Without this support, we cannot empower victims to seek justice.
The problem doesn't end here, however. No matter how many victims we rescue, if they are not given access to education or job placements, they are still at risk of further exploitation by traffickers. We have discharged women from our shelters only to rescue them a second time from exploitative working conditions. This revolving door of victimization points to the need for more robust rehabilitation and reintegration programs.
Walk Free estimates that 261,000 Filipinos are enslaved. There are no easy solutions for the problems that contribute to this scourge. In the Philippines, corruption, poverty and a culture of overseas labor migration are the biggest factors.
Too many people in the Philippines are reliant on relatives working abroad. And that leaves already vulnerable people open to recruiters and, when the promise of a good job turns out to be slave labor in a foreign land, abusive employers.
While working to dismantle these systemic problems, we also need to make vulnerable groups aware of red flags and reporting mechanisms so they can protect themselves and the people around them.
Over half of the 11,500 people we housed in our shelters between 2000 and 2011 were between the ages of 13 and 22. Young people are at the highest risk of being targeted by traffickers, who approach recent graduates and vocational students with offers of "special scholarships" and job opportunities.
In response, we have built up a national youth movement against trafficking called iFight. Together with survivors turned advocates, we visit schools across the country to mobilize young people to play a greater role in the fight. With close to 2 million iFighters, we are in a stronger position to increase awareness of trafficking and demand more protection for vulnerable people.

        <title>A nuclear deal with Iran is better than no deal </title>

        <MainBody>Investors keep close eye on Iran nuclear talks 03:10
Story highlights
Will Marshall: The bar for a nuclear deal with Iran is pretty low -- it only has to be better than no deal
But President Obama's critics demand a deal that is a fantasy of complete Iranian capitulation
Will Marshall is the president of the Progressive Policy Institute . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN)
Americans who didn't get their fill of fireworks over the July Fourth holiday can expect more pyrotechnics this week if U.S.-led talks in Austria's capital produce a nuclear accord with Iran.
To hear his critics tell it, President Barack Obama is desperate to strike a nuclear bargain with Iran -- even a bad one -- to burnish an otherwise lackluster foreign policy legacy. Leading the alarmist chorus is columnist Charles Krauthammer , who claims that Obama is poised to sign "the worst international agreement in U.S. diplomatic history."
The main burden of proof, however, should fall not on Obama but on skeptics of a nuclear deal with Iran. The President's harshest critics, including conservative hard-liners such as Krauthammer, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some Sunni Arab leaders, have set the bar for an acceptable agreement impossibly high.
They demand that Tehran shutter its entire nuclear program, end support for Hezbollah and other extremist groups, and stop meddling in the affairs of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. All this would be nice, of course, but it would require fundamentally transforming the political character and aims of the Islamic republic.
That's not what some of America's key negotiating partners -- Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- signed up for. What holds this improbable but formidable coalition together is a common interest in keeping Iran from joining the nuclear club.
The deal under discussion in Vienna won't guarantee that outcome, but it will move Tehran back from the nuclear threshold for the next decade or so. In fact, the bar for a deal America and its partners can live with is pretty low: It only has to be better than no deal.
Keep that essential fact in mind as Obama's critics berate him for allowing those crafty Persians to take him to the cleaners.
Despite years of diplomatic isolation, punishing economic sanctions and hard bargaining with world powers, Iran has never agreed to dismantle its nuclear program altogether. It's not even clear that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, will countenance key elements of the deal currently on the table -- the one Obama's critics consider fatally weak.
Nonetheless, there's no doubt that President Hassan Rouhani is eager to break his country out of political quarantine and to win relief from international sanctions that, along with falling oil prices, have hammered its economy. In exchange, its leaders are promising to limit nuclear enrichment, for the next 10 to 15 years, to levels sufficient for civilian nuclear power, but not making bombs.
Iran has long insisted it has no interest in developing nuclear weapons, while adamantly asserting its "right" to enrich fuel for civilian nuclear power. Given Tehran's record of nuclear secrecy and deceit, there's no reason for Washington to accept such claims at face value, but a verifiable nuclear deal would enable the world to monitor Tehran's actions, whatever its intentions.
Yet many in Congress persist in arguing that, by ratcheting up sanctions, America can force Tehran to forgo all uranium enrichment. This supposedly tough-minded posture overstates our leverage and underestimates Iran's prickly resolve to defend its sovereignty in the face of U.S. bullying. It skates blithely over the fraught history of U.S.-Iran relations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Recognizing that Iranian leaders can't readily make concessions to the "Great Satan," Obama has shrewdly assembled a broader coalition that includes all the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Yet if Congress rejects an agreement or insists on passing new sanctions unilaterally, that coalition would swiftly unravel. This would be a huge strategic gift to Iran's own hard-liners and America-haters.
So the real choice we may face this week is between a deal that puts real constraints on Iran's nuclear program, or no deal at all.
No deal means Tehran will install more advanced centrifuges spinning out weapons-grade uranium. It means no international inspections of Iran's nuclear or military sites. And it could mean resumption of Tehran's original plans to produce plutonium at its Arak reactor, giving it a second path to the bomb.
What's more, an unfettered Iranian nuclear program would likely induce Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, already unnerved by Iranian imperialism in the region, to launch their own nuclear programs. This would conjure up U.S. strategists' worst nightmare -- a nuclear arms race in the world's most unstable and terror-plagued region. It would raise the odds of a military strike on Iran's scattered nuclear facilities, possibly by the United States but more likely by Israel.
If, on the other hand, a final deal hews to "parameters" negotiators have already agreed to, it would enhance U.S. security and reduce the risk of regional proliferation. These include steep reductions in the number of centrifuges installed, and no production of highly enriched uranium for at least 15 years; a redesign of the Arak reactor so it doesn't produce plutonium; and, regular international inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities and nuclear supply chain.
In return, the international coalition would agree to lift sanctions as Iran fulfills its commitments. The chief sticking point here is timing: Khamenei insists that sanctions be lifted immediately once a deal is reached. This would be an immediate, $150 billion boost to Iran's stricken economy, and skeptics are right in arguing that, once sanctions are lifted, it won't be easy to rebuild the consensus for snapping them back on if Iran doesn't live up to its promises.
Obama can't accept this demand. But if Iranian officials can compose their own differences -- chiefly by selling the deal to Khamenei -- America and the world would reap real security gains. Specifically, the deal under discussion would extend the "breakout" period -- the time Iran would need to acquire enough fissile material to make one nuclear bomb -- from the current two to three months to a year.
That may not sound like much, but it's progress in the right direction. President John F. Kennedy's 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty didn't end the Cold War, but it bred habits of cooperation that helped to manage and eventually de-escalate the superpower nuclear arms race.
Keeping Iran's nuclear program on "pause" likewise beats what Obama's conservative critics are peddling -- a fantasy of complete Iranian capitulation to America's righteous demands.

Both the U.S. and China have carried out tests of such missiles. China's most recently confirmed space test in 2013 launched a rocket that reached out 6,250 miles into space.
But there are other weapons of concern beyond long-range missiles -- novel, non-kinetic weapons. Instead of destroying satellites from afar with missiles, countries can also use cyberwar techniques to attack satellites' software. The Office of Personal Management is not the only federal agency that has been hacked. Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's weather satellite network have been breached by Chinese hackers.
These weapons might not just be fired from Earth, but also operate from space itself. For example, in November 2014, Russia launched a mysterious satellite into space known as "Object 2014-28E." It oddly left its launch vehicle, navigated toward other Russian satellites and then returned back to the rocket that had launched it.
Some believe it was Russia's test of a technology the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War called " Istrebitel Sputnikov " -- a kamikaze satellite that is itself a "satellite killer."
Or, the space systems could mount weapons themselves. During the Cold War, a Soviet satellite was rumored to have mounted a cannon for potential use. In another example of science fiction crossing with science reality, astronomers at UC Irvine are exploring the mounting of a laser onto the new telescope to be put on the International Space Station in 2017.
Their idea is that the laser could be used to destroy any space junk that threatens to damage the station (thus avoiding the scenario from the movie "Gravity"). But, of course, a directed energy weapon that can fire with the equivalent power of a blowtorch can also be used on targets other than just junk.
The outcome is that while space is supposed to be a domain that excludes conflict, the leading space powers expect that if there is a flight over some place such as the reef in the South China Sea, the battles would quickly extend to the heavens.
"The U.S. must prepare for battles high above Earth whether it likes it or not," argued four-star Gen. John Hyten, the commander of Air Force Space Command.
In turn, People's Liberation Army's assessments of Chinese military thinking report that "war in space is inevitable."
Like what happens in other arms races, this mentality then fuels the competition even further. For instance, fears over these above programs led the Pentagon to announce that it was planning to boost its spending on space warfare systems to more than $5 billion in the upcoming defense budget, and to this month announce plans to create "an operations center to fend off Chinese and Russian attacks on U.S. military and government satellites" within the next six months.
The irony is that if such a conflict in space ever broke out, the weapons and technologies would be 21st century in nature, but the result would be, as a marine officer put it, taking the battle back on Earth to the " pre-electronic age ." This is because our drones, our missiles and even our ground units -- which all rely on satellites -- wouldn't be able to operate the way we planned.
It would force a rewrite of all our assumptions of 21st century, high-tech war. For example, the cover of our book features the USS Zumwalt, a stealthy, modern version of a battleship presently under construction in Maine that CNN described as " the future of naval warfare ." But if access to all the systems it depends on in space were lost, naval battles would in many ways be like the battles of World War I or the game of Battleship, where the two sides struggle to even find each other.
Even if conflict never breaks out -- something we certainly hope is the case -- there is still a certain sadness in all this preparation for war above. Reaching into space is one of humankind's greatest past accomplishments, and in many ways our species' future. That we can't leave our conflicts behind points to how far we still have to go.

Will Iran give up its nuclear ambitions? As its leaders try to hammer out a deal with the United States and five other leading world powers, CNN gets rare access to the Islamic state. It's the holy month of Ramadan, which means Muslims fast all day and feast at night. In Tehran, Iranians flock to markets after dark to break their fast.

While the shops are full of fruit, other Iranian industries have it harder because of decades of international sanctions. At the Modern Technic factory in Tehran, workers mold auto parts by hand or with only basic machinery.

Atena Farghadani has been sentenced to 12-plus years in prison
Nazanin Boniadi: Iranian authorities should release her immediately
Nazanin Boniadi is an Iranian-born actress. The views expressed are her own.
(CNN)
As we approach the revised Tuesday deadline for six world powers to reach a nuclear deal with Iran over its nuclear program, we should not turn a blind eye to the country's ongoing abusive treatment of its citizens.
As an actress, I value and rely on peaceful self-expression, not only in my daily life, but also in my professional work. This is particularly true as my commitment to the promotion of human rights is an integral part of my calling as an artist. So when I see another socially committed artist persecuted for upholding the values I hold dear, I feel it incumbent upon myself -- and artists everywhere -- to condemn this outrage against our entire community.
Atena Farghadani is a case in point. Following a trial in May, the 28-year-old Iranian artist and women's rights activist was handed an outrageous prison sentence , essentially for drawing a cartoon depicting some members of Iran's Majles (parliament) with animal heads. The drawing was a form of protest against bills in various stages of the parliamentary process that are aimed at increasing the birthrate by restricting access to contraception and establishing hiring practices that favor married women over single women.
I was shocked when I heard that Farghadani had been sentenced to 12 years and nine months in prison, on spurious charges, as Amnesty International notes , of "spreading propaganda against the system," "insulting members of the parliament through paintings" and "insulting the Supreme Leader" with her cartoon. Amnesty notes that she was also charged with gathering and colluding with deviant groups because "she met with the families of those killed by government agents in the unrest following the 2009 presidential elections, as well as for an art exhibition she held that was attended by members of Iran's persecuted Baha'i community."
The judge who presided over her trial, held in one of Iran's notoriously unfair revolutionary courts, is well-known for the harsh sentences he imposes on those guilty of peaceful dissent.
Farghadani had already been in jail for most of the time since her August 2014 arrest. She went on hunger strike in February to protest her detention in poor conditions, according to Amnesty, and she suffered a heart attack. But even while behind bars, and deprived of art supplies, Amnesty says that "she was so anxious to express herself that she attempted to use small paper cups to create art." For her "audacity," she says she was subjected to abusive treatment at the hands of prison guards.
All this despite the fact that there is a long and venerable history in Iran of satirical cartoons being used to express political opinions, just as there is in other countries around the world. Unfortunately, Iran is also not alone in the world in trying to censor cartoons. Although it is hard to see why any sensible authority would feel threatened by the peaceful expression of one's point of view, there is a long history of trying to repress subversive depictions of political figures -- back in the 19th century, for example, France's King Louis Philippe was depicted as a piece of fruit.
History's lesson, of course, is that attempts to suppress free expression have merely confirmed the caricaturists' original critique of heavy-handed and objectionable actions of overreaching governments.
But Farghadani does not have time to wait for history to judge the repressive system in Iran, one that crushes expressions of peaceful dissent. It breaks my heart to think that she could remain in prison for another decade or more if forced to serve her full sentence.
With all this in mind, I urge artists and concerned citizens everywhere to join me in calling on Iranian authorities to release Farghadani immediately and unconditionally, and to make human rights a priority even as much of the world is focused on the nuclear talks.
Put simply, this hideous miscarriage of justice cannot be allowed to stand.

        <title>Stench of death in Pakistan should shame government</title>

        <MainBody>When the heat wave struck, the power cuts were mismanaged by government, writes Saima Mohsin
The politicians and the bureaucracy should be hanging their heads in shame, she says
Mohsin: Pakistan needs to educate its people ... educate its politicians
Karachi, Pakistan (CNN)
I have seen many dead in my career, but I will never forget the smell that enveloped me at a morgue in Karachi this week. The dignity denied to the dead that had suffered so much in life is deplorable.
As a heat wave hit the heart of the financial capital and swept across Sindh province it stripped away layer after layer of the dire straits of governance here.
The death toll rose at an incredible pace to pass 1,000 people. Everyone questioned how this could happen. And sadly there's not just one place to lay the blame -- there are many failures of governance.
There's the lack of public education and awareness: today we can all check our phones for the latest weather forecast yet the Sindh government did nothing to warn people about the approaching heat wave or improve water supplies or educate people on staying cool or treating heatstroke at home.
It's the month of Ramadan when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, yet it took at least 700 deaths before a locally prominent imam reminded the Muslim faithful that the elderly or sick do not have to fast and that if you feel unwell then you can break your fast. No word from the government.
When the heat wave struck, the daily power cuts caused by a lack of electricity generation were mismanaged by federal and provincial governments. Instead of redistributing the cuts geographically or at cooler times of the day, the cuts lasted longer and some people went without electricity throughout the weekend.

EXPAND GALLERY
As the crumbling infrastructure buckled under the tremendous demand, people suffered in heat that felt like 50 degrees C without the ability to power even a small fan.
When people fell ill and rushed to hospitals across the province and city, they were met with doctors and nurses let down by their government, with not enough beds, medicines, drips, or staff.
In fact it's local people who are stepping in and stepping up -- buying hospital beds from wholesalers, providing air conditioning units and generators to run them, doing even simple things like delivering blocks of ice. I have seen people posting on social media, saying they are willing to pay for cleaners to clean the hospital. When's the last time you had to do that for your local hospital?
Is this the job of local residents or is it the job of the government?
I used to be uplifted by the sense of humanity and community spirit that finds Pakistanis rallying together to help one another. But this week it sickened me that they have to do so at all.
When tragedy strikes, as it often does in Pakistan -- be it terrorist or extremist -- we often talk about hanging our collective heads in shame. Not here, not now.  It's the politicians and the bureaucracy who should be hanging their heads in shame.
Yes, Pakistan needs to educate its people. But it also needs to educate its politicians -- in good governance. The basic principles of being effective and efficient, responsive, equitable and inclusive, participatory or even accountable, seem to have eluded the Sindh government.
In the U.S. or UK just one body left out in the heat for more than a few hours would cause national outrage. I saw many bodies, decomposing in the heat. A morgue run by a charity that couldn't do its merciful job because power cuts meant the cold storage unit was actually hot. The stench of death stifled the air. If this does not shake the government to the core then what can?

"I left the Nuba Mountains because of the war in '83. At that time, we left in a group of 57 people. Only nine of us survived the journey. I was the youngest, only seven years old.
One day, my father was very sick and he began to tell me the names of all of my uncles. When he finished he died. I stayed for seven more years until the people signed a peace agreement, which was in 2005.
I said to myself, let me see what will happen. After six years I prepared to go back to my homeland, but when I was about to start my journey the war broke out. I thought, 'I'll never see my family. I will die as my father died.'
Then people began to arrive from the Nuba Mountains to the camp. The first person I spoke to turned out to be my uncle. It was the best moment of my life. This is why I am happy. Because I have found my relatives."

A death trap for al Qaeda leaders?

Al Qaeda in Yemen confirms leader's death, replacement 01:30
Story highlights
Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader is reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike
David Sterman: Since AQAP seized Yemeni port, four leaders have died in drone strikes
David Sterman is a program associate specializing in counterterrorism at New America , a Washington-based think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
(CNN)
Much attention is being devoted to analyzing the significance of the death of Nasir al-Wuhayshi , the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the No. 2 leader for al Qaeda globally, in a reported U.S. drone strike last week.
After all, he was the organization's second-ranking leader and headed the al Qaeda affiliate that has been consistently portrayed as the one that poses the greatest threat to the United States -- even more dangerous than ISIS, the breakaway al Qaeda affiliate and center of media focus, according to former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell.
David Sterman
That view was shared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which  tweeted: "We continue to assess that AQAP remains the al-Qa'ida affiliate most likely to attempt transnational attacks against the United States" as the President laid out his justification for strikes on ISIS.
Al-Wuhayshi had the personal history to back up his claim as leader of the most threatening terrorist group. He was Osama bin Laden's personal secretary and body guard and was with the core al Qaeda leadership as it fled Afghanistan. He spent time in a Yemeni prison before escaping and becoming the leader of the newly formed AQAP.
Yet as interesting as the man is the place where he was reportedly killed. The strike occurred in Al Mukalla, a Yemeni port in the province of Hadramaut and the fifth-largest city in Yemen.
AQAP seized Al Mukalla in early April amid the chaos precipitated by Houthi rebel advances. AQAP's seizure of the city prompted extensive worry regarding the group's resurgence buoyed by the conflict.
For example, The New York Times ran an article headlined "War in Yemen Is Allowing Qaeda Group to Expand," quoting Jamal Benomar, a U.N. diplomat who had been tasked with achieving political reconciliation in the country, as saying, "For the first time, al Qaeda is building a strategic alliance with the tribes," and, "It is a strengthened and dangerous al Qaeda. This is what worries everybody."
While it is clear that AQAP has made great strides, there is another story in Al Mukalla -- a story of the constraints on jihadist power. Since AQAP seized the city, the United States conducted five drone strikes in the city's vicinity, according to data collected by New America. That constitutes nearly half of the strikes the United States has conducted in Yemen so far in 2015.
Those five strikes have ripped holes in AQAP's leadership. Four AQAP leaders have been killed in Al Mukalla since the group seized the city. Al-Wuhayshi was reportedly killed in Al Mukalla on Friday. On April 22, a drone strike killed Muhannad Ghallab , a 35-year-old Egyptian who acted as an AQAP spokesman in the city.
Also in April, Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, the senior AQAP commander who appeared in a video claiming responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris by the Kouachi brothers, was killed by drone strike in Al Mukalla. And on April 13, a drone strike killed Ibrahim al Rubeish, a 35-year-old Saudi and former Guantanamo Bay prisoner, who served as a top spokesman and ideologue for the group.
By taking Al Mukalla, AQAP gained much but also placed its leadership in a death trap. The deaths reveal the risks jihadist terrorist groups take by seizing territory. Even ISIS, the group that has made the most dramatic territorial gains when it conducted a blitzkrieg across northern Iraq, faced a similar challenge when its advances opened its forces up to the devastating effect of American air power.
Of course, leadership deaths do not necessarily mean the end of an organization , and AQAP may still benefit overall from seizing the city. Though the subject of much debate, various studies have found leadership decapitation to have at most a limited effect on a terrorist group's fortunes.
Other recent research suggests that decapitation can lead to more, and less selective, violence on the part of terrorist groups. Moreover, while air power is great at stopping advances, and also quite effective in killing selected leaders, it has a poor record in dislodging terrorist groups from territory they've seized.
Despite these cautions, the recent wave of leadership deaths in Al Mukalla suggests there are real constraints on a group's ability to take advantage of instability and seize territory, even in a situation as chaotic as the war raging in Yemen.

        <MainBody>U.S. confirms al Qaeda leader killed in Yemen 01:58
Story highlights
Several high-level terror leaders have been killed in the Middle East
Bergen: Just picking off the leaders of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda isn't an effective strategy
Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad."
(CNN)
American counterterrorism officials have had much to celebrate in recent days: the killing of ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf in Syria and the trove of "intel" that was taken from his residence by U.S. special forces; the death of the leader of al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi , in a drone strike; and the possible death in Libya of Mokhtar Belmokhtar , the leader of a virulent North African jihadist group.
But the leadership of these groups is generally replaceable. Consider the case of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the brutal head of al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS, until he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006.
Peter Bergen
Since then, a number of other leaders from al-Zarqawi's group have been killed, but that did not prevent from ISIS becoming ISIS -- a group that today lords over millions of people and occupies territory in Syria and Iraq that is around the size of the United Kingdom.
To be sure, any counterterrorism campaign that eliminates many leaders of a group can have a real impact -- al Qaeda's core group in Pakistan is a shadow of what it once was, in part, because of a deadly campaign of CIA drone strikes that eliminated many of its leaders and middle managers.
Yet, if we zoom out to the bigger picture, from Libya on the northern coast of Africa to Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the spaces in which jihadist militant groups can operate have greatly opened up as a result of the early promise of the Arab Spring turning into the grim reality of the Arab winter. The resulting chaotic conditions and weakened states have proven a boon to ISIS and to al Qaeda and its affiliates:
-- In Yemen, al Qaeda has taken advantage of the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Hadi government to seize control of large swaths of southern Yemen, including the country's fifth largest city, Mukalla.
-- In Libya, jihadist groups including ISIS control about a tenth of the country, according to a senior U.S. government official.
-- In Syria, al-Qaeda's local affiliate, the Nusra Front, together with ISIS are now the most powerful groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and each control large sections of the country.
-- In Iraq, ISIS controls the second largest city, Mosul, and much of Anbar province, which is about a third of the landmass of the country.
What to do about all this is a puzzle because much of Middle East is in the grip of a regional, sectarian civil war fomented by Iran and the Gulf States and is evolving into a Rubik's Cube-like problem that has no good solution, because when you move one piece of the cube it can create both solutions and a new set of problems simultaneously.
To get a sense of how complex this Rubik's Cube is: Consider that the United States is training Syrian opposition  forces  to fight the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad, while it is also training Iraqi forces of the Iran-backed Iraqi government to fight ISIS. The U.S. therefore is effectively supporting both sides of the wars in Syria and Iraq.
Describing problems is always, of course, much easier than solving them, but here are some ideas that can help the U.S. achieve its strategic goals in the Middle East -- dismantling ISIS and al Qaeda and avoiding a long-running sectarian regional civil war:
Curtail the foreign fighter flow
ISIS is taking around 1,000 casualties a month in U.S.-led airstrikes, yet it's also recruiting around 1,000 "foreign fighters" from around the Muslim world every month, so the military campaign against ISIS is something of a draw.
The U.S. should put pressure on Middle Eastern countries, which supply the bulk of the foreign fighters to the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts, to curtail the flow of their nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has already made some strides in that direction, but this should also be a priority for other Arab governments.
Let American soldiers go forward
The exact number of U.S. troops in Iraq is not the germane issue right now. It's the constrictive rules of engagement that have been imposed upon them that prevent them from getting "outside the wire" of the bases that they are assigned to. What is needed are rules of engagement that allow U.S. forward air controllers calling in precise airstrikes as well as U.S. advisers embedded with Iraqi troops on the frontlines. Not only will this help to place more accurate air strikes on ISIS positions, but also Iraqi troops with embedded Americans will have better military advice and  the comfort of knowing that they will get close American air support if ISIS threatens them. Right now that isn't the case.
Step up the air campaign in Syria and Iraq
One of the world's experts on counterinsurgency, New America fellow David Kilcullen suggests increasing the tempo of of the air campaign. Kilcullen points out that the average rate of  coalition air strikes since last August into Syria and Iraq is about 10 per day, while in the successful air campaign against the Serbs in Kosovo in 1999, it was around 250 per day, suggesting that the U.S.-led coalition can still ratchet up the pressure on ISIS significantly.
Resist calls to split Iraq up into Sunnistan, Shiastan and Kurdistan
Iraq is a country where many of its citizens are products of Shia-Sunni marriages and cities like Mosul and Baghdad remain mixtures of many ethnic and religious groups. Trying to separate out Iraq into sectarian and ethnic cantons will only fuel the sectarian passions in Iraq and in the region. The model to avoid, albeit on a larger scale, was the disastrous 1947 partition of India into Muslim- and Hindu-majority states in which 1 million people died.
If the Iran nuclear deal gets done, use it as leverage to show al-Assad the door
Use the goodwill tendered by a deal with Iran to have the Iranians pressure their close ally, al-Assad, to step down, while maintaining much of his regime in place. That way the coalition of Alawites, Christians and other regime supporters will be assured that if al-Assad goes, they won't have to go down with him and will have a stake in some kind of peace deal, rather than fighting to the death.
Keep pressure on the Saudis not to resume their counterproductive air campaign in Yemen
That campaign had the effect of further fracturing the already-fracturing country, which has benefited al Qaeda.

The Rohingya are a persecuted Muslim minority who are effectively stateless in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are forced to live in crowded camps -- which they are generally forbidden to leave --  and are considered to be interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, despite the fact that many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

David Scott Mathieson says Myanmar is facing rising Buddhist extremism
New laws look set to target Rohingya Muslims, he says
David Scott Mathieson is the senior Burma researcher for Human Rights Watch. The views expressed are his own.
(CNN)
The impact of Myanmar's repressive policy toward Rohingya Muslims was made clear in recent weeks with scenes of desperate people crammed into boats, an escalation of a miserable maritime flight in which an estimated 90,000 people have fallen prey to smugglers and traffickers since early 2014. The United Nations estimates that around 1,000 people have died on the way.
The root cause is the long-term reprehensible treatment of the Rohingya in Myanmar (also known as Burma) -- stateless, officially and socially reviled, with severe curbs on their rights to work, travel, get health care and education, and practice their religion.
Yet even as this anguishing exodus has gripped international attention, it has obscured a connected and equally troubling pattern of rising religious extremism in Myanmar. At the height of the boat drama, parliament passed the " population control law ," which permits the government to identify areas in Myanmar that could be subject to repressive birth control measures. The law was inspired by Buddhist extremists whose stated agenda is opposition not just to Rohingya, but to all of Myanmar's sizable Muslim minority. The law was sharply criticized by many activists in Myanmar and opposed by the opposition National League for Democracy, but passed a joint parliamentary vote, 530 to 443, with 39 abstentions.
The population control law is one element of a package of four "race and religion protection" bills. The other elements are an interfaith marriage bill, which grants government oversight of any marriage between a Buddhist and non-Buddhist; a religious conversion law, which requires government permission to change one's religion; and a monogamy law, which could limit the rights of people living in unmarried relationships and potentially target Muslims.
These laws were proposed by the increasingly influential Race and Religion Protection Association, known by its Burmese acronym, Ma Ba Tha, consisting of prominent Buddhist abbots. The problem is that Ma Ba Tha has tapped into a deep and divisive strain of ethnic Burmese ultranationalism and a belief in Buddhist religious supremacy that has contributed to vexed and violent relations with scores of ethnic minorities since independence from the British in 1948. U Wirathu, Myanmar's most vitriolic Buddhist monk, infuses his regular public rallies with populist paranoia over a nonexistent Islamic takeover of Myanmar.
To push for passage of these discriminatory laws, the Ma Ba Tha staged public events throughout Myanmar and collected nearly 1.5 million signatures. The purportedly reformist government of President Thein Sein, pandering to Ma Ba Tha's agenda, then drafted similar pieces of legislation and submitted them to parliament.
There are fears that the three remaining draft laws will pass in this final parliamentary sitting ahead of the first ostensibly free national elections in decades later this year -- and possibly fuel anti-Muslim violence during what will be a very tense period. After all, a surge of violence in 2012, which amounted to ethnic cleansing , displaced about 140,000 Rohingya, who languish in squalid camps. At the same time, security restrictions on the estimated 1 million Rohingya in areas abutting the Bangladeshi border have been tightened. Several incidents of anti-Muslim violence in the past two years have caused dozens of deaths.
Myanmar's Rohingya: terrorized, starving and homeless
Last month, local authorities and Thein Sein's office denied permission to hold a Union Muslims Nationwide Conference in Yangon, citing its potential for instability. On June 2, a court in upper Myanmar sentenced a writer and former National League for Democracy official to two years in jail with hard labor for "insulting religion," over a 2014 speech defending the purity of Buddhism from Ma Ba Tha's political distortion.
Diplomats in the country realize that the race and religion laws could spark not only attacks on Muslims but justifications for government crackdowns. The United States, European Union and numerous United Nations officials have therefore conveyed their deep concern, although Burmese officials have rejected this out of hand.
Meanwhile, many Muslims see the laws as just one part of a long-term plan to extirpate the Rohingya and other Muslims from the country, and there is a danger that all this could lead to the collapse of the nascent political reforms over the past four years that have led to the beginnings of economic development, increased international assistance and direct foreign investment that are crucial to help pull Myanmar from the hole dug by 50 years of dictatorial military rule.
By mining the darker nature of Myanmar's Buddhists, religious extremists and the political opportunists who seek to profit from them are thwarting the aspirations of generations who have struggled for democracy and openness. Sadly, the extremism reflected in the laws suggests a future of even greater violence and division.

Dirty bomb: Just how worried should we be as ISIS seeks ultimate threat?

Rescue workers take part in a trial in 2008 in Tokyo, Japan, to improve the city's response to a "dirty bomb" attack.
Story highlights
Radioactive sources acquired by ISIS cannot be used to create a nuclear bomb
The real threat from dirty bombs lies in their psychological and economic effects
Economic costs associated with a dirty bomb would be considerable

(CNN)
Last week, the news emerged that ISIS terrorists have reportedly obtained radioactive materials from hospitals and research facilities captured in Iraq with a view to developing a radioactive "dirty bomb."
Unsurprisingly, the prospect of ISIS dabbling with unconventional weapons has been greeted with considerable concern. The Iraqi government has appealed to the United Nations for international help to "stave off the threat" in this regard and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently acknowledged that NATO countries are deeply concerned by the situation.
But what can ISIS actually do with these newly acquired radioactive materials? What is the nature of the threat?
First off, it is important to emphasize that radioactive sources of the type acquired by ISIS cannot be used to create a nuclear bomb. These sources are mostly used for medical research and treatments such as radiotherapy, and are completely unsuited to the development of nuclear weapons.
This said, the harmful effects of these sources, stemming from their chemical toxicity and radioactive properties, can be exploited in other ways. If inhaled or ingested, for example, these materials can be lethal. This was evidenced by the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, when just a fraction of a gram of radioactive polonium proved enough to kill the former KGB officer.
Fortunately, achieving this type of internal exposure on a large scale would prove enormously challenging for a terrorist group. Consequently, attention has focused on the use of these materials by ISIS in a dirty bomb.
Combining radioactive materials with conventional explosives, this is a bomb with an edge. A dirty bomb would spread radioactive materials, contaminating the local area and any individuals in the nearby vicinity. Crucially, however, this contamination would be mostly external in nature and, if the attack was promptly identified as being radioactive, decontamination of individuals would be a relatively straightforward process. The exposure time of anyone affected would be limited and the negative health effects mitigated.
Indeed, with a dirty bomb, members of the public are more likely to be harmed by the impact of the conventional explosives than that of the radioactive materials.
This point was borne out by a series of tests conducted over a four-year period by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in the Negev Desert. As part of this project - details of which were recently published by Haaretz -- some 20 devices laced with radioactive materials were detonated and their effects observed. The IDF concluded that a dirty bomb attack poses little physical danger beyond the conventional blast.

The real threat from dirty bombs lies in their psychological and economic effects -- a fact that often sees these devices described as weapons of mass disruption rather than weapons of mass destruction.
From a psychological perspective, for example, nuclear weapons are associated with death and destruction on an enormous scale, and dirty bombs benefit from association with these more sophisticated weapons simply because they incorporate radioactive materials.
There is an important distinction to be made between nuclear and radiological materials but this is often lost in media reports and commentary on these issues. In any case, a dirty bomb detonated in a major urban center would be sure to cause widespread fear and panic.
The economic costs associated with a dirty bomb would also be considerable. A 2011 Congressional Research Service report , for example, suggested that the clean-up after such an attack could figure in the billions of dollars, if detonated in a high-value area such as city center or port. Little wonder, then, that the security of radiological sources has emerged as a politically salient issue in recent years.
Ultimately, while the thought of ISIS using dirty bombs to further its terrorist agenda is unsettling, the threat should not be exaggerated, particularly when it comes to its impact on public health. These are not the nuclear weapons that ISIS supposedly desires , and will do nothing to further the group's ambitions in this regard.

        <MainBody>On GPS: The horrific ways ISIS abuses women 02:12
Story highlights
Zainab Hawa Bangura visited refugees who fled Iraq, Syria conflict
Sexual violence is being committed against women strategically, she says
Zainab Hawa Bangura is the United Nations special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict and serves as the United Nations' spokesperson and political advocate on conflict-related sexual violence. The views expressed are her own.
(CNN)
Nothing prepared me for what I saw and heard when I visited refugees from the conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
As I traveled to Iraq and Syria, and to neighboring countries of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to meet with refugees and displaced women, I heard firsthand the horrifying stories of how they have been targeted in this conflict.
I was told, for example, how mothers with babies were separated out by members of ISIL (also known as ISIS) because it is the younger women who they want to take. I heard how these younger women are examined to see if they are virgins, and how the younger and prettier they are, the more likely they are to get taken to ISIL's headquarters in Raqqa. And I heard how the rest are taken to open markets, where they will end up being auctioned after being examined like cattle.
I was in the Middle East as the special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict, and while I had been monitoring the situation since the crisis began, this was the first time I was able to visit those who have been disproportionately affected by the conflict.
Zainab Hawa Bangura
The refugees and displaced women and girls I met told me how sexual violence is being committed strategically, in a systematic manner, and with a high degree of sophistication by most of the parties to the conflicts. Indeed, as I moved from country to country, I came to the terrible conclusion that this is in essence a war on women and girls, a group that finds itself under assault every day, and every step of the way, whether it be in areas of active conflict, those under control of armed actors, or at checkpoints and border crossings.
But while it is true that most parties to the conflict are committing sexual violence, it is extremist groups like ISIL that have been particularly public and shameless in institutionalizing sexual violence and engaging in the brutalization of women and girls as a tactic of terror to advance their key strategic objectives.
ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK
For a start, it is clear that ISIL has been working to increase recruitment by promising male fighters access to women and girls. In addition, the group has been raising funds through the sale of women and girls in slave markets and through ransoms paid by relatives. And the group has also been using sexual violence to displace populations, while also using the threat of sexual violence to extract information for intelligence purposes.
Women and girls I spoke with described being treated as property to be owned and traded, or else as vessels for producing children for fighters. In ISIL strongholds in Syria and Iraq, Raqqa and Mosul, women and girls are held in houses and buildings before they are inspected, selected and sold in "bazaars" where prices can be negotiated. Simply put, we have been witnessing the revival of the slave trade in the 21st century.
What can and should we do? Such extreme violence requires political and security responses, but also legal and social response.
For a start, all parties to the conflicts, both state and nonstate actors, have an obligation under international humanitarian law to prevent and punish such crimes. Second, U.N. agencies need greater support to be able to provide the necessary assistance and to be able to respond to the needs of the affected population, particularly women and girls who are suffering even in the places where they are seeking refuge. The reality is that the humanitarian appeals dealing with the provision of services to sexual violence survivors are underfunded, and neighboring countries are now also under tremendous pressure. Greater support is therefore needed not only for programs for refugees, but also to support host communities of neighboring countries that have absorbed an estimated 80% of the refugees.
'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS
To address the transnational nature of ISIL, and the cross-border dimensions of the conflicts raging in the region, a concerted regional and international response is required, including improved information sharing across countries and a common counterterrorism response with women's protection and empowerment at its heart.
Such a response should also look at the root causes of violent extremism, something that we cannot ignore any longer. Preventing abuses will require deeper engagement with communities, including with traditional and religious leaders who can help break the silence surrounding sexual violence and ensure that it is the perpetrators who are shamed and stigmatized, not the victims. In fact, if there was a glimmer of hope during my visit, it was the statement issued by the supreme spiritual leader of the Yazidi community, who said that women and girls released from ISIL captivity should be embraced and reintegrated by their families and communities. Countering ISIL's violent ideology will mean accepting these women and girls -- and any children they may have -- in a spirit of tolerance, dignity and respect.
Ultimately, we cannot beat ISIL without understanding who they are, where they come from, and what their ideology is. The group presents a very formidable enemy, one that we must fight together.

Sex is bound up in shame for many in Mideast -- particularly women, says Shereen El Feki
El Feki: Cairo comedian's humorous take on sex is a welcome development
El Feki: Change will come slowly -- evolution, not revolution, is what's needed
Shereen El Feki is the author of "Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World," a study of changing sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Got a question for Shereen? Let us know in the comments -- we'll answer some of the best ones Thursday on Connect the World at 11:00 a.m. ET.
Cairo, Egypt (CNN)
In a packed Cairo theater a couple of months ago, Ali Qandil brought down the house.
"Why do Egyptian fathers cry at their daughters' weddings?" the comedian asked the crowd. "Because they know their little girls will be having sex for the first time."
In Egypt's current conservative climate, Qandil's well-aimed thrust at sexual taboos was enough to send the audience into stitches, even as the theater management reached for its smelling salts.
The show was courtesy of Al-Hubb Thaqafa ("Love is Culture"), a groundbreaking social media platform offering straight talk on love, sex and relationships in Arabic. Launched just over a year ago, its website, YouTube channel and social feeds have attracted more than nine million visitors, mainly from Egypt and Morocco.
Al-Hubb Thaqafa's no-nonsense approach to sex, offering accurate information on everything from the basic facts of life to the finer points of fellatio, is a welcome development in a region where teachers are often too embarrassed to communicate even the barebones sexual and reproductive curriculum on offer, and parents generally draw a veil of silence over such topics with their kids.
For Ali Qandil, sex is an endless source of humor -- just as it is anywhere else in the world. But on the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region.
In recent weeks, accounts of the arrest and abuse of dozens of gay men and transsexual women in Egypt, or mass sexual exploitation under ISIS' reign of terror, or Morocco's recent ban on a new film which lays bare the country's thriving sex trade, do little to dispel the image of societies mired in sexual repression.
But by emphasizing sex as a pleasure to be enjoyed, rather than a problem to be solved, Al-Hubb Thaqafa hearkens to a long tradition of free and frank exchange on sexual matters in Arabic. Short of cybersex and internet porn, there isn't much its platforms tackle that our forefathers from weren't writing about more than a millennium ago.

There is nothing un-Islamic about talking about sex; indeed, many of the great works of Arabic erotica were written by religious scholars.  But over the centuries, and in particular in recent decades with rise of Islamic fundamentalism, societies across the Arab region have become far less comfortable in their sexual skin.
Al-Hubb Thaqafa offers a chance (in part by reclaiming Arabic as a language of sexuality and offering a "respectable" alternative to street slang) for men and women to talk each other about sex -- asking questions, sharing personal experiences and contesting each other's opinions without the usual embarrassment or censure.
Such opportunities are all too rare offline. It's been two years since I published "Sex and the Citadel" -- a five-year investigation into sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region, and their intersection with politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations. Since then, the grand political aspirations which fed the Arab Spring have either frosted over, as in Egypt, or burnt up in the conflagration now consuming Libya, Yemen and Syria.
Sex might seem an odd focus these days, given all the other pressing issues in the region. But it is never far from politics, as authoritarian powers -- be they military-backed presidents or religious extremists -- know only too well, using matters of flesh, wrapped in selective interpretations of Islam, to clamp down on their communities.
This is sadly true beyond the borders of the Middle East as well. But the converse also holds. Realizing the rallying cries of the recent uprisings -- "freedom", "justice" and "dignity" -- in private life will, in the long run, have profound implications for public life as well.
When it comes to sex, it is never black and white, as conservatives would have us believe. In this, as with so many other aspects of life, there are at least 50 shades of gray.
On my travels, I've met men and women across the Arab region who are exploring that spectrum. Doctors like Chafik Chraibi, a Moroccan obstetrician whose efforts to open up his country's restrictive abortion laws have helped to catalyze a recent small step in legal reform. Educators like Safa Tamish, a Palestinian living in Israel, who is working to get sex education into schools and families across the West Bank. Or activists like the founders of Chouf and Damj , two new Tunisian NGOS, which are among the dozens of groups across the region trying to find a place for men and women whose sexualities or gender identities break the mold.
There are many, many more such initiatives -- combating sexual violence, or securing the rights of unwed mothers or providing sexual health services to unmarried youth, for example -- springing up across the Middle East, often on very rocky ground. The most successful work slowly, along the grain of religion and culture.
Confrontation -- be it political protests in Tahrir Square or Femen -style baring of breasts -- is not the way to achieve tangible, durable change in the Arab region, as recent events have clearly demonstrated.
For too many -- particularly women -- sex is still bound up in shame, which makes it a powerful tool of political and social control. Sexual freedoms are hard to exercise when family interests trump individual choice, or when appearance counts for more than reality -- when virginity is defined by a piece of anatomy -- an intact hymen -- rather than a state of chastity, or when prostitution masquerades as marriage between wealthy visitors and desperate refugees.
Shifting the political, economic and social conditions which underpin these realities is the work of a generation at least. But at least in a few places, positive change is slowly taking root. As my Egyptian grandmother used to say, "If there were seeds for patience, I would have planted fields." In other words, what we need is a sexual evolution, not revolution.

The images are heartrending : Desperate families fleeing fighting, frantically trying to get their small children across the barbed wire fence separating Syria from Turkey. On the other side of the fence are bearded fighters from the self-styled Islamic State armed with machine guns and smiling coldly as they patrol thousands of civilians trapped on the Syrian side. The gunmen have reportedly been forcing those trying to flee to return to their homes in the war zone.
But while the border is where the cameras are, more pivotal events are taking place a few miles away, where ISIS is on the verge of suffering a potentially devastating loss -- the strategic city Tal Abyad and its surrounding areas. The defeat appears poised to come at the hands of the YPG, the Kurdish People's Protection Units, whose fighters, men and women, a few months ago liberated the devastated city of Kobani.

Now, with air support from the U.S.-led coalition, they are preparing to deal a significant blow to ISIS. According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Kurds have already taken back from ISIS some 50 towns and villages . Meanwhile, Turkish officials say about 20,000 villagers , fearing getting trapped in the intensifying battles, are trying to cross into Turkey.
If the Kurds take Tal Abyad, as seems likely, they will cut off a key supply route into the ISIS "capital" in Syria, Raqqa. If you look at a map of the region, you can see why this is so significant -- Raqqa is the strongest of ISIS strongholds, meaning that if it weakens, ISIS will become considerably more vulnerable.
This crucial battle, at a time when the United States is struggling to find a way forward against ISIS in Iraq, comes loaded with useful messages for Washington. Some key points:
1. It is possible to beat ISIS without strengthening the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Almost four years ago, President Barack Obama and European allies declared that "Assad must go." But as the opposition to al-Assad's rule morphed from a pro-democracy movement into an increasingly radical Islamist insurgency, Washington viewed Syria as offering only bad choices -- an al-Assad dictatorship or radical Islamist rule.
It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, as moderate rebels were left with little material support and slowly wilted. Extremists grew stronger, and al-Assad became even more brutal, using chemical weapons and barrel bombs in a war that has killed more than 200,000 people . It seemed as if no positive outcome was conceivable.
But now Kurdish forces are advancing, helped by U.S. bombings and the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army, showing that it is possible to push against ISIS without helping al-Assad.
2. Success will breed success and help unify the opposition.
One reason moderates have ended up so weak is that extremists, well-armed and financed, kept winning battle after battle. Nothing begets success like success. Many of the fighters who back Islamist groups do so only because they view them as likely victors in the battle against al-Assad. If the Kurds and other secular forces start winning battles, more fighters will be drawn to their side.
If the Kurds and their Free Syrian Army backers can win against ISIS and keep fighting, with U.S. and European support, against al-Assad, then there is a chance that the Syrian war could ultimately be brought to an end and create a pluralistic, moderate regime, which is what history tells us the Syrian people would prefer.
3. Another important message contained in the events of the past few days is that the United States can play a major role in defeating ISIS without flooding the battlefield and committing boots-on-the-ground.
But ultimately a political solution is needed.
The Kurds, legendarily fierce fighters, have proved themselves time and again. With strong U.S. support from the air and U.S.-provided arms, they could win. Nobody will fight harder to protect Kurdish territory than the Kurds. That is true in Syria and in Iraq.
Yet while ending the war in Syria and Iraq will require battlefield victories, more than anything it will require political change. In Iraq, Sunnis will not take on ISIS with all their might if they think it will only leave them under the heel of a sectarian government interested only in protecting the Shiites. In Syria, the fight against ISIS will not succeed unless the majority of the people believe there is a way to get rid of al-Assad.
4. Turkey's motivations will prove confusing, at best.
The Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has two goals: to see the end of the al-Assad regime and to prevent the Kurds from growing stronger. Turkey has received millions of Syrian refugees, but it also stood by while Kurds were killed in Koban i and has shown little enthusiasm for Kurdish victories. It sees the YPG as an extension of violent Kurdish separatists in Turkey. And armed Kurds, winning battles against ISIS, spark fears that their battle will pivot to establishing their own country.
5. A final, dispiriting lesson is that civilians will become caught up in the fighting, their suffering exploited for political and tactical gain.
Turkey has at times tried to prevent civilians from entering .  Others accused the Kurds of "ethnic cleansing" Arabs. But refugees, including Arabs, reportedly cheered news of Kurdish victories.
So, back to those images of ISIS fighters laughing from the Syrian side of the border? Why were they herding villagers back to the battlefield? One theory is that ISIS wanted them back so they could be used as human shields and prevent the United States from carrying out more bombing raids against ISIS.
Regardless, for the Syrian people, the suffering continues even as Kurdish fighters continue to make gains. Just one more reason for the rest of the world to do what it can to find a way to bring an end to this terrible war.

Street children generally do not believe that their identity has anything to do with the names given to them by their parents, Macilau said. When they arrive on the streets, many develop new identities that are tied to their interests and things they like. "My name is Cowboy because I like to dress like cowboys," said this 14-year-old. "I know my hat is different from the ones they wear, but I try my best to be like them with what I can get."

Mario Macilau photographed children who are growing up on the streets of Mozambique
Some have been abandoned; others are working to make money for their families
(CNN)
Many of us travel through streets each and every day so we can get to our homes. But for the children documented in photographer Mario Macilau's "Growing in Darkness" series, the streets are their homes.
The title refers to how some children in Maputo, Mozambique, are forced to literally grow up in darkness as they find themselves seeking refuge in places without electricity.
"I entered into their private spaces: bridges and abandoned buildings where they live and sleep. These places (are) very dark, damp and pernicious," Macilau said via email. "In these makeshift places, there are no facilities, light, water or any other form of domestic support."
The darkness is also a symbolic representation of the children's condition. It is as though society allows the literal lack of light to conceal the situation, rendering the children overlooked.
Photographer Mario Macilau
"We forget that (these children) are humans as we are. We ignore the fact that they have feelings and that they dream as well," Macilau said. "The main issue in Maputo today is the ignorance from each person to another -- (it) is the same thing that happens with (these) children. They are in the street because of our ignorance and ego."
There are various reasons children are forced to live on the streets. Some have been abandoned by their families, while others have moved into the capital city to earn money for their loved ones.
The project is particularly personal for Macilau, a Maputo native who carried groceries and washed cars as a child to help his family with finances.
All of Macilau's photos were shot in natural light and developed using a pigmented inkjet technique, resulting in a black-and-white photo series that provides a hauntingly rich and raw portrait of these children's lives.
"My aim was to go where everyone advised me not to go," Macilau said. "I was determined to reach the sight that seemed to frighten many."
Social media
Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.
Having initially visited his subjects without a camera, Macilau says he and the children were able to develop a mutual trust and sense of safety.
"It is from this position of a friend that I managed to capture their existence: the adversity of their environments, the endurance of their young but possibly condemned bodies, and their resilience that, daily, defies the inhumanity of their hardships," he said.
Macilau's photos present everything from children sleeping and seeking shelter from the rain to dressing up as cowboys and ninjas.
The power and permanence of the images stem not only from the subject matter, but also Macilau's decision to shoot in black and white. He notes how viewers are more likely to retain the images in their memories because the lack of color enhances the details and deep, poetic significance that lives within each photo.
The photos also raise questions regarding the role society plays in the growth of its children. He notes that many of the children are engaged in forms of child labor, meaning they are vital participants and contributors to the functioning of Maputo. Macilau asks: "What is our role in this? How can we remedy their unfavorable situation?"
Macilau effectively sheds light upon a situation that is simultaneously so visible and invisible.
"Spending time with them reveals their charming sensibilities, human gestures and the immensity of their heart," Macilau said.

Photographer Raffaele Petralla documented brick factories in Bangladesh's capital
He spent time with the workers who make low wages and suffer from the fumes in the fields
(CNN)
Raffaele Petralla, a documentary photographer based in Rome, was struck by what he witnessed when he first arrived on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka.
"I saw hundreds and hundreds of chimneys around me. It was a landscape of smoke and chimneys," he said.
Petralla was in Bangladesh to document the brick factories that cluster around Dhaka. The first photo he took, capturing the moment he arrived in spring 2014, shows chimney stacks belching black smoke into a heavy grey sky above a watery but bleak industrial landscape.
He was to stay for two months, living among the brick workers to get a real understanding of their difficult lives.
"Near each factory there was the village of the workers, so there were all the families that work inside the factories," he said. "The houses were very bad -- only 1.5 meters high, so you can't even stand up inside -- and (they were) without electricity."
To make matters worse, he said, the tin-roofed houses were very, very hot inside, thanks to 100-degree temperatures outside and heat rising from the underground brick furnaces.
Photographer Raffaele Petralla
As many as 10 people, often from three generations, would be living in a house measuring only 3 or 4 square meters (33-43 square feet), he said.
One of Petralla's images, No. 3 in the gallery above, shows five young men inside one of these houses in the Gazipur area. Their faces show little expression, but their shoulders are uncomfortably stooped.
Petralla soon discovered that all those living in the workers' community had come from other parts of Bangladesh, mostly tiny rural villages far from big cities. They were lured by the promise of decent housing and a wage that would sustain them even in the months when the factories are closed.
One man Petralla met was 19-year-old Saddam. Saddam's account revealed how many of the workers find themselves trapped in a daily nightmare.
Saddam "told me one day a man came to the village with a very big car, dressed like a rich man, and he promised him a job and also one for all the family if they came with him to the capital city," Petralla said.
The family decided to go. Some days later, trucks arrived in the village and carried many of its people to the factory.
Social media

"They received a promise to have a good job, to have a house, and they could leave after a year of work and go home. But at the end of the work season, they didn't have any money to go back," Petralla said.
Just change the name of the village, and Petralla heard the same story over and over again.
And it isn't just adults who are trapped in the brick factories. With wages kept miserably low, the families need every salary they can get just to survive -- and this means children as young as 6 work long hours, too, Petralla said. Their pay is the same as that for adults, based on the number of bricks transported daily in woven baskets loaded onto their heads. Petralla's images capture some of these children at work, dusty and often barefoot, in the brick fields.
Because many of the brick factories are illegal, Petralla said, the owners are wary of strangers, particularly journalists. So he pretended to be a tourist fascinated by the colors of the bricks, smoke and dust.
When the boss left each day, he stayed with the workers, took out his camera and documented their lives close up.
"They feel like they have a promise to change their lives, their economic position. But in reality, they didn't have access to medicine, they had money only for food," Petralla said. Some people fall ill, particularly with respiratory problems. But they can't stop working or they have no way to live.
"Maybe there's no way to escape," Petralla said. "I think most of them are not educated, they are illiterate people, and they don't know how they can escape from this situation."
The government has promised to tackle the problem of the brick factories and the choking pollution they produce, Petralla said, but they still continue.
According to a World Bank report last year, brick fields across Bangladesh expel more than 9.8 million tons of greenhouse gases into the air each year "due to a combination of old technology, weak environmental legislation and enforcement and lack of corporate responsibility."
The website of the Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forests outlines plans to cut the fumes emitted from brick fields by introducing cleaner technology and practices, as well as closer monitoring, through the Clean Air and Sustainable Environment Project.
The pollution is causing serious health hazards, Petralla said. The brick kilns spew out vapor that is harmful to eyes, lungs and throats. These pollutants pose a risk to children's physical and mental development.
There's also a heavy environmental cost beyond the air pollution the brick kilns cause, particularly since forests are cut down to provide fuel for the furnaces.
Meanwhile, the brick workers serve the rapid development of Bangladesh's cities. But what, Petralla asks, do they gain from such growth?
"They are only slaves of it, and they cannot use their production," he said.  "It's pure injustice."

Mexican painter Frida Kahlo works on her now-famous "Portrait of My Father" in 1951. As well-known for her independence as she is for her portraits, Kahlo is the subject of a new book containing never-before-seen pictures of her private life. "Frida Kahlo: The Gisele Freund Photographs" is published by Abrams and offers an intimate glimpse inside the world of the late artist.

        <MainBody>At least 14 killed by Al-Shabaab in Kenya 01:58
Story highlights
Official says estimated number of attackers is between 10 and 15
An Al-Shabaab spokesman says the attack killed Kenyan Christians
The attack targeted a compound in Mandera County that primarily housed quarry workers
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)
Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility Tuesday for a nighttime attack on two homes in northeastern Kenya's Mandera County.
The attack killed at least 14 people and injured 11 others, according to Mandera County Commissioner Alex Nkoyo.
The compound housed primarily quarry workers.
The attack began around 1 a.m. when a group of men using a variety of weapons attacked the compound, Nkoyo told CNN.
The commissioner said an explosive device -- something other than a hand grenade -- was used to blow open a gate to the compound. The attackers then entered and started shooting.
Many people were sleeping outside to escape the heat. When the attack began, those who were able to do so ran inside the houses, followed by the gunmen, Nkoyo said.
Attackers disappeared into the bush
Those killed were local laborers and workers from other parts of Kenya, he said. A woman, identified as the landlady of the compound, was also among the dead, he said.
Judging by the number of bullets at the attack site, Nkoyo said, the estimated number of attackers was 10 to 15, with more as backup.
The commissioner said local security forces responded within 10 minutes, and as their vehicles approached, the attackers dispersed into the bush and surrounding villages. Some may have crossed the border into Somalia, he said.
Mandera County borders Somalia and Ethiopia.
Nkoyo said Mandera has been under heightened security since attacks there last year on a bus that killed at least 28 people and on a quarry, where 36 people were killed.
Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, said Tuesday's attack had killed more than a dozen people whom he described as Kenyan Christians.
Al-Shabaab is an Islamic terrorist group that operates primarily in Somalia.
The attack was part of Al-Shabaab's Ramadan offensive against Kenya, said the spokesman, speaking on Al-Shabaab's main broadcaster, Radio Andalus.

Borrowing from Maasai culture, the Nairobi-based brand combines shuka, a Maasai fabric normally wrapped around the body, with contemporary designs. In doing so, their products both pay homage to tradition whilst highlighting the trends of modern Kenya. The brand sells around 100 units a month. Bags go for $18, jackets $29, with Wan Fam saying they're able to make a good profit on each item.

(CNN)
The formidable Maasai tribe have long been known as tall and fierce warriors, but they have recently also become unlikely fashion icons.
A Kenyan clothing label has taken inspiration from the patterns of the traditional Maasai shuka, a cloth usually worn wrapped around the body, to produce clothes and accessories in vibrant tribal prints.
Nairobi-based Wan Fam Clothing was founded by brothers Jeff and Emmanuel Wanjala -- the sibling duo say they want to pay homage to Kenya's Maasai culture by turning a traditional garment into fashionable urban wear.
"Our dominant fabric is usually Maasai shuka," says Jeff Wanjala. "It's very ideal because it has like a signature for Africa -- you can just see it and notice that this is our brand."
The two brothers think time is right for Kenyan and other African designers to start looking inward and exploring their own heritage.
"The demand for local products has actually gone up," says Jeff Wanjala. "People are trying to get more African products, so that means it is actually a big market for local designers," he adds.
Strong demand
The brothers tried to tap into that demand for authenticity by launching a collection called 1963, commemorating 50 years of Kenya's independence. They read the consumer mood correctly, and their move resulted an astounding success:
Wan Fam Clothing makes urban garments inspired by traditional Maasai cloth called shuka.
"This was one of the best sales we ever had. We had launched it on a Friday and by Monday we had sold like half the collection," Jeff Wanjala says.
The brand, which launched in 2009, says it sells up to 100 units a month, with bags carrying a price tag of $18 and jackets $29. Their success has, however, brought them to the attention of copycats:
"Once you make a good product, automatically people start coming in, so the new clients start thinking that you are actually the one imitating the products," says Jeff  Wanjala, but adds that in spite of that challenge the company is making a profit. "Once you create a good product, you create demand," he says.
Growing trend
Wan Fam Clothing is just one in a string of African brands who have shunned imported aesthetic to focus on their own heritage for inspiration. South African knitwear designer Laduma Ngxokolo creates menswear which incorporates visual motifs of his own Xhosa heritage, and Rwandan jewelery maker Teta Isibo creates handmade pieces which fuse traditional local craftsmanship with contemporary bold designs.
Jeff Wanjala offers a piece of advice for inspiring entrepreneurs looking to start a new company:
"I would tell anyone who wants to start a local brand, don't compromise on quality. That's number one. And don't give up on whatever you love doing. Just do what you love and the rest will follow," he says.

For three weeks to June 5, the James Dalton Highway lay underwater, following ice storms that burst the banks of the Sagavanirktok "Sag" River.
The Highway has earned a permanent position on lists of the world's most dangerous roads . Stretching 414 miles through the Alaskan tundra, it is the sole route and supply line to the Arctic Ocean and its abundant oil fields. Only the most experienced drivers with heavy-duty trucks can navigate fearsome stretches with names to match from "Ice cut" to "Avalanche Alley." A breakdown in the permafrost can be quickly fatal.
Yet the Dalton is well-trafficked, with hundreds of trucks making the trip between Fairbanks and Deadhorse each day. The recent flooding caused a backlog of over 1,000 journeys and the loss of millions of dollars.

The cold rush
Alaska has become too important to ignore. Beneath the frozen surface, the land and sea are rich in precious natural resources.
Prudhoe Bay is among the largest oil fields in the continent, producing 80 million barrels of crude per day. The lucrative minerals industry is soaring , with gold, silver and zinc coming out of the ground in increasing volume. Seafood is becoming a powerhouse of the local and international economy.
The asset boom is helping local businesses to capture overseas markets - exports have doubled over 20 years to $5.2 billion in 2014 -- and is attracting international business to Alaska.
There can be a culture shock for new arrivals. Swedish engineering giant Sandvik Group employs around 50,000 people in over 100 countries, but after entering the Alaskan market as a construction and mining dealer in 2012, it had to adapt to unique conditions.
"Transportation is a challenge, especially considering that our equipment tends to be located in remote areas," says Jeff Heinemann, vice president of Sandvik Construction in North America. "The minimal infrastructure makes access by road difficult ... In remote locations, the best option for transporting people and parts could be air."
Sandvik, like many of the international companies operating in Alaska, works with a local distributor that provides the benefit of experience and insight into Alaska's working customs.
"Our customers may work around the clock in the five-six month construction season in the year or work around the clock in extreme winters," says Heinemann. "The local companies will adapt their ways of working according to the climate conditions ...We (have to) make sure our equipment is ready to go."
Building bridges
Logistics are even more demanding on the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands west of the mainland, home to some of the most plentiful fisheries in the United States. Companies rely on boats and planes for transport, which is unreliable and expensive, says Larry Cotter, CEO of APICDA , an umbrella group of seafood companies that exports all over the world.
"In the case of one plant can we can only move out products three to four times a year, so timing to market is not always on the button. Sometimes we are two months late for a sale."
The conditions are also notoriously dangerous , but demand for local fish such as Black Cod and Alaskan Salmon provides rich rewards. If Alaska were an independent nation it would be the seventh largest seafood supplier in the world, with exports worth over $3 billion a year.

"China and south-east Asia are huge growth markets," says Cotter. "China has an insatiable appetite and is making a huge impact. Fifteen years ago, 99% of Black cod went to Japan, now it's China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, along with the U.S., and Japan has to compete with them."
Cotter believes Alaska must develop its infrastructure to capitalize on this boom. Modernization of ports and harbors, and investment in renewable energy, are key priorities.
The most ambitious project is a long-mooted pipeline for LNG (liquefied natural gas) that would serve the state, as well as export to foreign markets. A $65 billion, 800-mile scheme backed by oil giants Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and BP, with support from the local authorities, is advancing through regulatory hurdles -- including a federal review of the environmental impact, which has raised concerns -- before six years of construction can begin.

The state has also made business-friendly moves, including the introduction of a trade zone that frees international companies from tariff requirements. Alaska's airports have the most liberal laws in the United States for foreign companies transferring cargo.
If Alaska can improve its infrastructure, it is well placed to make rapid progress as an international business hub, says Dr. Darren Prokop, professor of logistics at the University of Alaska Anchorage. It is the best positioned of U.S. states for international trade, he points out -- "within nine hours flying time to 90% of the industrialized world," -- and the only Arctic state, which guarantees resources, influence and prestige.
With the onset of major development projects, a new challenge is to maintain the unique environment.
"It's a beautiful area that has a lot of resources, so it's a matter of balancing that equation," says Prokop. "We want to extract the wealth but keep the pristine nature of the coastline and interior in a way that encourages tourism and travel."
The future seems bright and full of possibilities. But whatever changes, the essence of working in Alaska will remain the same: a battle with nature at its wildest extremes. And as every Dalton Highway trucker knows, it cannot always be won.

(CNN)
Daniel Boria says he was trying to get attention for his cleaning business when he tied more than 100 helium balloons to a lawn chair and soared through the sky over his city.
But soon after he opened a parachute and jumped back on the ground, police in Calgary, Canada, arrested him Sunday, charging him with one count of mischief causing danger to life .
A day later, the chair still hadn't landed, Calgary Police Acting Inspector Kyle Grant said, according to Canadian broadcaster CTV .
"At this point, we have no reports of anybody finding anything or anybody being injured," Grant said, "but it's a big concern for us, and I don't think it's something he took into account."
Boria, 26, told CNN he devised his plan about two months ago. Originally, he was hoping to pay a plane or helicopter service to fly him over the crowds at the Calgary Stampede. But Boria said he had to take matters into his own hands after the services rejected his request, telling him there was a no-fly zone policy over the popular rodeo.
In the end, Boria said the stunt cost him more than $10,000. He bought a lawn chair for $19.99 and 110 helium balloons -- the largest he could find -- for about $13 each. Filling up the balloons cost around $80 each and took about two hours, he said.
Equipped with an oxygen tank and a parachute, he took off Sunday evening.
"I'd estimate I was going up about 500 to 1,000 feet in a minute," he said. "I was looking down on the city and watching 747s and planes approaching the local airport."
It wasn't the first time Boria had found himself floating far above his hometown; he's skydived a few times in the past. But this, he said, was different.
Boria flew over the stampede grounds, but turbulent weather led him past his destination. He deployed his parachute and landed by train tracks in a rocky area.
He had a few cuts on his body and was worried he'd broken his foot, but he was still hoping he could walk away unscathed.
"A guy was driving by and was going to give me a ride," he said.
But instead, Boria got a ride in a different kind of vehicle.
"A police officer arrived and put two and two together and put me in custody," he said.

        <MainBody>Ultra-Orthodox Jews go high-tech 02:21
Story highlights
Ultra-Orthodox men, many in need of work, getting high-tech education
Skills from studying scripture help them with analysis of programming problems
Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN)
The third-floor room in a suburb of Tel Aviv looks like any other high-tech company in the "Start-Up Nation." Rows of programmers type away at computers, hammering out computer code for mobile applications. One room over, they work on web development in this small tech hub in Bnei Brak.
But the programmers come from a very different background. They are ultra-Orthodox Jews, known for their strict traditions and private lifestyle. They are called Haredim, which means "those who tremble in awe of God," and they are Israel's next wave of high-tech programmers.
By day, they adhere to their devout lifestyle, studying religious scripture on the first floor of the building. They huddle in groups, reading and rereading passages from religious texts such as the Talmud and the Torah, arguing about the meaning of individual words and phrases.
In the afternoon, they move up to the second floor and study something different.
Very different.
Instead of studying ancient texts, they learn modern computer languages and computer programming. The students begin by learning mathematics and English, subjects they never learned in their strict traditional lifestyle, which focuses on religious study. Then they start learning to program.
After one of year of study, they begin working in the high-tech fields.
"People who didn't know anything about computers a year ago, you'll see them developing web applications, mobile applications," says Vered Mor, general manager of RavTech , the religious high-tech school where these students study Judaism and technology.
An eye and heart for analysis
New classes start each year with about 30 students. The students are required to pass tests in math, English and web development.
"They're really curious," says Noam Elfenbaum, one of the teachers. "They just want to know, to really understand what's going on, and they're not satisfied with shallow answers."
The religious high-tech school is a way of finding work for Haredi men. Unemployment and poverty are major problems in the ultra-Orthodox community.
Among ultra-Orthodox men, 55% are unemployed. In most ultra-Orthodox families, only the woman works, often at low-income jobs, while supporting large families. On average, Haredi families have six children.
The ultra-Orthodox Haredi community makes up 10% of Israel's population, but it is the fastest-growing segment of the population.
Most of the students at RavTech are in their 20s and 30s. They already have families. Now they are looking for work. Student Ariel Braun says years of strict religious study make for excellent programmers.
"A lot of times you have to think outside the box, and that's very, very important, especially in studying the scriptures," says Braun. "To think beyond the simple understanding of what's in front of you, look into different levels and try and get deeper into the problem."
High-tech programming jobs allow the ultra-Orthodox to maintain their strict lifestyle. In between programming classes, they break for afternoon prayers. One Haredi man reads the prayer service from his cell phone. For these ultra-Orthodox men working in today's modern economy, technology is always close at hand.

Abyaneh, Iran (CNN)
The elderly lady struggles to walk up a steep alley in the ancient Iranian village of Abyaneh. It's almost painful to watch as she puts her whole weight onto her walking stick to try to propel herself up the incline.
Honey Amiri, 74, has lived here all her life. She takes life slowly. But when I ask her about the United States, all of sudden full of vim and vigor, she stands upright, her voice as strong as her opinions.
"We like the American people, we like President Obama, but we don't like Congress," she says -- with a broad grin.
Her friend, 80-year-old Fatemeh Jamal, adds: "We have heard that President Obama says the military option is on the table. Well, we are not afraid of that!"

Abyaneh village is unique even by the standards of Iran's massive cultural diversity. It is known as one of the oldest places in the country, dating back around 4,000 years.
Its red-colored mud brick houses, clustered at the foot of a hill in a valley in the Karkass Mountains, are known all over Iran; many of the homes here have beautifully ornate carved wooden doors, almost as old as the buildings themselves.
Abyaneh's culture of "live and let live" developed over the centuries; the village was subject to a lot of change but always maintained its core identity.
CNN visited a Koran lesson for women in the biggest and oldest mosque in Abyaneh. The people here are Muslim, but have preserved much of their culture from pre-Islamic times when the main religion in Persia was Zoroastrianism.

Persian Pahlavi, a dialect of ancient Persia, is still the main language spoken here -- the residents simply refer to it as the Zoroastrian language.
Most of the 1,000 or so people who live here are very well educated. And, they say, they have a reputation as conflict mediators in this region.
"We have a story here in Abyaneh," says Reza Alirezai, the head of the city council. "A man and a woman come to court because they have a dispute. Then the judge sees the woman tying the man's shoelaces and he thinks the conflict has been resolved. He asks them and they say that the conflict is still ongoing, but that doesn't mean that she can't help her husband tie his shoe."
"The lesson is that even if you have a conflict in one area, it does not mean that you have to break off all relations," explains Alirezai. "You can still live together."
Alirezai says Abyaneh is often called upon to draw up contracts and agreements between towns and individuals because its people are known for finding wise and fair solutions.
He says he believes that kind of thinking would be helpful for the U.S.'s relations with Iran.
"The people of Iran have always talked to each other in councils," he says. "And the output and the thoughts of the council were always stronger than any one man's thoughts. This is what creates civilization."

Lee, highly revered in Singapore, was laid to rest In March with thousands gathering in a massive state funeral service. Admired for his role in turning the former British colony into a financial powerhouse, Lee was also criticized for tamping down free speech.
Funeral for founding father of Singapore
On the day of Lee's funeral in March, Singapore police arrested Yee, saying his video contained "disparaging remarks against Christians." He was charged with intent to wound the religious feelings of any person, circulating obscene objects and making threatening and abusive or insulting communications -- charges commanding up to three years in prison.
"Police take a stern view of acts that could threaten religious harmony in Singapore. Any person who uploads offensive content online with deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings of any person will be firmly dealt with in accordance with the law," Deputy Commissioner of Police Tan Chye Hee said at the time.
Yee's bail was set at $14,500, The Strait Times newspaper reported, adding that Yee's father apologized to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the son of Lee Kuan Yew.
Deteriorating state?
Found guilty in May, Yee was detained for 53 days at Changi Prison before being transferred two weeks ago to the Institute of Mental Health where, his attorney said, he underwent court-ordered psychiatric examinations.
"As Amos's lawyers, we were deeply concerned of the strain on his mental state and his physical state in the long period of remand," Dodwell said.
Amos Yee arrives at court with his father in March.
Some of the teenager's advocates feared that if those exams went poorly Yee might be required to undergo more than two years of mandatory psychiatric treatment in lieu of prison time.
But on Monday, Judge Jaswinder Kaur handed down a one-week sentence for the obscenity charge and three weeks in prison for the charge of wounding religious feelings.
Singapore teen charged after YouTube rant
With Yee having been in prison for well over a month, Kaur released him for time served.
A psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health said Yee does not realize that "freedom of expression is not freedom from consequence" and recommended counseling on responsible use of the Internet, Dodwell's statement said. The psychiatrist also recommended that Yee continue his formal education and attend family counseling.
'The conviction is wrong in law'
"So, Amos is free  today. He does not face any further sanctions in so far as these two charges are concerned," Dodwell said. "Amos, duly advised by his lawyers, is of the view that the conviction is wrong in law and sentence levied against him is manifestly excessive."
Earlier this month, Yee's mother, Mary Toh, who attended court hearings in a "#FreeAmosYee" T-shirt, wrote a letter -- widely shared on Facebook -- to her son, apologizing that he was so insecure and scared after she had told him he was "in the safest country"

It was originally built to defend an empire, but now parts of the Great Wall of China are crumbling so badly they need someone to leap to their defense.
About 2,000 kilometers, or 30%, of the ancient fortification built in the Ming Dynasty era has disappeared due to natural erosion and human damage, according to the Beijing Times .
And the situation could worsen, experts are warning, as not enough is being done to preserve what remains.
"It's a great pity to witness the Great Wall in such devastated situation," Mei Jingtian, a volunteer who has worked for three decades to safeguard the structure and has founded of the Great Wall Protection Association, tells CNN.
About 8,000 kilometers of the structure dates from the Ming period between the 14th and 17th centuries and is considered by some to be the original Great Wall.
Wild Great Wall
Of this, 2,000 kilometers is made up of naturally occurring earthworks -- and so only 6,000 kilometers of actual Ming dynasty wall was ever built.
Stretches built in other eras make up an overall length estimated at up to 21,000 kilometers.
Many visitors to China associate the Great Wall with an extensively restored stretch of Ming era wall at Badaling near Beijing, but this is far from typical of most of the structure.
According to a 2014 survey done by the Great Wall of China Society, only about 8.2% of the Great Wall is in good condition, with 74.1% classified as poorly preserved.
"The Great Wall is a vast heritage site -- over 20,000 kilometers -- hence increasing the difficulty in preservation and restoration," Dong Yaohui, deputy director of the Great Wall of China Society, tells CNN.
"Reliance on a very small amount of manpower by the local heritage departments is not enough to guard and protect the site."
A recent surge in interest from tourists in visiting unexploited sections, known as the "Wild Great Wall," has accelerated its deterioration, according to the report.
Graffiti and theft have also taken their toll.
"Local residents in some sections sell bricks that have historic engravings on them," says Dong.

Slopes of Burgundy, France, also receive special status
(CNN)
France's world renowned wine country was toasted twice Saturday with world heritage status by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
The U.N.'s cultural body bestowed the special status on the historic hillsides and properties where the sparkling wines of Champagne are produced, as well as the famous vineyards that grace the slopes of Burgundy.
The designation covers the Champagne hillsides, houses and cellars where "the method of producing sparkling wines was developed on the principle of secondary fermentation in the bottle since the early 17th century to its early industrialization in the 19th century," UNESCO said in a statement.
The vineyards in Hautvilliers, A and Mareuil-sur-A, Saint-Nicaise Hill in Reims, and the Avenue de Champagne and Fort Chabrol in Epernay bear "clear testimony to the development of a very specialized artisan activity that has become an agro-industrial enterprise," the statement said.

        <MainBody>Three cities in southern Germany host museums dedicated to the country's leading car brands
Enthusiasts can tour collections of priceless cars made by BMW, Audis, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche
The museums can be explored in two days using Munich or Stuttgart as a base
To mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, CNN's week-long special Made in Germany will look at how the country's economy has developed since the momentous event.
(CNN)
In the automotive world, good things often come in fours.
Four doors, four-wheel drive and, in one corner of Germany, four of the planet's finest motoring museums.
And you don't even need a car to visit them.
Germany's premium motoring brands can be seen the world over, but only in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg, where their manufacturers -- Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche -- have established the museums in their honor can their legacy be fully appreciated.
Between them, the collections based in a magic motoring triangle that connects the cities of Stuttgart, Munich and Ingolstadt, are a priceless showcase of automotive history.
The hundreds of cars, trucks and motorbikes on display range from the pioneering creations of Gottlieb Daimler, Carl Benz and August Horch through to the futuristic prewar designs of Ferdinand Porsche and on to the high-tech vehicles of the modern era.
For car enthusiasts -- or simply anyone interested in the technology of modern transport, global brand values and remarkable architecture -- these state-of-the-art museums create a touring "golden triangle" that can be covered in a couple of days using Stuttgart or Munich as a base.
Innovation, engineering excellence, historic achievement and a sense of style are some of the factors that exemplify the vehicles on display.

Ethereal aluminum body
An example is the first exhibit a visitor encounters at the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart: the ethereal aluminum body shape of the 1939 Type 64.
Clearly the forerunner of all Porsches, this tiny streamlined prototype was designed as a long-distance racing coupe by company founder Ferdinand Porsche.
After World War II, it was the first car to carry the family name, ahead of the Porsche 356 No. 1.
Not far from the Type 64 is a car that began Porsche's long association with the Le Mans 24-hour race in France.
In 1951, a 1.1 liter Porsche 356 SL coupe bearing the number 46 competed in the race, winning its class and finishing 20th overall.
Between 1970 and 1987, Porsche was the outright winner 12 times at Le Mans, and added another four wins in the 1990s.
The massive collection at the Mercedes-Benz Museum, also in Stuttgart, includes such historical masterpieces as the Benz Patent-Motorwagen of 1885, the first Daimler motor car of 1892, the supercharged Mercedes-Benz roadsters of the 1920s and 1930s, through to the quirky high-speed transporter built to carry the 300 SLR sports racer to the track.
On one wall of the museum stands the 1939 six-wheeled T80 world record car, originally fitted with a 44-liter V12 engine that was designed to reach a speed of 600 kilometers per hour (372 mph).
Plans for a record attempt were undone by the advent of World War II; the car was mothballed and its engine removed.
Mercedes' racing heritage is prominent, culminating in a spectacular lineup of its Silver Arrow grand prix and sports racing cars.
Outside the museum, a bronze statue depicts five-time world champion F1 driver Juan Manuel Fangio standing next to his 1954 W196 grand prix racer.
Audi, created by engineer August Horch in 1910, consolidated its brand in 1932 when it joined with Wanderer and DKW to form Auto Union under the "four rings" emblem.

Flowing silver masterpiece
Examples of all these marques can be found at the Audi Museum, along with Audi's Le Mans-winning sports racers, the Quattro rally championship cars and the "baby Thunderbird" Auto Union 1000 SP.
One highlight of the Audi display is a flowing silver masterpiece known as the 1937 Auto Union V16 Type C Streamliner racing car.
The car on show is a modern recreation of the Streamliner that German driver Bernd Rosemeyer took to a speed of more than 400 kmh on the Frankfurt-Darmstadt autobahn in October 1937, the first time the mark was reached on a normal road.
Rosemeyer was killed in 1938 during a similar speed attempt on the same road.
In Munich, most people arrive by subway to BMW Welt, which is a showroom and delivery center for its contemporary BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands.
A pedestrian bridge links this with the silver bowl-shaped BMW Museum across the road.

The museum pays homage to the company's aero engine origins and to its F1 racing endeavors with Brabham, Williams and Sauber, but primarily features a superb range of prewar and postwar BMW saloons, roadsters and coupes, along with its current crop of high-technology vehicles such as the i8 concept car.
Highlights include a roadster and coupe versions of the classic 1939 328 model, while curiosities such as the 1955 Isetta bubble car enliven the display.
Between them, the four museums can easily soak up four days of visitor time, particularly if the factory tours are included.
Either Stuttgart or Munich makes a great base.
They are two of Germany's most liveable and appealing cities -- easy on the eye, great transportation systems and not too expensive.
The business-style hotel chain Motel One, for example, offers rooms close to the main stations for 60 to 80 ($80-$107) outside peak season.
If time permits, Germany's other great auto museum, Volkswagen's sprawling Autostadt, lies 600 kilometers north of Munich in the city of Wolfsburg, about an hour by train west of Berlin.
Munich to Berlin takes about six hours by car or train.

        <title>A ride with diamond eyes: The first Arab supercar</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/oVasn4C1LJY/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>W Motors is the Middle East's first supercar manufacturer
The Lykan Hypersport costs $3.4m, can hit 395 km/h, and has diamond headlights
(CNN)
Asking the top speed of the world's first Arab supercar is beside the point. The 0-60 times, or horsepower, too. Those numbers won't matter by the time you notice the seats are stitched with gold thread and headlights are trimmed with diamonds.
When did the company think, "diamonds, what we need is headlights made of diamonds"?
Ralph R. Debbas, W Motors CEO, laughs: "Diamonds in the headlights are something we don't need at all, actually. It was a true marketing gimmick that we integrated. But people talk about it."
W Motors styles itself as the Arab world's first supercar manufacturer, and has major plans to build its name in the oil-rich Middle East, which has so far lacked a credible motor industry.
Its first creation is the ferociously styled $3.4 million Lykan Hypersport , built to attract attention and invite Instagram photos -- "in a crazy way, in a disruptive way" -- in a market already crowded with ultra-exclusive autos.
The Hypersport ticks each of the hypercar performance boxes. If you must ask, it has a 3.7-litre 780bhp, twin-turbo flat-six which can go from 0-100 km/h in 2.8 seconds (faster than the power-focused Lamborghini Aventador) and reach a top speed of 395 km/h.
But Debbas knows better than anyone that buyers chasing the top hypercar specs (and have a few million to spare), are already spoilt by the likes of the face-peeling Pagani Huayra , Koenigsegg Agera , or Bugatti Veyron Super Sport .
That's not the point, he insists: "My client already has a Pagani or a Koenniggseg, and he wants something different."
"Flying doctors"
"When you get into something like this hypercar, it's really about a luxury lifestyle," explains Stephanie Brinley, senior analyst at industry experts IHS Automotive . "It's something that somebody would buy in place of yet another house somewhere, and it's a whole other stratosphere than typical transportation."
For W Motors, the car itself is just part of the package. Buyers also get a global servicing system, where the press of a button in-car summons a technical advisor to come to their aid, explains Debbas. And if needed "flying doctors" -- a team of W Motors-trained engineers -- will fly to wherever you are in the world.
An elite, invite-only and round-the-clock concierge service comes as part of the deal too and there's also a watch -- designed specially by Swiss luxury watchmaker Franck Muller -- which you can probably chalk down as another "gimmick."
Crucial, though, is the fact that only seven Hypersports will ever be manufactured -- and Brinley explains this kind of above-and-beyond service and exclusivity is what buyers looking to spend $3.4 million want:
"It's special, it's unique, and you can be darn sure that there's like two other people in the world that have what you have."
The Wolf Model
Debbas doesn't call other boutique manufacturers Pagani and Koenigsegg "competitors" -- "I respect all of them. We work with them all" -- and neither does he see himself taking on the heritage brands' most exclusive offerings, like the Ferrari LaFerrari or Porsche 918 Spyder .
The company's model is different from those heritage manufacturers, whose story typically begins with an obsession for engineering. W Motors -- the W is short for "Wolf," a nickname given to Debbas as a child -- pitches itself as a young marque that brings together designers and engineers already esteemed by automotive "connoisseurs".
Ralph Debbas, CEO of W Motors
Debbas, who started the company seven years ago, then aged just 22, is the master of ceremonies coordinating existing specialists across the Middle East and Europe. Under the watchful eye of 15 core staff in Dubai, 70 staff-contracted workers in Italy from automotive engineers Magna Steyr build the car around engines and chassis made by specialists RUF in Germany.
"Working with the biggest people in the industry, this gave us a lot of credibility and access to the world. It's true we don't have a hundred years of heritage, and there's no pedigree behind, but the companies that we work with have over a hundred years of experience."
W Motors' forthcoming, so-far unnamed SUV project
Building pride
Being new, and the first home-grown manufacturers in the Middle East helps W Motors understand a growing group of buyers from the oil-rich nations, says Debbas, who's Lebanese.
But their projects in the region go beyond catering to the unrestrained desires of the incredibly wealthy.

Short term aims still cater to this market: a $1.6 million "Supersport" model and a $250,000 SUV are to follow, but these are set to be constructed in a purpose built factory -- employing 100 people -- opening in Dubai in a year's time.
Debbas is bullish:  "We are not only building a car. We are building an industry, we are building a name, we are building something historical. Every step of the way, we're getting the support of the Arab nations that are helping us to be proud, and raising the heritage."
Before that there are challenges. Car manufacture remains "capital intensive, highly regulated, highly complicated, [and] highly competitive," reminds expert Brinley, and hyper luxury is a difficult market for those even with pedigree.
Even Bugatti, a historic marque with the support of Volkswagen, remains subject to different stories about whether it "has quite ever been profitable," she says.
"It will be a cautionary tale as to whether something like W Motors will ultimately be [profitable]. Basically if VW can't leverage its global footprint and get the Veyron to be a profitable, it will be very difficult for a one-off to do that."
"But I don't know," she laughs. "This W Motors car has diamonds on it!"

Petra, Jordan  Also called "Rose City" due to the color of its stone, the ancient city of Petra is Jordan's main tourist attraction, and that's the problem: touching and rubbing hands, as well as wind and rain erosion, are eating away at the surface of the Al Khazneh temple, which has receded by 1.5 inches in the last century. Camels and donkeys are also contributing to the erosion of the walkpaths and the excess humidity may threaten the structural stability of the dry sandstone.

Battersea Power Station, London  The area surrounding one of London's most iconic buildings is now a construction site for 1,300 apartments, a hotel and 350,000 square-feet of retail and restaurant space. The chimneys of the power station are currently being demolished and replaced. Even though the developers must respect the building's status as being of special architectural or historic interest, Grade II* , new high-rise blocks will soon obscure some of the most dramatic views of the station.

Picasso murals, Oslo  Picasso's first attempts at concrete murals adorn the walls of two government buildings in Oslo, Norway, called H-Block and Y-Block. Both were heavily damaged during the Anders Breivik bombings in 2011, and given the high cost of repairs -- estimated to be $70 million -- a proposal has been made to demolish them and relocate the murals. But the public opinion is divided , as the artwork was designed specifically for these buildings.

Portland Public Services Building, Portland, U.S.  This 15-storey municipal office block was completed in 1982, but due to structural problems it already needs renovations to the tune of $175 million. An early example of post-Modernism in a major city, it attracts diverging opinions, with many supporting its proposed demolition to make space for something new entirely. Yet, in 2011, it was included in the U. S. National Register of Historic Places.

Little Green Street, Kentish Town, London  Immortalized by the Kinks in their 1966 video for the song " Dead End Street ", this is one of London's few intact Georgian streets: it hasn't changed much since 1780. The dozen houses in the cobblestone thoroughfare are protected historical buildings, but the land behind them is sought after by developers to build a new gated complex, which would turn the delicate, 2.5 meter-wide street into a truck route.

Abdul Ali Ladhari and his friends waited 45 minutes before the police finally arrived. He's sure, he says, because he watched every minute drag by on his phone, unwilling to believe that help still hadn't come.
While waiting, they did what they could.
"We went and covered up the tourists that died -- God rest their souls -- and waited, terrified, in complete chaos. We were scared that -- God forbid -- there might be a second shooter. It was all just a mess," he says.
Ladhari works at a beach shack, renting Jet Skis and parachute rides to tourists.

        <MainBody>More women have undergone FGM in Egypt than anywhere else in the world
92% of married women aged 15 to 49 have had the procedure
Anti-FGM campaigners believe they're turning the tide on the practice
Cairo, Egypt (CNN)
Summer days: They're what childhood memories are made of, glorious afternoons of unchecked freedom to frolic with friends in the sun, unshackled from the earthly obligations of a math class that never seemed further away.
But for millions of schoolgirls in Egypt, this time of year represents something much darker: the start of the female genital mutilation (FGM) season.
Mona Mohamed was 10 years old when she underwent what's also known as a female circumcision on a hot summer day in her village in Upper Egypt.
"I was terrified," she said. "They tied me down, my mother on one hand and my grandmother on the other."
As Mona thrashed around, pinned by her loved ones to the living room floor, a doctor injected her with anesthesia.
Mona remembers being given a piece of bubble gum to chew on before she finally passed out.  It wasn't until she woke up that she realized she had been mutilated.
Egypt: The FGM capital of the world
Stories like Mona's are far from rare in Egypt, where "cutting" has been a brutal rite of passage for young girls since the time of the pharaohs.
Of the more than 125 million girls and women alive today who have undergone the procedure, one in four live in Egypt. That's more than any other country in the world, according to the U.N.
Ninety-two percent of married Egyptian women aged 15 to 49 have been subjected to FGM, according to a government report released in May . That figure is down from 97% in 2000 , but the practice is still the norm here.
Most girls are cut between the ages of nine and 12, and the operations usually take place during the summer school break so the girls can recover at home.
U.N. officials say FGM has no medical benefits and can cause lifelong physical and emotional trauma for the women forced to undergo the procedure.
"This is a gross human rights violation," Jaime Nadal-Roig, the U.N. Population Fund representative in Cairo, told CNN. "It doesn't add anything to the life of the girl, and there are no medical or religious grounds whatsoever."
A celebrated tradition
The most common FGM procedure in Egypt is Type 1, the partial or full removal of the clitoris. It's what Mona Mohamed -- and her older sisters -- endured years ago.
Compared to her sisters, Mona was lucky, given that her procedure was performed by a doctor. Her sisters were circumcised with a razor blade by a traditional (non-medical) midwife who put dust on their wounds to stop the bleeding.
Mona, now 47, recalls asking her mother why getting circumcised was so important. "Usually girls at your age get 'excited,' and this operation takes care of that," her mother replied.
FGM has been illegal in Egypt since 2008, but the practice remains woven into the very fabric of Egyptian society, where many see cutting as a way to "purify" a girl and make her marriage material.
"People used to have a party after a girl was circumcised, they'd celebrate and exchange gifts," Nadal-Roig said. "So for them to turn from there and say, 'look this is a crime or this is a sin or this is not allowed by religion' means confronting a lot of beliefs and social norms."
Campaigners go on the offensive
But progress is being made. The percentage of girls aged 15 to 17 who have had the procedure has dropped from 74.4% in 2008 to 61% in 2014 -- a clear sign that the drive to end FGM is working, campaigners say.
Last week Egypt announced a plan to reduce FGM by 10-15% in the next five years. If it works, it will mean that for the first time in decades, "uncut" girls would outnumber those who have had the procedure.
"It's an ambitious plan, but now I think that the political atmosphere is supporting us and we can reach our goal," said Vivian Fouad, the National Population Council official leading the government's charge to eradicate FGM.
"For years we were on (the) defense, but now we're on the offensive."
The fight to eradicate FGM in Egypt is unfolding on a number of fronts, from the courts to the places of worship to the streets of the highest-risk towns.
In January a doctor was sentenced on charges related to mutilating a girl -- the first conviction of its kind since the 2008 ban went into effect.
The verdict was a victory for the anti-FGM campaign, but Fouad says too many doctors are still willing to take the money from families and look the other way when it comes to the law.
"It's a good income for doctors," Fouad said. "And some doctors have social and cultural backgrounds where FGM is supported."
Fouad classifies the battle against female circumcision as a fight for the middle class: "If doctors, judges, prosecutors, and teachers are supporting FGM, how are we going to convince poorer women not to have it?"
Campaigners are also trying to persuade local religious leaders to stop preaching the alleged benefits of FGM to mothers. It's often a tough sell in a country where more than half of women still believe, falsely, that cutting is required by religion, according to the most recent survey.
"You need to make people not want to do it for their daughters," said UNFPA program officer Germain Haddad. "You need to work on people's convictions."
To that end, the UNFPA has hired a theater group to perform comedic skits in the streets of communities across the country to foster debate -- and doubt -- about the necessity of FGM.
"Many of these people are shy," said Haddad. "When we used to do seminars on FGM it was very difficult to get people to speak up and ask questions.
"These plays act as an icebreaker that opens up the subject like magic," she said. "And women get to see in a comedic way that FGM is ridiculous."
"I hate the man that did this to me"
But it remains an uphill struggle. Around six in 10 women think the practice should continue, according to the most recent government survey.
"It's tradition, and there's no escape," says Sarah Abulaziz Mohamed, who was circumcised at 12 in her village of Mansour.
"It hurt my dignity -- I was forced to do this act that I didn't want to do," she said. "I hate the man that did this to me."
Sarah is 40 now and has two young daughters of her own. She says FGM left her with lifelong psychological trauma, but at least it taught her a valuable lesson.
"I definitely wouldn't do it to my daughters by any means," she said. "To this day I still have pain, and what's gone is gone ... that part of me can never be given back again."

        <MainBody>Mission to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, passes big hurdle
Icy moon may have ingredients for life
NASA has included $30 million in its 2016 budget to plan the mission
(CNN)
NASA wants to go to Europa. No, it's not in Europe. And for soccer fans, it has nothing to do with the Europa League .
Europa is one of Jupiter's larger moons . It's about the size of Earth's moon, and it's thought to be one of the best places to look for life in our solar system -- besides Earth, of course.
An artist's concept of a plume of water jetting above the icy surface of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons.
Interest in the icy world heated up in 2012 when the Hubble Space Telescope observed water vapor above the south polar region of Europa. NASA says those observations gave scientists strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface.
Long before Hubble made those findings, a NASA spacecraft named Galileo traveled to Jupiter in 1995 and found evidence that Europa has a salty ocean beneath its frozen crust. NASA says that ocean may have more than twice as much water as Earth.
"Europa has tantalized us with its enigmatic icy surface and evidence of a vast ocean, following the amazing data from 11 flybys of the Galileo spacecraft over a decade ago and recent Hubble observations suggesting plumes of water shooting out from the moon," John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement in May.
"We're excited about the potential of this new mission and these instruments to unravel the mysteries of Europa in our quest to find evidence of life beyond Earth."
An artist's concept of what a NASA spacecraft would look like approaching Europa.
NASA hopes the new probe will help determine if Europa really does have the ingredients for life, according to Barry Goldstein, manager of the Europa Project at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
The mission took a big step forward Wednesday when NASA announced it had been moved to what's called the "formulation phase," Goldstein told CNN in an email.
"In this phase we mature the mission design and requirements to assure we are asking the correct science questions, and designing the correct mission to answer those questions," he said.
The space agency has included $30 million in its 2016 budget to plan the mission. Goldstein said there's still work to do before NASA officially clears mission managers to build the hardware and software for the mission.
If the mission does get final approval, the spacecraft would be launched in the 2020s . It would take several years to get to Jupiter, and when it arrived it would "orbit the giant planet about every two weeks, providing many opportunities for close flybys of Europa," according to a NASA statement.
NASA says the mission plan includes 45 flybys at altitudes ranging from 16 miles to 1,700 miles (25 kilometers to 2,700 kilometers). With each pass, the spacecraft would collect information about Europa's surface and use instruments to look deep inside the small world.
Nine science instruments have been selected so far, including cameras, ice penetrating radar and a magnetometer.
A bit more about Europa and Jupiter
Europa is one of the four largest moons orbiting Jupiter , the biggest planet in our solar system -- so big that 1,000 Earths would fit inside. Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei is given credit for discovering Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto in 1610, and so the four are known as Galilean satellites or moons. German astronomer Simon Marius claimed to see the moons at about the same time, but Galileo published his findings first. Jupiter also has dozens of other smaller moons .
Jupiter is about 390 million miles (629 million kilometers) from Earth when the two planets are at their closest.
Despite the distance, you can see Jupiter with the naked eye on a clear night. In fact, Jupiter and the much brighter Venus are putting on quite a show in the evening sky this month. If you go out after sunset and look west, you can see the two planets fairly close together. They look like two bright lights. In late June and early July, the two planets will be at their closest until August 2016.
If you have binoculars or a telescope, you can see Jupiter's largest moons , including Europa. They will look like tiny lights near Jupiter.
Jupiter's other visitors
This image of Jupiter is a composite of four images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in December 2000.
While the new probe will focus on Europa, Jupiter has had a steady stream of visitors from Earth over the past few decades:

"Jurassic World" hit over 4,200 theaters last week, reintroducing the man-meets-dinosaur disaster to a new generation of fans.
The movie has already smashed records, becoming the highest grossing global opening in history by bringing in $511.8 million over the weekend.
While real-life scientists have yet to resurrect the terrible lizards from mosquito DNA, they have recently discovered remnants of what look like red blood cells and soft tissue in the fossils of a 75-million-year-old dinosaur.
But they say it'll be a long time before a "Jurassic Park"-style theme park is feasible. (As if anyone who's seen any of the films would want to visit one anyway.)
Fortunately there are already plenty of museums worldwide that (safely) bring humans face to face with dinosaurs -- and not always just their skeletons.
1. Museum fr Naturkunde (Berlin)
Berlin's natural history museum houses a serious collection of bones excavated largely from Tanzania in the 20th century, featuring all sorts of species.
Most impressive is the 41-foot, 5-inch Brachiosaurus, the tallest dinosaur in the world on display.  It's a Guinness World Record holder and dominates the first gallery.
The museum also has the most important Archaeopteryx fossil in the world, demonstrating the birdlike link between dinosaurs and birds.

2. Field Museum (Chicago)
The world's biggest version of the world's most famous dinosaur.
The museum's Evolving Planet exhibit, dedicated to the last 4 billion years of evolution, features dinosaurs from as far away as Madagascar and Antarctica.
The main attraction stands at the entrance. Meet Sue, the largest Tyrannosaurus in the world, who greets visitors at Chicago's natural history museum.
She's a terrific specimen -- the original skull, weighing 600 pounds and flashing 58 teeth, is on display in the museum's balcony level along with information on the most notorious of dinosaurs.
It's easy to imagine the enormous tooth-filled snout crashing through the sunroof of a "Jurassic Park" jeep.

3. Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Science (Brussels)
With the largest dinosaur hall in the world, this museum has an impressive collection of fossilized skeletons and casts.
The standouts are 30 Iguanodons, the second dinosaur to be classified in the 1800s.
They're the ones with the curious spike that early paleontologists mistook for a horn on their nose.
Interactive displays in the gallery also detail the fossilization process and dinosaur digs, among other topics.

4. National Dinosaur Museum (Canberra, Australia)
This is the place to explore prehistory in Australia.
The place has the country's largest collection of dinosaur fossils.
Alongside fossils, bones and impressive footprints from all sorts of animals and beasts, the museum features a garden with imposing dinosaur sculptures and animatronics inside that add a bit of Spielberg magic to displays.
Fossil digs, children's learning events and weekend tours help attract 200,000 people a year, making it one of the area's biggest tourist attractions.

5. Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology (Alberta, Canada)
More than 130,000 fossils call this paleontological research center home, including the original "Black Beauty" Tyrannosaurus skeleton with its unique dark sheen.
A recreation of a pack of Albertosaurus, inspired by a bone bed of 22 specimens found in Alberta, pays homage to Joseph Tyrrell, who discovered the carnivore in 1884.
The museum also displays sabertooth tigers attacking a mammoth as well as a living garden that recreates life during the Cretaceous period in Alberta.
Visitors can watch paleontologists at work in the preparation lab to see how they prepare fossilized bones, like those of an Ankylosaur found in a Canadian mine.
Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology , 1500 North Dinosaur Trail, Canadian Badlands, Drumheller, Alberta, Canada
6. Wyoming Dinosaur Center (Wyoming)
This museum's standout attraction is a 106-foot Supersaurus.
The museum has acquired the most complete archaeopteryx in the world (after the one in Berlin) and boasts skeletons of Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Velociraptor, among others in all sorts of dynamic poses.
The real draw is getting to talk with real paleontologists, like those who inspired Alan Grant's character in "Jurassic Park."
All ages are invited to "dig for a day" by signing up to participate in excursions to one of the world's richest bone fields, just down the street.

In addition to dozens of other exhibits, the prehistoric section deals with lesser known dinosaurs and their cousins that inhabited the continent from Cape Town to Marrakech.
The "African Dinosaurs" exhibit features the Euparkeria, a distant relative of the dinosaurs, native to South Africa; as well as the Jobaria, a sauropod from Africa.
The Carcharodontosaurus skull from North Africa is part of a creature that trumped the mighty T. Rex in size and stature, making it one of Africa's most imposing killers.

While Spielberg may not have given his blessing, the center does offer a creative and engaging educational experience for children, though connoisseurs may question the seemingly anachronistic placing of a Spinosaurus next to a Triceratops.

        <MainBody>British family recognized 17-year-old in ISIS photo
ISIS claims seven suicide attacks this weekend conducted by seven foreign nationals
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)
The family of a British boy said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS apparently released a photo showing their 17-year-old relative smiling in front of an ISIS flag.
ISIS media posted images of a boy the group called Abu Yousef al Britani. In one picture, the teen known as Talha Asmal back in England raises his index finger. A black flag hangs behind him.
In another shot, he's posing inside a black Toyota.
The family's heartache played out this weekend against the backdrop of two waves of car bombings in Iraq, notable for the role foreigners were said to have had in them.
Family: 'A loving and affable' boy
Asmal's relatives in West Yorkshire, England, were in shock after British media published the pictures of him.
Asmal was a "loving, kind, caring and affable" and had no "ill will against anybody nor did he ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind," his family said in a lengthy statement Sunday.
It seems that ISIS targeted the teen and "exploited" his "tender years and naivety," they said, adding that the terror group apparently carried out a "process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him."
"As a result of this and completely unbeknown to us, his family, and entirely against our wishes, he ended up traveling it seems to Iraq," the family's statement reads.
On Sunday, the United Kingdom's North East Counter Terrorism Unit said that police are aware of media reports that allege a British national has died in Iraq. The identity of the person has not been confirmed, and the office unable to give further comment, it said.
"We are aware that large numbers of British nationals are traveling to the Middle East for a variety of reasons, and we understand that some of those traveling have resided in West Yorkshire," it said.
Seven bombers, all foreigners?
ISIS is known for staging multiple bombings at a single time to rattle its enemy, but this weekend's violence stands out -- the seven car bombers who attacked near the city of Baiji were all from countries outside of Iraq, the terror group claimed. According to ISIS, the attackers were a Brit, a German, a Kuwaiti, a Palestinian, two Dagestanis and one national of Turkmenistan.
The bombings happened in two waves.
During one, four car bombers raced toward and drove through an Iraqi security forces checkpoint. At least 16 were killed and 29 wounded.

In another attack, three car bombers blew themselves up near security forces, causing numerous injuries but no deaths, an Iraqi Security Forces paramilitary commander told CNN.
The commander told CNN that in the first attack security forces mistook four speeding SUVs heading toward them as a convoy escorting a high-level official.
Violence in Iraq continued Sunday. A parked car exploded near a shopping area in Shaab, a predominantly Shia district northern Baghdad. Two people were killed and seven wounded, police told CNN.
A family waits, worries
Other families around the world share in the pain Asmal's family is experiencing.
British teens have been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Earlier this year, three teenage British girls were seen on airport surveillance footage heading to Syria. A Scottish teenager wrote extensively on her Tumblr account about her love of ISIS. She stunned her family, left her country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. An American teenager from suburban Chicago, Mohammed Hamzah Khan, allegedly was on his way to join ISIS in October when he was stopped at an airport.
Asmal's family said he comes from a "close knit, hardworking, peace loving and law abiding British Muslim family."
"It appears Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability," they said.
If he was one of the suicide bombers, the boy was "ordered to his death by so called ISIS handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work," they said.
ISIS does not represent Islam, they stressed.
"They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like ISIS to hijack our faith," their statement said. "ISIS Not and Never in our name."
They are grieving, they said, and need a break from talking to reporters.
They need "time and understanding to come to terms," they said, "with our unimaginable and painful loss."
CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad while Ashley Fantz wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Anas Hamdan and Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report.

Magna Carta at 800: We are still enjoying the freedoms won
By John Stanton

England's King John signs the Magna Carta in 1215.
Story highlights
Magna Carta is said to have been sealed on June 15, 1215 under the title of the "Great Charter"
Core values set out by the Magna Carta are still very much at the heart of Britain's constitution

Around 20 miles from central London, where modern-day government and democracy shape the lives of citizens throughout the United Kingdom, the Thames meanders peacefully through nondescript English countryside. This is just another part of the green and pleasant land that has come to define much of these shores.
Except that there's something rather different about this rural corner of England. These riverside fields at Runnymede are reputed to be the setting for one of the most significant moments in UK democratic and constitutional history. The National Trust labels it "the birthplace of modern democracy," while an impressive monument commemorates a "symbol of freedom under law." It was here, of course, that the Magna Carta is said to have been sealed on June 15, 1215 under the title of the "Great Charter."

Shortly after graduating from high school, she found herself working in a honey shop. Intrigued about where the products came from and the subjects of sustainability and conservation, Fumsi quickly realized this could be a powerful pastime for local women in the area. Seventeen years on, and The Village Women Organization for Sustainable Development Cameroon has become a thriving apiary association.

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  Fumsi explains: "I'd always had this idea of working with women because I came from a single home where my mother raised me all by herself. She was a widow and I was two. So this passion of working with women I developed from there." Here, local beefarmer Bridget Mbah extracts honey from a top bar bee hive.

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  Griffiths' spent three weeks traveling around the north-west region visiting keepers who had set up their own hives. She explains that there is now a strong network of apiculturists high up in the mountain.
"Once you know one beekeeper there, you go through a network who are all in touch with one another, learn from one another. Also things like sharing equipment. Beekeeping equipment is strangely quite expensive, even to have a suit. Beekeeping suits protect yourself from stings but are quite expensive, so its easier to get together and share these things."

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  While beekeeping was not uncommon in the region, it was mainly reserved for the men of the villages, explains Fumsi. "But I said, 'the women could still do something. They shouldn't just allow them because the man is already on the farm. The woman can have a little piece of it.'"

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  At the beginning, there were just 15 beekeepers-in-training, but over the years the group has increased to over 50 women. Fumsi puts this success to its ease when compared with traditional farming in the region. "With beekeeping -- it's less costly, its less timely, it's just within their reach. That's why I got interested in it at the beginning."

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  Before taking up beekeeping, many women in the area struggled to make ends meet while also maintaining all the regular homemaker jobs -- a fact that spurred Fumsi to push for local women to be trained in the craft. She explains: "Actually most of the chores in the house are left to the women. And she has to get washing soap for the family, she's got to get ingredients for the family, even the school fees of the children -- she's got to pay for fees, uniform and shoes. And at times hospital bills, if its not an emergency -- she takes care of that."

"The market is not really that organized. At times the women have to travel far to sell their products or they have to give it to the cooperative," says Fumsi. "There's also a problem of quality because we still do it on a local level so bee farmers have a good product but we need to do better bottling."

Bees are dying at an alarming rate; even the White House acknowledged the dire situation
David Schubert: Bees are dying from some of the pesticides that are found in our human food supply
David Schubert is professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN)
We love our bees. They make honey and pollinate our flowers and crops.
But bees are dying at an alarming rate. Even the White House acknowledged the dire situation and recently released a task force report about it.
While the report acknowledges that pesticides are involved in the demise of bees, it could have discussed more how for the first time in the history of agriculture the same chemicals are inside not only the pollen that bees consume but the foods we eat.
Recent data published in Science, Nature and other scientific journals show that bees are dying from some of the pesticides that are found in our food supply.
One of these groups of chemical insecticides is the neonicotinoids that are similar in structure to nicotine and poison the nervous system.  The exposure of bees and people to neonicotinoids has increased enormously since it was discovered that by coating seeds with them the plants systemically take up the insecticide and distribute it to all parts of the plant and kill insects that eat the plant.  They are used on about 80% of commercial food crops in the United States , are found in pollen, honey and other foods, and are exceptionally resilient in the environment.
David Schubert
The other is glyphosate, the active ingredient in most herbicides. Glyphosate not only kills weeds, it also kills many of the beneficial kinds of bacteria that are found in the guts of bees, dogs and humans. These bacteria are an integral part of our body and play major roles in both physical and mental health. The World Health Organization has declared glyphosate a probable carcinogen. Because glyphosate is required for the production of most genetically modified, or GM, crops, its use has increased a lot since the introduction of these crops about 20 years ago .
Neonicotinoids are banned in Europe. It has been documented that the systemic treatment of some plants by seed coating is ineffective in preventing insect predation.
Is our government doing its best to protect our health, as well as the busy pollinators?
Two recent books say that the responsible agencies -- the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency  -- do not independently safety test pesticides or GM crops before their introduction.
" Altered Genes, Twisted Truth ," by Steve Druker, details how FDA administrators often disregarded the advice of their scientists and hardly questioned the fact that most GM crops require the use of herbicides in order to work properly. Herbicides used on GM crops are food additives, because they must be in the plant to be effective. It is the FDA's mandate to test additives that are found in food that are potentially unsafe , which should include things like glyphosate and neonicotinoids. However, as Druker documents, the FDA shrugs responsibility for GM food safety.
The book about the EPA, " Poison Spring: The Secret History of Pollution and the EPA ," by Evaggelos Vallianatos, carefully documents how the agency is beholden to large agricultural chemical companies. For example, although it is now well documented that bees are dying due to long-term exposures to pesticides , the EPA has only requested that producers do short-term toxicity studies.  Therefore, unless the chemical kills the bee outright, its use will be allowed.
Since the science has become clear that pollen containing agricultural chemicals is contributing to the death of bees, what are these same chemicals in our food doing to us?
In the absence of proper safety tests, this is a difficult question to answer.  But there is a striking correlation between the decline of the bee population, which was first widely noted in the late 1990s -- soon after the introduction of neonicotinoids and glyphosate resistant crops -- and an increase in the relative frequency of several human diseases , such as autism and gastrointestinal conditions, in the same time frame.
Perhaps the dying bees are telling us something about the future of human health.  Unless the system of chemical-based agriculture is changed, the chemical exposure of both bees and humans will continue to increase.
Individuals can demand that their state governments phase out the use of the most dangerous agricultural chemicals. Creating a sustainable and safe food supply is essential for the health and future of both bees and humans.

New planet discovered by 15-year-old intern
Updated 2310 GMT (0610 HKT) June 11, 2015
Tom Wagg was an intern at Keele University's observatory when he discovered the planet.

Advice to interns: work hard and make your mark. And if you can discover a new planet while you're at it, you could also be pushing the boundaries of our knowledge.
Believe it or not, a 15-year-old boy did just that, according to Keele University in England , UK. While undertaking work experience at the university, Tom Wagg noticed a tiny dip in the light of a star as a planet passed in front of it -- that planet had supposedly not been on anyone's radar until then. The university said it has since taken two years to verify his findings.
"I'm hugely excited to have a found a new planet, and I'm very impressed that we can find them so far away," Tom said, according to a statement from the university. He apparently spotted the planet by scouring the data collected by Keele University's WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project, which scans millions of stars in night skies and searches for tiny dips, or transits, caused by the passing of planets.
An artist's impression of WASP-142b orbiting its star.
Nameless for the time being, the new planet has been labeled with the catalog number WASP-142b, as it's the 142nd discovery by the WASP collaboration.
Invisible to the naked eye and 1,000 light years away, the planet is the same size as Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, but orbits its star in only two days. Such frequent orbits make such planets easier to find -- if you can describe the feat as easy.
After the discovery of the planet, astronomers at the University of Geneva and the University of Liege confirmed that it had the required size and mass to be identified as a planet. And the university is planning a competition to find a name.
A star student at a nearby school and a science enthusiast, Wagg had requested the work experience after learning that Keele University had a research group studying extrasolar planets, or exoplanets -- planets that exist around stars other than the sun.
According to NASA, the first exoplanet was spotted in 1995 and 5,000 have been discovered ever since. The space agency says on its website that such findings provide hope in finding another Earth.

This might look like a painting, but it's actually a photograph. Its author, Serge Najjar, has the ability to find the visually arresting in everyday life.

Talking to CNN, Najjar says he only discovered photography four years ago -- and even then, at the behest of his mother.
"She registered me and my brother at a course her friend was running. The professor needed another two or three students for the class to go ahead, so she was helping her out," he says. "It's typical of the Lebanese mother, very present in her children's lives -- I was 37!"

He arrived at his first class a complete novice, but with what describes as the inherent ability to "sense when an art piece is good."
Najjar set out trying to treat his traditional camera as he would that on his phone, opting to use unconventional angles and the square aspect ratio found on Instagram. Whilst he developed his technical abilities, a clear focus began to develop in his output.

Najjar says he "was obsessed with architecture straight away." Drawing on constructivism, Parisian avant-garde and MC Escher, Najjar's work is all about finding art in architecture," describing his subject as a "playground for abstract photography."
"In Lebanon," he says, "we don't have very exciting architecture, but I always say it's not about what you see, but how you see it."

His first show, "Lines, Within" in 2012 -- for which Najjar had to teach himself how to develop his own photographs -- was a runaway success, with nearly all of the 32 displayed works selling.

Today he rises at 5 am at the weekends to capture his images, driving to nondescript locations.
"I try not to show the surroundings of the buildings," Najjar says, arguing it helps emphasize his photography's abstract qualities. The effect deprives the observer of context, creating an "anonymous message" to be decoded. Najjar believes the presence of people in his images is important however, as it provides "a certain scale and warmth to the architecture."

Here's the scenario:
The business meet wraps up in Boston, now an urgent situation is developing in Los Angeles.
A quick check of flight schedules reveals there's a premium-rate business-class seat available.
However, the flight doesn't depart until first thing tomorrow.
But hang on, there's another option.
A private jet, leaving when you want it to leave.
And it's cheaper too.
Seriously.
In the wake of Uber 's shake-up of the taxi market and AirBnB 's impact on accommodations, that most exclusive industry of all, executive aviation, could soon be disrupted in the same way.
So does that mean that ordinary business travelers could soon be switching to low-cost private aircraft in the same way they've been switching to cheaper, convenient cabs across town?
Some aviation entrepreneurs think so.
They're creating simple, sleek mobile apps to optimize spare capacity in the private jet market and create a smooth booking experience.
Obviously private aviation isn't going to be for the masses, but what if this exclusive preserve of the super-rich is about to become accessible to the merely affluent -- those that today fill the front cabin section of commercial aircraft?
Instead of calling a broker or buying into shared exec jet ownership, these new apps allow travelers to secure a private aircraft with just a few clicks and no membership fees.
Online marketplaces like Jetsmarter , Victor or Ubair rely on complex predictive algorithms to aggregate aircraft availability data from hundreds of private jet operators and provide quotes within seconds.
Cheaper than driving?
"We are a high tech big data company at core," says Sergey Petrossov, Jetsmarter's founder, adding that most of his company's clients are newcomers to executive aviation.
Petrossov sees a future where the executive jet industry goes the way of the Uber-reshaped taxi market.
He believes apps could even become so efficient that prices drop to the point where private aircraft not only take business from traditional operators and airlines, but from road transport.
Fleets of small propeller aircraft could lure people away from cars and into the skies.
Richard Koe, managing director of aviation market intelligence consultancy WINGX, is more cautious.
Yes, some new players are streamlining the booking process, he says, but that might not be enough to bring prices down to levels that'll open up private flights to greater numbers.
Victor recently acquired YoungJets, responsible for masterminding music tours for the likes of Rihanna.
Empty-leg solutions
Koe instead thinks the online players might simply end up taking business from traditional brokers rather than disrupt the industry's structure.
They could, however, offer an efficient solution to the problem of so-called empty legs.
These happen when private jets fly without passengers as operators reposition them.
According to some industry estimates, empty legs account for more than a third of all private flights.
Jetsuite , a light-jet operator based in California, pioneered discounted online sales of empty legs and others have followed suit.

Known as "The Man with the Golden Arm," nearly every week for the past 60 years he has donated blood plasma from his right arm. The reasons can be traced back to a serious medical procedure he underwent as a child.
"In 1951, I had a chest operation where they removed a lung -- and I was 14," recalls Harrison, who is now aged 78.
"When I came out of the operation, or a couple days after, my father was explaining what had happened. He said I had (received) 13 units (liters) of blood and my life had been saved by unknown people. He was a donor himself, so I said when I'm old enough, I'll become a blood donor."
A deadly problem
Soon after Harrison became a donor, doctors called him in. His blood, they said, could be the answer to a deadly problem.
"In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didn't know why, and it was awful," explains Jemma Falkenmire, of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service . "Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage."

It was the result of rhesus disease -- a condition where a pregnant woman's blood actually starts attacking her unborn baby's blood cells. In the worst cases it can result in brain damage, or death, for the babies.
Rhesus disease happens when a pregnant woman has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive), inherited from its father. If the mother has been sensitized to rhesus-positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an rhesus-positive baby, she may produce antibodies that destroy the baby's "foreign" blood cells.
Harrison was discovered to have an unusual antibody in his blood and in the 1960s he worked with doctors to use the antibodies to develop an injection called Anti-D. It prevents women with rhesus-negative blood from developing RhD antibodies during pregnancy.
"Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time," says Falkenmire.
Precious gift
Harrison's blood is precious. He and Anti-D are credited with saving the lives of more than 2 million babies, according to the Australian Red Cross blood service: That's 2 million lives saved by one man's blood.
"Every bag of blood is precious, but James' blood is particularly extraordinary," says Falkenmire. "His blood is actually used to make a life-saving medication, given to moms whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. Every batch of Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James' blood.
"And more than 17% of women in Australia are at risk, so James has helped save a lot of lives."
One of those lives is that of baby Samuel, who is just five weeks old. His mother, Kristy Pastor, first received the Anti-D injection during her second pregnancy. With Harrison's antibodies in her blood, little Samuel is her fourth happy and healthy baby.
"They just said you needed the vaccine," she said. "I didn't think about it any further, and then looking into it a bit more, I found out about James and how amazing he is and how many donations he's made, and that it was all because of him.
"I'm grateful and I think James is really selfless to continue to donate, so that we can keep having this vaccine."

Doctors still aren't exactly sure why Harrison has this rare blood type but they think it might be from the transfusions he received when he was 14, after his lung surgery. He's one of no more than 50 people in Australia known to have the antibodies, according the Australian Red Cross blood service.
"I think James is irreplaceable for us," says Falkenmire.
"I don't think anyone will be able to do what he's done, but certainly we do need people to step into his shoes," she adds. "He will have to retire in the next couple years, and I guess for us the hope is there will be people who will donate, who will also ... have this antibody and become life savers in the same way he has, and all we can do is hope there will be people out there generous enough to do it, and selflessly in the way he's done."
Harrison is considered a national hero, and has won numerous awards. He's now donated his plasma more than 1,000 times, but no matter how many times he's given blood there's one thing that will never change: "Never once have I watched the needle go in my arm," he says.
"I look at the ceiling or the nurses, maybe talk to them a bit, but never once have I watched the needle go in my arm. I can't stand the sight of blood, and I can't stand pain."

Her career has been a rollercoaster both on and off the pitch, but USWNT goalkeeper Hope Solo produced a display in the Women's World Cup that one teammate described as "freaking huge."
Solo's performance in the USWNT's 3-1 win over Australia in its opening game of the tournament rekindled memories of Tim Howard's heroics in last year's men's World Cup.
Howard was dubbed the "Secretary of Defense" by adoring fans on social media.
Solo had gone into the match in Winnipeg under something of a storm.

The United States is considered by many to be the favorite in this year's Women's World Cup, and a big reason why is goalkeeper Hope Solo. Solo has made headlines for some off-the-field troubles in recent years, but on the field she is simply one of the best keepers in the world. She won the award for best goalkeeper at the 2011 World Cup, and she was the starter for the gold-medal teams at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.

Wambach, who at 5-foot-11 is the tallest person on the team, is an imposing figure in the penalty box and a clinical header of the ball. She was the 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year.

The 33-year-old has been embroiled in a domestic violence case since June 2014, though charges against her were dismissed by a judge in Washington state in January.
However later that month, Solo was suspended by U.S. Soccer for 30 days following "an incident that occurred during a WNT training camp being held in Carson, California."
Solo's husband, former pro football player Jerramy Stevens, was charged with driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California, about 12 miles from Carson. The Los Angeles Times reported that Solo was in the passenger seat.
"I am perfectly focused, sir, perfectly focused," Solo responded when asked if her preparations had been affected by new details ESPN provided ahead of the match against Australia.
USWNT team media officials then cut short Solo's interview.
Her first standout moment came after just five minutes when she tipped Emily van Egmond's shot onto the bar and out for a corner.

 U.S. Soccer WNT (@ussoccer_wnt) June 8, 2015
She then produced another show-stopping save, getting down low to her right to deny Samantha Kerr what would have been a sublime volley just seconds after the Americans had taken the lead.
"Hope Solo was freaking huge," star player Megan Rapinoe told Fox Sports. "I think she had three saves that I don't think anybody else in the world can make.
"It was a little bit of a shaky game for us, especially the first 30 minutes. It's big and obviously the first tournament for a lot of people, only my second, so to get out of here with three points is huge."
Despite all of Solo's efforts in goal, there was still work to be done at the other end -- and 35-year-old veteran Rapinoe duly obliged.
Her deflected effort from distance after 12 minutes deceived Aussie 'keeper Melissa Barbieri to open the scoring.
Lisa De Vanna found a way past Solo 15 minutes later before Christen Press restored the U.S.'s lead just after the hour mark.
Rapinoe sealed the win on 78 minutes, a mazy dribble and finish that she described as her "best Lionel Messi impression."

"Megan thrives in these big games, big moments," U.S. Coach Jill Ellis said in a post-match press conference. "She's got ice running through her veins, but a lot of passion inside of her. She's a game-changer. And that's what makes her special."
"I probably shoot too much," joked Rapinoe. "It doesn't matter what kind of shot it is for me  I'll take it."
"A couple bits of class in the end from Rapinoe changed the game," said Alen Stajcic, the Australian coach.
The U.S. will be hoping for more moments of magic from Solo and Rapinoe when it plays Sweden on Friday.

ISIS twins: From schoolgirls to jihadi widows 02:37
Just a year ago, twins Salma and Zahra Halane were popular, high-achieving teens, studying hard at school in northern England and aspiring to careers in medical science.
But in June 2014, the pair - then aged 16 -- ran away from what the local community describes as a "very religious family home in northern England, in June 2014, traveling first to Turkey and then across the border into Syria.
Within weeks, according to the ISD, they had both been married to ISIS fighters; on what's believed to be Salma's account, there is advice to other would-be recruits on how to find a husband in ISIS territory.
The ISD says her sister Zahra uses her strong Twitter presence to celebrate and encourage the work of Islamic terrorists.
On September 11, she is said to have tweeted: "Happy #9/11 Happiest day of my life. Hopefully more to come InSha Allah #IS" and she also appeared to revel in news of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in January.
The ISD believes both girls' husbands were killed within days of each other last December. Zahra purportedly announced her husband's "martyrdom" in a tweet on December 6: "He was a blessing from Allah ... I will join him very sooooon :')".
Less than a week later, a post believed to be from Salma: "May Allah accept my husband ... I am among the [wives] of shuhada [martyrs] and [I'm] honoured to be chosen".
CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of either of the posts attributed to the girls by ISD.
The girls, who are of Somali descent, are thought to have been influenced by their older brother, who, according to authorities, traveled to the battlefields of Syria in 2013. He has reportedly left the war behind and is now in Denmark, according to the ISD and a community leader in Denmark.
The family has not responded to CNN's request for comment on this story.
The twins appear defiant on social media, but analysts say such combative public profiles often mask private doubts. But even if the girls do want to leave ISIS, they face a tougher journey than their brother.
"If you are a female and you journey to ISIS territory, it's 10 times harder for you to return back to Western society," explains Saltman. "We have a few hundred cases of men who have returned, but for women it's almost impossible.
"This is because just to leave your house you need to have male permission. You need to have an escort to take you around. Once you arrive in ISIS territory your passport is ... confiscated.  For you to try and leave and wander towards to border is almost impossible."

        <MainBody>How China's astronauts prepare for space 01:23
PLAY VIDEO
In October last year, China launched its most ambitious unmanned space mission to date: to orbit the moon and then return to Earth.
Nicknamed "Xiaofei," or "Little Flyer" on Chinese social networks, the unmanned orbiter traversed 840,000 kilometers on its eight-day mission that saw it round the far side of the moon and take some incredible pictures of Earth and the moon together, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported .
It then successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and parachuted down to the surface in Inner Mongolia.
Wu Yanhua, vice director of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said at the time the successful test mission has gathered a lot of experimental data and laid "a solid foundation for future missions."
While China hasn't committed to it, many analysts think it wants to put a man on the moon.
However, when asked, Commander Nie won't be drawn on whether this is the ultimate goal of the country's space program.
"For the next step, the focus is Tiangong-2  and then we will do more preparatory work for the space station."

        <MainBody>India's poor hit hardest by deadly heat wave 01:35
PLAY VIDEO
India is experiencing Loo winds, hot and dry westerly gusts from Pakistan and northwest India which dries out the region, according to CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett. That means that air moisture, or dew point, is low. When a monsoon advances, and one is expected to hit as early as the end of this week, there is always more dry heat.
Isn't it hot in nearby countries?
Neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan are hot, with temperatures well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but India appears to be suffering far worse, due in part to its many densely populated areas.
About two-thirds of India's 1.2 billion people have access to electricity. That would mean that in India alone about 400 million people do not have reliable access to air conditioning and refrigeration.
And India suffers because of geography. High mountains block cool air coming from the northeast, said Garrett.
It's 42 degrees celsius. A warm wind makes it feel even hotter. #indiaheatwave pic.twitter.com/bclIRPbNB0

Is a hotter future ahead?
India is used to intense early summers. May is typically India's hottest month with temps in some parts of the country hovering around 104 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (around 40 degrees Celsius). Heatwaves are common in India. Hundreds died in 2002 and 2003 as a result of the heat.
Studies suggest India is in for more rough summers . The southern part of the country, which has mostly escaped the buckling heat, is predicted to suffer more heat waves. Overall, more parts of India will suffer heat waves that last longer -- possibly 30 days.
Recent analysis by Verisk MapleCroft suggests that over the course of just one generation, the heat stress currently felt in the worst-hit states of Andra Pradesh and Telangana will be felt across most of the country.
When will the heat wave end?
It's possible that a monsoon could hit by the end of the week and bring relief. On Wednesday night, a light shower in Hyderabad brought some relief to millions who had been praying for rain.
In the meantime, water camps are open and commuters are doing their best to survive.

        <MainBody>Story highlights
Man, 41, reunites with his biological mother in Chile after four decades
His mother was told that her baby died shortly after birth, but he was instead adopted by U.S. couple
Chile has thousands of cases of illegal adoptions from the 1970s and 1980s under dictatorship
Santiago, Chile (CNN)
It was a hug kept on hold for more than 41 years. The hug of a mother and son whose lives were abruptly separated four decades ago.
Nelly Reyes had been waiting for hours in the international arrivals lounge at Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport in Santiago, holding a hand-made red poster board sign that said "Lovingly waiting for Travis, your mother Nelly and family." A granddaughter in her early 20s and a 10-year-old grandson keep her company.
On the other side of the terminal, going through immigration and customs, Travis Tolliver was anxious and nervous.  Up until the last minute, mainly because of a language barrier, he didn't know if anybody would show up to greet him.
When he finally came out of the terminal, no words were needed. They rushed to each other's arms and held on for a long hug. Few relatives knew the real story.
Tolliver had tears of joy. "I don't know how I feel. It's crazy! I never thought this could happen," he said.
Reyes, 61, could barely talk. "I'm going to hug him every day. I love him so much," she said.
The emotions released in that hug at the airport were the culmination of four decades of heartbreak, lies, deception, criminal acts and an injustice that separated mother and son at birth.
Stolen at birth
The newborn baby ended up living thousands of miles away, being raised in Tacoma, Washington, by a couple who had no knowledge of what had happened, while his biological mother cried and desperately tried to find her son.
Tolliver says he always knew he was adopted. What the 41-year-old supervisor at an imports distribution center didn't know was that he was stolen as a baby in his native Chile, only hours after his birth.
He hopes that knowing the truth about his past will now allow him to overcome a psychological trauma he has suffered for as long as he can remember. He says he has "abandonment issues."
"You know, I wasn't given up willingly like I thought for all these years, so that makes my heart feel wonderful; but it's just coming to terms with that. This whole thing still seems unreal to me," Tolliver said.
Reyes says she had a normal pregnancy with no medical issues. The mother of six children, including Tolliver, says she gave birth to a healthy baby boy at 4 p.m. on November 15, 1973. She was 19.
But her joy quickly turned to sadness when a nurse told the baby was born with a heart condition and was unlikely to survive.
"Hours later they told me he had died," Reyes said. Despite her multiple pleas, Reyes says she was never shown a body and was never given a death certificate.

Tolliver's case is not unique in Chile, according to Marcela Labraa, the director of the country's child protection agency (SENAME, by its Spanish acronym).
"This is no longer a myth. We know nowadays that this happened and it was real. It's not a tale that a couple of people were telling," Labraa said.
Her agency is currently investigating hundreds of cases, but Labraa says there could be thousands of cases of illegal adoptions from the 1970s and 1980s, when the country was ruled by a repressive dictatorship.
Tolliver and Reyes believe he was stolen. He is now working with authorities to find out what exactly happened to him.
In Chile they call them "Children of Silence."  Some babies were stolen and sold. Other newborns were given away by their grandparents who conspired with doctors, priests and nuns to hide a daughter's socially embarrassing pregnancy.
'Children of Silence' seek truth
Priest investigated
Prosecutor Mario Carroza investigated Gerardo Joannon, a priest accused of acting as a secret liaison between well-to-do families in Chile and adoptive parents as a part of a scheme also involving doctors, nurses and nuns in the 1970s.
Carroza says the priest, who belongs to the Sacred Hearts congregation, was investigated for the crimes of theft of minors, falsification of documents, and usurpation of identity.
To the dismay of those seeking answers, Carroza determined that even though Joannon might have committed those crimes, it was so long ago that he couldn't be prosecuted.
"In this case we're talking about a period between 15 and 20 years ago, which means the statute of limitations has run out," Carroza said.
The congregation to which Father Joannon belongs also conducted an internal investigation last year into the allegations and sent its findings to the Vatican. The Holy See later determined that even though the priest had made ethical and moral mistakes, none of his actions had risen to the level of a violation of canon law.
In his only on-camera interview in April 2014 with Chile's Channel 13, Joannon denied all the accusations, including telling women their children had died in order to give the babies to other couples.
"I never told anybody the babies had died because I didn't even know if they had been born, or if they were male or female," he said on Channel 13. "I never knew anything."
Still
In Tolliver's case, it's not clear who took him from his mother or whether there was any money involved.
Tolliver says his U.S. adoptive parents never knew he had been stolen. They were told he was an abandoned baby.
Tolliver also says he tried to find his biological parents when he was in his 20s but didn't have the connections to make it happen.
It was not until last year, he says, that he determined he needed to find the truth about his past not only for himself, but also for his two children. He says the decision was, in part, motivated by seeing several news stories about stolen children in Chile, including CNN's "Children of Silence."
The news that he was matched to his biological mother through DNA testing has been difficult to digest, Tolliver says, especially for his adoptive mother.
"But she's always going to be my mom --  it's just that I have two now -- she raised me. I am who I am because of what she did for me. She's always going to have a place in my heart and it's not like I'm replacing her or anything like that," Tolliver said.
Reuniting with siblings
Since reuniting with his biological mother, Tolliver has been busy meeting four brothers and one sister and seeing the sights of the country.
"Now I'm back here in my homeland I guess. I'm going to explore and see what the country is all about," he said.
One of his stops was the site where the hospital where he was born once stood. The Enrique Deformes Hospital in the coastal city of Valparaso has since been demolished and Chile's main congressional building now sits in its place.
As to why he would travel such great distance from his home in Yelm, Washington, and spend so much money -- some of it raised through a GoFundMe appea l -- to find the truth about his past, Tolliver is unequivocal. "To become whole," he says choking up and fighting back tears. "I've always felt incomplete, always kind of the outsider. My adoptive parents have blonde hair blue eyes. I just kind of stood out like a sore thumb."
Reyes, his biological mother, has been cooking for him daily and going out of her way to make him feel welcome.  He doesn't speak Spanish and she doesn't speak English.
But more than anything, she's been showing him her love, giving her son the hugs and kisses that she was unable to give him all of the years gone by.

A botanist and historian believes he's discovered picture of Shakespeare
Only two verified likenesses are thought to exist
(CNN)
Is this the Bard I see before me?
That's what botanist and historian Mark Griffiths believes. He says that a drawing of a man on the cover of a 1598 book about plants is a picture of William Shakespeare.
If Griffiths' theory holds up, it would be a major find -- and it's being trumpeted as such by the UK magazine Country Life, which is revealing the discovery in its new issue .
It's "the literary discovery of the century," Country Life editor Mark Hedges told the UK Guardian. "This is the only known verifiable portrait of the world's greatest writer made in his lifetime. It is an absolutely extraordinary discovery; until today, no one knew what William Shakespeare looked like in his lifetime."
There are only two verified likenesses of Shakespeare known today, both from after his death in 1616. One is the famed one of a balding man in a wide collar, taken from the First Folio , published in 1623. The other is a memorial at a church in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon.
If the man on the book, "The Herball," is Shakespeare, he would have been in his early 30s and would have already written a number of the plays based on English kings, including "Richard III" and both parts of "Henry IV." Still in his future were "Hamlet," "Othello," "King Lear" and "Macbeth," all of which probably date from the early 1600s.
To determine that the picture is Shakespeare, Griffiths had to unlock some elaborate Elizabethan codes, he told the Guardian. There are four men pictured on "The Herball," and he figured who three of them were relatively easily: the book's author, John Gerard, the subject of some Griffiths research; botanist Rembert Dodoens; and royal minister William Cecil, Lord Burghley.
But the fourth took some doing.
"He's dressed as a Roman, wearing laurels and meant to make us think of Apollo and poetry. ... I couldn't think of anybody really who was a direct intimate of Gerard's and was involved in writing his book," he told the Guardian.
Through a variety of clues, including an arrowhead, a peculiar flower and a W, Griffiths deduced that the man was Shakespeare.
Hedges believes the theory is correct. "The more you find out about the story, the more it glues together," he said in a Country Life video.
But not to a number of experts.
"There's no evidence that anybody thought that this was Shakespeare at the time," professor Michael Dobson, director of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC .
And in a Guardian essay , art critic Jonathan Jones compared the theory to something Dan Brown would have come up with: "fanciful tosh."
"There is no 'proof' at all here that the moustachioed man in the engraving is Shakespeare," he wrote. "His complex strings of argument are massive acts of overinterpretation."
Griffiths, though, is convinced.
"It is not an assumption that he is Shakespeare, it is algebra. ... It is an equation," he said.
Interpretation, then, may be in the eye of the beholder.
Or as Shakespeare wrote in "Antony and Cleopatra," "In nature's infinite book of secrecy / A little I can read."

Rohingya migrant boat missing in the Andaman Sea 02:32
In the Andaman Sea, aboard a fishing vessel searching Thai waters for vessels carrying refugees, a CNN crew saw several Thai navy vessels on patrol.
Kraiwut Chusakul, a local fisherman, said he's seen one of the many boats filled with Rohingya refugees. "There are so many children on the boat," he said. "I think there must have been around 100 small children."
The boat Kraiwut saw hasn't been seen since, and despite searching and asking other fishing boats if any refugee ships had been spotted, the CNN crew also turned up a blank.
"I feel so sorry for them," Kraiwut said. "It's so different to when you see these refugees on land, and the conditions are so terrible."
Late last week, residents on Koh Lipe Island in southern Thailand could be seen collecting food, water and clothes to take to the migrants on board the boats, but since then the military has told them not to take supplies out to the boats, or to talk to journalists about the situation.
Fortify told CNN that patrol ships stay ahead of those searching for these ships, chasing them out of territorial waters, so journalists and rights groups cannot get a clear understanding of the situation.
The country will host trilateral talks between the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand this week in an attempt to resolve the current impasse, and will again host a larger meeting of ASEAN nations on May 29.
Indonesia
Indonesian military spokesman Fuad Basya told CNN on May 18: "We have four navy vessels guarding our territorial waters in Aceh now. The policy remains -- we won't let any illegal migrants in."
Its foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, will attend meetings in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday in an attempt to find a solution to the growing humanitarian crisis.
However, she told reporters Tuesday that Indonesia has "given more than it should" to help those stranded at sea.
The UNHCR reports that, in the last week, Indonesian fishermen have rescued more than 1,300 Bangladeshis and Rohingya, whose vessels had entered Indonesian territorial waters after they drifted or swam to shore in Aceh and North Sumatran provinces.
The chief of the Aceh Search and Rescue Agency (SAR), Budiawan tells CNN approximately 100 migrants were rescued Wednesday by fishermen and the SAR.
However, Indonesian fishermen were being discouraged from actively searching for and rescuing stranded refugees.
"If they encounter any boats then of course they can rescue and tow them in, for humanitarian reasons. But their job is to catch fish and they shouldn't be going out to search for these boats," Basya said.
The Philippines
Despite being geographically distant from the epicenter of this growing humanitarian crisis, the Philippines has offered to allow the migrant boats landing rights.
The government quickly reacted to a report in local press saying that it would "push back to sea" any refugees that tried to land on Filipino soil.
Herminio Coloma Jr., a spokesperson for the country's Presidential Communications Operations Office said in a statement May 18 that the Philippines has extended humanitarian assistance for "boat people" in the past, citing its establishment of a processing center for Vietnamese migrants in the 1970s.
Citing the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, or which the Philippines is a signatory, Coloma said: "We shall continue to do our share in saving lives under existing and long-standing mechanisms pursuant to our commitments under the Convention."

The Rohingya are a persecuted Muslim minority who are effectively stateless in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are forced to live in crowded camps -- which they are generally forbidden to leave --  and are considered to be interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, despite the fact that many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

More than 1,600 migrants -- both Rohingya and economic migrants from Bangladesh -- have landed in Malaysia and Indonesia since Sunday, May 10, officials say, after Thai officials began cracking down on human trafficking camps operating in the country's south near the Malaysian border, disrupting established people-smuggling networks.

Rohingya migrants swim to collect food supplies dropped by a Thai army helicopter after they jumped from the boar adrift in Thai waters on May 14.  With the Thai pipeline for illegal migrants closed, overcrowded traffickers' boats have begun offloading their human cargo on the shores of Malaysia and Indonesia -- Muslim-majority countries that have shown sympathy to the Rohingya in the past. Alternatively, crews have simply abandoned them to drift.

Ronan Yver took fun photos of farm animals, getting to know their personalities
"I am also telling a story about human beings," Yver said. "I wanted to create caricatures"
(CNN)
You can tell a lot about a person from their expressions. Perplexed eyebrows, pursed lips.
Animals are no different.
From raised noses to lowered heads, outward displays of emotion are not exclusive to humans. But perhaps that isn't the message inked in these portraits taken by Ronan Yver .
Farm animals have their own stories. Their lives consist of more than rolling in the mud and grazing the fields. The perception of farm life cannot be taken at face value. You have to dig deeper for the truth under the skin.
But it's a story they cannot share -- at least not verbally. So Yver decided to document it for them through two lenses: his Canon camera and his literary prowess.
Photographer Ronan Yver
"I shot animals, but I am also telling a story about human beings," Yver said. "I wanted to create caricatures."
As a primary school teacher in Brent, France, he sees the world through tales of personification, from the legendary "Little Red Riding Hood" to the modern "Puss in Boots."
In French poetry, Jean de La Fontaine is well known for his fables that criticized Louis XIV during the 17th century. Fontaine replaced humans with animals: Louis XIV was a lion, aristocracy became wolves or foxes, and the weak were portrayed as lambs.
And thus, Yver's series "Animal Moods" was born out of a respect for allegoric storytelling, a passion for photography and a heavy dose of Animalia.

Yver spent several years with farm animals, getting to know their personalities through his wide-angle lens. Seeing the humanity in their eyes, he began to create a catalog of common feelings and moods and character traits, labeling the photos with captions such as "pride" or "elegance" or "innocence."
"We love our pets, but what about these (animals)?" Yver said. "We feed them and we eat them. But we can also take photographs and tell a story."
And telling that story was not always so easy.
"It's so difficult to take photographs of animals," he said. "I'm so close to them I can't hide! ... Sometimes they want to fight!"

In 2010, photographer Vlad Sokhin gained rare access to the rituals and practices of the Nyau brotherhood, a secret society of the Chewa people that exists in communities in Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. He reveals how he managed to infiltrate, and ultimately join, this secret group. Photographs by Vlad Sokhin.

Vlad Sokhin: "From 2010-2011, I lived in Mozambique's Tete province, where I was doing different jobs. One of them was for a coal exploration company. One day they asked me to photograph the opening ceremony for a new camp. While I was waiting for the ceremony to start, I saw someone pop out of the bush wearing feathers and a mask. Locals started screaming, 'Nyau,' and started to run."

"I had no idea what Nyau was, so I started to do some research," said Sokhin.
"I learned it was a secret society within the Chewa culture. Chewa people live in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. I found out that many locals, and even policemen, were afraid of the Nyau and considered them dangerous. One type of Nyau, known as Nyau 'kampini,' or 'dangerous Nyau,' (pictured) walk around with machetes and have a reputation for attacking people."

"One policeman told me they are never prosecuted. 'How can you put an elephant or snake in jail? The same is with Nyau,' he said. In spite of the rumors, I never heard of any accident involving a Nyau while I was there."

"The performance I witnessed was the Gule Wamkulu, a secret cult and ritual practiced by the Nyau brotherhood during the harvest, as well as important ceremonies, like weddings and funerals. Gule Wamkulu means 'The Great Dance' in the Chewa language. It is performed by the Nyau, who wear masks and costumes that represent the spirits of animals, called 'nyama,' and of their ancestors, called 'mizimu.' The ritual has had UNESCO protection since 2005, when it was included as one of 90 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity."

"After my first encounter with the Nyau, I spent a year in Mozambique looking for more dances, and trying to find members, so I could photograph them. This proved difficult, since everything about the Nyau is kept secret. If you're part of the Nyau cult, you're not supposed to tell anyone."

"Nyau keep both their rituals and their identity a closely-guarded secret. I later learned that during a ritual, the dancers will rotate so no one can tell their identity.
"If you see a whole family watching a dance, maybe the husband will leave for a bit then go to a secret place to change and dance, then come back so his mother, sister or wife won't know he's a member. If one dancer falls down and injures himself and starts limping, all members of the Nyau will start limping so no one can identify the injured dancer. "

"One day I met a teacher from Zimbabwe named Ofis, who started to ask me why I was so interested in the Nyau. We ultimately became friends, and he confessed that he was a member. I started to learn about the cult from him, but he said if I wanted to know more, I'd have to join."

"Ofis talked to the chiefs, and they agreed I could be a spectator at first, but nothing more. I started to go every week and take pictures of the dances, but I wanted to see more. I wanted to go inside and see how they made their masks.
"First, I had to be accepted as a member of the Nyau. One day, they said they were willing to accept me, but I would have to go through a ceremony."

"Afterward, I had to kill a chicken with the other new members, so we could take the feathers and add them to our costumes later. Later, I was brought to a nearby village, where I was covered in a fabric and flowers, and the Nyau came out, already in costume."

"This photograph is of the initiation. When I was initiated, they hit me a little bit with a stick -- hitting is an important part of the ceremony as it serves as a warning not to reveal the secrets of the Nyau.

6,400 employees at a Chinese company were sent to France for a company paid trip
The staff also broke a Guinness World Record for building the largest human sentence in Nice
(CNN)
More than 6,000 employees of Tiens Group -- a Chinese conglomerate -- were given the VIP treatment on an all expenses paid trip to France to celebrate the company's 20th birthday.
The tour group -- the largest to visit the country -- was given a private tour of the Louvre museum and a private shopping session  at luxury department store Galeries Lafayette during their four-day trip, reported French news agency Agence France-Presse.
After two days in Paris, the group headed down to the southern resort town of Nice on Friday, where they also broke a Guinness World Record for forming the largest human sentence.
All staff members lined up on the waterfront, Promenade des Anglais, to spell out the phrase "Tiens' dream is nice in the Cte d'Azur" that was visible from above.
The Chinese company broke a Guinness World Record for building the largest human sentence in Nice, France.
According to local media, the company booked 4,760 rooms in 79 hotels between Cannes and Monaco, and 146 tour buses.
"We have mobilized public services as well as tourism professionals, hotels, restaurants, shops and designer brands," Christian Mantel, head of the French tourism development agency told AFP.
It's estimated that the group will spend $15 million during their visit added Mantel, and France is seen to reap up to $20 million in total economic benefits.
Chinese tourists, who are known to be the world's biggest holiday spenders, are said to spend an average of $7,200 when they go overseas.
It's not the first time a Chinese company has arranged for massive tours overseas. Last year, a group of 7,000 made a trip to the U.S. to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties.
Tiens Group operates in a diverse range of business interests, including biotechnology, tourism and trade.

About 12,000 Mormons practice their faith in Cambodia
Mormons believe that families can be eternally connected through the practice of posthumous baptism
Cambodia's history of civil war and genocide make tracing family genealogy challenging
Matthew D. LaPlante is an assistant professor of journalism at Utah State University.
(Special to CNN)
When Eng Bunhuoch joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the late 1990s, there were just a handful of families practicing Mormonism in Cambodia.
Today, the Salt Lake City-based church claims more than 12,000 parishioners in this predominantly Buddhist nation.
That growth has come with a challenge for church leaders, who are now working to encourage fellow converts to engage in what Mormons consider a sacred duty: digging into family history for a Mormon ritual intended to give the dead an opportunity for a better afterlife.

But in a nation cursed by decades of civil war and one of the worst genocides in history -- a place where dredging up the past can be a tremendously painful experience -- that hasn't been an easy sell.
"Most people," said Eng, now the lay leader of a Mormon church in Phnom Penh, "prefer not to do it."
The Mormon preoccupation with family history research is connected to a belief that families can be eternally connected through the practice of posthumous baptism. The rite has stirred controversy in the past: The church has apologized on several occasions in which it was revealed that members performed such proxy baptisms for Jewish victims of the Nazi regime. Mormons now are instructed to only submit for baptism the names of those who are in their own family lineage.
Sophat Yin, who grew up in the western Cambodian city of Battambang during the Khmer Rouge regime and is now an organizer at the Cambodian Buddhist Society in Fresno, California, is troubled by the proxy baptisms for many of the same reasons Jewish survivors of the Holocaust were. Most of the estimated 1.8 million people killed during the Khmer Rouge's brutal four-year rule in the 1970s were Buddhist. And Buddhist leaders, he said, weren't consulted about the practice. It was just assumed, he noted, that they'd be fine with the same rules as were settled upon with leaders of other religions.
"We Buddhists believe in afterlife, reincarnation and karma," he said. "If I were to die during the Khmer Rouge time, I would ask Mormons to leave me alone."
Still, he said, since he doesn't believe the practice holds any spiritual weight on the souls of the dead, he is trying to not feel offended and trying to look at it as a harmless offered blessing.
In Cambodia, Mormon believers' efforts to baptize family members -- including some of those slaughtered during the Khmer Rouge rule -- have also thus far met with little public backlash. But that might be because, at least for the moment, the work is quite limited.
Samnang Kang, who was recently appointed to work as a family history consultant for church members in Phnom Penh, said last's year's goal was to submit 1,600 names to LDS temple workers in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Parishioners could only manage 1,322.
This year, she said, "we haven't set a goal."
A big part of the challenge is a lack of records. The Khmer Rouge, which occupied the nation from 1975 to 1979, is thought to have destroyed about half of all government records -- the kinds of documents frequently used by Mormons in other nations and which are provided even to non-believers through the church's FamilySearch.org service.
Many more documents weren't specifically targeted for destruction, but were left unprotected during the regime and either looted or ruined by nature, said Khamboly Dy, a staff member at the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has worked since 1995 to recover and restore the record of the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign.

"It is important to us to collect all the remaining documents and conduct interviews to reconstruct the record," he said.
To that end, the center has recorded conversations with more than 6,000 people -- a tiny fraction of the millions of individuals who survived the regime. But those oral histories are driven by an open-ended questionnaire and don't necessarily include genealogical information that would be helpful to those trying to trace their ancestry.
The center does have what might amount to a treasure trove of information for family history sleuths: As militaries are wont to do, the Khmer Rouge created detailed personnel records for many in its cadres. Center staffers said those records often do include information about soldiers' parents and other family members.
While Cambodian society generally treats Khmer Rouge foot soldiers as victims of the regime, that tolerance is at least partially contingent on a general disinclination to re-examine the past, as opening military personnel files might do. Equally if not more potentially painful: In studying the center's documents, family history searchers might happen upon the name of an ancestor only because another family member gave up that person's name under interrogation or torture.
Local Mormon leaders said they haven't yet asked to look into the documentation center's vaults, though the center's director, Youk Chhang, said he would welcome their queries. He noted that religion, in general, "was the enemy of the Khmer Rouge revolution" and that any avenue "for healing, forgiveness, and moving on" is worth exploring in a nation in which victims and perpetrators of atrocities still live, work and worship side by side.
The center's records potentially could help equalize family history resources in Southeast Asia. The LDS church has managed to acquire an extensive collection of government records from other countries across the region and has published those records on its family history website. However, the site has no historical records from Cambodia.
Paul Nauta, a public relations specialist for the LDS Church who specializes in family history, said even without records "the average person can usually remember three generations back. If you are fortunate to have a parent or grandparent still living, that affords the individual to trace their family history back up to six generations."
But Nauta said only a small set of patrons in Cambodia have listed more than four generations.
Including herself and her children, that's all Vanna Kim has been able to produce. And even at that, she said, "I had to pray for a miracle" that her Buddhist aunt and uncle would help her identify the names of her grandparents.
She's glad to have done her part to build the record base, but genealogy isn't for her. "It was an obligation," she said.
Khoem Samphon, whose written family tree is also only four generations deep, said it isn't just the governmental records that were lost in the Khmer Rouge years. The types of keepsakes many people use to trace back their lineage were often lost, too.
He was 27 years old when the Khmer Rouge swept into Phnom Penh and forced the relocation of millions of people across the country.
"We didn't bring any records with us," he said. "At that time, records were not important. Food was important."
Some of what was left behind -- family photographs, for instance -- are now sold, apparently for souvenirs, at ephemera shops catering to foreign tourists. Some of the pictures have names penciled on the back, but few have any more context than that.
Even if they did, it might not be helpful. Cambodians cycle through family names every few generations, and a lot of people changed their names when the Khmer Rouge came to power to hide familial affiliations.
"Because we were a political family, we did not want anyone to know where we came from," said Sok Mony, whose family didn't reclaim its name until long after the Khmer Rouge had left power.
For a time, during those years, she went by the name Eang Bunna.
"My family kept hiding until 1991," she said, "but my mother wouldn't open up about the past for many years after that."
Cambodians are rightfully proud of their distant past, said physician Lim Keuky, who lives and works minutes away from Angkor Wat, a thousand-year-old temple that draws hundreds of thousands of tourists to Cambodia each year and whose iconic towers appear on everything from the nation's favorite beer to its red, white and blue flag. But, he said, fellow Cambodians -- about 60% of whom are under the age of 30 -- generally prefer to ignore the much more recent past.
"That is why, if you go to someone who is 18 years old and talk about how genocidal the Khmer Rouge was, she would say, 'It's not possible -- you must be lying,' because the parents who lived at that time they don't want to remember," he said. "In trying to forget, then the same thing can come again."
But Lim, the president of the Cambodian Diabetes Association, noted that family history is also important for helping identify those most at risk for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. And increasingly, he added, researchers are demonstrating such conditions may be worse among those whose ancestors suffered traumatic stress, as so many Cambodians have.
"I want to say it strongly -- I cannot say it strongly enough -- that Cambodians must work to remember the past," Lim said.
Eng, who last year was appointed as a stake president to lead a new church by his home, said he also is hopeful his fellow Cambodians will wake up to the importance of learning about their family history, and not just for the purposes of Mormon rituals.
Logging into a computer at the church, he called up his family history profile on the genealogy website. Soon he was face to face with a black and white photograph of his father.
"You see," he laughed, "he is handsome like me."
Eng understands why Cambodians are hesitant to dig into their family roots; he was a member of the LDS church for more than a decade before he began to do so.
But now, Eng said, he'd like everyone to have the same experience he had once he began looking for long-lost relatives.
"When I would work on finding relatives," he said, "I pulled out my dad's picture and it felt like he was close to me again."

CNN's Moni Basu reported this story last week from the region where the epicenter of Tuesday's earthquake was located.
Lukla, Nepal (CNN)
The Goma Air flight makes a swift turn over jagged white peaks and lush Himalayan farmlands before a herky-jerky landing in what's been called the world's most dangerous airport.
Phurba Sherpa hurtles off the prop plane that on this day has carried four adults, two children and 16 gray bags that each weigh 53 pounds. Inside are industrial-strength, family-size tents donated by the German Red Cross.
In the aftermath of the enormous earthquake that shook Nepal, Phurba, a 49-year-old Kathmandu entrepreneur, has made it his business to get relief to his people. By that he means the Sherpas, the ethnic minorities who inhabit the towns and villages in the shadow of Mount Everest and are known worldwide as expert climbers.
The Sherpas prop up Nepal's lucrative trekking and tourism business, but the government, Phurba says, has never looked out for them. Isolated in remote mountainous villages, they have been a forgotten people in Nepal and now, after the earthquake, they fear being forgotten again.
For Phurba, the journey from the Kathmandu Valley up to the soaring peaks is not just a humanitarian mission to help thousands of people living in quake-affected villages.
It's personal.
"It is my duty," he says of the responsibility he feels to give back to the majestic land and people who shaped him as a man.
Phurba has no time to lose.
Namche Bazaar is usually bustling at this time of year in Nepal with mountaineers on their way to Everest Base Camp. Now, the town is dotted with tents filled with displaced people.
Few others are here to help. There's no Nepalese government presence. Nor do I see any of the hordes of international aid workers and members of the media who descended on Kathmandu within days of the earthquake.
Granted, the villages and towns that dot the hills and mountains under Everest are not as badly affected as other areas closer to the earthquake's epicenter. People here are not lacking for food and water at the moment. This is a region in eastern Nepal where the tourism industry has helped people fare better moneywise.
But Nepal is not just a poor nation; it is one of the poorest. And now, the tourist season has abruptly ended for two years in a row. Last year, a giant block of ice broke free and crashed down into the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp, killing 16 Sherpas.
The people here worry if they will ever be able to recover from tragedy. They wonder if tourists and trekkers will even consider returning to a place of such risk and sorrow.
Their villages are also places that can be extremely difficult to access -- there are no roads and the only way to travel is on foot. Some say it's hard to get aid delivered. But Phurba says there are ways -- donkeys are a popular means of transporting goods.
"If we wait for the government, it will take a lot of time," he says, blaming red tape and a lack of will.
I watch him make arrangements in his orange puffy down jacket, standing against the Himalayan vistas that tourists pay a lot of money to experience. I see a man who is determined amid a crisis of gigantic proportions.
I'd met Phurba in Kathmandu a few days earlier when I wrote about American mountaineer and filmmaker Tom Taplin , one of 19 known to have died on Everest. Phurba, who owns his own Himalayan tourism compan y, helped make all the arrangements for Taplin's body to be brought back down the mountain.
Phurba lamented to me then about the plight of his people. The attention, he said, has been cast on foreigners who were killed, injured or trapped, but not the Sherpas without whom Nepal's bustling trekking industry would not be possible. He told me a young man from his village was killed at the base camp and that the family is in mourning.
I asked if I could accompany him on his whirlwind trip to Solukumbhu District, thousands of feet above sea level. Two days later, I find myself racing to keep up with him.
Phurba Sherpa, center, discusses the earthquake's toll with Bal Bahadur KC, left, a  member of Nepal's Parliament who represents the district in which most of the affected Sherpa villages fall.
'Please help us'
At the Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla, the town where thousands of trekkers fly in to begin their journeys toward the skies, Phurba oversees the unloading of the Red Cross tents. Then he hops into a Fishtail helicopter that whisks him away to Phakding, where the lawmaker who represents this district is waiting.
Phurba invited Bal Bahadur KC on this assessment tour because he wanted someone from the government to see the earthquake's devastation in this part of country. Maybe then, Phurba thought, someone in Kathmandu would pay attention to the needs of his people.
We land in Phakding and find Bal Bahadur with his right arm in a sling. He has trouble getting onto the chopper. I ask him if he was injured in the earthquake. "No," he laughs. "I hurt it before then. But now I know what it feels like to have a broken arm."
The helicopter has no seats -- they were taken out to bring down the bodies of the dead from Everest Base Camp.
Pilot Mauritzio Folini tells me he used to love flying here -- joy rides in the sky in a place that arguably has the most fantastic views on Earth. The Nepalese name for Everest is Sagarmatha. Sagar means sky in Nepalese and matha, head. I am in a land that touches the heavens. From the helicopter, it's plain to see why that name is appropriate.

Only now, after the earthquake, this land is dotted with pockets of hell.
In the last few days, maneuvering the light helicopter around the peaks and through deep canyons has turned into a gruesome chore as Folini has made countless rescue flights up and down to Everest Base Camp.
"I am a climber myself. I love my job," Folini says. "But now ... it's a tragedy."
We land at a gravel heliport in front of the police station in Khunde, 13,000 feet above sea level, and walk down narrow dirt lanes that snake around clusters of stone, cement and wooden houses.
The landscape has a recent addition: hundreds of colorful tents made by North Face, Marmot and Mountain Hardwear. Households in Khunde and other Sherpa villages have at least one person employed in the tourism industry and many own high-end outdoor gear given to them by foreigners or knockoffs sold in the local markets.
Phurba surveys the destruction, writes down names and the amount of loss. Some houses have been flattened; others are severely damaged. Few have escaped unscathed.
This is where his wife grew up. It's shocking for Phurba to witness the devastation.
"How are you doing?" he asks everyone he sees.
The answer is like a song's refrain that he hears over and over.
"I was at the Saturday market and that is why I am alive," says Da Tsering Sherpa, 40. "But my house is destroyed."
"I have lost everything," says Pasang Lamu, 55, breaking down. "Please help us."
Phurba finds his wife's relatives. They are camping out in a tiny tent; their broken houses still stand as constant reminders of their suffering. Phurba has stayed in those houses so many times, shared meals there with loved ones.
"All gone," Phurba says to me. "This will all have to be rebuilt."
I can tell Phurba is making a heroic effort not to betray his emotions at this moment.
"We are the lucky ones," he says. "We are alive. There is no time to be sad. We have lots of work to do."
We trek through several villages, up and down dirt paths laden with rocks.
The same scenes of despair -- and frustration -- play out everywhere. Foundations shaken to the core, roads blocked off by falling rocks and with the upcoming monsoons, the threat of massive landslides along the fresh cracks in the earth.
In nearby Khumjung, Bal Bahadur doles out $400 -- a token amount -- to people who lost loved ones. That's what the government gave as compensation to the families of the 16 Sherpas who died on Everest last year. They saw the meager sum as derisory, government indifference to the Sherpas and the dangerous jobs they perform.
Those who lost their houses receive $100 on this afternoon. In this area alone, 164 houses are documented as gone. Bal Bahadur tries to assure residents that help is on the way.
"I will not forget you," he tells the people.
But few believe the government's intentions are true.
"We are citizens of Nepal," says Phurba's friend, Chungbu Sherpa. "And that is all. Beyond that there is no relationship. We have to take it upon ourselves to help each other."
Schoolteacher Chhunjing Dorjee Sherpa, 50, listens to what Bal Bahadur has to say but has little faith that the lawmaker will come through.
"Do you feel that aid is coming?" I ask.
"This is the Nepal government," he says. Maybe he will rely instead on a grant from a nonprofit or perhaps a bank will issue him a low-interest loan.
A woman who runs a small restaurant has few customers. Sherpas who serve the tourist community are hurting after two failed Everest climbing seasons.
Near Phakding, we see a centuries-old teaching monastery that barely withstood the earthquake. The 28 Buddhist monks and 18 students who live here are busy putting up wood supports to mitigate the risks of everything crashing down.
Phurba has made it a priority to generate money to get the monastery repaired. It's his history. His culture. It's like seeing the fallen temples and palaces in Kathmandu's UNESCO World Heritage site, national treasures that will never be the same.
He stays behind to discuss reparations. Nawang Nuru Sherpa, 38, works as a guide for Phurba and accompanies me to Phakding. On the way we stop to survey Nawang's property.
He gazes at the fertile farmlands. The fields are a vibrant green with new wheat; potatoes abound in the soil the color of charcoal. Beyond that, he sees his home, still standing but precariously.
He pitched a tent for himself, his wife, 9-year-old son and infant daughter. He saved as many things as he could from the house and arranged them in the tent as though it were home.
But it isn't.
"I am afraid no tourists will come here anymore," Nawang says. "Then how will I get money to rebuild my house?"
It is something that preoccupies Phurba.
He had planned to let me stay at a lodge he built a few years ago. But we arrive instead to heavy damage to all 20 rooms and 22 bathrooms. Boulders lie in front of a fireplace on the second-floor landing as though they, like an evil Santa Claus, hurtled down the chimney.
It took Phurba five years to build this lodge; nature took a few seconds to destroy it. He suspects he will have to demolish and rebuild by mid-September when the monsoons have ended and the fall Himalayan season begins. He estimates it will easily cost $300,000 to make the necessary fixes.
I tell him I am sorry for his losses and that even amid the destruction, it's hard not to be overcome by the beauty of this land.
"Bahut sundar hai," I say in Hindi to some of Phurba's employees. "It's very beautiful here."
One replies. "Bauhut sundar tha."
"It was very beautiful."
Helicopters usually ferry climbers to Everest Base Camp. This year, they have been carrying those who died or were injured in the quake back to lower ground.
A day of suffering
Seeing his wife's village in ruins was hard enough, but Phurba's heart shattered when he learned of the earthquake's wrath on Chaurikharka, the village he calls home. He dreaded seeing it. On the second day of our trek, he tells me to go ahead to Chaurikharka. He will follow later.
It takes six hours to reach the village. There is no doubting nature's wrath here.
Sheets of corrugated metal that flew off roofs and sides of houses obstruct the main dirt path. Chunks of stone and cement tumbled to the earth.
Nima Kiter, 74, rushes toward me waving his hands in the air.
"Everything gone," he says in broken English. "We would all be dead if this had happened at night."
Most of the residents of Chaurikharka know Phurba and are relieved that a native son has taken charge of rebuilding the village.
When Phurba was born 49 years ago, most Sherpas, including his father, either worked the land growing buckwheat and potatoes or they were traders selling goods from Tibet and India. But Phurba grew up as a new industry was blossoming: tourism.
Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary scaled to the summit of the world's tallest mountain in 1953, challenging climbers from all over the world to match their feat.
Many Sherpa men began charging foreigners money for acting as their guides, porters and support staff through this unforgiving terrain.
Purbha's father pushed him from an early age to get into the trekking business. But the headmaster at his school recalls how Purbha snuck away to study. He was determined to learn, leave the village and carve out a successful life for himself.
"My parents were disappointed in me," Phurba had told me when I first met him. "But I knew education was the key to seeing the world."
He saved the money from his occasional trekking jobs and left for Kathmandu. He paid for college tuition with his earnings from an aunt's tea shop and earned a degree in journalism and then a master's in sociology.
"There were no Sherpas in journalism then," he told me. "I wanted to make a difference."
But then Mount Everest became big business, and in 1992, Phurba launched his own firm: Himalayan Sherpa Adventure. With it has come success, a large house and a comfortable existence for Phurba and his family in one of the poorest nations on Earth. A huge number of Nepalese live on $15 a month, and poverty is worst in remote mountainous villages.
The Sherpa guides I speak with all tell me Mount Everest saved them, that the trekking business has been lucrative. But the work is seasonal and meant for the young and strong. And now, after the earthquake, the future looks grim.
In popular tourist spots like Lukla and Phakding, I see empty guesthouses. Lodge owners say that after the earth shook, everyone and everything went downhill.
The planes landing at Lukla airport are normally full of people this time of year. But these days, they land only with cargo. Rice, tents, medical supplies. The tourists who are still here are clamoring to go the other way.
Phurba knows the worst may still be on the horizon for his people whose livelihoods are dependent on trekkers. The end result of falling tourism will mean no jobs.
"And the people will suffer even more," he says.
On this day, the suffering is greatest at Dawa Chiri Sherpa's house.
The 27-year-old worked as an assistant for mountaineers attempting to reach the summit. He was at the base camp when a quake-triggered avalanche thundered down the mountain.
Inside the heavily damaged family home, everyone is still mourning. They invite me inside and for a moment I think about what might happen if the second floor came crashing down. I climb the creaky stairs and see a Buddhist monk. He is sitting by a window chanting prayers in front of 13 flickering oil lamps. Dawa's mother cannot stop her tears.
Dawa owned a yak and used to work as a porter, his brother Tenzing tells me. But that was a hard life, walking uphill with hundreds of pounds of gear and not making that much money.
So Dawa completed a mountaineering course and became a climbing Sherpa; some of them earn as much as $7,000 in the two-month Everest season. That's more than 10 times the average Nepalese wage.
Everyone knew it was tiring and extremely dangerous work, especially Dawa's wife, Phura Yangzi. She last spoke with her husband the day before the earthquake.
"Tomorrow is my rest day at base camp," he told her. That was the last time she heard from him.
It took the family two days to retrieve Dawa's body, even though he worked for a trekking company that had the resources to bring him down. Ultimately, it was Phurba's friend, Chungba Sherpa, who made the arrangements.
"My brother died, but no one helped us," Tenzing tells me over a traditional Sherpa meal of boiled potatoes and freshly ground chili sauce. "No one from the government or from his company has contacted us. No one has said sorry. Who will take care of his wife and baby?"
Phura Yangzi carries 18-month old Chiring Dolma on her back as she carries on with her chores. Sometimes, she thinks it's all a bad dream; that her husband is still on Everest. She got married two years ago and at age 22, she is a widow with a child.
She tells me she is worried for her daughter's future. How will she get an education without a father earning money? She says she will try her hand as a street vendor, selling sodas and mineral water to tourists.
"It will be difficult but I will try," she says. "I have to."
In this land of incredible beauty, nature exacted a heavy toll.
The eternal mountain
I ponder the tough lives of the Sherpas on the uphill trek back to Lukla. I only have a backpack -- a porter is carrying my heavier bag, just like they do for tourists. I have been walking all day and the last stretch seems the most strenuous.
On the way, I see a 63-year-old man carrying what he estimates to be 130 pounds of goods on his back. I am in awe of his strength and his ability to carry on without complaint.
In Lukla, I meet back up with Phurba, who has come from seeing his own village and is making arrangements to fix damaged structures and bring in more aid to his people.
"Base camp has become very big news, but you see how thousands of people have been affected," he says. "There are many places that are really poor, are really miserable. It is my job to support those in need."
"Wasn't it hard to see your wife's village, to see your own village lie in ruins?" I ask.
"Some people cry with their eyes," he says, "and others don't. But that doesn't mean I am not sad."
He says he has to worry about his people's livelihoods in the future.
During the recession, when his company felt the sting of fewer Americans spending money on global travel, his friends assured him.
"Don't worry," they said. "You will have no problem as long as you have Everest."
Phurba -- and his people -- are counting on that again.

FAA questioned mental health of Germanwings pilot

Germanwings pilot identified
Washington (CNN)
Years before Andreas Lubitz crashed a commercial airliner into the French Alps, the Federal Aviation Administration raised questions about his mental health, declining to give him a medical certificate.
The agency switched course about three weeks later in 2010 after a physician working with Lubitz said his treatment was complete.
That and other findings are revealed in documents obtained by CNN through a public records request that cover a time frame between April 2008 and July 2010 -- the period in which Lubitz was in Arizona training to be a pilot for Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Lubitz is accused of purposely slamming a Germanwings jetliner into the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. He suffered from bouts of depression and the incident sparked a global debate over how to properly monitor the mental health of pilots.

OPINION: Germanwings co-pilot -- an accident waiting to happen?
According to the documents, Lubitz suffered from "reactive depression," which the medical examiner said was caused by "modified living conditions" and "decompensation subsequent to excessive demands." Reactive depression can resolve itself when the individual recovers from an overwhelming event, according to Jacqueline Brunetti, who works as a medical examiner for commercial pilots.
From January through October 2009, Lubitz received psychotherapeutic treatment, which included two medications for depression -- Cipralexone and Mirtazapine, both anti-depressants.
"The use of 2 drugs would suggest that maybe a single drug was not sufficiently effective," said Burnetti, who did not treat Lubitz, but said pairing anti-depressants could indicate an inability to "cope with either day to day work and/or home demands.'"
It is not entirely clear when his depression began. But a document from April 2008 identifies Lubitz as medically fit to fly . Lufthansa CEO Carsten Sphor told reporters after the crash that Lubitz interrupted his training at some point in 2009. That break lasted several months. Medical documents do not reference that break or reveal why he took it.
But it is clear from the documents that once treatment for his reactive depression was complete in October 2009, Lubitz applied to have his medical certificate and student pilot certificate renewed.
Then, there is something of a mystery.
On a June 14, 2010 questionnaire for a medical and student pilot certificate, Lubitz checked "no" when asked whether he presently or in the past experienced "mental disorders of any sort; depression, anxiety, etc."
There is another copy of the same questionnaire with the same June 14, 2010 date. But on this form, Lubitz checked "yes." That second document indicated that the medical examiner modified the questionnaire to reflect Lubitz suffered from "reactive depression" from November 2008 through July 2009.
Contacted by CNN, the FAA couldn't definitively explain the existence of the two questionnaires.
Germanwings 'black box' shows co-pilot Andreas Lubitz sped up descent
"The questionnaire is done electronically," said Laura Brown, a spokesperson for the FAA. "In some cases an airman may fill out the first page of the questionnaire before visiting with the doctor and once the doctor's visit is complete the form is updated," she said.
She added that even after it's updated, the original form "still lives in the system."
When asked if they were aware of the existence of two conflicting medical documents, Germanwings Senior Vice President of Communications Joachim Shttes said "no" and that they were "unaware" if both of the documents were submitted to the airline.
"I want to point out that the (First Officer) had been medically cleared to fly and hold all the requisite licenses," he said.
Lubitz had not always been cleared to fly, however.
A July 8, 2010 letter from the FAA's  Aerospace Medical Certification Division informed Lubitz that after reviewing his medical examination results the FAA was "unable to establish your eligibility to hold an airman medical certificate" due to his history of "reactive depression."
Dr. Warren Silberman, who prepares FAA medical certifications, signed that letter and requested a detailed medical status report from Lubitz' prescribing physician detailing "when medication(s) were discontinued  and confirmation of no reoccurrence of the symptoms since discontinuing medication(s)."
In the letter, Silberman also requested "a diagnosis, prognosis with medication(s) and  follow-up plan" before consideration of reinstating Lubitz medical certificate and student pilot certificate.
The tortuous trail to 'Why?'
In order to fly again, Lubitz would need his physician to vouch that he had successfully been treated and was no longer suffering from reactive depression.
Lubitz' medical records show the medical specialist treating him wrote two letters saying Lubitz had successfully completed treatment. One was addressed to Lubitz and the other to an airline medical examiner, although the name of that person was redacted.
That letter to the airline official states "considerable remission has been obtained" and "medication has been tapered." It described Lubitz as being "without memory disorders and phobias" and "mentally stable."
After he was cleared by his psychotherapist, the FAA sent a new letter to Lubitz stating he was cleared to fly. That letter was also signed Silberman and it included that precautions must be taken in order for Lubitz to fly.
"You are cautioned to abide by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR's), Section 61.53, relating to physical deficiency. Because of your history of reactive depression, operation of aircraft is prohibited at any time new symptoms or adverse changes occur or any time medication and/or treatment is required," Silberman wrote.
But Silberman says this is nothing more than a self-monitoring system.
"You don't see the airman with the number of cases so you have to rely on how good the letter is," he said.
In other words, FAA certifiers don't see the actual airman. CNN was unable to reach Jrg Siedenburg, the aviation medical examiner listed in the documents as the physician Lubitz visited for clearance to fly.
But the decision to approve or deny a pilot who was once deemed ineligible to fly is based on doctors' letters, Silberman said. And in his opinion, the letter Lubitz' physician provided "was a very complete and legit letter."
Silberman added: I "had no reason to question its accuracy."

Jimmy Savile abused at least 22 pupils at a former girls' school, a Surrey police report says
Since Savile died in 2011, he has been exposed as a serial sex abuser and pedophile
The abuse at Duncroft school occurred during visits by the TV star in the 1970s, police say
London (CNN)
At least 22 pupils and a visitor at a former school for troubled girls in southeast England were sexually abused by the late British TV star Jimmy Savile in the 1970s, a report by Surrey police has concluded.
The report said that at least 46 offenses of abuse occurred, including one rape, at the Duncroft Approved School in Staines, a town to the west of London.
An initial police investigation into Savile's behavior at Duncroft, a school for socially vulnerable girls, began in 2007 and ended with Savile being interviewed under caution in 2009, when he denied the allegations of 14 pupils.
A second investigation, dubbed Operation Outreach, was launched in 2012 after a documentary by UK broadcaster ITV revealed that Savile -- once one of the most beloved people in Britain, a radio DJ and television star with big hair, a big cigar and an even bigger attitude -- was a serial sex abuser.
Since then Savile, who died in 2011 , has become one of the most reviled figures in the country as it becomes clear that he sexually abused untold numbers of people over decades.
The latest revelations about his abuses at Duncroft school come on the heels of other reports detailing assaults by Savile on children, hospital patients or those with mental health problems .
Operation Outreach found that Savile visited Duncroft at least 16 times between 1974 and 1979, and that he stayed overnight at the school on at least two occasions.
He was likely to have taken the pupils out unaccompanied by staff on several occasions and was given "significant" access to the school's grounds and buildings, which appears to have been unrestricted and largely unsupervised, the report said.
Pupils were abused in multiple locations throughout the school, including the principal's office, and in vehicles brought to the school by Savile, police found.
Of the 23 victims, "ten were abused on a single occasion by Savile," the report says, and "thirteen were abused on at least two occasions."
The four types of abuse listed in the report are rape, assault by penetration, causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and sexual assault.
The school was closed from late 1979 until 1982, and shut its doors for good in 1991.
As well as seeking to establish the scope of Savile's offenses at the school, Operation Outreach also looked at what was known by former members of staff there -- and whether any had committed offenses as a result.
Surrey police submitted a file last year to the Crown Prosecution Service on two of those former staff members, but the agency decided not to bring criminal charges on the grounds there was no realistic prospect of conviction.
In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Cundy said Surrey police "has always accepted there are things which should have been done differently" in the force's original 2007-2009 investigation.
But he added those inquiries "predated much of what we now know about Savile and his pattern of abuse."

The conservationist grew up in Uganda after his parents fled Rwanda as refugees.
His father traveled to other countries in search of work, leaving his mother to raise him and his four siblings. In 1995, his family reunited in Rwanda where a trip to the Volcanoes National Park would change everything.

Nineteen of the 43 eggs are completely intact, a museum official says
Hong Kong (CNN)
The Chinese city that boasts the largest number of dinosaur eggs in the world has added a new batch to its impressive collection.
Construction workers unearthed 43 fossilized dinosaur eggs during road repair work in Heyuan city in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong on Sunday, officials said.
The city, which calls itself the "Home of Dinosaurs," won a Guinness World Record for the world's largest collection of dinosaur eggs at its museum in 2004.
A crowd gathered around the site along a main road where the fossils were discovered in Heyuan city.
EXPAND IMAGE
Huang Zhiqing, deputy director of the Heyuan Museum, told CNN that it was the first time the fossils have been discovered in the bustling city center.
Major road repair work was halted as a team of researchers and construction workers jumped down into a ditch to dig out the fossils.
Eggs as wide as 5 inches
Nineteen of the eggs are completely intact, with the largest measuring as much as 13 centimeters (5 inches) in diameter, Huang said.
Researchers said they will continue to examine the fossils to determine which dinosaur species they belong to.
Most of the eggs in the museum's existing collection belong to oviraptorid and duck-billed dinosaurs, which roamed the earth 89 million years ago.
Nearly 17,000 dinosaur eggs have been uncovered in the city since the first group of fossils was found in 1996 by children playing at a construction site, the China's official news agency Xinhua reported.

        <MainBody>WHAT did they do this Shih Tzu?!
Sudan's female companions,  Fatu and Najin, live at the conservancy, where experts are scrambling to ensure the subspecies does not go extinct.
The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs.
In addition to round-the-clock security, the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching.
The conservancy is also raising funds to help equip and train rangers who guard the rhinos.
On the verge of extinction
At 42, Sudan is elderly in rhino years. Fatu, 15, is a spring chicken, while Najin is 25.
Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy.
"Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female," he says.
Najin could conceive, but her hind legs are so weak, she may be unable to support a mounted male .
"There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years, but not conceptions," Paul says. "Based on  a recent health examination conducted, both animals have a regular estrus cycle, but no conception has been recorded."
And if one is not recorded soon, the beloved animal will go extinct.
Alternative methods to conceive
In a race against time, international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies.
The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. Though the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts say.
A committee at the conservancy is also looking at various alternative reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization.
"In other countries, success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species, thus that, as a technique, can be presupposed to be the most promising," Paul says. "However, consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward."
Countdown to extinction
The need to preserve the northern white rhino is dire.
"Realistically, we are looking at these animals dying in the next decade or so. But hopefully, using artificial methods of reproduction, we might be able to bring them back in the future," Paul says. "This might mean that it will happen when the current animals are already deceased, but it could happen."
The conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos --  two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year.
In another incident, another male, Angalifu, died at the San Diego Zoo last year, bringing the subspecies closer to extinction.
There are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild.
A total of five remain in captivity worldwide: three in Kenya,  and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic.
But Sudan, a male, is in a company of one.

The professor's statistics confirm what they have seen in the glaciers above their town and in the ice beneath their boots.
"When I came here as a boy, the (Bossons) was several hundred meters below," says Seb, was we dig our axes into the ice. "At the moment we can still enjoy it but in 40, 50 years what are going to say to our next generation? 'Oh, it was great! You should've been here.'"
Since the time when America was a newborn nation and the first men climbed Mont Blanc in woolens and top hats, the Bossons glacier we're climbing has retreated nearly a mile.
"Maybe one day there will be no glaciers and mountain guides will have to be biking guides," says Fleur, a Chamonix native and one of the most accomplished female alpinists in the world. "We are revolted."
Of course, providing thrills and business in the "death-sport capital of the world" is far from the most important role for glaciers like the Bossons.
The Wonder List with Bill Weir
This frozen playground is also the water tower of Europe, and glacier run-off provides drinking water for hundreds of millions around the world. Which is why the rate of "la grande fonte" is so alarming.
But not to guys like Yan Giezendanner.
"Everyone says 'global warming, global warming.'" he says. "But for me, I'm not so sure."
For over 30 years, Yan has been forecasting for France's national weather service in Chamonix and is convinced other glaciers around the world are growing, despite the science of those like Ohmura. He believes the fear is manufactured by politicians and the wind industry.
"That's their job to say these things," he shrugs.
I found plenty of similar conspiracy theories at the Heartland conference in Vegas, and had a few exchanges that frankly, you have to see to believe. But when I ask Ohmura about the allegations of hackery or corruption, he just sighs.
"Skeptics close their eyes while telling people to close their eyes from the reality. One must use simple thinking. Think. Open your eyes and think. It may sound a bit insulting, but there is no other suggestion I can use."
There will be plenty of frozen food for thought -- and plenty of gorgeous, high alpine adventure -- as " The Wonder List " hits the Alps. Come hang.

Protecting Chad's Elephants from poachers 02:05
"Formation! Prepare yourselves! Fire!" shouts Patrick Duboscq, a retired French police officer instructing the Zakouma rangers.
A handful of men throw themselves flat to the ground, aim, and fire their Glock pistols, hitting distant targets.  They jump up, run, and fire again from standing positions, repeating the drill with Kalashnikovs.
Duboscq, who is a volunteer, runs the Mamba team through its paces.  His passion for elephants, conservation and the park brings him back every year to keep Zakouma's troops sharp -- and the animals safe.
Duboscq leads the men through a rallying cry for Zakouma; the rest of the exercise is all business. They're capable of taking on armed poachers, handling sniper rifles, and engaging in a firefight.  They're trained in making arrests, judicial procedures and presenting evidence in court.
A deadly game
It's a sharp learning curve, but it's necessary to fight off the lethal threat poachers present.  Often organized criminal gangs, international trafficking mafias and terror groups are behind the poaching raids, providing skills and sophisticated arms to carry out the killing.
"Of course it's dangerous," says Mamba team member Ahmat Assilek.  "But we do it because it's our national patrimony ... that's why we're ready to die."
And these men have skin in the game.  Among the group training today, four lost fathers to poachers when a six-man Zakouma anti-poaching unit was gunned down outside the park in September 2012 during morning prayers.
The raid was a suspected retaliation killing for the capture of a group of poachers who had slaughtered six elephants the previous month north of the park. According to park staff, the raid on the poacher camp netted satellite phones, solar chargers, stamped Sudanese army leave slips and insignia, and 1,500 rounds of ammunition.
The poachers weren't minor league opportunists. They were well equipped to slaughter elephants for their ivory -- and to kill anyone trying to stop them.
23 Zakouma guards have died on the job since 1998.
New management
Park manager Rian Labuschagne understands the dangers confronting Zakouma and its staff. Along with his wife, Lorna Labuschagne, the conservationists were tasked with safeguarding the surviving elephant herds in 2010, when African Parks, a South Africa-based non-profit organization, took over the management of the embattled park following a decade-long elephant killing spree.
Before the Labuschagnes and African Parks took over the 3,000-plus-square-kilometer area, the territory suffered huge losses.
In 2002, an estimated 4,300 elephants lived in Zakouma. A decade later that figure had plummeted by 90 percent, most of them slaughtered by poachers for their ivory. The elephants were in danger of being wiped out.
About 450 elephants make Zakouma their home today -- roughly half the entire elephant population of Chad, says the park's field operations manager Darren Potgieter.  It's a far cry from the 50,000 elephants that roamed the country's savannahs and scrublands 50 years ago.
The statistics for the region are equally dire. As recently as 1970, Potgieter says, 300,000 elephants roamed a Texas-sized area that included southern Chad, eastern Central African Republic, southwestern Sudan, and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Today, only small pockets of elephant populations remain, and they remain under threat.
This is not one of the world's thriving neighborhoods; each of these countries has experienced protracted wars, and all have impoverished populations.
Poaching, shrinking habitats, human-animal conflict, war and a seemingly insatiable appetite for ivory in Asia -- particularly in China -- have all contributed to the disappearing populations of elephants and many other species.  Zakouma is no exception.
Turning the tide
So the Labuschagnes, with their African Parks staff and volunteers, set out to reverse the grim Zakouma statistics, which eclipsed even the worst trends of vanishing elephant populations across much of the African continent.
For years, the constant fear of being hunted and killed had made the elephants too stressed out to reproduce. But by the end of 2011, Zakouma started to see a dramatic turnaround. Since then, no elephants have been poached in the park, and no ivory has been taken from the park in five years.
More than 40 calves have been welcomed into the herd since the end of 2013. The births are an important step towards the park's goal of increasing the herd's size to more than one thousand within the next decade.
The gains of the past few years were hard-earned. And the benefits have been reaped not only by the animals but by people living nearby as well.
Communities around Zakouma have been given a stake in the battle against poachers.  It has not only meant well-paid jobs as guards, rangers and support staff, but the patrols in and on the periphery of the park also mean better security for the surrounding villages and nomads.
24-hour tracking
There's even a toll free number to call with any concerns regarding the security of the elephants or the people, and many villages have radios to connect them to the park's nerve center -- a 24-hour military-style operations room with radios, computers, and near real-time tracking of elephant herds.
As Potgieter gives a tour of the command center, the radio crackles with constant communication from guard teams on the ground.  Computers and maps display elephant groups' locations.  "We have 11 collars on as many family groups as possible," says Potgieter, pointing to black marks on a map showing the positions of the elephants. The satellite collars enable monitoring and protection, and there's always a guard unit within a few kilometers of the herds.
Another 4 elephants were outfitted with satellite collars in late February.  In one collaring operation, Potgieter circled overhead in a Cessna light aircraft, guiding Labuschagne's team through kilometers of scrub and high grasses to an acacia forest.  It was midday, the elephants a bit more dozy in the searing heat.  They may feel somewhat safer in this seemingly inhospitable forest of thorn trees. But it's tough tracking them through the scratchy terrain.
Legendary wildlife veterinarian and consultant to the park Dr. Pete Morkel flew to Chad from southern Africa on his annual mission to help with the collaring. After preparing the necessary drugs and tranquilizer gun, Morkel and Rian Labuschagne set out on foot to get close to the 90-strong herd.  The two worked without words, silent gestures sufficing for the pair who have done this together before.
A few large female elephants were visible through a gap in the thick acacias as they fanned their ears to cool themselves.  Morkel watched and waited for a suitable individual to tranquilize, wanting to avoid a mother with a calf. After few minutes' wait, he took aim and darted one with the tranquilizer gun.
A single trumpet from the forest signalled alarm, and the herd quickly dispersed into the tangle of thorns. Morkel and Labuschagne approached a teenage female, now lying on her side.  The pair, followed by the rest of their team, set to work quickly, fitting the collar while pouring water over the sedated elephant to keep her cool. Lorna Labuschagne held the tip of the trunk to enable the elephant to breathe unencumbered.
As the team adjusted the collar, Morkel treated an old festering wound in the elephant's right front foot. He guessed it was likely from a spray of gunfire in the days when poaching in the park was out of control. This female's darting may have been lucky for her.
Rian Labuschagne says the collaring isn't just necessary to track and protect the elephants -- it is the main goal of the operation.
Will Zakouma's success be contagious?
Kenyan officers burn 15 tons of ivory on March 3.
The success in and around Zakouma has been noted by Chadian President and conservation advocate Idriss Deby, who has asked African Parks to come up with an elephant protection scheme for the entire country.
Chad, under its National Elephant Protection Plan, burned the country's ivory stockpiles in February 2014. A number of African countries have likewise burned their ivory stockpiles in order to stop poaching and illegal trafficking of the highly profitable commodity.  Kenya set alight a 15-ton pyre of tusks in early March of this year, and Ethiopia followed suit two weeks later.
But reviving the elephant population isn't the only goal Zakouma and African Parks have in mind.
Their stewardship of the wilderness area is evident in the richness of the ecosystem here. Buffalo herds have rebounded, the lion population is rising, and about half of the continent's Kordofan giraffes live here -- not to mention an abundant variety of antelope and bird species.
Conspicuous by its absence from this list is the black rhino, last spotted in Zakouma in 1972, according to the Rhino Resource Center. In April, African Parks hopes to reintroduce the species into the park.  Asked whether this would bring unwanted attention from poachers -- rhino horn commands an even higher price than elephant tusks on the illegal market -- Potgieter replies: "Someone has to take the bold step and reintroduce rhino. There are lots of responsibilities and lots of risks in park management."
'These animals are our legacy'
No doubt additional patrols will need to match new protection needs.
So far, African Parks and Zakouma have met those security demands and challenges, but the battle to protect some of the world's most iconic species is far from over.
Armed guards on horseback are a constant reminder of the battle to protect the park. The guards have been bolstered by new equipment, including sniper rifles. But the financial stakes in this fight are high, and well-armed poaching gangs are always upping the ante.
The pressure on the animals won't let up, and this war will continue. The Zakouma guards know this, and are prepared to fight, even if it means death.
The reason is simple, Mamba team ranger Ahmat Assilek says:  "The animals you see are the legacy for future generations."

Footnote: This remote wilderness, far from the usual spots on the safari circuit, doesn't get a stream of camera-toting visitors.  CNN's Ingrid Formanek joined some of Africa's top safari guides, some of them old friends, on a tour hosted by the non-profit African Parks at their newly established Camp Nomade.
This is unexplored territory, and has a draw not only for its wildlife but for its remarkable conservation efforts.  African Parks has taken on management of areas few others will touch - marginal and often war-torn sectors in countries such as the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The photos were contributed by a few of Ingrid's fellow traveller guides. On the trip, they discovered a bird species previously unknown in Chad.

Spring is in the air and underwater -- especially off the coast of British Columbia.
Four orca babies have been born in the last three months, a higher number than usual, according to the Center for Whale Research.
Orcas in the area are called the Southern Residents and this baby boom brings their total to 81 whales.
"We hope this is a sustained upswing in the population, but they are endangered and will remain endangered until we can get their population up over 100," said Ken Balcomb with the Center for Whale Research.
The first calf of the season was spotted in December, followed by two in February and this last one in March.
Balcomb said CWR has been studying the Southern Residents for nearly 40 years. "Early on we used to have seven, eight orca babies, but recently we've had substantially less."
Michael Harris, executive director of the Pacific Whale Watch Association, said efforts to improve the numbers of orcas include beefing up salmon in the area. "We're going to keep a careful watch on these babies and our fingers crossed -- and of course continue to do everything we can to rebuild these salmon runs and feed these whales."

In 1923, Cecil B. DeMille became a believer in the power the Bible held with moviegoing audiences. After finding success with his Old Testament epic "The Ten Commandments," DeMille enlisted H.B. Warner to help him tell "The Greatest Story Ever Told." The result was 1927's "The King of Kings," a film for which Warner was virtuous both on and off the set. According to Turner Classic Movies , he signed an agreement not to be involved in any sort of scandal -- even divorce -- for a year following the movie's release.

Story highlights
If you turned on the television this past Sunday, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal.
According to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong.
(CNN)
It's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like.
Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image.
A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean.
If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer.
Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from "Killing Jesus," a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. "A.D.," NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries "The Bible," and "Finding Jesus," CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare.
Does God have a prayer in Hollywood?
What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business , is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood.
Haaz Sleiman, from "Killing Jesus," was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians , who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure.
Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in "Finding Jesus."
And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in "A.D.," replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed "hot Jesus, " by some, "smarmy Jesus" by others.
You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past.
But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say.
"Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed," said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of "Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."
"A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India," Humphries-Books continued. "That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways."
The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings , which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf.
But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't wear long hair, said the New Testament scribe .

        <title>How Stone-Age blades are still cutting it in modern surgery</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/HEIfTb7oI9I/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels
Some surgeons still use the blades in procedures today
Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world.
(CNN)
Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out?
In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines.
It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds.
But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian.
Cutting edge
Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels.
At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge.
When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce.
Read: The worms that invade your brain
Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring.
Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades.
"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring," he said.
"It makes for the best cosmetic outcome."
He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut.
Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian.
Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel.
The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference.
Cut with a chainsaw
"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh'," Dr. Green said. "Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw."
Read: Contact lens with built-in telescope
Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal.
Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw
Dr Lee Green
"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'" he said. "If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically.
"It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery.
"You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!"
And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel.
"What's really fun is seeing it heal," he said. "Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring."
Specialist use
In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal.
"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer," the company says.
At 99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at 712.50 ($772.60).
But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use.
Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone.
"If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it," he said. "It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off."

"My goal was to show diverse personalities in a broad age range, to show that although they share the syndrome, they are all unique."

Sigga Ella's portraits show people with Down syndrome from 9 months to 60 years old
She hopes her photos shine a light on "the beauty and diversity of mankind"
(CNN)
Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world.
Ella's series, "First and foremost I am," consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21 , the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavk Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography.
Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport.
The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on "the beauty and diversity of mankind" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable.
"I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world."
The title of the series, "First and foremost I am," comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project.
"I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora," Jonsdottir writes. "I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies."
Jonsdottir goes on to say, "Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?"
Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects "to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together." The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot.
"My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness."

Researchers: World's largest asteroid impact zone found in Australia
By Jethro Mullen , CNN
Updated 0151 GMT (0951 HKT) March 25, 2015
Imaging taken from rock along the border of South Australia and the Northern Territory shows evidence of a massive impact.

Two pieces of asteroid crashed into Australia many millions of years ago
Researchers stumble across traces of the impact zone deep in the earth's crust
(CNN)
The massive meteorite split in two shortly before smashing into Earth, wiping out large numbers of species.
The devastating event took place on our planet many millions of years ago, but researchers are only now beginning to discover what happened.
In a remote part of Central Australia, the two pieces of asteroid left what geophysicists say is the largest impact zone ever found on Earth, spreading over an area 400 kilometers (250 miles) wide.
"The two asteroids must each have been over 10 kilometers across -- it would have been curtains for many life species on the planet at the time," said lead researcher Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University .
The team published its research in the journal Tectonophysics this month.
The crater caused by the asteroids vanished long ago. But Glikson said the researchers stumbled across scars from the impacts during drilling for geothermal research.
Traces are buried more than 2 kilometers inside the Earth's crust, under an area near the borders of South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.
"There are two huge deep domes in the crust, formed by the Earth's crust rebounding after the huge impacts, and bringing up rock from the mantle below," Glikson said.
Mystery over timing
The researchers are still trying to figure out just how long ago the shattering event happened.
The surrounding rocks are 300 million to 600 million years old, according to the team, but they haven't been able to find the sort of evidence left by other meteorite strikes.
A big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks.
But the researchers say they haven't come across a similar layer in sediments from about 300 million years ago.
"It's a mystery -- we can't find an extinction event that matches these collisions. I have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300 million years," Glikson said.
The discovery of the huge asteroid impacts could lead to new insights about the Earth's history.
"Large impacts like these may have had a far more significant role in the Earth's evolution than previously thought," Glikson said.

Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) has taken delivery of the Izumo, the largest Japanese military vessel to see service since World War II.
The warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the Yokusuka naval base near Yokohama, also home to the U.S Navy's Seventh Fleet.
The Izumo has a crew of 470, and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones (24,000 tonnes at full load, according to military publication Jane's ), it is as large as the storied Yamato-class battleships which fought U.S. naval forces in the Pacific theater of World War II.

        <title>A really big fish story</title>

        <MainBody>Is this 280 pound catfish real? Fisherman provides proof 02:04
Story highlights
Dino Ferrari snaps photos of a 280-pound catfish he says he caught in Italy
It took him 40 minutes to reel in the fish, according to his sponsor
(CNN)
Catfish come in all varieties, shapes and sizes, some big and some small.
And one downright gigantic, apparently now swimming in a river in Italy.
That's the fish story being told by Dino Ferrari, who reeled in a 280-pound (127-kilogram), 8.75-foot-long catfish last Thursday along the Po River, said Davide Valla, who is with Ferrari's sponsor company Sportex. (The sponsored fisherman wouldn't say exactly where he caught the big fellow, choosing to keep his favorite spots secret.)
Assuming the world isn't being hooked, this would not be the first time someone has caught a whopper of a catfish and lived to tell the tale.
In fact, it wouldn't be the biggest catfish ever caught. That would be a nearly 342-pound lau-lau (or piraiba) type of catfish snared in 2009 in Brazil's Amazon region, according to the International Game Fish Association.
Heck, it's not even the biggest catfish ever snared in Italy. That honor goes to a 298-pound wels catfish -- which is reportedly the same variety caught by Ferrari -- also from the Po River. And Ferrari didn't necessarily bring his fish in alone, with stories linked from Sportex's Facebook page indicating that twin brother Dario was by his side.
One thing that makes the latest Po River catch unique is that it was done with a spinning reel, said Valla, who called it a record for such fishing tackle. It took Ferrari 40 minutes to bring in the fish, then bring it to shore, his sponsor said.
Once it was on land, the Ferraris snapped some photos and weighed their catch. But they didn't dig in, savoring it with fresh bread, cheese and a glass of pinot grigio.
That's because this fish story has a happy ending for the star of the show: the catfish. According to Valla, Ferrari released his big catch back into the river.

Some take to social media to speculate about what the new look means
(CNN)
Who doesn't like a new look? New Year, new you, amiright?
An updated 'do can "hair-ald" a new phase in your life, signifying a fresh start.
And maybe that's what the reclusive leader of North Korea was going for when he modified his almost boyish over-the-top-flop to a higher, angular, more severe cut. The look first debuted at his New Year's address in January.

From refugees to photojournalists  Adil Mustafa Hamdan, 21, is a student at the Soba Secondary Refugee School. He was one of 21 students selected to take a digital storytelling course through the UN Refugee Agency project. Like many of the students that graduated from the course, he aspires to be a photojournalist.
"I would go to the Nuba Mountains and photograph people with no clothes, no shoes; I'd photograph soldiers while they are fighting; I'd photograph airplanes that drop bombs. I would show through my photos and explain through my stories the situation in the Nuba Mountains," he says.

"What do you want to hunt?"
"I want to hunt gazelles, monkeys, hawks and other animals that you find in the bush.
"What is the hardest thing about hunting?"
"When you get caught by the police."

"I left the Nuba Mountains because of the war in '83. At that time, we left in a group of 57 people. Only nine of us survived the journey. I was the youngest, only seven years old.
One day, my father was very sick and he began to tell me the names of all of my uncles. When he finished he died. I stayed for seven more years until the people signed a peace agreement, which was in 2005.
I said to myself, let me see what will happen. After six years I prepared to go back to my homeland, but when I was about to start my journey the war broke out. I thought, 'I'll never see my family. I will die as my father died.'
Then people began to arrive from the Nuba Mountains to the camp. The first person I spoke to turned out to be my uncle. It was the best moment of my life. This is why I am happy. Because I have found my relatives."

From refugees to photojournalists  Aziz Hassan Eidiie was born in 1990 in the Nuba village of Kauda. When war broke out in his home in 2011, he had to stop his schooling. He was able to resume it at the Soba Secondary School. Many of his photographs focus on the lives of the young men inside the camp.
"I am happy to have become a photographer, because this was one of my dreams," he says.
"I hope that God may help me learn more and more about journalism so I can put it into practice."

From refugees to photojournalists  Awatif Kawaja Matile is 20 years old. Education has always been very important to her. At ten, she walked long distances to attend her primary school. Later, she attended a private school, where she lived without her parents."I struggled because I didn't have their financial support to help me buy clothes, shoes and other materials," she admits.
When the war broke out in 2011, she made her way to the Ajuong Thok  Refugee Camp so that she could continue her studies. "Being in school is an opportunity to learn, and to change your life from bad to better," she says, though she admits she doesn't view education as a cure-all. "It doesn't mean that you will have a comfortable life; you may face challenges and problems, but education makes you a better person in the future. You must think and reason wisely," she says.As a participant in the project, she focused a lot on the everyday struggles of families in the camp.

From refugees to photojournalists  Roda Tia Hamdan was pulled out of school as a young girl, because she needed to take care of her cousin."Even though I wanted to continue my education, my uncle wouldn't let me, because I was a babysitter," she recalls. At 11 years old, she started cutting grass to earn money for school fees, but soon afterward her education was stalled again due to the conflict in the Nuba Mountains. "I dared to continue my studies as a refugee," she says. Like many in Ajuong Thok refugee camp, she arrived solo, without her parents.
"I went to live with my friend so that I wouldn't have to live alone," she says.

They call themselves the "eyes and ears of Nuba", a reference to the mountains from which they fled.
Young, mainly in their 20s, sometimes younger, these student refugees share a similar narrative. Their villages, tucked away in the remote regions of South Kordofan in the Sudan, became uninhabitable : They were rained down on with rockets; they could no longer grow food, keep cattle, go to school.
They joined 15,000 other refugees in Ajuong Thok camp in South Sudan (Yida camp, closer to the Sudanese border, houses an additional 70,000). Now, they want their stories to be heard. They are citizen journalists in the making.
Last November, Kathryn Mahoney, a communication officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and a self-described "repository of stories" launched an initiative that trained 21 students from the community in digital storytelling through smartphones.
"I travel around and meet these amazing refugees who have been through some of the most horrifying situations, and my responsibility is to help them get their story out, to amplify their voice," she says.
"But as humanitarians, we forget that these are their stories to tell."
At first, she recalls, the students didn't know how to turn the phones on.
"Growing up in the west, we take for granted our visual literacy. We're literally bombarded with images from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep. These students don't come from that culture, so even with issues like framing and point-of-view, we were really starting from scratch," she recalls.
By the end of the course, Mahoney says, "they knew how to use the phones better than I did."
The phones have since gone to the local school, which has adopted a kind of lending library for other students who want to learn photojournalism skills and sign the equipment out.
The students paired the photos they took with a narrative. Some opted for straight quotes from their subjects, a la Humans of New York . Others wrote essays.

        <MainBody>In the past few weeks, Houthi rebels have taken control of Yemen's capital
The move pushes country closer to failed state status, giving al Qaeda greater foothold
Nic Robertson joins Saudi border police trying to staunch the human tide
Nic Robertson will take your questions about his reporting from Saudi Arabia today at 4 p.m. ET/9 p.m. GMT on Reddit .
Jizan, Saudi Arabia (CNN)
Driving out of the sleepy Saudi seaside town of Jizan at dawn, I had no idea what to expect.
I'd been asking the Saudi Interior Ministry to take me there for several years. Now I was in the desert kingdom covering King Salman bin Abdulaziz's ascent to the throne, and that permission had finally come through.
In the past few weeks, Houthi rebels have taken control of Yemen's capital, pushing the country ever closer to "failed state" status and giving the al Qaeda franchise there -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP -- a greater foothold.
The Saudi minister of interior, now second-in-line to the throne, has a personal stake in seeing AQAP eradicated. The terror group's top bomb-maker put a sophisticated bomb in his own brother's rectum, exploding it when the brother met the leading royal a few years ago. The brother died, the minister was only lightly injured.

This is the same bomb-maker who made the underpants bomb that came close to bringing down an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Despite extensive drone campaigns targeting him, he is believed to still be alive and remains a significant global threat.
There is no doubt in anyone's mind here that al Qaeda in Yemen will use any chance it gets to export terror over the border to their northern neighbor, with the royal family being the targets of choice.
Col. Omar al Kahtani, our escort for the day, was in a voluble mood as we sped toward the looming mountains that mark the border. "Anything could happen," he told us. "Be ready with your camera." Gun battles are rare on this border, he said, but only three weeks earlier, on Saudi's northern frontier,  ISIS fighters broke through the defenses, killing three Saudi soldiers, including their commander.
The gun battle, footage of which was posted on the Internet, was a salutary reminder that the desert kingdom, the West's biggest regional partner in fighting the terror groups, is surrounded by battle-hardened enemies.
This corner of the country is remarkably green. Relatively lush vegetation -- in Saudi terms, at least --  sprouts in profusion from the semi-arid fields.
As our four-wheel-drive truck swung through the rickety metal gate, marking the edge of the border exclusion zone, we got our first taste of what has mostly been a hidden war down here.
A sprawling Saudi village of large ornate villas came into view. Pretty, until we got close, when we realized the buildings were all shot up. Rockets had torn gaping holes in the walls and gardens were overgrown with spindly tentacles of creepers that slowly consumed the once-vibrant homes.
Our host explained this was a village overrun by Houthi rebels from Yemen six years ago. In a three-week battle, Saudi Apache gunships had nearly destroyed the hamlet in the battle to save it. The government moved the residents away, creating a buffer between them and their fractious neighbor.
As we drive on, he tells us Yemen's security is worsening and Saudi Arabia is spending almost $3 billion on beefing up border security. Our trucks are bumping and slipping their way up the newly cut rough rock tracks. At moments, it feels as if we are almost climbing vertically.
These mountains are as rugged and rough as they are beautiful. Villages cling precariously to their higher reaches. No fence reaches up this far, the tiny smattering of guards solidifies the impression that at these altitudes, border control works on an honor system.
No line on a map will stop these mountain men from rounding up their stray goats. Even from the roadside I can see tiny footpaths crisscrossing the steep terrain from Yemen to Saudi and back.
Massive drugs haul
In the foothills, control is much more effective. Watch towers are equipped with thermal imaging equipment, super zoom cameras watching over mile upon mile, and layer upon layer of razor wire. It needs to be like this.
What we saw was staggering. I had no idea so many people and such a massive amount of drugs are moving over the border every day.
At our first stop, we saw two men captured that day. We saw another one caught soon after. Then a whole vanload, about a dozen people crowded inside a mesh cage welded to a pickup truck. One of them was just 11 years old.
They all told us they had come to Saudi for work. The 11-year-old was earning about $100 a month on a supermarket till in Jizan. All told the same story: about poverty and increasing chaos in Yemen and the Houthis getting stronger. The risk of jail in Saudi, they said, was better than the certainty of poverty in Yemen.
Our government escort told us they'd all be sent to the nearest large police station where they would be fingerprinted and officials would check their records to make sure none had ties to terrorism.
The men -- and they were all men -- admitted that sneaking over the border is getting much harder amid the increase in guard posts and border fences.
Border guards told us in the past three months alone, they have picked up 42,000 people along the 800-kilometer (about 500 miles) border.
Of course we are unable to verify that figure, but if the volume of illegal migrants we saw in the morning was shocking, then the afternoon was mind-blowing.
We were taken to a room where three children were standing with bundles of qat, the narcotic shrub that most Yemenis chew every day, at their feet.
The youngest, a 10-year-old, told me drug barons pay him $50 for hauling 10-kilos (about 22 lbs) of the green leaves over the border. It's the second time he has been caught.
I was told that the boy, who had been given a banana and a bottle of water by the guards, would be taken back to the border and told to return home. All three looked small for their age. No one, particularly them, doubted they would be back.
Continual stream of infiltrators
Unemployment among younger people is running at 40% in Yemen, likely higher in their villages. Putting food on the table at the end of the day is as far ahead as they think.
Between them, they had been caught with about 30 kilos of the narcotic. Piled up outside the guard post were several tons more -- the haul of the past week, or so we were told. I'd seen similar piles outside many of the other posts we'd already visited.
According to statistics given to us at the Jizan headquarters of the border guards, qat is a multi-million-dollar business. In the last three months, they say, they have seized more than 500,000 tons along the border, with a street value close to $100 million.
They also showed us 50 kg of cannabis resin they had confiscated that day. Over the past three months, more than 6,000 kg of hashish -- with a street value in Saudi of about $36 million -- had been seized, we were told.
Guns and ammunition are also smuggled in: 2,562 weapons have been seized in the past three months, as well as 380,088 rounds of ammunition, the border guards said. And the list goes on.
And so did our day and the near-continual stream of infiltrators. The problem for the Saudis is that they cannot ignore this deluge. Any one of the thousands they stop could be a terrorist.
Said Kouachi, one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers in Paris, is believed to have slipped in to Yemen not far from Saudi's border, making his way there for terror training from Oman. The attack he and his brother carried out also shows the lengths that AQAP is willing to go to in order to export terror.
Hajj pilgrimages to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, draw millions of Muslims to the kingdom. Knowing who comes and who goes is vital.
As the sun began to set, we jumped in police gun trucks as another group of men were spotted near the razor wire border fence. Tearing over the bumpy ground, we raced to intercept them. Surprisingly, they didn't run. They know they'll be freed soon, and from what we saw none of the six were beaten or abused.
Within minutes, as we were driving away, the sun sinking over the horizon and our day done, we thought we passed another eight men being caught. We stopped as police emptied the men's pockets. Cheap cellphones, not much else. They were illegal workers on their way back to homes in Yemen after weeks of work in Saudi, their wages already sent over the border by local money exchangers.
It was already darkening as we pulled away, once again trying to set off back to Jizan. And yet again,  we stopped as we saw a group of guards searching two small figures. More child qat smugglers, rope and sack bags on their backs bulging with the big wraps that protect the delicate green leaves. Each boy carrying bundles with the drug baron's name on them.
Later, when we finally did get back to Jizan, we ate dinner sitting on rugs next to the Red Sea: fish, meat, salads, bread and Saudi "champagne," non-alcoholic fizzy grape juice.
This is a land of plenty, Yemen is not. Stanching the human tide flowing over the border is only going to get more difficult, and finding the terrorist hiding in so much human misery even harder.

Illegal loggers are moving into their territory and threatening their way of life
(CNN)
Portuguese photographer Daniel Rodrigues had always dreamed of visiting the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, and he finally got his chance last year.
After two years of fundraising and wrestling with government bureaucracy, Rodrigues arrived at a place some might call a version of Eden: the Alto Turiacu reserve where the Awa-Guaja roam.
"I wanted to show the daily life in the world's most endangered tribe," he said.
The Awa-Guaja's way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally encroaching on their land, according to Brazil's National Indian Foundation. Many Awa Indians have had little to no contact with the outside world, but that is beginning to change, the foundation reports, as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on.
Daniel Rodrigues
Rodrigues set out to document the tribe's existence -- pure, pristine and, tragically, fleeting.
"I had traveled to Africa and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was," Rodrigues said. "Here I was, in the 21st century, with other humans who (until recently) had never seen a camera, a computer ... never seen a shower and were shocked when they saw a helicopter. And yet they are extremely happy."
Calling themselves Awa, Tupi-Guarani for "man," the tribe is made of forest foragers and dexterous hunters. Challenges abound, said Rodrigues, who was forced to communicate with hand gestures for several weeks because the tribespeople did not speak Portuguese.
"I pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting," Rodrigues recalled. "They were incredibly friendly, and I was very well-received."
Spending weeks without uttering words, Rodrigues immersed himself in the visual resplendence of the Awa-Guaja life in the forest. Twelve-hour hunting expeditions were common, cutting through thick jungle growth during the monsoon rains. Nature's orchestral sounds rang behind every moment, something his photographs seem to allude to.

Detouring from the use of formal portraiture often seen in ethnophotography, Rodrigues' black-and-white photos are filled with an honesty that could only come as a result of an amicable pact with his subjects. The Awa clearly trusted Rodrigues' camera, and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well-versed he became with the ins and outs of the Awa way of life. The cinematic quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the photographer's endurance and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of sportsmanship.
"We walked and walked for hours, slashing through the forest overgrowth to look for the prey," Rodrigues said. "The Awa were barefoot the whole time."
Rodrigues nonchalantly talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red puma.
"The hunter had missed a shot, and the puma jumped right over towards me," he said. "In the meantime, I was having an allergic reaction to a spider bite. It wasn't easy."
There are several groups of the Awa-Guaja in this part of the forest. Some have been known to exist since the 1970s. Others have been contacted in the early 1980s. Many are believed to still be in hiding.
Earlier this month, Brazil's official news agency reported that three isolated Awa Indians had made contact with the other mainstream Awa-Guaja. The group's leader, Amakaria, reportedly said that loggers were marking trees and threatening to kill them.
The Brazilian government has launched a massive military operation into the states of Para and Maranhao, today the epicenter in the war between loggers and Indians. Latest satellite imagery shows that new logging tracks are constantly being carved.
Monitoring and preserving such a large expanse of tropical forest is a challenge. In the meantime, how can the so-called civilized world understand what is being lost?
Rodrigues tries to explain:
"Getting out of my comfort zone, my comfortable bed, to walk for hours through virgin forest, crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck ... hearing the triumphal songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their brethren -- this experience can completely change a human being."

A new sex park for Taiwan?
By Maggie Hiufu Wong , CNN
Updated 0719 GMT (1519 HKT) January 27, 2015
Not everyone loves the idea of a new sex theme park in southwestern Taiwan, though this installation, set up in Beimen for wedding photos, suggests a local appetite for romance.
Story highlights
Proposal to build the first sex park in Taiwan posted online
The sex theme park will explore topics from different sex positions to sex toys
The park's spokesperson confirmed the plan but stressed that it's just an idea at this stage
(CNN)
Taiwan, are you getting a new sex theme park or just teasing us?
The word on the street -- or on the Internet at least -- is that plans are afoot to develop an erotic entertainment attraction on the island's Southwest Coast National Scenic Area.
After interest was aroused by details posted on the region's official website , however, the page was quickly taken down.
The park's administration director, Cheng Rong-fong, confirmed with CNN that the proposal is real, but he insists it's just a concept at this point.
"The ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government," said Cheng.
Details of the plan , circulated by a user on Taiwan's popular PTT online bulletin board, outlined a "Taiwan Romantic Boulevard" sightseeing route with four zones stretching across three counties.
'Silk road of love'
Tainan's Jingzaijiao Salt Farm is famous for its romantic sunset views.
Each stage has a different theme: "dating paradise," "scenic spot for wedding gowns," "silk road of love" and a proposed 10,000-meter-square "sex theme park."
The sex theme park -- or "Garden of Eden" as it's called in the proposal -- will be modeled after other erotic parks around the world including Jeju's Loveland in South Korea and Vigeland Park in Oslo, Norway.
Claiming to be educational, the park will serve as the final stop of the four-stage journey of love.
It'll be divided into different sections, covering topics including sex positions, unusual sex lives and sex toys.
"The dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but aren't officially a couple yet," the proposal said.
Cheng said that the proposal shouldn't have been made public before being finalized, but insisted, if realized, that it will help regenerate a neglected area.
"The southwestern coast of Taiwan has been an important salt farm since the Qing Dynasty," he says.
"It has a unique background, culture and ecological value. Yet, a decade after it was declared a national scenic area, it still hasn't received much attention from tourists. So we thought to ourselves, is it time to try a new mode of thinking?
"The white powdery salt hill and salt farm have always emitted a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area," said Cheng. "That's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating/wedding-themed park in Taiwan."
'Too out of line'
The proposal generated heated debate online.
"This is the first time I find a government proposal interesting," said one online critic, according to Taiwan's Now News .
Another said: "We surpass Japan. The pride of Taiwan."
"This is too out of line," posted another. "And soon the government will start promoting sex tourism."
Beimen is so popular for wedding photos it has fake churches as backdrops.
Chang Huang-chen, the deputy commissioner for Yunlin County, the sex park's proposed home, told the Taipei Times that the idea may not be suitable for traditional-minded locals.
Cheng said he'd received mostly supportive comments, but he welcomed different opinions.
"Sex has always been a taboo in Chinese society," he added. "But it's a part of our lives and a very natural thing -- why can't we discuss it openly and generously?"
Aside from the sex park, the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions.
"We're planning to add around 100 landmarks and installations to each of stage to enrich the experience," said Cheng.
The proposed route starts at the scenic six-story-high salt hill in Cigu County.
It then leads to Beimen, a place famous for its vibrant pre-wedding photo-shooting industry, where "churches" and dozens of other romantic landmarks are built for that purpose.
The third destination, Budai, is a fishing town in Chiayi.
The proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park.

Most of us are happy with being flung around in a roller coaster or spun high in a Ferris wheel.
The rush of fear and the brief re-acquaintance with breakfast are part of the thrill.
But when does a theme park ride stop being scarily fun and start being just plain scary?
We're talking about the rides on which the fear turns into the kind of pure psychological terror that only weeks of counseling -- or a night of martinis -- can resolve.
The rides on which it's not just breakfast that flashes before your eyes, but your entire life (plus some diced carrots that you have no recollection of eating).
These are the scariest theme park rides on Earth.
Thankfully, we don't have to try them, because Stefan Zwanzger, aka the globetrotting Theme Park Guy , already has.
And lived to tell the tale.
The rusty roller coasters of Pyongyang (North Korea)
Just when life in a totalitarian state couldn't get any more terrifying, North Korea unleashes some creaking fairground rides on its unsuspecting citizenry.
To be fair, the Kaeson Youth Park is a rare attempt to sprinkle genuine joy on the gray Stalinist cityscape of Pyongyang.
The fear here, says Zwanzger, is an emotional response in no way soothed by geopolitics.
"When you visit North Korea you naturally never feel completely safe and relaxed, so you enter the rides wondering if they've been maintained at all since most were built decades ago.
"The cobwebs aren't a good sign."

Baku's gross ghost train (Azerbaijan)
Most ghost trains are so lame that it's interesting to hear of one that actually does spook its passengers.
Unfortunately, at the time of Zwanzger's visit, this boardwalk ride on Baku's Caspian seafront was getting its screams the lazy way: via pain.
"Imagine you're alone in a ghost train, driving through the dark, and all of a sudden a sticky curtain drops on you from above and sticks itself to your nose and teeth," Zwanzger says.
"And while the ghost train keeps moving forward, the curtain and your nose and teeth don't.
Zwanzger says he complained to the operator.
"Due to the language barrier and the lack of any internationally recognized sign language for 'my nose got stuck to a curtain,' I don't think he got the message. I don't think he really cared about anything, either."
He adds: "Man, that was painful! My love and pity goes out to those who ride it next."

The Tehran neck cracker (Iran)
At Iran's Eram Park, it's a tossup between which is more disturbing.
The badly drawn Mickey Mouse cartoons, or the soda can roller coaster?
For Zwanzger, the coaster -- which plays fast and loose with physics by flinging passengers in a such a tight loop they can almost see the backs of their own heads -- wins.
"When I saw this the first time, with Coke can-shaped cars hurtling noisily around a narrow loop, I thought, that's going to hurt.
"And it did. Two to three hours of neck pain followed.
"This roller coaster makes one of the narrowest loopings known to mankind. It's as if your head stays in the same place while the coaster spins around."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: Skip roller Iran's coasters altogether and enjoy the country and its wonderful people.
Ferris wheel of misfortune (Nepal)
Take an ordinary Ferris wheel.
Fill it with starry-eyed couples and happy families.
Then crank the speed dial up to 11.
That's how they do it in Nepal.
Because maybe when you live on the slopes of the Himalayas, gaining a few extra meters in height just isn't thrilling enough.
"That thing had speed," says Zwanzger, who says he didn't board the wheel in Kathmandu's Fun Park because the line was too long -- and he was afraid of being propelled into orbit.
"You could hear screams. And these were not the normal Ferris wheel screams of 'ooooh, let's take a photo.'
"These were more like 'argghhh, let me down, I wanna get outta here' screams."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: The London Eye (South Bank, London; +44 871 781 3000)
Qingdao chairoplane of pain (China)
Chairoplanes are called chairoplanes because, as with chairs, it's possible to sit in them, and as with planes, all logic says these things should not leave the ground.
Typically chairoplanes rise a few meters off the ground, giving passengers a thrill as they ride in a chair or model aircraft attached by chains to a rotating overhead gantry.
At Fantawild, a new theme park in the Chinese coastal city of Qingdao, the chairoplane ride is less chair, more plane, lofting startled passengers up to almost cruising altitude.
"I was the only rider, and once up in the air, the chains were making creaking and groaning noises and my chair was turning wildly on its own axis," says Zwanzger.
"It was a long ride. And cold.
"It was new so maybe my fear was just psychological, but I'd rather fly a plane from the 1970s than get back in that Qingdao chairoplane."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: Any chairoplane in a European theme park with a budget of more than 100 million euros.
Disney's secret weapon (Various locations)
There is of course, nothing remotely scary about a kid-compatible classic that takes passengers on a mini-tour of a world populated by friendly animatronic puppets.
And yet, says Zwanzger, Disneyland's "It's a Small World" ride, as seen in its U.S., French, Japanese and Hong Kong parks, has untapped potential as a psychological weapon.
"One ride is fun, but try it about six or seven times and it becomes one of the scariest rides on Earth.
"You ask yourself, 'what if I was trapped here listening to that song and seeing these puppets forever?'
"If you were to chain someone in this ride and have them go around over and over, I think it would actually break them."

The Cannonball Loop (United States, closed)
Like many unnecessary things assembled in the 1980s -- among them the Cadillac Cimarron and mid-career films of Sylvester Stallone -- the Cannonball Loop must've seemed like a good idea at the time.
Looking back, however, it's hard not to view it as the work of an unhinged mind.
The Cannonball was a giant water tube that sent riders sliding through a full 360-degree loop. (See it in action in this YouTube video at 8.19: http://youtu.be/vDHqfhyCbbM )
It enjoyed a brief life in the summer of 1985 at the now-defunct Action Park in Vernon, New Jersey, before being shut down in 1996, reportedly after a series of accidents.
"I've been to almost 300 theme and water parks now, but this is by far the scariest thing I've ever seen," says Zwanzger.
"Looking at it, it's just so obvious that if you have one wrong move, you're going to experience a lot of pain or get trapped inside.
"I can't believe this was actually built in the United States, the country where you can be sued by anyone for just about anything."

Story highlights
The jobs that we aspired to when we were children reflect our passions and talents, say experts
LinkedIn's childhood jobs survey reveals 30.3% of people are either currently in that dream job or a related role
Childhood aspirations are shaped by the people, standards and social expectations that surround us
Leading Women connects you to extraordinary women of our time -- remarkable professionals who have made it to the top in all areas of business, the arts, sport, culture, science and more.
(CNN)
When you were young, what did you dream of being "when you grew up"? Is it what you've ended up doing?
You may dismiss those childhood aspirations as unrealistic now you're an adult with responsibilities and bills to pay, but that role reflected what you enjoyed doing and who you were at that time.
"The dream jobs we aspire to as children are a window into our passions and talents," says LinkedIn 's career expert Nicole Williams. "Identifying and understanding those passions are key to improving our performance and enjoyment of the jobs we currently do, even if they aren't specific to the careers we dreamed of as kids."
So, what influences our childhood aspirations?
When she was a young girl, Meredith Haberfeld wanted to be a librarian like her grandmother was.
"When we're small most of us have a limited idea of what's out there," explains career coach Meredith Haberfeld . "It is shaped by the exposure we have -- the people that have a big impact on us and the standards and social expectations around us".
Our families greatly influence our outlook on life. If we look up to one family member in particular, we tend to be drawn to their careers as we want to be like them. Indeed, when Meredith was a little girl, she wanted to be a librarian because her grandmother, who she admired, was one.
And it's not just our relatives' roles at work that can influence children's aspirations. The gender roles that our parents take on at home can also dramatically impact our childhood career choices.
A study by Alyssa Croft, of the University of British Columbia , found that the division of labor at home had implications for how girls' identities developed in gender roles.
Croft told CNN that fathers' behavior around the house seems to be "predicting their daughter's career aspirations" beyond what they "might be publicly endorsing or specifically saying about gender roles."
She found that if fathers talked about supporting gender equality but didn't take on an equal role in domestic tasks then this sent conflicting signals to their daughters, which led to daughters placing more weight on their father's actions, rather than his words.
By contrast, where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles "that are more gender neutral or even sort of male-stereotypic like being a scientist or athlete," Croft says.
When she was younger, Alyssa Croft wanted to be an artist because she enjoyed painting and drawing.
And that could have a major impact on our pay check down the line. Research by the London School of Economics , published in the journal Social Forces, found that girls who aspired to traditionally female-dominated occupations were far more likely to earn lower wages in their first job, since stereotypically "female" jobs tend to pay less.
"Stereotypically 'male' or 'female' preferences that children exhibit during childhood continue into, and affect, their adult lives," says Lucinda Platt, Professor of Social Policy and Sociology at LSE .
Our early experiences can also have a bearing on what we see as our "dream job" -- a positive experience linked to a potential career can be hugely inspiring.
"I went through an intense marine biologist phase fueled by a life-changing snorkeling expedition when I was seven years old," reveals Hayley Barna , co-founder and co-CEO of beauty start-up Birchbox .
And inspiration can also strike at school, if we learn about a career that resonates with us.
"When I was in the 4th grade [aged 9-10] I learned about lobbyists. I thought it would be amazing job to try and influence important issues," says Joanne Bradford , head of partnerships at Pinterest .
When we are young, our aspirations are a response to our circumstances; but Haberfeld says that when the time comes to start "designing" our careers we begin tuning in to what we feel "compelled to express" about ourselves.
Clara Shih , founder of Hearsay Social , started out with a long and varied list of possible careers -- she went through phases of wanting to be a teacher (like her mother), a police officer, an astronaut and an attorney.
"Only in high school when I began programming computers, did I become interested in tech and start-ups, which led me to attend Stanford and major in Computer Science," she says.
"Even as an eight-year-old, swinging ponytails et al, I would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little 'scripts' to deliver to a pretend audience!"
Shivvy Jervis, Creator and presenter, Digital Futures
While many of us turn our backs on our childhood ambitions when faced with the realities of life as a "grown-up," some really do end up in their dream jobs.
A survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than 8,000 professionals from around the world, carried out for social networking site LinkedIn, found that 30.3% of the site's members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of, or in a career linked to those plans.
Creator and presenter of Digital Futures Shivvy Jervis is one of those living out her early dreams.
"Even as an eight-year-old, swinging ponytails et al, I would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little 'scripts' to deliver to a pretend audience!" she says.
"When I was fifteen, I announced with assured clarity to my family that my 'dream job' was to be a producer and TV journalist."
Sometimes our careers begin at such an early age that there's little to think about.
Four-time Paralympic champion Ellie Simmonds OBE started swimming when she was five; by the time she was eight she was competing against able-bodied children.
"I'm not sure I thought too much on what career I was interested in when I was a child," she says. "I always just wanted to have a farm and work with horses when I was very young, though the thought of working with children is something I've thought about since.
"I'm very fortunate that my swimming career took off when I was very young, so it was never really a question."
But no matter how early we step on to that treadmill, it's never too late to change tack; thinking back to our childhood ambitions can help us work out which aspects of our current job we love.
After Hayley Barna's marine biologist phase passed, she says, "I never had a single career in mind. I always pictured myself being able to do many things at once: engineer, President of the United States, investment banker, professional skier, magazine editor...
"I haven't checked the box on any of those specifically, [but] I feel lucky that my current role blends a lot of different disciplines."
When we were children, our aspirations were limitless and anything seemed possible; by recapturing that excitement and allowing it to inform your research and networking, 2015 could be the year you find your dream job.

        <MainBody>Five-year-old artist Iris Halmshaw has been compared to Monet
She has autism and is unable to speak, but paints for hours at a time
Demand for her paintings is rocketing around the world
Original artworks sell for thousands of dollars
(CNN) -- At first glance, they could almost pass for masterpieces by Monet or Renoir.
But these impressionist-style paintings -- which are changing hands for thousands of dollars -- were painted by a five-year-old girl who is unable to speak.
Meet Iris Halmshaw, an autistic child from Leicestershire, UK, who has been producing these striking artworks since she was three.
She has autism, a condition that has made her unable to communicate except through the medium of art.
"From the first painting, she filled the paper with color and it wasn't random -- it was considered and thought out," says her mother, Arabella Carter-Johnson.
Five-year-old painter Iris Grace Halmshaw
"She was so excited and happy I knew that we had found a key into her world and a way of interacting with her."

Autism changed everything
The journey started when Iris was two. Carter-Johnson and her husband, Peter-Jon Halmshaw, realized that something was wrong: she had not picked up any words, and rarely made eye contact.
"We researched it ourselves," her mother recalls, "but as parents, you are always hoping that there was some other explanation."
Iris was officially diagnosed as a child with autism. According to Carter-Johnson, the doctor was "depressing" because he told them that very few therapies worked.
Not to be deterred, the couple embarked on "long nights of research", which led them to the idea of art therapy.
The little girl picked up painting techniques astonishingly quickly, and before long was spending much time at work on her canvases.
Remarkably for a child of her age, her sessions involved about two hours of consistent concentration.
Savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them.
Professor Allan Snyder, Australian National University
How one girl's talent captured the world
To begin with, Carter-Johnson, who is a photographer herself, started sharing her daughter's paintings on Facebook .
The overwhelming response from her friends convinced her that she hadn't been blinded by mother's pride. Iris was special.
Fast forward two years, and Iris' paintings are in high demand, and are starting to be worth a lot of money.
Due to the high level of demand for Iris' art, her mother has set up a website to sell both originals and prints.
It was a runaway success, quickly attracting over a million pageviews from more than 200 countries.
"All profits from the originals go into Iris's savings account," says Carter-Johnson.
"We also sell cards and prints, and the profits from those go towards her speech therapy, occupational therapy, music and yoga."
The money generated from sales of the prints has had profoundly beneficial effects on Iris' day-to-day life.
According to Carter-Johnson, systems like Gemiini speech therapy, for instance, have made an immeasurable difference to her ability to communicate.
"She has a tendency to drift off into her own world, if you let her," says Carter-Johnson.
"So by using her interests, we manage to engage her, and she changes into a giggly little girl dancing around the house.
"Her speech isn't at a stage yet where we can have conversations, so it's hard to tell exactly how much she is understanding everything that has happened surrounding her art.
"We have shielded her from a lot of it. She hasn't been to TV studios or done interviews."
She has a tendency to drift off into her own world, if you let her.
Arabella Carter-Johnson, Iris' mother
Extraordinary artworks
Many of Iris' paintings show an astonishingly mature interpretation of natural scenes, including waterfalls, fields and skies.
Her abstracts often depict particular moods or experiences after which they are titled, like Patience, Separation, and Immersion.
All are united by a distinctively contemplative and often lightly melancholy atmosphere, as well as a mysterious sense of depth.
This growing body of work has led to Iris being widely accepted as a savant.
According to Professor Allan Snyder from the Centre for the Mind at the Australian National University, people like Iris are able to unlock the hidden wells of potential that lie in all of us, but are rarely accessed.
"I think it's possible for a perfectly normal person to have access to these abilities," he says. "[But] savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them."

A conservator tells state-owned Ahram Online that the beard broke off during cleaning
He says it was stuck back on with epoxy, which "was not a proper material to use"
Museum director denies claims of damage, tells Ahram a committee will inspect the mask
(CNN)
Was the priceless funeral mask of King Tutankhamun damaged and hastily glued back together? That's the claim made by a museum conservator to Egyptian media.
The conservator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Egypt's state-owned Ahram Online that the mask's beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being cleaned last year at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
He said the blue-and-gold braided beard was fixed back in place quickly with epoxy, a type of strong adhesive.
"The epoxy was not a proper material to use to restore the mask, although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for attaching metal and stone," he is quoted as saying.
The conservator said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the glue had dried.
However, the Egyptian Museum's general director, Mahmoud El-Halwagi, dismissed the claims in an interview with Ahram Online, saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in October.
"An archaeological committee was assigned to inspect the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the mask's condition," he said.
Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh Eldamaty also told Ahram Online that media reports of damage to the mask were unfounded.
The boy king's elaborate burial mask, discovered in his tomb in 1922, is one of Egypt's most outstanding artifacts.
Tutankhamun, who ruled from 1336-1327 BC, is thought to have been about 17 years old when he died, based on analysis of his mummy, according to the British Museum . His cause of death is not known.
If confirmed, it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe.
In 2006, a visitor to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, famously tripped on a staircase and smashed three hugely valuable Chinese Qing dynasty vases. The thousands of porcelain fragments were eventually painstakingly reassembled .

        <MainBody>Chinese man who disappeared in alleged abduction as a child was reunited with his father
Sun Bin's mother died "constantly murmuring" his name, father says
Child trafficking is a major business in China
Hong Kong (CNN)
A Chinese man has been reunited with his father 24 years after he was abducted as a toddler from a vegetable market.
In 1991, 4-year-old Sun Bin was taken by child traffickers from his hometown in Sichuan province and sold to a family thousands of miles away, in Jiangsu province on the country's eastern coast, Chinese state media reported .
Sun Bin when he was four with his father.
On Tuesday, Sun was finally reacquainted with his 60-year-old father, Sun Youhong, and a younger sister he had never met. The moment was captured in a moving series of photographs.
"I was happy. I was grateful," the father said. "But I was also bitter."
Child trafficking is still a major business in China, as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents in China and elsewhere.
Boys, prized because they carry on the family line, are in great demand and fetch higher prices.
Earlier this week, Chinese police said they had rescued 37 newborn babies after busting a trafficking ring that sold the babies for up $13,000 each.
The reunion Tuesday took place at a police station in Chengdu. When a police officer introduced Sun Bin to his father, the 28-year-old dropped to his knees and wept in his father's embrace.
"You're a man. Don't cry," said the elder Sun, according to a report released by the state news agency Xinhua.
The Search
Sun Bin was just a toddler when he disappeared at a vegetable market in 1991. Sun Youhong said that he and his wife had dropped everything to search for him.

India's Environment Minister has announced a 30% increase in wild tigers in India since 2011
Debbie Banks from the Environmental Investigation Agency says this has "set India apart from other tiger range countries"
One of the major challenges that continues to exist, however, is the sophistication of the illegal tiger trade
The significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, says Banks
(CNN)
Wild tigers in India appear to be staging a comeback in the battle against extinction, with the country's Environment Minister announcing a 30% increase in the endangered species' population since 2011.
"Our latest estimate today is that India has 70% of the world's tiger population and we have now 2,226 tigers presently in 47 tiger reserves [up from 1,706 in 2011] and this is a great achievement. It is a net increase of 30% over the last estimation,"  Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a statement Monday.
Researchers involved in the study, the third of its kind carried out in India, say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats.
Debbie Banks, head of the Tiger Campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade, welcomed news of the study, saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in March.
"I think it has set India apart from some of the other tiger range countries. If you look at China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, there's more emphasis on tigers in captivity, farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild," she says to CNN.
India's once-thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching, a reduction in prey, habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area.
Although preliminary results of the government's study are promising, Banks warns against complacency.
"While this is good news from India, I don't think anyone is sitting back and saying 'we've won.' The demand within China for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue. And so it's a constant battle."
A major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade, where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders, such as mountain passes. "The criminals have changed their practice. And there's no evidence of any enforcement there," she says.
A historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as India and China, the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, Banks says.
"Tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment, certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit. But they are the water gods, if you like. They are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change.
"There's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers."
And if today's results are anything to go by, Banks says India appears to be leading that charge.
"India, despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas, is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation."

The Open Worm Project aims to recreate the behavior of the common roundworm in a machine
The open source project has taken four years to model 302 of the worm's neurons in its software
It had its first major breakthrough recently when the software independently controlled a Legobot
The robot mimicked some of the behaviors of the worm, responding to external stimulus through sensors
(CNN)
A humble roundworm is leading the race in artificial intelligence, showing that it may be possible one day to upload our brains to a computer.
Called the Open Worm Project , the research brings together scientists and programmers from around the world with the aim of recreating the behavior of the common roundworm ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) in a machine.
The open source project recently had its first major breakthrough when its software -- modeled on the neurons of the worm's nervous system -- independently controlled a Lego robot.
The machine's sensors, without any prior programming, made the robot behave in a similar fashion to C. elegans, approaching and backing away from obstacles or stimulated by food.
While the developers say it will be some time before the Lego bot will be avoiding predators or searching for a mate, scientists say the project shows that artificial intelligence, or AI as it is known, is coming out of the realm of science fiction.
"We've been working on it for four years and while we have a lot more to achieve it's been the most surprising project I've been involved in," project coordinator Stephen Larson told CNN. "It's certainly exceeded my expectations."
With the worm's nose neurons replaced by a sonar sensor and the motor neurons running down both sides of the worm replicated on the left and right motors of the Lego bot, the robot could emulate the worm's biological wiring.
Larson said that while the open source project is still awaiting peer review, and the scientists and researchers in the experiment are reluctant to make any bold claims about how closely it resembled biological behavior, the result were nevertheless impressive.
"We definitely have further to go, but I think what captures people's imagination is how much information we have managed to put together," Larson said.
"We know we have the correct number of neurons, we have them connected together in roughly the same way that the animal has, and they're organized in the same way in that there are some neurons that give out information and other neurons that receive information."
"We feel we've gone a long way down the road, but we still know that there's a lot that's been left out and there are a lot of assumptions -- at the moment it represents one point in a line of iterative improvements.
I'd say we're only 20 to 30% of the way towards where we need to get
Stephen Larson
"I'd say we're only 20 to 30% of the way towards where we need to get."
The project aims to digitally model the worm entirely in a virtual environment; creating a robot with an elastic body complete with stretchy muscles.
"Something with wheels that is rigid is an interesting application but it still falls short of reproducing the anatomy of the worm," Larson said.
He said the scientific road map is to model the worm completely, equipping it with the same physics right down to the cells in all the right places.
While the C. elegans nematode was chosen because of the simplicity of its biological structure, the complexity of the experiment has been such that the team has had to narrow down the project to just a third of the worm's neurons, restricting it to those parts of the worm's make-up that would display behavior.
The digital version of the worm will be released on the web in June this year, allowing anyone with an interest to tinker with the project.
Larson said the open source and collaborative nature of the project has been key to its success, allowing it to make fast progress over the four years of its existence.
So far, it's had input from more than 60 contributors from 15 countries, all of them bringing a unique take on the problems thrown up by the project.
The project has now split into various sub-teams, all of them dealing with different elements: one team is looking at the physical and mechanical model, while another is fleshing out the neurons and the muscles and their electrical models.
The great part of the open source experiment is that the team can take onboard left-field suggestions that push it beyond its boundaries.
"I'd say that this robot was just one of those left-field suggestions," Larson said. "A contributor was able to come along and re-use our material, put it up online.
"The fact that it caught so many people's attention was really a bit of a surprise."

Tourism revival?  After hitting rock bottom in 2008, Zimbabwe is experiencing a tourism revival, but visitors have yet to rediscover Great Zimbabwe.

Story highlights
Great Zimbabwe was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s
Zimbabwe is making a tourism comeback after hitting rock bottom in 2008
Visitors have yet to rediscover Great Zimbabwe, however, leaving it almost deserted
(CNN)
About halfway up the cobblestone stairwell, the screeching starts.
Loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop.
All around me, tree limbs shake.
It's just after dawn, and I'm alone, climbing the trail to the 15th-century royal compound on the hilltop at Great Zimbabwe in southern Africa.
Alone, except for the baboons.
Like all the stone structures here, the stairwell is open to the sky, but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that I can't see more than 10 feet in front of me.
Sure enough, around the next bend a baboon is waiting for me on one of the dozens of terraces that skirt the hillside.
We watch each other for a few moments until I'm certain he's not interested in me, and then I keep walking.
Baboons freak me out, but these moments are part of what makes Great Zimbabwe such an incredible place to visit.
Monkeys are often the only other visitors to the ruins.
Baboon standoffs
Unlike the world's more visited ruins -- which is basically every other ruin -- here it's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place, even if that means the occasional standoff with a baboon.
The stairwell leads to a narrow passage through a cleft in the rocky hilltop. Stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead.
They once would've extended even farther out over the stairs, but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned, bringing a wall down with it.
It's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex.
The old city, which was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s, stretches over 1,800 acres.
Essentially the hilltop functioned as a palace and cathedral, the center of political and religious power.
On the planes below, circular stone walls form a series of enclosures.
The most iconic, aptly called the Great Enclosure, is the largest pre-colonial structure south of the Sahara. The walls rise up 36 feet and stretch 820 feet around.
At one end, an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a conical tower, the most distinctive landmark in the old city.
I like the hill complex more.
Here the walls curve around each other and the granite boulders, which are incorporated into the design. Different chambers are linked by a labyrinth of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks.
At the far side is a chamber with a towering stone ledge that once held a small stone wall that acted like a balustrade.
Destructive treasure hunters
Like all the structures here, the stones were assembled without mortar.
Each layer was slightly recessed, creating a slope that held it all together. Over the centuries, some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters, or just by the elements.
The chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found.
Most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park, which is worth a visit if only to see them.
The image of a bird appears on the national flag, and is as much a symbol of Zimbabwe's national identity as the Statue of Liberty is to the United States.
A labyrinth of narrow passages snakes among the hill complex.
There's a good chance of being here alone.
Visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class, or the occasional park worker, but not many other visitors.
Tourism in Zimbabwe has been in a long and slow recovery.
In the 1990s, Zimbabwe was for a moment the most visited country in sub-Saharan Africa.
By the time the nation hit rock bottom in 2008, hardly any foreign visitors came.
Now major attractions like Victoria Falls are bouncing back, but places like Great Zimbabwe have fallen far off the radar.
The ruins are easily accessible by road, but it takes several hours from Harare or a full day from Johannesburg, so not many people make the effort.
But this is a place I love returning to.

An estimated 300,000 civilians are stuck in rebel-held areas around Aleppo
They are at risk of barrel bombs and warring militias and are short of food, water and fuel
Fierce battle under way for control of Handarat hill, on the road in to the rebel-held area
(CNN)
It is difficult to know at what point things of horror become forgotten and slip out of the world's view. Perhaps it is when they are eclipsed by another, seemingly more pressing crisis. Or when it becomes almost impossible -- for safety or other reasons -- for outside observers to bear witness to their daily toll.
Aleppo has, somehow, sometime between late 2012 when it was the open sore of the Syrian civil war, and today -- when the fight against ISIS has completely grabbed the world's attention span -- slipped off the radar screen.
But here is why it must not: there remain an estimated 300,000 civilians there, in rebel-held areas alone.
These are people who suffer any one -- or all -- of the following litany of afflictions daily: Barrel bombs -- randomly dropped, crudely made devices intended to maim, kill and terrify; warring rebel militia, also fighting with the regime; radical Islamic groups; shortages of food and water; people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel.
And above all a sense, for months now, of hopelessness that their world has only worsened since the fight for Aleppo began in June 2012. That their fight has been deemed by some to be so incurable and intractable that the outside world has left Aleppo to its own devices -- willing to help the winner, but not to assist a victory.
Aleppo is the greatest prize in the fight for Syria's north, but also its greatest victim. Aleppo, the biggest city, its commercial hub, its cultural heart, is a skeleton of what stood proudly merely three years ago.

Is this the site of Jesus' trial?
Joel Baden, special to CNN
Updated 1737 GMT (0137 HKT) January 6, 2015
Archaeologists say they've found evidence that Jesus' trial was held near the Tower of David in Jerusalem.
Joel Baden is professor of Hebrew Bible at Yale University.
(CNN)
Every few years, it seems, an archaeological find of major biblical significance is announced, almost always to do with either Jesus or King David. This week, it's Jesus, and it's a big one.
Just inside the western walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, beneath the tall Ottoman-era fortification known misleadingly as the Tower of David, archaeologists this week proclaimed the discovery of the site of Jesus' trial by Pontius Pilate, at which he was condemned to die by crucifixion.
More accurately: They proclaimed the opening to visitors (read: tourists) of the site, which has now been excavated and prepared for public viewing.
Without pinpointing the precise location, scholars have known for a long time that the trial must have taken place somewhere in this general vicinity -- despite the fact that tradition has put the spot of the trial on the very opposite side of the Old City, in the Antonia Fortress.
First, the background:
According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus' trial before Pilate happened in a place called the praetorium. Originally a term used to signify the tent of the general when encamped for war -- and thus the place where the important military decisions were made -- praetorium came to signify the palace or administrative center for very high-ranking officials.
In Jerusalem, this was the palace of Herod the Great, and according to ancient witnesses, it was at Herod's palace that visiting Roman prefects, like Pilate, would hold any necessary trials during their visits to the capital city.
These same ancient writers declared that Herod's Palace was in the western part of Jerusalem -- near the Tower of David.
On these grounds scholars have long doubted, indeed outright rejected, the notion that the Antonia Fortress on the northeastern side of the city was where the praetorium was located and the trial occurred.
This most recent announcement is being hailed as a blockbuster, in large part because the Antonia Fortress is the first station of the cross on the Via Dolorosa, the path that Jesus is thought to have taken from his trial to his crucifixion and burial at Golgotha, ending at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
The Via Dolorosa is an important pilgrimage site and a massive tourist attraction. But if its first station is on the completely wrong side of the city, then the whole thing is cast into doubt.
The Tower of David museum, which is housing the exhibit of the newly discovered trial site, is openly hoping to draw pilgrims and other interested visitors, and it is certain to get them.
What should not be overlooked, however, is that an important archaeological revelation about the life and death of Jesus was effectively kept under wraps for nearly 15 years -- the discovery of Herod's Palace beneath the Tower of David was first made in 2001 as part of a museum expansion project.
The timing of the announcement is linked entirely to the potential for tourist dollars, rather than to the remarkable historical and religious significance of the discovery on its own terms.
This may sound cynical, but it is par for the course, especially in Jerusalem, where the integration of history, religion, archeology, and tourism is at the very heart of the city's economy.
It is a safe bet that this discovery will not significantly diminish interest in walking the Via Dolorosa --customs and traditions are awfully hard to break, even with the best historical evidence.
What is more likely to happen is that there will be two sites of Jesus' trial, happily coexisting, just as there are two sites of Jesus' burial: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Garden Tomb.
Jerusalem, despite being riven by conflict, remains one of the most religiously pluralistic places on Earth, and that pluralism is nowhere better exemplified than in the sharing, duplicating, and often just plain old creating of religious sites.
From a scholarly perspective, however, it is nice that in this case, the significance for the tourism industry of an archeological discovery really does match up with its significance in history.
Better 15 years late than never.

"Our top 10 safest airlines are always at the forefront of safety innovation and launching new planes," says Thomas.
AirlineRatings.com's rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations as well as government audits and the airlines' fatality records.
It also examines airlines' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence.
Of the the 449 airlines it monitors, 149 have the top seven-star safety ranking.
This year, the site also included a list of the top 10 safest low cost airlines for 2015.
These are, in alphabetical order:  Aer Lingus (Ireland), Alaska Airlines (U.S), Icelandair (Iceland), Jetblue (U.S.), Jetstar (Australia), Kulula.com (South Africa), Monarch Airlines (UK), Thomas Cook (UK), TUIfly (Germany) and WestJet (Canada).
"Unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit audit and have excellent safety records," says Thomas.
"Low cost does not mean low safety."

One fatal accident for every 1.3 million flights
The release of the AirlineRatings.com list comes at a particularly sensitive time for fliers.
While 2013 was one of the safest years in global aviation history, 2014 is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities, due to several high-profile air incidents.
AirlineRatings.com says there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities in 2014 -- higher than the 10-year average.
However, looking to the positive there were only 111 crashes in 2014, the lowest number in more than 80 years says the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, or BAAA.
The last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927.
"If you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes, flying today is safer," says Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group.
"However, there are more aircraft in the sky, so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and, in some categories of disaster, higher."
According to a report on AirlineRatings.com , the world's airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights in 2014.
"Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number," says the website.
"Another twist is that fatal accidents for 2014 were at a record low 21 -- one for every 1.3 million flights. Two of the crashes last year -- MH370 and MH17 -- were unprecedented in modern times and claimed 537 lives."
In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 aboard.
Officials believe that plane is somewhere in the Indian Ocean. But, nearly 10 months later, MH370 hasn't been found.
In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard.
Malaysia Airlines has a five out of seven ranking on AirlineRatings.com.
AirAsia Indonesia -- still reeling from the crash of Flight QZ8501, which went down over the Java Sea on December 28 with 162 people on board -- has a four out of seven star ranking.
Prior to December, AirAsia had a near flawless safety record, with no previous fatal accidents.
World's unsafest airlines
AirlineRatings.com says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically receive a deduction of one star, giving it a lower safety rating.
"A crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star deduction for 10 years from the date of the incident," says the website on a page explaining its ratings system.
Of the 449 airlines surveyed by AirlineRatings.com, nearly 50 have just three stars or less.
Four airlines only achieved one star for safety.
Two are from Nepal -- Tara Air and Nepal Airlines -- joining Kazakhstan's Scat Airlines and Afghanistan's Kam Air.
All four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the European Union .
The United States doesn't blacklist individual airlines, but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards.
