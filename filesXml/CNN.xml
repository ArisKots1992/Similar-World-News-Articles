Initial reports Friday about the attack suggested there had been three gunmen, but a Tunisian Interior Ministry spokesman later said the ministry was aware of only one and that he had been killed.
The spokesman, Mohammed Ali Aroui, told CNN on Saturday that the gunman specialized in electronics in pursuing his masters degree and didn't have any known relationship with a terror group.
The dead
Tunisian authorities on Saturday began transferring the bodies from Sousse to the capital, Tunis, the Ministry of Health said. It updated the death toll to 38 and said 39 people were wounded.
"The nationalities of the killed, most of them are British, German, and French, this is the 95% of them," according to Prime Minister Habib Essid. "The majority of them are British, then the second in number were German, then third in numbers were French."
Fifteen of the dozens killed were British, and the number may rise, the UK Foreign Office said.

One Belgian, one German and three Irish citizens were also among the dead. Ireland's Foreign Ministry confirmed the death of Lorna Carty on Saturday, while the mayor of Athone on Sunday said a couple from the Irish town -- Laurence and Martina Hayes -- had also died. It is not yet clear whether they were killed immediately or died later from their wounds.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi on Saturday, a German government spokesman said. Merkel expressed her condolences, the spokesman said, and both leaders agreed to cooperate more closely on the issue of terrorism.
In the wake of the resort attack, Essid announced a crackdown on what he called "illegal mosques."
The mosques were "spreading rumors and poisons to encourage terrorism," he said Saturday. "About 80 (mosques) will be closed ... within one week."
Attacks also in France, Kuwait
Tunisia's nightmare came the same day as two fatal terrorist attacks in other countries.
A man caused an explosion at a chemical plant near Lyon in southeastern France after having beheaded his boss and leaving the head hanging on a fence, French officials said. Authorities detained the suspect.
And ISIS claimed responsibility for an apparent bomb blast at the Shiite-affiliated Al-Sadiq mosque in Kuwait's capital during Friday prayers, leaving at least 27 dead and more than 200 wounded.

Decapitated victim identified by French authorities

Decapitated victim identified as 54-year-old Herve Cornora
Victim ran transportation company where suspect worked
Mayor: Cornora "took care of others"
(CNN)
French authorities have identified the man whose decapitated head was found after an attack on a factory near Lyon.
Herve Cornora was in charge of the transportation company that employed Yassin Salhi, the alleged attacker, according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV.
A memorial for Cornora, 54, was held Saturday in his hometown, Fontaines-sur-Sane, about seven miles (11.3 kilometers) north of Lyon. Residents of his neighborhood gathered to listen to the town's mayor eulogize Cornora, who was a personal friend.
Mayor Thierry Pouzol said Cornora was deeply connected to his community and tried to help his neighbors.  He "took care of others," Pouzol said during the emotional tribute that was broadcast on French TV.   "Today, we are all with Herve," he said, and asked the people gathered to "maintain reserve and dignity to honor (Cornora's) memory."
The group also held a minute of silence.
Attack occurred at U.S.-owned company
Cornora's severed head was found hanging from a fence, along with two banners that purportedly bear Islamic writing, outside the same factory where a large explosion occurred Friday.  Police found his body in the suspect's van.
The attack took place at a U.S.-owned factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, about 18 miles (30 km) outside of Lyon.  The company, Air Products &amp; Chemicals, supplies gases for industrial use.
It began when a delivery van allegedly driven by Salhi entered the facility Friday morning, according to Paris Prosecutor Franois Molins, whose office handles anti-terrorism cases throughout France.
The vehicle was allowed through the gates because the van had been used to make previous deliveries and Salhi was recognized as an employee of the transport company.

About seven minutes later, Salhi's van appears on security cameras accelerating toward a warehouse containing canisters of gas, acetone and liquid air, Molins said.  After another minute, there was an explosion so loud residents two miles away could hear it.  The blast damaged the warehouse and destroyed the roof and back of the vehicle.
When firefighters arrived about five minutes after the explosion, they say they found Salhi trying to open canisters of acetone.  He was then taken into custody, according to Molins.  While examining the damage to the warehouse, officials found Cornora's head tied to the factory's fence, along with the flags.  Molins said that the Islamic profession of faith was written on the fabric, but the French Interior Minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the writing had not been translated.
Suspect had been on terrorist watch list
Authorities say Salhi has been married for 10 years and has three children.  He was put on the French terrorist watch list in 2006. "[H]e continued to attract the attention of the intelligence services, particularly with regard to the Lyon region," Molins said.  Cazeneuve said the suspect was in touch with Muslim fundamentalist Salafists.
Investigators are still trying to piece together details of the attack, but Salhi's wife and sister were taken into custody, along with another person, according to Molins.  They are being investigated for involvement in a terrorist conspiracy.
French media is widely reporting that Salhi posed for a selfie with Cornora's severed head, citing sources close to the case.  CNN has not been able to independently confirm that such an image exists.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his condolences for the attack to Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.  The two met Saturday in Vienna ahead of talks on Iran's nuclear program.
Air Products &amp; Chemicals says it is working closely with French authorities and that it has stepped up security at other locations around the world.
French authorities have raised the security level to maximum across the Rhone-Alpes region, according to BFMTV.

Worst attack in Kuwait in years
(CNN)
Kuwait's Interior Ministry said Sunday that it had identified the suicide bomber who blew himself up at a mosque as a Saudi citizen, according to the official Kuwait News Agency.
The Ministry named the attacker as Fahad Suleiman Abdulmohsen Al-Gabbaa.
The terrorist group ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the attack, had identified the bomber as Abu Sulieman al Muwahid -- probably the man's nom de guerre.
The bomb ripped through the Al-Sadiq mosque during Friday prayers -- a time when, more than other, mosques are packed with worshipers.
It was the worst terrorist attack Kuwait had seen in years, and one of three that took place on three different continents Friday.
Kuwaiti emergency personnel pull stretchers past security forces outside the Shiite Al-Imam al-Sadeq mosque after it was targeted by a suicide bombing during Friday prayers on June 26, 2015, in Kuwait City.
Kuwaiti police said they had arrested the man who drove the bomber to the mosque, the country's state-run Kuwait News Agency reported early Sunday. They identified him as Abdulrahman Sabah Eidan Saud, whom they said was as an "illegal resident" born in 1989.
In addition, police said they had arrested the driver's landlord, whom who they said was the "bearer of fundamentalist and deviant ideology."
A message of unity
Beyond the immediate investigation looms the issue of preventing such attacks in the future and ensuring that ISIS, which is wreaking havoc in neighboring Iraq and also has claimed attacks in Saudi Arabia, cannot do the same in Kuwait.
Kuwaiti newspapers Saturday carried messages of unity in this emirate, where Shias are one-third of the population.

Story highlights
Bergen: Terror attacks on three continents show diversity of jihadist terrorism
There is no one answer to how to prevent this wide variety of attacks, he says
Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad."
(CNN)
In one several-hour time period on Friday, the world saw jihadist terror attacks on three continents: In Europe, in North Africa and in the Middle East.
The three attacks underline the diversity of global jihadist terrorism today, both in terms of the types of tactics being used by Islamist terrorists and their choice of targets, demonstrating that such terrorism is no monolith, but can take several forms: "homegrown" extremists in the West, as well as well-trained gunmen and suicide attackers in the Arab world attacking a range of targets from an American commercial venture overseas, to Western tourists in the Arab world and Shia targets.
Peter Bergen
The multiple attacks underline the multiplicity of forms that jihadist terrorism is now taking and should serve to remind policymakers both in the West and in the Arab world that there are no simple fixes to countering the phenomenon.
In southeastern France, Yassin Sahli, who, according to French officials, had been associated with Salafism, which is a fundamentalist Islamic movement, allegedly conducted an attack on a factory owned by an American company.
That attack seems to have been inspired by ISIS as it involved a beheading and a black-and-white flag that is typical of the group was found at the scene.
One person was killed in the French factory attack, which looks similar to other ISIS-inspired attacks in the West with relatively limited impacts. Those include the attack in May in Garland, Texas, aimed at an exhibition of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in which the only deaths were the two ISIS-inspired gunmen killed by police, or the attack in Copenhagen in February aimed at an event celebrating a cartoonist who had drawn Mohammed in which one person was killed.
These kind of "homegrown" attacks don't involve militants training overseas, so they generally do not result in major death tolls.
Contrast the attack in France on the factory with the attack also on Friday at a hotel in Tunisia frequented by Western tourists.
That attack has resulted in at least 37 deaths and was carried out, it seems, by more than three gunmen using so called Fedayeen--" those who sacrifice themselves"-- tactics of the kind that were deployed in the Mumbai attacks in 2008, in which 166 people were killed.
In such attacks the gunmen go into the attack planning to fight to the death to prolong the length of the attack, so ensuring higher casualties and prolonged media attention.
Typically such assaults involve more than one gunman and training by a terrorist organization, such as we saw in January's Charlie Hebdo magazine attack in Paris in which two brothers killed 12 people, including an armed policeman. One of the brothers had received training from al Qaeda in Yemen.
Finally, in Kuwait, ISIS claimed a suicide attack on a Shia mosque on Friday in which some two dozen worshipers were killed. The attack was similar to those carried out against two Shia mosques in Saudi Arabia by ISIS in recent weeks.
These attacks are part of ISIS' strategy to stoke  what is now a regional, sectarian civil war stretching from Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula to Syria to the heart of the Gulf.
What we saw unfold on Friday is what we can expect going forward in the world of jihadist terrorism; relatively frequent small-scale attacks in the West inspired by ISIS; large-scale attacks by trained fighters in the Arab world, and attacks against Shia targets around the Middle East that are designed to inflame Sunni-Shia tensions.

After visiting with hospitalized victims, Taiwan's Premier Mao Chi-Kuo announced a ban on color powder events while the incident is being investigated, according to CNA. In a video distributed by the government, he said the ban would be in place until color powder can be proved safe.
President Ma Ying-Jeou also met with people injured in the fire. He said the Taiwanese government would help the victims and promised a full investigation.
Five people have been questioned in connection with the blast, according to Tu Yi Te, secretary in chief of the Luzhou District police department.  He said two of them are considered to be suspects -- the organizer of the party and the person in charge of lighting and hardware. They have been brought to the prosecutor for further questioning, Tu said.
Mayor Eric Chu called it the  "worst incident of mass injury (ever) in New Taipei," Taiwan's most populous city.
Formosa Fun Coast said the fiery explosion occurred during a "Color Play Asia" party put on by a separate company that leased out space at the park.
"We are very regretful (for) this accident that caused injuries to many victims," Formosa Fun Coast said in a statement. "The most urgent matter  currently for us is to handle and assist with ... victims on the scene and work comprehensively with the New Taipei Fire Department."
The organizer of "Color Play Asia" apologized and promised to take full responsibility, CNA reported.
"We need to apologize to the families. I am very sorry that something like this happened," organizer Lu Chung-chi told CNA.  "We shoulder ultimate responsibility."

"We're determined to do everything that we can in order to be able to make this important milestone. But that depends on a lot of things and were determined to work on them and find out," Zarif said.
Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Wendy Sherman, under secretary of state for political affairs, were also in the meeting.
Saturday night, Kerry met for about an hour with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, a senior State Department official told CNN. The secretary offered his condolences on the terrorist attack that occurred Friday, and they discussed the attacks in Tunisia and Kuwait as well. But the bulk of their meeting was spent discussing the Iran deal.
Kerry is set to meet with Zarif again Sunday morning, and will also meet with European Union High Representative Federica Mogherini as well, the official added.
Iran and the U.N. Security Council's permanent members hope to negotiate a comprehensive nuclear deal before June 30. Until now, it has been difficult to get the Iranians to focus on the details of an agreement.
U.S. officials do not expect to have an agreement by the deadline. Sources say they hope a deal is finalized by July 3, but understand that things could last much longer.
One of the most sensitive issues needing to be addressed is granting International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors access to Iranian nuclear sites, including military ones. There seems to be less focus on making Iran confess about its past developments of a nuclear weapon than it is about current affairs and future compliance.
The second outstanding issue is related to sanctions being lifted or suspended against Iran.

        <Description>The U.S. effort to take out senior ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and other top ISIS officials is increasingly focusing on Raqqa, Syria, the self-declared capital of ISIS, CNN has learned.</Description>

Bin Laden, by comparison, was largely removed from day-to-day operations, with the U.S. pinpointing his specific hideout location and watching him for an extended period of time before launching a raid.
The increased fighting in the area has not changed the U.S. view that al-Baghdadi and top leaders mostly remain in the city, keeping a low profile so they cannot be located. If they were to be found in a building, the U.S. would then face the complication of potentially putting civilians at risk in any bombing to destroy the site.
The coalition continues to use overhead satellites and aircraft to keep watch for any signs of a vehicle convoy that could be tracked by a drone with Hellfire missiles, which is the optimum weapon for targeting moving vehicles. The U.S. is not ruling out that al-Baghdadi may move around, but the overall assessment is that he does so with an extensive understanding of how to stay out of U.S. crosshairs.
The U.S. has identified a series of buildings in downtown Raqqa it believes house the headquarters and operations of ISIS but has been unable to bomb them because of civilians in the area. The existence of the complex was first reported by The New York Times.
U.S. intelligence also is observing a buildup of ISIS defenses along the northern side of Raqqa as Kurdish fighters potentially draw closer. One U.S. official said defenses include trenches, berms, improvised explosive devises and obstacles -- all traditional ISIS battlefield defenses.
Whether the Kurds actually decide to go all the way to Raqqa to confront ISIS is not entirely clear. But the U.S. is stepping up assistance in that area.
READ: U.S. considers whether ISIS wives playing key role in operations
"Special operations have knitted together networks on the ground" of local fighters, the official said, who can communicate targets to the coalition operations center in Irbil, Iraq, for them to call in airstrikes.
While this has been going on in several locations for some time, the U.S. is trying to give specific assistance to the fighters north of Raqqa, officials said. Communication of targeting information from fighters on the ground is done via cellphone as well as other undisclosed means.
For now, the U.S. believes Kurdish groups control much of the border from Iraq all the way west to Kobani, Syria.
Some U.S. officials believe the ISIS move on Kobani in recent days may also be an effort to divert those Kurdish fighters moving towards Raqqa so they have to turn around and go back north.
U.S. officials said the renewed efforts to take back Kobani are not surprising, given the Kurds have cut off so much of the group's access to the border with Turkey.
Now the worry is that ISIS will move further west to look for other border crossings. That could pose a challenge for more U.S.-led airstrikes, as that runs up against an area where the U.S. believes the anti-air missiles and radar systems of the Syrian government are still active and pose a potential threat to aircraft in the U.S.-led coalition.

The case of an 11-year-old pregnant girl has become a lightning rod in the abortion debate
The girl's mother she tried to denounce abuse, but the case was dismissed
Accusations of child neglect against her are "unjust," the mother says
Asuncin, Paraguay (CNN)
Long before the case of a pregnant child in Paraguay who was allegedly raped by her stepfather drew international attention and became the latest lightning rod in the abortion debate, the girl's mother says she went to authorities asking for help.
"I was the one who reported all of this, asking for justice to be done and hoping that something would be done, but prosecutors dismissed the case," the mother told CNN en Espaol in an exclusive interview Thursday. "Otherwise, this would have never gotten to this point."
It was November 2013 when she first reported the abuse, according to the mother, who CNN is not identifying in compliance with Paraguayan laws protecting the alleged victims of abuse.
Now, her 11-year-old daughter is pregnant. The mother is accused of child neglect and complicity. And the stepfather is behind bars, accused of rape.
In her first interview with an international media organization, the mother said the charges against her are false, and the view the public has of her simply isn't true.
"I was unjustly accused," she said, tearfully describing what she said were years of threats and abuse she endured at the hands of her husband.
Paraguayan Health Minister Antonio Barrios earlier told CNN that neighbors were the ones who'd reported the abuse, and that the mother had denied accusations against her husband.
"Who should we believe?  Why would I do something like that?" the mother said Thursday. "I went to demand justice, but authorities decided not to carry out an investigation."
Debate over Paraguay's response
The case has sparked international debate, with high-profile human rights organizations criticizing the government's response.
The girl's mother, according to Amnesty International , had asked for the pregnancy to be terminated after learning about it in April.
Paraguayan law bans abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. The Paraguayan Ministry of Health has said there's no indication that the health of the girl is at risk.
Earlier this month, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights cited recent testimony from U.N. experts saying Paraguay's government had "failed in its responsibility to protect a 10-year old sexual abuse survivor and provide her with critical and timely treatments, including a 'safe and therapeutic' abortion."
The human rights commission said the girl, who was 26 weeks pregnant at the time of its statement, was facing a serious health situation with a significant possibility of complications. It criticized the Paraguayan government for not releasing enough information about the case and questioned whether the girl and her family were being provided enough information about the situation and the significant medical risks.
Paraguay's government has maintained it's done everything possible to protect the girl's life , and the life of the fetus.
'We are going to take care of the baby'
The moment she got out of jail on a provisional release this week, the mother said she knew where she needed to be: by her daughter's side.
"I went to talk to my daughter after almost two months," she said. "I felt a huge excitement that couldn't be contained in my heart, as any mother would."
Doctors, according to the mother, say her daughter -- now seven months pregnant -- is in good health and doing well.
The stepfather has denied the charges against him and demanded a DNA test.
"I'm going to leave it all up to the justice (system). Let them do their job, even if they didn't do it until now," the mother told CNN en Espaol. "I asked for this a long time ago, two years ago, and they never listened to me. I'm now asking that justice be done. I leave justice in their hands so that this never happens again."
There are no more options now, the mother said, other than waiting for the baby's birth and supporting her daughter.
"We are going to wait for the baby to be born," she said. "And between my whole family, we are going to take care of her baby, so she can keep studying. ... Because nothing that happened to her was her fault."

"Children were suffering from malnutrition. Their stomachs were very swollen. ... Their whole faces were covered with fine hair and their hair was a very light brown color instead of black. Their arms and legs were so skinny they looked like tree branches."
Now, North Koreans are again facing a "looming humanitarian disaster in the DPRK," or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according to the United Nations human rights chief.
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein told CNN, "We call for the international community to support the DPRK and help the DPRK in a respect of what is going to be a very difficult famine."
State media, which usually paint only a rosy picture of life for North Korea's citizens, have been publishing reports about what they call the worst drought in 100 years.
"Their decision to officially report the drought in their internal media is remarkable," says Andrei Lankov, a professor at South Korea's Kookmin University. "It's a signal to both domestic and foreign audience that probably something will go bad later this year.  So they will probably apply for foreign aid."
Parched rice paddies 'incredibly serious'
China says it is willing to help.
And there's been a neighborly offer of assistance from South Korea, even though the two countries are technically at war. Seoul's Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo says both Koreas are facing drought, and this could be a time for cooperation.
The Asia deputy regional director for the U.N. World Food Programme, John Aylieff, witnessed power cuts to the hydroelectric power supply when he was last in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. He says his staff members have reported low reservoir and river levels.

National Olympic Stadium, Tokyo  Today's stadiums are architectural feats of design that can elevate the senses, capture the spirit of a community, and become an icon of the city long after a sports event ends. Celebrity Iraqi-born British architect, Zaha Hadid's design for the 2020 Olympic stadium in Tokyo won an international competition, but has received criticism. Japanese architect, Arata Isozaki described it as, "A turtle waiting for Japan to sink so that it can swim away." The 83-year-old warned: "Tokyo will surely be burdened with a gigantic white elephant." Not all new stadiums receive such objections.

National Olympic Stadium, Tokyo  "While the New National Stadium in Tokyo will be used for the 2020 Olympic Games, the stadium is being built to host the widest variety of events in the future. Its first major international event will actually be as a venue for Japan's hosting of the 2019 Rugby World Cup -- the first country in Asia to host the event," said Jim Heverin, director at Zaha Hadid Architects which designed the arena. "The key to a successful stadium is to design for these long term requirements, rather than the one-off event such as the Olympics."

        <title>Why these girls fear the summer</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/h-VnhrZPRsI/index.html</Link>
        <Description>For millions of schoolgirls in Egypt, summer can be a terrifying time -- it's the start of the female genital mutilation season.</Description>
        <MainBody>More women have undergone FGM in Egypt than anywhere else in the world
92% of married women aged 15 to 49 have had the procedure
Anti-FGM campaigners believe they're turning the tide on the practice
Cairo, Egypt (CNN)
Summer days: They're what childhood memories are made of, glorious afternoons of unchecked freedom to frolic with friends in the sun, unshackled from the earthly obligations of a math class that never seemed further away.
But for millions of schoolgirls in Egypt, this time of year represents something much darker: the start of the female genital mutilation (FGM) season.
Mona Mohamed was 10 years old when she underwent what's also known as a female circumcision on a hot summer day in her village in Upper Egypt.
"I was terrified," she said. "They tied me down, my mother on one hand and my grandmother on the other."
As Mona thrashed around, pinned by her loved ones to the living room floor, a doctor injected her with anesthesia.
Mona remembers being given a piece of bubble gum to chew on before she finally passed out.  It wasn't until she woke up that she realized she had been mutilated.
Egypt: The FGM capital of the world
Stories like Mona's are far from rare in Egypt, where "cutting" has been a brutal rite of passage for young girls since the time of the pharaohs.
Of the more than 125 million girls and women alive today who have undergone the procedure, one in four live in Egypt. That's more than any other country in the world, according to the U.N.
Ninety-two percent of married Egyptian women aged 15 to 49 have been subjected to FGM, according to a government report released in May . That figure is down from 97% in 2000 , but the practice is still the norm here.
Most girls are cut between the ages of nine and 12, and the operations usually take place during the summer school break so the girls can recover at home.
U.N. officials say FGM has no medical benefits and can cause lifelong physical and emotional trauma for the women forced to undergo the procedure.
"This is a gross human rights violation," Jaime Nadal-Roig, the U.N. Population Fund representative in Cairo, told CNN. "It doesn't add anything to the life of the girl, and there are no medical or religious grounds whatsoever."
A celebrated tradition
The most common FGM procedure in Egypt is Type 1, the partial or full removal of the clitoris. It's what Mona Mohamed -- and her older sisters -- endured years ago.
Compared to her sisters, Mona was lucky, given that her procedure was performed by a doctor. Her sisters were circumcised with a razor blade by a traditional (non-medical) midwife who put dust on their wounds to stop the bleeding.
Mona, now 47, recalls asking her mother why getting circumcised was so important. "Usually girls at your age get 'excited,' and this operation takes care of that," her mother replied.
FGM has been illegal in Egypt since 2008, but the practice remains woven into the very fabric of Egyptian society, where many see cutting as a way to "purify" a girl and make her marriage material.
"People used to have a party after a girl was circumcised, they'd celebrate and exchange gifts," Nadal-Roig said. "So for them to turn from there and say, 'look this is a crime or this is a sin or this is not allowed by religion' means confronting a lot of beliefs and social norms."
Campaigners go on the offensive
But progress is being made. The percentage of girls aged 15 to 17 who have had the procedure has dropped from 74.4% in 2008 to 61% in 2014 -- a clear sign that the drive to end FGM is working, campaigners say.
Last week Egypt announced a plan to reduce FGM by 10-15% in the next five years. If it works, it will mean that for the first time in decades, "uncut" girls would outnumber those who have had the procedure.
"It's an ambitious plan, but now I think that the political atmosphere is supporting us and we can reach our goal," said Vivian Fouad, the National Population Council official leading the government's charge to eradicate FGM.
"For years we were on (the) defense, but now we're on the offensive."
The fight to eradicate FGM in Egypt is unfolding on a number of fronts, from the courts to the places of worship to the streets of the highest-risk towns.
In January a doctor was sentenced on charges related to mutilating a girl -- the first conviction of its kind since the 2008 ban went into effect.
The verdict was a victory for the anti-FGM campaign, but Fouad says too many doctors are still willing to take the money from families and look the other way when it comes to the law.
"It's a good income for doctors," Fouad said. "And some doctors have social and cultural backgrounds where FGM is supported."
Fouad classifies the battle against female circumcision as a fight for the middle class: "If doctors, judges, prosecutors, and teachers are supporting FGM, how are we going to convince poorer women not to have it?"
Campaigners are also trying to persuade local religious leaders to stop preaching the alleged benefits of FGM to mothers. It's often a tough sell in a country where more than half of women still believe, falsely, that cutting is required by religion, according to the most recent survey.
"You need to make people not want to do it for their daughters," said UNFPA program officer Germain Haddad. "You need to work on people's convictions."
To that end, the UNFPA has hired a theater group to perform comedic skits in the streets of communities across the country to foster debate -- and doubt -- about the necessity of FGM.
"Many of these people are shy," said Haddad. "When we used to do seminars on FGM it was very difficult to get people to speak up and ask questions.
"These plays act as an icebreaker that opens up the subject like magic," she said. "And women get to see in a comedic way that FGM is ridiculous."
"I hate the man that did this to me"
But it remains an uphill struggle. Around six in 10 women think the practice should continue, according to the most recent government survey.
"It's tradition, and there's no escape," says Sarah Abulaziz Mohamed, who was circumcised at 12 in her village of Mansour.
"It hurt my dignity -- I was forced to do this act that I didn't want to do," she said. "I hate the man that did this to me."
Sarah is 40 now and has two young daughters of her own. She says FGM left her with lifelong psychological trauma, but at least it taught her a valuable lesson.
"I definitely wouldn't do it to my daughters by any means," she said. "To this day I still have pain, and what's gone is gone ... that part of me can never be given back again."

A python died after eating a porcupine at the Lake Eland Game Reserve in South Africa.

Park rangers found a 30-pound porcupine inside the African Rock Python
The snake's death may be down to a combination of what it ate and stress from human interaction
(CNN)
A huge snake's big meal in South Africa has turned out to be its last.
After the death of a 12-foot-long African Rock Python, park rangers opened its stomach. Inside they found a 30-pound porcupine.
Its needle-sharp quills seem to have punctured the snake's digestive tract and may have contributed to its death.

The engorged snake was first spotted by a mountain biker in the Lake Eland Game Reserve, about 100 miles south of Durban, two weeks ago.
Visitors showed up at the park to observe the snake and to speculate what it had eaten. On its Facebook page , the Game Reserve had its own guesses: a small warthog or impala calf.
When the snake died this week, curious park rangers performed a necropsy, or autopsy, on the animal.
Though the exact cause of death is unknown, spectators and the porcupine may be to blame.
"With all the human interaction, this could have caused stress and the python would then regurgitate the meal up with all the quills causing a problem," said game reserve manager Jennifer Fuller.
Pythons, which are some of the largest snakes in the world, kill their prey by constriction.
Some species are known to eat animals as large as antelope or deer. Their prey is swallowed whole and may take days or weeks to digest fully.

In search of peace? Maybe it's time to move to Iceland.
According to the nonprofit Institute for Economics and Peace, the thinly populated island in the midst of the North Atlantic has retained its place as the most peaceful country in the world.
The institute released its Global Peace Index for 2015 this week, which ranks 162 nations around the globe based on factors like the level of violent crime, involvement in conflicts and the degree of militarization.

Six out of the top 10 most peaceful countries were European, with Denmark and Austria holding the second and third spots.
"Europe maintained its position as the most peaceful region in the world, supported by a lack of domestic and external conflicts," the report said.
But that glowing review is helped by the fact that violence-plagued Ukraine is lumped into a different region: Russia and Eurasia.
U.S. in bottom half of rankings
Ukraine suffered the second biggest deterioration in its rating over the past year as pro-Russian separatists clashed with government forces.
The only country that fared worse was Libya, which has "sunk into a low-level civil war between Islamist and nationalist groups," the report said.
War-ravaged Syria remained at the bottom of the rankings. And Iraq, the other country where the Islamic militant group ISIS holds large areas of territory, dropped below South Sudan and Afghanistan to second last place.
The United States is in the bottom half of the index, scoring badly in terms of militarization, homicides and fear of violence. Its ranking improved somewhat from a year earlier, though, rising from 101st place to 94th.

The World Happiness Report highlights the happiest countries
People live longer and experience more generosity and social support in these counties
The United Nations first declared a World Happiness Day in 2012

Would a taste of the finest Swiss chocolate make you happy? Or soaking in the warm Icelandic springs? Perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in Denmark is for you?
It's not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy, according to the third World Happiness Report , released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations on April 23.
People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support, experience more generosity, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows.
The tiny country of Bhutan, a very happy country famous for measuring the "Gross National Happiness" of its people, gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness: Its Prime Minister proposed the idea of a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011.
Recognizing "happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world," the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012 . This officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month.
Through the happiness report , the Sustainable Development Solutions Network hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people's happiness.
"There is no single key to happiness," said Jeffrey Sachs , the network's director and an economics professor at Columbia University. "All of these countries do well in several ways. Being rich? That's good, but it's only a modest part of the story. Trusting society, having a government that ranks on low in corruption, a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness."
Even if you don't live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world, a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day.
Here are the top 10 happiest places on Earth, according to the World Happiness Report.
1. Switzerland
Switzerland took the top spot from Denmark in 2015, rising from third to first place in this year's list of the world's happiest countries.
Bern, the capital city of Switzerland , has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Since the city's founding in the 12th century, it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion. And the lovely River Aare offers in-town swimming and boating.
Looking to get out of the capital city? Book a trip to Lucerne, where you can take a boat trip on the lake, ride the panorama gondola, take in the views on the new Dragon Ride aerial cableway and ride on the world's steepest cog railway. Book the Golden Round trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the Alps -- in one day. (The railway reopens in mid-May.)
And no matter where you go, there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try.
2. Iceland
Nature and culture combine to make Iceland a truly happy place, so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year.
Explore South Iceland, where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document Iceland's 10th- and 11th-century history are remembered.  A two-hour drive from the capital city of Reykjavik, south Iceland is home to Vatnajokull Glacier, the 60-meter (197-foot) Skogafoss Waterfall and amazing fresh seafood. (Though you could probably skip the fermented shark ...)
No matter where you visit, there's probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring. And when you get back to the capital, note that the renowned annual Reykjavik Art Festival will take place from May 17 through June 7.
3. Denmark
Never mind that Denmark lost the top spot this year and is now the third-happiest country in the world.
Looking at all that Danes have to be happy about, you won't notice the slight dip while you're enjoying jazz at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, hanging out with the hipsters at Queen Louise's Bridge , taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the Royal Danish Playhouse.
Prefer your music in the woods? Head to Smuk Fest ("The Beautiful Festival"), a rock/pop festival in the woods of Skanderborg held in August.
Wherever you go, enjoy that Danish tradition of "hygge," sometimes translated too simply as the need for "coziness." It's really a complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family, and it makes for one happy country.

4. Norway
The sun never sets in some parts of Norway during the summer months, and the North Cape area is one of the best spots to play when the sun stays out for 24 hours. Visitors love to golf, hike and even run a marathon during the months ruled by the midnight sun.
If your taste buds dictate your travels, head to the Norwegian capital city of Oslo, a gastronomic paradise where the Michelin food guide has awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna (one star each) and Maeemo (two stars).
5. Canada
Canada combines European style, sensibility and history with the enormous natural wonder of North America.
Within the French-speaking province of Quebec , a tour through the historic city of Old Quebec is a treat for any Francophile. Founded in the early 17th century, it's the only North American city north of Mexico that still has its fortifications. The historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Just a few minutes from downtown Quebec City, Ile d'Orleans is a small island where farming and agriculture are still a way of life. And if nature is what you crave, in less an hour from Qubec City, you could be hiking through the Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier, home to the glacial Valle de la Jacques-Cartier.
50 states, 50 spots to get happy around the U.S.
6. Finland
What a happy event to spot the rare Saimaa ringed seal , which adapted to freshwater living after the Ice Age cut off its lake home from the sea. There are only about 300 of them in the world, and they can be found at Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland.
But you might have more luck spotting the white whooper swan, Finland's national bird, whose arrival heralds the start of spring.
For a more urban experience, visit Helsinki's Market Square and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. And you can still spot animals in the capital city: In mid-May, the cows will be herded into the fields in Viikki, a neighborhood in Helsinki, after the long winter. Locals always gather to celebrate this moo-ving event.
7. Netherlands (Holland)
Though the Netherlands' tulips are without equal, and they are most stunning at Keukenhof (known as the Garden of Europe), there are so many beautiful spots across the country to walk and bike to welcome spring and its trademark flower.
For a more regal celebration, note that the kingdom celebrates its 200th year this year with many festivities.
8. Sweden
In a country that's very fond of celebration, Swedes love to celebrate midsummer, the longest day of the year , most of all. It's a national holiday marked with traditional food and dances around a maypole.
Can't make the midsummer parties? There's still plenty to do. Just 20 minutes from the capital city of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago of about 30,000 islands offers endless opportunities for contentment. Swimming, hiking, cycling, fishing, horseback riding -- it's all within your reach by booking a boat ride. (Some boat trips include meals and tours of many of the islands.)
9. New Zealand
New to the top 10 list of happiest countries, New Zealand has plenty of reasons to celebrate. Though it's always been an attractive spot to explore, Peter Jackson choosing the country to host the filming of the "Lord of the Rings" movie trilogy has given New Zealand more attention than money could buy.
The capital city of Wellington has benefited from the growth of the movie industry, developing a happening restaurant and design scene.
And many of the country's natural wonders have gained international attention, including the 2,291-meter (7,516-foot)-high Mount Ngauruhoe , which played the fictional Mount Doom. It's part of Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
10. Australia
The Great Barrier Reef , the world's largest collection of coral reefs, is a natural phenomenon not to be missed. Australians are arguing fiercely over manmade threats to its existence  (and no one is happy about that).
Once you've had a chance to explore that magical underwater realm, head to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island 240 kilometers (149 miles) off the mainland coast. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a UNESCO World Heritage Site , includes one of the last surviving temperate rainforests in the world.
To see the wilderness up close, try hiking the stunning 65-kilometer (40-mile) Overland Track . It takes about six days for hikers (who must book the trip in advance), but day-trippers can take short hikes starting at Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre and Dove Lake.

From refugees to photojournalists  Adil Mustafa Hamdan, 21, is a student at the Soba Secondary Refugee School. He was one of 21 students selected to take a digital storytelling course through the UN Refugee Agency project. Like many of the students that graduated from the course, he aspires to be a photojournalist.
"I would go to the Nuba Mountains and photograph people with no clothes, no shoes; I'd photograph soldiers while they are fighting; I'd photograph airplanes that drop bombs. I would show through my photos and explain through my stories the situation in the Nuba Mountains," he says.

"I left the Nuba Mountains because of the war in '83. At that time, we left in a group of 57 people. Only nine of us survived the journey. I was the youngest, only seven years old.
One day, my father was very sick and he began to tell me the names of all of my uncles. When he finished he died. I stayed for seven more years until the people signed a peace agreement, which was in 2005.
I said to myself, let me see what will happen. After six years I prepared to go back to my homeland, but when I was about to start my journey the war broke out. I thought, 'I'll never see my family. I will die as my father died.'
Then people began to arrive from the Nuba Mountains to the camp. The first person I spoke to turned out to be my uncle. It was the best moment of my life. This is why I am happy. Because I have found my relatives."

From refugees to photojournalists  Awatif Kawaja Matile is 20 years old. Education has always been very important to her. At ten, she walked long distances to attend her primary school. Later, she attended a private school, where she lived without her parents."I struggled because I didn't have their financial support to help me buy clothes, shoes and other materials," she admits.
When the war broke out in 2011, she made her way to the Ajuong Thok  Refugee Camp so that she could continue her studies. "Being in school is an opportunity to learn, and to change your life from bad to better," she says, though she admits she doesn't view education as a cure-all. "It doesn't mean that you will have a comfortable life; you may face challenges and problems, but education makes you a better person in the future. You must think and reason wisely," she says.As a participant in the project, she focused a lot on the everyday struggles of families in the camp.

A death trap for al Qaeda leaders?

Al Qaeda in Yemen confirms leader's death, replacement 01:30
Story highlights
Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader is reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike
David Sterman: Since AQAP seized Yemeni port, four leaders have died in drone strikes
David Sterman is a program associate specializing in counterterrorism at New America , a Washington-based think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
(CNN)
Much attention is being devoted to analyzing the significance of the death of Nasir al-Wuhayshi , the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the No. 2 leader for al Qaeda globally, in a reported U.S. drone strike last week.
After all, he was the organization's second-ranking leader and headed the al Qaeda affiliate that has been consistently portrayed as the one that poses the greatest threat to the United States -- even more dangerous than ISIS, the breakaway al Qaeda affiliate and center of media focus, according to former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell.
David Sterman
That view was shared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which  tweeted: "We continue to assess that AQAP remains the al-Qa'ida affiliate most likely to attempt transnational attacks against the United States" as the President laid out his justification for strikes on ISIS.
Al-Wuhayshi had the personal history to back up his claim as leader of the most threatening terrorist group. He was Osama bin Laden's personal secretary and body guard and was with the core al Qaeda leadership as it fled Afghanistan. He spent time in a Yemeni prison before escaping and becoming the leader of the newly formed AQAP.
Yet as interesting as the man is the place where he was reportedly killed. The strike occurred in Al Mukalla, a Yemeni port in the province of Hadramaut and the fifth-largest city in Yemen.
AQAP seized Al Mukalla in early April amid the chaos precipitated by Houthi rebel advances. AQAP's seizure of the city prompted extensive worry regarding the group's resurgence buoyed by the conflict.
For example, The New York Times ran an article headlined "War in Yemen Is Allowing Qaeda Group to Expand," quoting Jamal Benomar, a U.N. diplomat who had been tasked with achieving political reconciliation in the country, as saying, "For the first time, al Qaeda is building a strategic alliance with the tribes," and, "It is a strengthened and dangerous al Qaeda. This is what worries everybody."
While it is clear that AQAP has made great strides, there is another story in Al Mukalla -- a story of the constraints on jihadist power. Since AQAP seized the city, the United States conducted five drone strikes in the city's vicinity, according to data collected by New America. That constitutes nearly half of the strikes the United States has conducted in Yemen so far in 2015.
Those five strikes have ripped holes in AQAP's leadership. Four AQAP leaders have been killed in Al Mukalla since the group seized the city. Al-Wuhayshi was reportedly killed in Al Mukalla on Friday. On April 22, a drone strike killed Muhannad Ghallab , a 35-year-old Egyptian who acted as an AQAP spokesman in the city.
Also in April, Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, the senior AQAP commander who appeared in a video claiming responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris by the Kouachi brothers, was killed by drone strike in Al Mukalla. And on April 13, a drone strike killed Ibrahim al Rubeish, a 35-year-old Saudi and former Guantanamo Bay prisoner, who served as a top spokesman and ideologue for the group.
By taking Al Mukalla, AQAP gained much but also placed its leadership in a death trap. The deaths reveal the risks jihadist terrorist groups take by seizing territory. Even ISIS, the group that has made the most dramatic territorial gains when it conducted a blitzkrieg across northern Iraq, faced a similar challenge when its advances opened its forces up to the devastating effect of American air power.
Of course, leadership deaths do not necessarily mean the end of an organization , and AQAP may still benefit overall from seizing the city. Though the subject of much debate, various studies have found leadership decapitation to have at most a limited effect on a terrorist group's fortunes.
Other recent research suggests that decapitation can lead to more, and less selective, violence on the part of terrorist groups. Moreover, while air power is great at stopping advances, and also quite effective in killing selected leaders, it has a poor record in dislodging terrorist groups from territory they've seized.
Despite these cautions, the recent wave of leadership deaths in Al Mukalla suggests there are real constraints on a group's ability to take advantage of instability and seize territory, even in a situation as chaotic as the war raging in Yemen.

        <MainBody>U.S. confirms al Qaeda leader killed in Yemen 01:58
Story highlights
Several high-level terror leaders have been killed in the Middle East
Bergen: Just picking off the leaders of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda isn't an effective strategy
Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad."
(CNN)
American counterterrorism officials have had much to celebrate in recent days: the killing of ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf in Syria and the trove of "intel" that was taken from his residence by U.S. special forces; the death of the leader of al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi , in a drone strike; and the possible death in Libya of Mokhtar Belmokhtar , the leader of a virulent North African jihadist group.
But the leadership of these groups is generally replaceable. Consider the case of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the brutal head of al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS, until he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006.
Peter Bergen
Since then, a number of other leaders from al-Zarqawi's group have been killed, but that did not prevent from ISIS becoming ISIS -- a group that today lords over millions of people and occupies territory in Syria and Iraq that is around the size of the United Kingdom.
To be sure, any counterterrorism campaign that eliminates many leaders of a group can have a real impact -- al Qaeda's core group in Pakistan is a shadow of what it once was, in part, because of a deadly campaign of CIA drone strikes that eliminated many of its leaders and middle managers.
Yet, if we zoom out to the bigger picture, from Libya on the northern coast of Africa to Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the spaces in which jihadist militant groups can operate have greatly opened up as a result of the early promise of the Arab Spring turning into the grim reality of the Arab winter. The resulting chaotic conditions and weakened states have proven a boon to ISIS and to al Qaeda and its affiliates:
-- In Yemen, al Qaeda has taken advantage of the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Hadi government to seize control of large swaths of southern Yemen, including the country's fifth largest city, Mukalla.
-- In Libya, jihadist groups including ISIS control about a tenth of the country, according to a senior U.S. government official.
-- In Syria, al-Qaeda's local affiliate, the Nusra Front, together with ISIS are now the most powerful groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and each control large sections of the country.
-- In Iraq, ISIS controls the second largest city, Mosul, and much of Anbar province, which is about a third of the landmass of the country.
What to do about all this is a puzzle because much of Middle East is in the grip of a regional, sectarian civil war fomented by Iran and the Gulf States and is evolving into a Rubik's Cube-like problem that has no good solution, because when you move one piece of the cube it can create both solutions and a new set of problems simultaneously.
To get a sense of how complex this Rubik's Cube is: Consider that the United States is training Syrian opposition  forces  to fight the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad, while it is also training Iraqi forces of the Iran-backed Iraqi government to fight ISIS. The U.S. therefore is effectively supporting both sides of the wars in Syria and Iraq.
Describing problems is always, of course, much easier than solving them, but here are some ideas that can help the U.S. achieve its strategic goals in the Middle East -- dismantling ISIS and al Qaeda and avoiding a long-running sectarian regional civil war:
Curtail the foreign fighter flow
ISIS is taking around 1,000 casualties a month in U.S.-led airstrikes, yet it's also recruiting around 1,000 "foreign fighters" from around the Muslim world every month, so the military campaign against ISIS is something of a draw.
The U.S. should put pressure on Middle Eastern countries, which supply the bulk of the foreign fighters to the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts, to curtail the flow of their nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has already made some strides in that direction, but this should also be a priority for other Arab governments.
Let American soldiers go forward
The exact number of U.S. troops in Iraq is not the germane issue right now. It's the constrictive rules of engagement that have been imposed upon them that prevent them from getting "outside the wire" of the bases that they are assigned to. What is needed are rules of engagement that allow U.S. forward air controllers calling in precise airstrikes as well as U.S. advisers embedded with Iraqi troops on the frontlines. Not only will this help to place more accurate air strikes on ISIS positions, but also Iraqi troops with embedded Americans will have better military advice and  the comfort of knowing that they will get close American air support if ISIS threatens them. Right now that isn't the case.
Step up the air campaign in Syria and Iraq
One of the world's experts on counterinsurgency, New America fellow David Kilcullen suggests increasing the tempo of of the air campaign. Kilcullen points out that the average rate of  coalition air strikes since last August into Syria and Iraq is about 10 per day, while in the successful air campaign against the Serbs in Kosovo in 1999, it was around 250 per day, suggesting that the U.S.-led coalition can still ratchet up the pressure on ISIS significantly.
Resist calls to split Iraq up into Sunnistan, Shiastan and Kurdistan
Iraq is a country where many of its citizens are products of Shia-Sunni marriages and cities like Mosul and Baghdad remain mixtures of many ethnic and religious groups. Trying to separate out Iraq into sectarian and ethnic cantons will only fuel the sectarian passions in Iraq and in the region. The model to avoid, albeit on a larger scale, was the disastrous 1947 partition of India into Muslim- and Hindu-majority states in which 1 million people died.
If the Iran nuclear deal gets done, use it as leverage to show al-Assad the door
Use the goodwill tendered by a deal with Iran to have the Iranians pressure their close ally, al-Assad, to step down, while maintaining much of his regime in place. That way the coalition of Alawites, Christians and other regime supporters will be assured that if al-Assad goes, they won't have to go down with him and will have a stake in some kind of peace deal, rather than fighting to the death.
Keep pressure on the Saudis not to resume their counterproductive air campaign in Yemen
That campaign had the effect of further fracturing the already-fracturing country, which has benefited al Qaeda.

The Rohingya are a persecuted Muslim minority who are effectively stateless in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are forced to live in crowded camps -- which they are generally forbidden to leave --  and are considered to be interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, despite the fact that many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

Alternatively, crews have simply abandoned them to drift.

David Scott Mathieson says Myanmar is facing rising Buddhist extremism
New laws look set to target Rohingya Muslims, he says
David Scott Mathieson is the senior Burma researcher for Human Rights Watch. The views expressed are his own.
(CNN)
The impact of Myanmar's repressive policy toward Rohingya Muslims was made clear in recent weeks with scenes of desperate people crammed into boats, an escalation of a miserable maritime flight in which an estimated 90,000 people have fallen prey to smugglers and traffickers since early 2014. The United Nations estimates that around 1,000 people have died on the way.
The root cause is the long-term reprehensible treatment of the Rohingya in Myanmar (also known as Burma) -- stateless, officially and socially reviled, with severe curbs on their rights to work, travel, get health care and education, and practice their religion.
Yet even as this anguishing exodus has gripped international attention, it has obscured a connected and equally troubling pattern of rising religious extremism in Myanmar. At the height of the boat drama, parliament passed the " population control law ," which permits the government to identify areas in Myanmar that could be subject to repressive birth control measures. The law was inspired by Buddhist extremists whose stated agenda is opposition not just to Rohingya, but to all of Myanmar's sizable Muslim minority. The law was sharply criticized by many activists in Myanmar and opposed by the opposition National League for Democracy, but passed a joint parliamentary vote, 530 to 443, with 39 abstentions.
The population control law is one element of a package of four "race and religion protection" bills. The other elements are an interfaith marriage bill, which grants government oversight of any marriage between a Buddhist and non-Buddhist; a religious conversion law, which requires government permission to change one's religion; and a monogamy law, which could limit the rights of people living in unmarried relationships and potentially target Muslims.
These laws were proposed by the increasingly influential Race and Religion Protection Association, known by its Burmese acronym, Ma Ba Tha, consisting of prominent Buddhist abbots. The problem is that Ma Ba Tha has tapped into a deep and divisive strain of ethnic Burmese ultranationalism and a belief in Buddhist religious supremacy that has contributed to vexed and violent relations with scores of ethnic minorities since independence from the British in 1948. U Wirathu, Myanmar's most vitriolic Buddhist monk, infuses his regular public rallies with populist paranoia over a nonexistent Islamic takeover of Myanmar.
To push for passage of these discriminatory laws, the Ma Ba Tha staged public events throughout Myanmar and collected nearly 1.5 million signatures. The purportedly reformist government of President Thein Sein, pandering to Ma Ba Tha's agenda, then drafted similar pieces of legislation and submitted them to parliament.
There are fears that the three remaining draft laws will pass in this final parliamentary sitting ahead of the first ostensibly free national elections in decades later this year -- and possibly fuel anti-Muslim violence during what will be a very tense period. After all, a surge of violence in 2012, which amounted to ethnic cleansing , displaced about 140,000 Rohingya, who languish in squalid camps. At the same time, security restrictions on the estimated 1 million Rohingya in areas abutting the Bangladeshi border have been tightened. Several incidents of anti-Muslim violence in the past two years have caused dozens of deaths.
Myanmar's Rohingya: terrorized, starving and homeless
Last month, local authorities and Thein Sein's office denied permission to hold a Union Muslims Nationwide Conference in Yangon, citing its potential for instability. On June 2, a court in upper Myanmar sentenced a writer and former National League for Democracy official to two years in jail with hard labor for "insulting religion," over a 2014 speech defending the purity of Buddhism from Ma Ba Tha's political distortion.
Diplomats in the country realize that the race and religion laws could spark not only attacks on Muslims but justifications for government crackdowns. The United States, European Union and numerous United Nations officials have therefore conveyed their deep concern, although Burmese officials have rejected this out of hand.
Meanwhile, many Muslims see the laws as just one part of a long-term plan to extirpate the Rohingya and other Muslims from the country, and there is a danger that all this could lead to the collapse of the nascent political reforms over the past four years that have led to the beginnings of economic development, increased international assistance and direct foreign investment that are crucial to help pull Myanmar from the hole dug by 50 years of dictatorial military rule.
By mining the darker nature of Myanmar's Buddhists, religious extremists and the political opportunists who seek to profit from them are thwarting the aspirations of generations who have struggled for democracy and openness. Sadly, the extremism reflected in the laws suggests a future of even greater violence and division.

        <title>Opinion: The key message from the Pope</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/EilCvgJS87E/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>It's not really the climate change deniers who are preventing action.
It's the rest of us -- those of us who are too oh-whatever to care.
"Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest," the Pope wrote in the much-anticipated document. "Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity."
Think about that stinging critique.
"Indifference."
Those terms, at various points in time, easily could describe me.
(I hear my air conditioner humming as I type this.)
And I bet they could describe you, too.
I don't blame you for that.
Climate change can seem like too big of a problem to tackle. It can seem so big no one individual can make a difference. Or it can seem so far away -- either in geography or time, like, who cares what happens way up there in the Arctic, or 200 years in the future -- that it's easy to ignore, to shuttle it onto a collective to-do list. One that we never actually plan to return to.
Opinion: Listen to the Pope about climate
As much as I'd like to, we can't entirely ignore the political fringe that denies the reality of climate science. But we can see them plainly for what they are: an ignorant sideshow.
And instead of giving them our attention, we can take the Pope's advice, opening our eyes to the harsh realities of climate change and then looking inward. Asking ourselves why we ignore climate change so effortlessly. This, of course, is a much more uncomfortable task than calling out political bogeymen. But maybe a dose of exploration and reflection would help us move past our addictions to fossil fuels and what the Pope calls a "throwaway culture," one characterized by a "whirlwind of needless buying and spending."
This is not to say that governments are off the hook for climate action.
The opposite, actually.
It's going to take an informed, engaged public to demand the level of action that is needed to stop the planet from warming 2 degrees Celsius , which is the benchmark for "dangerous" climate change.
But it starts with you and me.
It starts with paying attention.
I was forced to wrestle with some of these difficult questions on a recent trip to the Marshall Islands, a low-lying country in the Pacific, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. The entire nation may not exist in just a few decades if carbon emissions aren't cut drastically -- and people there are painfully aware of those facts. Marshallese people see the floods that have claimed homes and eroded beaches. They hear the roar of the ocean. It used to be a comfort, and now it frightens some people on the coast.
Climate change is a tinnitus ringing in everyone's ears -- a day-to-day reality.
They don't have the luxury of indifference.
I wandered around the islands for several days asking people about migration: What happens if this nation disappears? Where will you go? When will you go? Do you have a Plan B?
Then I met a young woman who helped show me how wrongheaded that was.
"When people ask that, it feels like defeat," Mila Loeak, a climate activist in Majuro, the capital, told me. "And I don't want to feel defeated. I don't want to entertain that question. I think people should be saying, 'What can we do to help?' instead of saying, 'When will you go?' "
I don't have all the answers.
I don't know exactly how to save the Marshall Islands.
But I know I think about the people I met there every time I start my car or turn on the air conditioner. I think of them every time I hear political bluster from climate deniers.
I know I'll never be able to ignore the stories I heard there.
"Everyone's talents and involvement are needed to redress the damage caused by human abuse of God's creation," the Pope quotes bishops in Southern Africa as saying.
That's something I'm thinking hard about.
I'd respectfully ask you to do the same.

Dirty bomb: Just how worried should we be as ISIS seeks ultimate threat?
By Matthew Moran and Christopher Hobbs
Updated 1544 GMT (2244 HKT) June 16, 2015
Rescue workers take part in a trial in 2008 in Tokyo, Japan, to improve the city's response to a "dirty bomb" attack.
Story highlights
Radioactive sources acquired by ISIS cannot be used to create a nuclear bomb
The real threat from dirty bombs lies in their psychological and economic effects
Economic costs associated with a dirty bomb would be considerable
Matthew Moran is deputy director, and Christopher Hobbs is co-director of the the Centre for Science and Security Studies at King's College London, specializing on issues related to nuclear proliferation and security. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.
(CNN)
Last week, the news emerged that ISIS terrorists have reportedly obtained radioactive materials from hospitals and research facilities captured in Iraq with a view to developing a radioactive "dirty bomb."
Unsurprisingly, the prospect of ISIS dabbling with unconventional weapons has been greeted with considerable concern. The Iraqi government has appealed to the United Nations for international help to "stave off the threat" in this regard and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently acknowledged that NATO countries are deeply concerned by the situation.
But what can ISIS actually do with these newly acquired radioactive materials? What is the nature of the threat?
First off, it is important to emphasize that radioactive sources of the type acquired by ISIS cannot be used to create a nuclear bomb. These sources are mostly used for medical research and treatments such as radiotherapy, and are completely unsuited to the development of nuclear weapons.
This said, the harmful effects of these sources, stemming from their chemical toxicity and radioactive properties, can be exploited in other ways. If inhaled or ingested, for example, these materials can be lethal. This was evidenced by the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, when just a fraction of a gram of radioactive polonium proved enough to kill the former KGB officer.
Fortunately, achieving this type of internal exposure on a large scale would prove enormously challenging for a terrorist group. Consequently, attention has focused on the use of these materials by ISIS in a dirty bomb.
Combining radioactive materials with conventional explosives, this is a bomb with an edge. A dirty bomb would spread radioactive materials, contaminating the local area and any individuals in the nearby vicinity. Crucially, however, this contamination would be mostly external in nature and, if the attack was promptly identified as being radioactive, decontamination of individuals would be a relatively straightforward process. The exposure time of anyone affected would be limited and the negative health effects mitigated.
Indeed, with a dirty bomb, members of the public are more likely to be harmed by the impact of the conventional explosives than that of the radioactive materials.
This point was borne out by a series of tests conducted over a four-year period by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in the Negev Desert. As part of this project - details of which were recently published by Haaretz -- some 20 devices laced with radioactive materials were detonated and their effects observed. The IDF concluded that a dirty bomb attack poses little physical danger beyond the conventional blast.

The real threat from dirty bombs lies in their psychological and economic effects -- a fact that often sees these devices described as weapons of mass disruption rather than weapons of mass destruction.
From a psychological perspective, for example, nuclear weapons are associated with death and destruction on an enormous scale, and dirty bombs benefit from association with these more sophisticated weapons simply because they incorporate radioactive materials.
There is an important distinction to be made between nuclear and radiological materials but this is often lost in media reports and commentary on these issues. In any case, a dirty bomb detonated in a major urban center would be sure to cause widespread fear and panic.
The economic costs associated with a dirty bomb would also be considerable. A 2011 Congressional Research Service report , for example, suggested that the clean-up after such an attack could figure in the billions of dollars, if detonated in a high-value area such as city center or port. Little wonder, then, that the security of radiological sources has emerged as a politically salient issue in recent years.
Ultimately, while the thought of ISIS using dirty bombs to further its terrorist agenda is unsettling, the threat should not be exaggerated, particularly when it comes to its impact on public health. These are not the nuclear weapons that ISIS supposedly desires , and will do nothing to further the group's ambitions in this regard.

Zainab Hawa Bangura is the United Nations special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict and serves as the United Nations' spokesperson and political advocate on conflict-related sexual violence. The views expressed are her own.

Nothing prepared me for what I saw and heard when I visited refugees from the conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
As I traveled to Iraq and Syria, and to neighboring countries of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to meet with refugees and displaced women, I heard firsthand the horrifying stories of how they have been targeted in this conflict.
I was told, for example, how mothers with babies were separated out by members of ISIL (also known as ISIS) because it is the younger women who they want to take. I heard how these younger women are examined to see if they are virgins, and how the younger and prettier they are, the more likely they are to get taken to ISIL's headquarters in Raqqa. And I heard how the rest are taken to open markets, where they will end up being auctioned after being examined like cattle.
I was in the Middle East as the special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict, and while I had been monitoring the situation since the crisis began, this was the first time I was able to visit those who have been disproportionately affected by the conflict.
Zainab Hawa Bangura
The refugees and displaced women and girls I met told me how sexual violence is being committed strategically, in a systematic manner, and with a high degree of sophistication by most of the parties to the conflicts. Indeed, as I moved from country to country, I came to the terrible conclusion that this is in essence a war on women and girls, a group that finds itself under assault every day, and every step of the way, whether it be in areas of active conflict, those under control of armed actors, or at checkpoints and border crossings.
But while it is true that most parties to the conflict are committing sexual violence, it is extremist groups like ISIL that have been particularly public and shameless in institutionalizing sexual violence and engaging in the brutalization of women and girls as a tactic of terror to advance their key strategic objectives.
ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK
For a start, it is clear that ISIL has been working to increase recruitment by promising male fighters access to women and girls. In addition, the group has been raising funds through the sale of women and girls in slave markets and through ransoms paid by relatives. And the group has also been using sexual violence to displace populations, while also using the threat of sexual violence to extract information for intelligence purposes.
Women and girls I spoke with described being treated as property to be owned and traded, or else as vessels for producing children for fighters. In ISIL strongholds in Syria and Iraq, Raqqa and Mosul, women and girls are held in houses and buildings before they are inspected, selected and sold in "bazaars" where prices can be negotiated. Simply put, we have been witnessing the revival of the slave trade in the 21st century.
What can and should we do? Such extreme violence requires political and security responses, but also legal and social response.
For a start, all parties to the conflicts, both state and nonstate actors, have an obligation under international humanitarian law to prevent and punish such crimes. Second, U.N. agencies need greater support to be able to provide the necessary assistance and to be able to respond to the needs of the affected population, particularly women and girls who are suffering even in the places where they are seeking refuge. The reality is that the humanitarian appeals dealing with the provision of services to sexual violence survivors are underfunded, and neighboring countries are now also under tremendous pressure. Greater support is therefore needed not only for programs for refugees, but also to support host communities of neighboring countries that have absorbed an estimated 80% of the refugees.
'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS
To address the transnational nature of ISIL, and the cross-border dimensions of the conflicts raging in the region, a concerted regional and international response is required, including improved information sharing across countries and a common counterterrorism response with women's protection and empowerment at its heart.
Such a response should also look at the root causes of violent extremism, something that we cannot ignore any longer. Preventing abuses will require deeper engagement with communities, including with traditional and religious leaders who can help break the silence surrounding sexual violence and ensure that it is the perpetrators who are shamed and stigmatized, not the victims. In fact, if there was a glimmer of hope during my visit, it was the statement issued by the supreme spiritual leader of the Yazidi community, who said that women and girls released from ISIL captivity should be embraced and reintegrated by their families and communities. Countering ISIL's violent ideology will mean accepting these women and girls -- and any children they may have -- in a spirit of tolerance, dignity and respect.
Ultimately, we cannot beat ISIL without understanding who they are, where they come from, and what their ideology is. The group presents a very formidable enemy, one that we must fight together.

Sexual politics and the Mideast: Does the Arab Spring need a Summer of Love?

Sex is bound up in shame for many in Mideast -- particularly women, says Shereen El Feki
El Feki: Cairo comedian's humorous take on sex is a welcome development
El Feki: Change will come slowly -- evolution, not revolution, is what's needed
Shereen El Feki is the author of "Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World," a study of changing sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Got a question for Shereen? Let us know in the comments -- we'll answer some of the best ones Thursday on Connect the World at 11:00 a.m. ET.
Cairo, Egypt (CNN)
In a packed Cairo theater a couple of months ago, Ali Qandil brought down the house.
"Why do Egyptian fathers cry at their daughters' weddings?" the comedian asked the crowd. "Because they know their little girls will be having sex for the first time."
In Egypt's current conservative climate, Qandil's well-aimed thrust at sexual taboos was enough to send the audience into stitches, even as the theater management reached for its smelling salts.
The show was courtesy of Al-Hubb Thaqafa ("Love is Culture"), a groundbreaking social media platform offering straight talk on love, sex and relationships in Arabic. Launched just over a year ago, its website, YouTube channel and social feeds have attracted more than nine million visitors, mainly from Egypt and Morocco.
Al-Hubb Thaqafa's no-nonsense approach to sex, offering accurate information on everything from the basic facts of life to the finer points of fellatio, is a welcome development in a region where teachers are often too embarrassed to communicate even the barebones sexual and reproductive curriculum on offer, and parents generally draw a veil of silence over such topics with their kids.
For Ali Qandil, sex is an endless source of humor -- just as it is anywhere else in the world. But on the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region.
In recent weeks, accounts of the arrest and abuse of dozens of gay men and transsexual women in Egypt, or mass sexual exploitation under ISIS' reign of terror, or Morocco's recent ban on a new film which lays bare the country's thriving sex trade, do little to dispel the image of societies mired in sexual repression.
But by emphasizing sex as a pleasure to be enjoyed, rather than a problem to be solved, Al-Hubb Thaqafa hearkens to a long tradition of free and frank exchange on sexual matters in Arabic. Short of cybersex and internet porn, there isn't much its platforms tackle that our forefathers from weren't writing about more than a millennium ago.

There is nothing un-Islamic about talking about sex; indeed, many of the great works of Arabic erotica were written by religious scholars.  But over the centuries, and in particular in recent decades with rise of Islamic fundamentalism, societies across the Arab region have become far less comfortable in their sexual skin.
Al-Hubb Thaqafa offers a chance (in part by reclaiming Arabic as a language of sexuality and offering a "respectable" alternative to street slang) for men and women to talk each other about sex -- asking questions, sharing personal experiences and contesting each other's opinions without the usual embarrassment or censure.
Such opportunities are all too rare offline. It's been two years since I published "Sex and the Citadel" -- a five-year investigation into sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region, and their intersection with politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations. Since then, the grand political aspirations which fed the Arab Spring have either frosted over, as in Egypt, or burnt up in the conflagration now consuming Libya, Yemen and Syria.
Sex might seem an odd focus these days, given all the other pressing issues in the region. But it is never far from politics, as authoritarian powers -- be they military-backed presidents or religious extremists -- know only too well, using matters of flesh, wrapped in selective interpretations of Islam, to clamp down on their communities.
This is sadly true beyond the borders of the Middle East as well. But the converse also holds. Realizing the rallying cries of the recent uprisings -- "freedom", "justice" and "dignity" -- in private life will, in the long run, have profound implications for public life as well.
When it comes to sex, it is never black and white, as conservatives would have us believe. In this, as with so many other aspects of life, there are at least 50 shades of gray.
On my travels, I've met men and women across the Arab region who are exploring that spectrum. Doctors like Chafik Chraibi, a Moroccan obstetrician whose efforts to open up his country's restrictive abortion laws have helped to catalyze a recent small step in legal reform. Educators like Safa Tamish, a Palestinian living in Israel, who is working to get sex education into schools and families across the West Bank. Or activists like the founders of Chouf and Damj , two new Tunisian NGOS, which are among the dozens of groups across the region trying to find a place for men and women whose sexualities or gender identities break the mold.
There are many, many more such initiatives -- combating sexual violence, or securing the rights of unwed mothers or providing sexual health services to unmarried youth, for example -- springing up across the Middle East, often on very rocky ground. The most successful work slowly, along the grain of religion and culture.
Confrontation -- be it political protests in Tahrir Square or Femen -style baring of breasts -- is not the way to achieve tangible, durable change in the Arab region, as recent events have clearly demonstrated.
For too many -- particularly women -- sex is still bound up in shame, which makes it a powerful tool of political and social control. Sexual freedoms are hard to exercise when family interests trump individual choice, or when appearance counts for more than reality -- when virginity is defined by a piece of anatomy -- an intact hymen -- rather than a state of chastity, or when prostitution masquerades as marriage between wealthy visitors and desperate refugees.
Shifting the political, economic and social conditions which underpin these realities is the work of a generation at least. But at least in a few places, positive change is slowly taking root. As my Egyptian grandmother used to say, "If there were seeds for patience, I would have planted fields." In other words, what we need is a sexual evolution, not revolution.

        <MainBody>Refugees flood into Turkey as Kurds attack ISIS 02:01
Story highlights
A Kurdish group is battling ISIS for control of Tal Abyad, on the border with Turkey
Frida Ghitis say the world should do what it can to assist Kurds
Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.
(CNN)
The images are heartrending : Desperate families fleeing fighting, frantically trying to get their small children across the barbed wire fence separating Syria from Turkey. On the other side of the fence are bearded fighters from the self-styled Islamic State armed with machine guns and smiling coldly as they patrol thousands of civilians trapped on the Syrian side. The gunmen have reportedly been forcing those trying to flee to return to their homes in the war zone.
But while the border is where the cameras are, more pivotal events are taking place a few miles away, where ISIS is on the verge of suffering a potentially devastating loss -- the strategic city Tal Abyad and its surrounding areas. The defeat appears poised to come at the hands of the YPG, the Kurdish People's Protection Units, whose fighters, men and women, a few months ago liberated the devastated city of Kobani.
Frida Ghitis
Now, with air support from the U.S.-led coalition, they are preparing to deal a significant blow to ISIS. According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Kurds have already taken back from ISIS some 50 towns and villages . Meanwhile, Turkish officials say about 20,000 villagers , fearing getting trapped in the intensifying battles, are trying to cross into Turkey.
If the Kurds take Tal Abyad, as seems likely, they will cut off a key supply route into the ISIS "capital" in Syria, Raqqa. If you look at a map of the region, you can see why this is so significant -- Raqqa is the strongest of ISIS strongholds, meaning that if it weakens, ISIS will become considerably more vulnerable.
This crucial battle, at a time when the United States is struggling to find a way forward against ISIS in Iraq, comes loaded with useful messages for Washington. Some key points:
1. It is possible to beat ISIS without strengthening the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Almost four years ago, President Barack Obama and European allies declared that "Assad must go." But as the opposition to al-Assad's rule morphed from a pro-democracy movement into an increasingly radical Islamist insurgency, Washington viewed Syria as offering only bad choices -- an al-Assad dictatorship or radical Islamist rule.
It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, as moderate rebels were left with little material support and slowly wilted. Extremists grew stronger, and al-Assad became even more brutal, using chemical weapons and barrel bombs in a war that has killed more than 200,000 people . It seemed as if no positive outcome was conceivable.
But now Kurdish forces are advancing, helped by U.S. bombings and the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army, showing that it is possible to push against ISIS without helping al-Assad.
2. Success will breed success and help unify the opposition.
One reason moderates have ended up so weak is that extremists, well-armed and financed, kept winning battle after battle. Nothing begets success like success. Many of the fighters who back Islamist groups do so only because they view them as likely victors in the battle against al-Assad. If the Kurds and other secular forces start winning battles, more fighters will be drawn to their side.
If the Kurds and their Free Syrian Army backers can win against ISIS and keep fighting, with U.S. and European support, against al-Assad, then there is a chance that the Syrian war could ultimately be brought to an end and create a pluralistic, moderate regime, which is what history tells us the Syrian people would prefer.
3. Another important message contained in the events of the past few days is that the United States can play a major role in defeating ISIS without flooding the battlefield and committing boots-on-the-ground.
But ultimately a political solution is needed.
The Kurds, legendarily fierce fighters, have proved themselves time and again. With strong U.S. support from the air and U.S.-provided arms, they could win. Nobody will fight harder to protect Kurdish territory than the Kurds. That is true in Syria and in Iraq.
Yet while ending the war in Syria and Iraq will require battlefield victories, more than anything it will require political change. In Iraq, Sunnis will not take on ISIS with all their might if they think it will only leave them under the heel of a sectarian government interested only in protecting the Shiites. In Syria, the fight against ISIS will not succeed unless the majority of the people believe there is a way to get rid of al-Assad.
4. Turkey's motivations will prove confusing, at best.
The Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has two goals: to see the end of the al-Assad regime and to prevent the Kurds from growing stronger. Turkey has received millions of Syrian refugees, but it also stood by while Kurds were killed in Koban i and has shown little enthusiasm for Kurdish victories. It sees the YPG as an extension of violent Kurdish separatists in Turkey. And armed Kurds, winning battles against ISIS, spark fears that their battle will pivot to establishing their own country.
5. A final, dispiriting lesson is that civilians will become caught up in the fighting, their suffering exploited for political and tactical gain.
Turkey has at times tried to prevent civilians from entering .  Others accused the Kurds of "ethnic cleansing" Arabs. But refugees, including Arabs, reportedly cheered news of Kurdish victories.
So, back to those images of ISIS fighters laughing from the Syrian side of the border? Why were they herding villagers back to the battlefield? One theory is that ISIS wanted them back so they could be used as human shields and prevent the United States from carrying out more bombing raids against ISIS.
Regardless, for the Syrian people, the suffering continues even as Kurdish fighters continue to make gains. Just one more reason for the rest of the world to do what it can to find a way to bring an end to this terrible war.

Is this the beginning of the end of child marriage?

Today marks the Day of the African Child. This day was created by the African Union to commemorate a tragedy -- the massacre of hundreds of children in Soweto, South Africa who were demonstrating for the basic right to a decent education. Since then, the day has been used as an opportunity to focus a global spotlight on the injustices African children face, and on the actions we all need to take to ensure they can realize their rights.
Lakshmi Sundaram is the executive director at Girls Not Brides.
This year, the theme for the day is ending child marriage in Africa, and it represents a timely call to end a practice that devastates the lives of millions of girls across the continent.
We have seen promising positive commitments from the African Union and African leaders on the issue. We have also seen civil society mobilizing across the continent especially in reaching out to the communities where child marriage is prevalent. Many use the Girls Not Brides global network to amplify their voices and share lessons of what works in curbing this practice.
This is crucial work since in sub-Saharan Africa, 40% of women are married as children, according to UNICEF . These girls are married off before they are physically or emotionally mature enough to become wives or mothers. Child marriage is an issue which affects girls in almost every country on the continent to a greater or lesser extent -- ten of the fifteen countries worldwide with the highest rates of child marriage are in Africa. In Niger, for example, as many as 76% of girls are married before they reach the age of 18; in Chad and the Central African Republic, it is 68%.
Child marriage robs girls of their education, their health and their future. Over 60% of child brides in Africa have received no formal education whatsoever, and girls who give birth under the age of 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women who have children in their early 20s.
Without major progress on this issue, the number of child brides will double by 2050 and child marriage will continue to hamper Africa's development. In fact, the persistence of child marriage has hindered Africa's efforts to achieve six of the eight Millennium Development Goals. That's why it is so crucial that we tackle child marriage head on in the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This week, the African Union is hosting a summit at which we hope African Heads of State will adopt a common African position on child marriage. Along with the SDGs, this represents a significant opportunity to ensure that commitments are quickly turned into practical national strategies and action plans that are comprehensive, well-resourced and involve all relevant actors including civil society so that the next generation of African girls can embrace a brighter, better future free from the shadow of child marriage.

(CNN)
In April this year, in the wake of the deaths of an American, Warren Weinstein, and an Italian, Giovanni Lo Porto, in a U.S. counterterrorism operation, U.S. President Barack Obama made an historic announcement , in which he said the following: "I take full responsibility for all our counterterrorism operations, including the one that inadvertently took the lives of Warren and Giovanni.
"I profoundly regret what happened," Obama continued. "On behalf of the United States government, I offer our deepest apologies to the families ... I directed that the existence of this operation be declassified and disclosed publicly.  I did so because the Weinstein and Lo Porto families deserve to know the truth.  And I did so because even as certain aspects of our national security efforts have to remain secret in order to succeed, the United States is a democracy committed to openness in good times and in bad."
Faisal bin ali al Jaber
President Obama was admitting to killing two innocents in one of his drone strikes. Never before had he apologized for an attack.
Like a lot of Americans, my family and I watched the President's speech at home. But while many praised him for his forthrightness, we do not share that view. His speech shocked us. No, it was worse: his speech broke our hearts.
As I watched, I thought of my dead relatives, names that so far as I know have never crossed the President's lips: Waleed and Salem bin Ali Jaber. A little over two years ago my family and I were forced to collect their remains after a drone attack on our hometown of Khashamir killed them both.
Like Warren and Giovanni, Salem and Waleed were innocent. America was not their enemy. Waleed, a young policeman, kept our townspeople safe. Salem, my brother-in-law, had preached a sermon against al Qaeda's hateful ideology just days before the U.S. killed him.
Waleed bin Ali Jaber
I will never forget the moment I saw what was left of Salem and Waleed. The drone left them almost unrecognizable. We identified them from their clothes and scraps of matted hair. Khashamir was not a war zone. It was a quiet town until Obama sent in his drones. The strike hit near the wedding celebration of my eldest son. After we buried the dead, we started to ask questions. How did this happen? Why?
A year and a half ago I traveled 7,000 miles to America seeking answers, and hoping for an apology. But the President's response to my questions was a wall of silence. It seems the Obama Administration has known for years how Salem and Waleed died, and what a terrible mistake it was. Yet the President refuses to admit it.
Instead of an official apology, a few months after my visit, members of my family were handed $100,000 in sequentially-marked U.S. dollars in a plastic bag. A Yemeni security service official was given the unpleasant task of handing this over. I looked him in the eye and asked how this was acceptable, and whether he would admit the money came from America.  He shrugged and said: "Can't tell you. Take the money."
What is the value of a human life? The secret payment to my family represents a fraction of the cost of the operation that killed them. This seems to be the Obama administration's cold calculation: Yemeni lives are cheap. They cost the President no political or moral capital.
Salem Ahmed bin Ali Jaber
This is short-sighted and wrong. Salem preached again and again that violence was not the answer. After his death, I sought to follow his example. But how can I persuade the younger generation to seek peaceful change when the message from the U.S. President was, and is, that the slain innocents of Yemen will go unnoticed and unmourned?
To the families of Giovanni Lo Porto and Warren Weinstein I offer my empathy and my heartfelt condolences. I know that Obama's apology by press conference does nothing to bring back their loved ones. I know their hearts are rent. Like mine, I know they always will be. But to those safe at home who have not suffered our losses, I ask you to remember not just Lo Porto and Weinstein, but also the hundreds of innocent Yemenis -- largely nameless to the U.S. public -- who have suffered the same fate.
Imagine that your loved one was wrongly killed by the U.S. government, and the White House would not apologize. Imagine they would not even admit their role in the death of your family members.

May 14, 2010  A turbulent period for FIFA began in May 2010 when the world's governing body for soccer was presented with official bid documents by Australia, England, Netherlands/Belgium, Japan, South Korea, Qatar, Russia, Spain/Portugal and the United States for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. During the ceremony at its Swiss headquarters, FIFA announced dates for inspections of the bidding nations from July-September.

November 18, 2010  FIFA's Ethics Committee confirms the suspension of six FIFA officials including executive committee members Amos Adamu (pictured) and Reynald Temarii, after claims by Britain's Sunday Times newspaper that they offered to sell their World Cup votes. Adamu receives a three-year ban and $11,947 fine and Temarii a 12-month ban and a $5,973 fine. The committee also rules that there is no evidence to support allegations of collusion between rival bid teams. Both Adamu and Temarii appeal unsuccessfully to FIFA's Appeal Committee and Adamu later also files an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In May 2015, FIFA bans Temarii for another eight years for allegedly accepting money from former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam to cover legal costs of his appeal of FIFA's 2010 ban.

November 29, 2010  Issa Hayatou from Cameroon (pictured) is one of three FIFA officials -- the others Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay and Ricardo Teixeira from Brazil -- who are named in a BBC program which alleges they took bribes from the International Sports and Leisure (ISL) marketing company who secured World Cup rights in the 1990s. A day later, Hayatou says he is considering legal action against the BBC. All three would have voted on the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The International Olympic Committee's Ethics Commission later looks into the claims against Hayatou -- as he was an IOC member. It finds he had personally received a sum of money from ISL as a donation to finance the African Football Confederation (CAF)'s 40th anniversary and recommends he be reprimanded. In 2013, an internal investigation finds Leoz and Teixeira accepted illegal payments from ISL but says the acceptance of bribe money was not punishable under Swiss law at the time. Its report says that as both have resigned their positions with FIFA further steps over "the morally and ethically reproachable conduct of both persons" are superfluous.

December 2, 2010  The winning bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals are announced. Russia wins the bid to host the 2018 tournament. But the big shock came when Blatter announced that Qatar would host the 2022 finals, despite FIFA's bid inspection report stating that hosting the World Cup in June and July would be "considered as a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken."

May 10, 2011  Just a few weeks before FIFA's presidential vote, former English Football Association chairman David Triesman testifies at a UK parliamentary enquiry into England's failed 2018 bid. Under the cover of parliamentary privilege, Triesman accuses FIFA Executive Committee members Jack Warner, Nicolas Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi of trying to secure cash and privileges in return for their vote. In other evidence submitted to the committee from the Sunday Times, it was alleged that FIFA vice-president Issa Hayatou along with fellow Executive Committee member Jacques Anouma has been paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar as the 2022 World Cup host. All those accused, and the Qatar Football Association, strenuously deny the allegations.

May 26, 2011  FIFA announces it will investigate Jack Warner (pictured), who ran the CONCACAF federation covering Central and North America, and Mohamed Bin Hammam, head of the Asian Football Confederation, over bribery allegations. It follows a report by fellow Executive Committee member Chuck Blazer alleging that they paid $40,000 worth of bribes to secure the support of members of the Caribbean Football Union.  They deny the claims, with Warner promising a "tsunami" of revelations to clear his name. Bin Hammam claims the accusations are part of a plan to force him to withdraw as a candidate for FIFA's presidency. He is incumbent Sepp Blatter's only opponent in FIFA's presidential election due to be held June 1.

May 29, 2011  But FIFA's Ethics Committee upholds the complaints against Mohamed Bin Hammam (pictured) and Jack Warner. Bin Hammam is effectively barred from standing in the FIFA leadership election. Warner's tsunami turns out to be an email, where secretary general Jerome Valcke seems to suggest that Qatar "bought" the right to host the 2022 World Cup. After initially threatening legal action, Qatar withdraws its complaint when Valcke explains he was referring to Qatar's large, and legal, campaign budget, rather than bribes. Warner faces no further action following his resignation and the presumption of innocence remains.

Frida Ghitis: The legal case against FIFA is not just about sport, it's about taking on corruption
Ghitis: Corruption is one of those evils that does its work quietly, managing to dodge attention
Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN)
If you think FIFA is all about sport, you're missing the most important and potentially transformative campaign to uncover and punish the misdeeds of people who use soccer as a way to enrich themselves and their friends.
The news that FIFA ber-boss Sepp Blatter has agreed to step down is much overdue. So is the announcement of the U.S. Justice Department indictments against top officials and FIFA business partners.
If the case against FIFA is pursued with relentlessness, it will go a long way in uprooting one of the most pernicious, destructive practices corroding our world. While the headlines normally focus on uncommon "man bites dog" events, corruption is one of those evils that does its work quietly, making itself routine and accepted, so it almost always manages to succeed at dodging attention.
Frida Ghitis
But graft, bribery and extortion create unimaginable devastation for individuals, societies, nations and even the environment. Corruption perpetuates poverty, destroys businesses, makes a mockery of democracy and saps people's faith in their justice system and government. In places where it is rampant, it poisons human interactions, undercuts sound decision-making and creates cynicism and mistrust.
It is not an exaggeration to say corruption helps open the city gates to extremists who bathe themselves in the promise of religious piety as a way to eradicate dirty politicians.
Corruption acts as a reverse Robin Hood, with the poor squeezed to pay the rich. And the rich, too, get squeezed to satisfy the greedy. Corruption hurts everyone, and combating it deserves a high place on the list of global priorities.
Going after FIFA is a fine place to start. As Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, corruption at FIFA is "rampant, systemic and deep-rooted." If the combined power of law enforcement agencies in the hundreds of countries where FIFA does business cannot tackle its outrageous deeds, what hope is there for attacking the daily destructive acts that affect millions of people around the world?
Corruption kills more people than ISIS when its practitioners divert needed funds from health care and economic development, or by making safety inspectors look the other way in exchange for a bribe. It keeps people in poverty, prevents economies from prospering and hollows the essence of democracy when elected officials act for their own benefit instead of the well-being of the people they represent.
FIFA is a perfect place for crooks. It is little wonder that dictators love doing business with it.
It has long been an open secret that votes are bought and sold; decisions are made on the basis of maximizing personal gains and private agendas. In the end, the results are often grotesque and nonsensical. That's what happens when corruption takes over.
Sports events such as the World Cup and the Olympics (Olympic officials should be getting nervous) have become trophies for tyrants, not only allowing them to display their might but by allowing them to play with massive amounts of money, some of which are disbursed in patronage deals to make key people wealthy and thereby ensuring support for the mighty.
What ends up happening is that billions in taxpayers' money -- money that comes partly from the poor and middle class -- goes to building white elephants , giant stadiums that stand decrepit and unused after the events. Money that is urgently needed to build hospitals and schools to pay for teachers and doctors goes instead to construction firms, bribes and crooks.
When FIFA officials voted 15 years ago to let the desert emirate of Qatar host the 2022 World Cup, there was only one conceivable explanation for the bizarre choice. Charges that the super-wealthy Qataris "bought" the tournament came almost immediately. Qatar and FIFA denied it, but rumors only intensified. Qatar is one of the worst possible places to hold the summer event. Temperatures routinely go above 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and the population is not particularly passionate about soccer.
Even worse, most of the work in the emirate is done by "guest" workers, and human rights advocates say thousands of them are dying in brutal temperatures and tough working conditions as they build the venues. As new information comes to light about the millions of dollars that changed hands in the selection process, Qatar may end up losing the 2022 tournament.
Then there's Russia, preparing to host the 2018 World Cup after last year's Sochi Games. Sochi was Vladimir Putin's big show just as he prepared to invade Ukraine and illegally seize Crimea. The games cost more than $50 billion -- more than any before. Sochi was an odd choice -- the Winter Games were held in a subtropical location. It was an awkward international performance for the Russian strongman, and a reminder of how major sporting events create a platform for domestic political propaganda. Most Russians were proud of their country and President. But on the global stage the glory was short-lived and stolen by events in Ukraine.
Anti-corruption activists detailed the billions of dollars that "disappeared" in the Sochi budget. Among the critics was Boris Nemtsov, who produced evidence of $30 billion in stolen funds, calling the games a " monstrous scam ." Nemtsov was killed in front of the Kremlin a few months later.
The legal case against FIFA is just beginning to unfold. The stakes are high. Just ask people in Latin America, now rising up in several countries against corruption, what the FIFA case means to them. Ask people of Nigeria what corruption does to their daily lives. Ask the widows of activists who have lost their loved ones in the fight. Ask the families of last year's South Korean ferry disaster -- another result of corruption .
If FIFA gets a thorough scrubbing, it would give new impetus to the war against corruption.

        <MainBody>New Zealand's most notorious gang
By Sara Khan and Neda Farshbaf, CNN

New Zealand's most notorious gang 7 photos
These haunting portraits by photographer Jono Rotman offer a close look at the largest gang in New Zealand, the Mongrel Mob.  After coordinating with a gang liaison, Rotman met mob members and gained unprecedented access to them. He took these portraits inside their homes from 2008 to 2014.

New Zealand's most notorious gang 7 photos
The Mongrel Mob started in the 1960s. Its members are known for their extensive tattoos and for wearing an emblem of a British bulldog with a Nazi helmet on their jackets and helmets. Most members are predominantly Maori people, the indigenous population of New Zealand.

The Mob appropriated Nazi party symbolism as their own but they are not white supremacists, Rotman said. "That Nazi iconography is a firm part of their identity and it's got nothing to do with white supremacy," Rotman told CNN. "The fathers and grandfathers of a lot of those guys brought back war booty from fighting the Germans, so there were a lot of swastikas and Nazi helmets lying around in attics and basements."

One of Rotman's subjects shared his grandfather's reasoning for choosing the swastika. "(He told me,) 'You think you're the master race? Well, I'll take your skin and put it on. Now who is the master race?' "

The Mongrel Mob Portraits, which debuted at City Gallery in Wellington in 2014, were criticized for glorifying gang culture . The series included this picture of convicted killer Shane Harrison . "The uproar seems to be more about the idea that you're not allowed to show these people in a respectful way," Rotman said. "It's like they should only be shown in a gritty documentary or in police mug shots."

The New Zealand-born and San Francisco-based photographer says he didn't ask his subjects to pose. "Other than perhaps occasionally saying 'Face me directly' or 'Turn to the side a bit,' they tend to just sit how they are. It just so happens that they have a certain gravitas," Rotman said. "I haven't done makeup. I haven't done Photoshop. I've just taken a backdrop, a camera and photographed what existed."

After dedicating the last eight years to this project, Rotman wants viewers to know he was not attempting to spin a narrative. "It's not actually about the Mob," he says. "It's more an effort to present these people so that the images speak for themselves. It is for the faces to reveal stories about the person, rather than for me to translate their story, which is not mine to tell."

Photographer Raphael Fournier visited the oil-rich Xinjiang province of western China
The region has experienced cultural tensions and unrest
(CNN)
Understanding a person means understanding the surrounding context, which is why Raphael Fournier captures both with his camera lens.
"When I take pictures I am intending to document peoples' lives in connection with their environment," Fournier said. "I am often fascinated by people -- they are my very first focus -- and then I like to show them inside of their privacy."
This creative trend continues in "Around Taklamakan," a series from China's Xinjiang province. The Taklamakan Desert is located in the region and helped nearby towns thrive many centuries ago as merchants formed routes around it. Fournier's photographs emphasize the cultural tensions there, a factor of special importance for Xinjiang's citizens.
In one photograph -- No. 9 in the gallery above -- the modernized section of Kashgar stands in the distance as a young woman moves through the historic side of the city. The bright lights that loom in the distance present the incoming cultures in contrast to the ancient area.

In another photo, a sheep lies dead in the street. It was killed "halal," a way permissible by Islam. Muslims are the religious majority in the region, but a minority in greater China.
Both pictures highlight factors that have caused unrest in Xinjiang. The province was contested among Mongols and Turkic groups before coming under Chinese rule in the 18th century. It has grown more prized since, as the region is rich in oil and minerals.
Recently, the Turkic-speaking Uyghurs of the province have protested Chinese rule as they become a minority group to the immigrating Han Chinese. These immigrants are coming for jobs and bring traditional Chinese culture with them from the east.
The Chinese government has allegedly issued restrictions on practicing Islam in Xinjiang, causing unrest among the Uyghurs.
Detailing the oppression has proven difficult. Journalists are rarely granted access to the territory. This fact caught Fournier's attention.
Social media
Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.
"Stories produced in the area are not common," he said. "So I felt like going there and checking it out myself."
One afternoon in the city of Aksu, Fournier was arrested because police suspected him to be a journalist. Fournier had been photographing a military tank in the main square. Police searched his belongings, unable to prove his motive for taking pictures. After being transported outside the city, he was asked to delete the photographs of the tank.
Photography has not always been Fournier's passion. While "Around Taklamakan" was photographed in March, he first visited Xinjiang in 2002. Arriving as a French language teacher, Fournier became especially interested in photography after interning for Time magazine's photo department in Hong Kong in 2008.
He has since traveled to the Middle East, where he photographed the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, protests in Taksim Square and Syrian refugees in Turkey.
"I got really lucky because during that year I spent in Turkey, the Taksim events happened and I was able to cover it entirely," he said.
While he resides in Paris, Fournier still feels a strong connection to China and Turkey. He remains motivated to visually tell the stories of marginalized populations.
"I believe my job has to be about putting the light on unfair or tricky situations in which people need exposition," he said.
Raphael Fournier is a French photographer. He is represented by Divergence and Sipa USA . You can follow him on Facebook .

Assassination of Harvey Milk  In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, making him the first openly gay person to be elected to a public office. Milk started his political ambitions in San Francisco in the early '70s, but he did not hold an office until he was appointed to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976 by Mayor George Moscone. Milk's career was tragically cut short on November 27, 1978, when he and Moscone were assassinated.

Music goes mobile  The sound barrier is broken once again in the '70s, but this time at walking speed. Sony introduces the Walkman, the first commercially successful "personal stereo." Its wearable design and lightweight headphones gave listeners the freedom to listen to music privately while out in public. The product was an instant hit. The Walkman was a mark of coolness among consumers, setting a standard for future generations of personal devices like the Apple iPod.

Magic vs. Bird  The 1979 national championship game between Michigan State and Indiana State still ranks as the most-watched college basketball game of all time, thanks to two up-and-coming superstars: Michigan State's Earvin "Magic" Johnson, bottom, and Indiana State's Larry Bird. Johnson's Spartans won the NCAA title, but the two players' rivalry was only just beginning. During their pro careers in the NBA, Bird's Boston Celtics and Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers would meet in the NBA Finals three times in the '80s.

Three Mile Island  On March 28, 1979, the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history took place in Pennsylvania when large amounts of reactor coolant and radioactive gases from the Three Mile Island power plant were released into the environment. Within days of the accident, 140,000 people evacuated their homes within a 20-mile radius of the plant. The accident brought widespread attention to reactor safety and large protests from anti-nuclear groups. Cleanup from the accident began in August 1979 and was not completed until December 1993.

SALT II  The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, otherwise known as SALT, were a series of meetings and treaties designed at limiting and keeping track of the missiles and nuclear weapons carried by the United States and the Soviet Union. The first treaty was signed in 1972, and the second one was signed in 1979. Six months after the second signing, however, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, and the United States never ratified the SALT II agreement.

An 'American Hustle'  Scandals shaped a large part of the '70s political atmosphere, and the decade ended on a big one. During a two-year investigation, the FBI set up a sting operation dubbed "Abscam," videotaping politicians accepting bribes from a phony Arabian company in return for favors. The sting resulted in the conviction of six U.S. representatives, one senator, a mayor from New Jersey and members of the Philadelphia City Council. The operation was the inspiration for David O. Russell's 2013 film "American Hustle."

In Steven Duede's compost bin, beauty exists side by side with decay. Bright-pink roses with black-rimmed petals lay next to brown-splotched bananas and cracked eggshells.
Duede, a photographer based in Boston, first took a picture of his compost bin two and a half years ago. Now, his series "Evanescence" has grown to 40 images -- all showcasing close-up shots of his backyard scraps.
The project began without any lofty ambition. Duede was simply struck by the "beautiful and very chaotic" scene in his bin and grabbed his camera.
"But as I began to view more and more images, I began to get a sense of this theme kind of growing," he said. "You can look at beautiful items up against things that are decaying or breaking away or losing their beauty, and it gives you something that's a bit more thought-provoking about our own transitory state of being."
Duede is used to transition. He spent years working as a painter and mixed-media artist before shifting to photography. The compost images, with their rich colors and varied textures, have the look and feel of a still-life painting.

"These images ... have a lot of elements I was toying with when I was a painter," he said. "When this project began, I felt a real connection to the career that I had for some 20 years previous."
"Evanescence" also expanded on themes of decay and beauty that are present in Duede's other works. In his recent "1-70 Series," Duede captured crumbling service stations along Interstate 70 between St. Louis and Kansas City. Just like "Evanescence," the series features the beauty of the things we toss away.
"I'm so incredibly drawn to those things -- things that formerly had function that are now in a state of degraded transition," he said.
Social media

Even after years of shooting, Duede said he is still surprised and inspired by the project. He rarely composes the images, instead letting the weather and the day's waste determine the shots.
"It's constantly changing," he said. "My neighbors also use the compost bin, so I don't always know what I'm going to find. So any given day I can find flora or I'll find the most disgusting rotting banana."
Duede named the series "Evanescence" to reflect the physical and thematic elements of the images. The objects in the compost bin break down into soil and vapor, creating a cycle of growth, decay and renewal that mirrors the human experience of aging and renewal.
Of course, working with compost doesn't always involve such lofty ideas -- Duede had to deal with a face full of flies first.
"Sometimes it's really gross," he said.

You might call Julia Margaret Cameron the Annie Leibovitz of the 19th century. At a time when photography was still an evolving art form and dominated by men, she was taking stunning pictures of some of the era's most notable personalities. Robert Browning, pictured here in 1865, was one of the leading poets of the Victorian era. His works include "Fra Lippo Lippi," "My Last Duchess" and "The Pied Piper of Hamelin."

Her sister was friendly with a number of writers, artists and scientists, and they agreed to pose for Cameron -- a notable undertaking in a day with bulky cameras and long exposure times.

Despite the fame of her subjects, Cameron's work didn't become well-known until the 1940s, when a book of her photos was published. George Frederic Watts, pictured here, was a painter and sculptor -- in his time, considered the greatest of Victorian English painters. This photo was taken in 1865.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson was one of the most famous of Victorian English poets. He served as poet laureate of Great Britain for 42 years. His works include "The Charge of the Light Brigade," "In Memoriam A.H.H.," the Arthurian epic "Idylls of the King" and "Crossing the Bar."

Historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle is probably best remembered these days for his history of the French Revolution, but he also wrote novels, essays and satires. His photograph was taken by Cameron in 1867. Posing for Cameron wasn't for the fainthearted; Tennyson described her subjects as "victims." But the results speak for themselves: The images are imbued with "powerful spiritual content," wrote Malcolm Daniel of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Before Arnold Schwarzenegger was the 'Terminator' 10 photos
Before he was the "Terminator" or the 38th governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger was an obsessive teen bodybuilder from Austria who saw pumping iron as a ticket to fame and fortune. Inspired by bodybuilders who found stardom on the big screen, Schwarzenegger figured out early in life that he needed titles and accolades to propel him to greatness. These photos show a 17-year-old Schwarzenegger competing in a bodybuilding competition in Graz, Austria, on May 18, 1965.

Schwarzenegger spent his teen years building and sculpting his physique, competing in weightlifting and bodybuilding competitions in his home country. At the 1965 Hotel Steirer Hof meet, he was vying for three bodybuilding titles: the provincial title of Mr. Steiermark (or Mr. Styria), Mr. Hercules and Mr. Austria.

"A connoisseur of his own story," as one biographer described, Schwarzenegger said a turning point in his aspirations came when he saw a magazine cover featuring bodybuilder Reg Park in a Hercules film. "It turned out that Hercules was an English guy who'd won the Mr. Universe title in bodybuilding and parlayed that into a movie career -- then took the money and built a gym empire," Schwarzenegger told Laurence Leamer, author of "Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger." "Bingo! I had my role model! If he could do it, I could do it. I'd win Mr. Universe. I'd become a movie star. I'd get rich."

Biographers trace the root of Schwarzenegger's ambitions to his strict childhood in Thal, a village outside Graz where he was born in 1947 to Gustav and Aurelia Schwarzenegger. Gustav was a police officer and former Nazi Party member said to favor his older brother. "Maybe I was competitive with my brother or trying to prove something to my father," Schwarzenegger told Leamer. "But it doesn't really matter. Something was there that made me hungry."

A natural athlete, Schwarzenegger started playing team sports as a child at the urging of his father. He probably would have excelled in any sport of his choosing, but he was drawn to bodybuilding because it was not a team sport. "I disliked it when we won a game and I didn't get any personal recognition," he said in his 1977 autobiography, "Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder." "The only time I really felt rewarded was when I was singled out as being best."

Schwarzenegger tried individual sports like the javelin and shot put, "but none of those things felt right to me," he said in his autobiography. Then his soccer coach brought the team to a bodybuilding gym for weight training and something "clicked," he said. "Those guys were huge and brutal. I found myself walking around them, staring at muscles I'd never even seen before. The weightlifters shone with sweat; they were powerful-looking, Herculean. And there it was before me -- my life, the answer," he said in his autobiography. "It was something I suddenly just seemed to reach out and find, as if I'd been crossing a suspended bridge and finally stepped off onto solid ground."

Two years later, he won his first Mr. Universe from the National Amateur Bodybuilders Association. The rest, as they say, is history.

(CNN)
The followers of the Baye Fall aren't your typical Muslims. They show their devotion a bit differently: with dreadlocks and reggae.
Often, members of the Baye Fall are confused for Rastafarians.
"They both have very positive vibes, which is why they look alike -- the Baye Fall and the Rasta" concedes Mamadou Lamine Seck, a follower and the lead singer in Gustou Band.
"But we don't have the same prophet. I don't believe in Rasta, but I appreciate Rasta."
The Baye Fall sect is little more than a century old, and was born out of Senegal's second largest city: Touba. Touba itself was founded in the late 19th-century by the creator of the Mouride Brotherhood -- a branch of the Sufi order of Islam. In fact, Baye Fall's founder, Sheikh Ibrahima Fall, was said to be one of the brotherhood's fiercest disciples.
Aside from the physical look of Baye Fall followers, the sect is also notable for the value it places on hard work.
"Ibrahima Fall realized and decreed that working is better than fasting and praying. That is the principle we are all still following right up to this day," says Serigne Abdoul Aziz Fall -- a Baye Fall religious chief and grandson to the founder.
To learn more about Baye Fall's followers and leader, watch the video below.

Abumbi II, the 11th fon, or king, of Bafut, Cameroon, has close to 100 wives. They weren't all his to start.  According to local tradition, when a fon dies, his successor inherits all his wives and then marries his own queens.
"The queens have a great role to play in the fondom," notes Prince Nickson, also of Bafut, noting that it is up to these women behind the man to shape him in his kingly role.
"Behind every successful man must be a very successful, staunch woman," says Abumbi's third wife, Queen Constance.
"Our tradition has it that when you are king, the elderly wives remain to hand down the tradition to the younger wives, and also to teach the king the tradition because the king had been a prince, not a king."
Despite the fact that polygamy is legal in Cameroon, the data shows that there are far fewer polygamous marriages across the African continent. The practice is being challenged by changing values, the spread of the Christian faith, the growing appeal of the western way of life but also the rising costs of having large families. It is against this backdrop that Cameroon's traditional rulers must walk the fine line between two often conflicting cultures.
"During colonialism other values came in, of governance, different from the traditional values we had and therefore there is this constant conflict between the traditional values and modern western values," admits Fon Abumbi II, who has ruled Bafut, the largest fondom in the region, for 47 years.
"My role is to blend them, to find the way forward so my subjects can enjoy the fruits of development and modernity without destroying their culture.  Without a culture, you are not a human being, you are an animal. And therefore the chieftaincy institution is the guarantor of our culture."

        <MainBody>Haitians face deportation from Dominican Republic 01:51
Story highlights
A law in the Dominican Republic offered to "regularize" undocumented immigrants
The deadline is Wednesday; tens of thousands were unable to sign up
Some fear mass deportations of migrants, the majority of whom are Haitian
(CNN)
Tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants in the Dominican Republic -- the vast majority Haitians -- face deportation as a deadline to apply for legal status looms.
The problem of what to do with thousands of workers who entered illegally from a neighboring country is not an unfamiliar one in the hemisphere. The plight of undocumented immigrants in the United States and lawmakers' failed attempts at reform come to mind.
The Dominican government tackled the issue with a "regularization plan" that offered a path to legal status for the undocumented. But critics say it was designed to fail the migrant workers.
Wednesday is the deadline for undocumented immigrants in the Dominican Republic to register under the regularization plan or face deportation.
"Those who do not have documentation will have to return to their country," Dominican Foreign Minister Andres Navarro said.
According to the government, more than 200,000 undocumented immigrants living in the Dominican Republic have registered, but at least that many others will not meet the deadline.
Claims of racial prejudice
The fact that the majority of foreigners -- documented or not -- living in the Dominican Republic are Haitian has led to accusations that there are other racial prejudices involved, too.
The immigration overhaul comes at the same time that Dominicans of Haitian descent are in a fight over their status. A 2013 court ruling stripped the citizenship of Dominicans whose parents were undocumented immigrants. A separate law to address their status is equally controversial.
Human rights groups fear mass deportations.
The regularization law states its purpose is to "provide a window of opportunity" for undocumented workers to contribute without living in the shadows and to reap the benefits of legal protections offered by the government.
Some Dominicans suddenly outsiders in their own country
But to hear it in immigrants' own words, those words don't correspond with their experience.
"Today is my 15th day here, and I still have not been able to get my documents," Haitian immigrant Ruben Renoir told CNN en Espaol as he waited in a line to apply for legal status.
Another immigrant shared a similar story: "I came here with my birth certificate to apply because I knew that there were going to be problems, but they still haven't processed me," Melizo Pierre said.
A problem with documentation
To human rights observers, this is not surprising.
Many of the undocumented workers in the Dominican Republic lack valid passports or other identification documents from their home countries.
Some 96% of those who have applied for regularization don't have passports, Angelita Baeyens, programs director at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, told CNN.
Another requirement is for employers to provide the undocumented workers with a certificate, something that many are refusing to do, Baeyens said.
Haitian officials, meanwhile, are preparing for an influx of deportees as the deadline passes.
At least two repatriation centers have been opened on the border between the two countries to process the Haitians who are sent back from the Dominican Republic.
The deadline also worries some people who were born in the Dominican Republic. While there is separate legislation to deal with Dominicans who were stripped of their citizenship, those Dominicans born to Haitian immigrants but not registered in the civil registry fear being swept up in deportation raids.
CNN's Mariano Castillo reported and wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN en Espaol's Diulka Perez reported from the Dominican-Haitian border.

By the look of the photographs, Vidal had a very lucky escape after he was involved in the crash Tuesday.
One side of Vidal's red shining Ferrari has almost been completely ripped away.
Follow @cnnsport
Multiple media reports quote the Chilean National Police, and prosecutors, as saying that the football star had been under the influence of alcohol, and was at fault for the crash.
After a court hearing Wednesday, a judge ruled the 28-year-old Vidal will have his license withheld and will need to report monthly to the Chilean consulate in Milan, while the investigation into the crash will go on for 120 days, the Chilean judicial system confirmed.

Arturo Vidal played for Juventus in the European Champions League final.
In a YouTube video posted on his Twitter account, the Chile midfielder, who plays for Italian club Juventus, confirmed he had been involved in a collision and said nobody had been injured and that it, "wasn't his fault."
Vidal added, "I'm fine, my family is fine. Thank you for everything."
But that's unlikely to be end of the matter.
Estoy bien, saludos a todos y gracias por su preocupacion! http://t.co/MyI3z8vHU7

The Chile national police was not immediately available for comment when CNN contacted them, but Police reportedly say he was impaired.
The Hospital San Luis de Buin confirmed to CNN that Vidal had been there but would not disclose the nature of his injuries.
"The driver of the red vehicle was under the influence of alcohol," the Chilean national police chief Colonel Ricardo Gonzalez was quoted as telling a number of media.
News website La Tercera reported Vidal's wife suffered a dislocated elbow in the collision, which involved three vehicles.
Radio BioBio said Vidal's vehicle was a few meters from dropping into the Los Guindos path, which is a drop of 10 meters, and that his car's airbags had been activated.
Prosecutor Luis Pablo Cortes was quoted as telling news website Emol that Vidal was the protagonist of the crash and that a driver from one of the cars involved had been let free, but will be called to testify as a witness. CNN tried unsuccessfully to reach him.
Read: Is FIFA facing 'doomsday' scenario?
He said Vidal was detained for driving in a "drunk state," which under Chilean law is a more serious offense that being "under the influence" of alcohol.
After playing for Juventus in the European Champions League final on June 6, Vidal returned to Chile, which is hosting the Copa America -- Latin America's leading international football tournament.
He is the tournament's top scorer with three goals from two games, guiding Chile to a win and a draw.
Given his importance to the Chile team, Vidal's involvement in the crash, has brought some withering criticism from local media pundits.
"[Vidal] f***ed over his teammates, coach, shirt &amp;, most seriously, those who dream of the Copa," tweeted De Tezanos. "There's 17m of us."
"It's very serious to let this happen right in the middle of the Copa Amrica," Jos Sulantay, a former coach of Chile's Under-20 team who worked with Vidal, told CNN Chile.
"This kind of stuff doesn't happen [when they're playing] in Europe.  I don't understand coach Jorge Sampaoli and I don't understand Vidal."
However, in a media conference Wednesday, Sampaoli said he had no intention of excluding Vidal from Chile's squad.
"It doesn't seem right to me to exclude someone just for making a mistake," said the Chile coach.
The crash reportedly took place in Buin, around 40km south of Santiago and Vidal was taken to the San Luis de Buin hospital for treatment.
Chile has a "zero tolerance" approach to drink driving, meaning there is no maximum limit for alcohol.
Vidal could face three years in jail, and a driving ban. It's believed to be his first offense.
He is more likely to receive a driving ban of two years, as there were no serious injuries and it's his first offense.
The Copa America host faces Bolivia in its final group stage game on Friday.

Muslim Brotherhood asks for international help to end what it calls Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's "cruel dictatorship"
Ex-President Mohamed Morsy was sentenced last month for his role in 2011 prison break
Three other senior members of Muslim Brotherhood also sentenced to death
Cairo (CNN)
A court in Egypt upheld a death sentence Tuesday against former President Mohamed Morsy .
Morsy, 63, was sentenced to death last month for his role in a 2011 prison break.
Morsy, along with 16 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders, was also given a life sentence for espionage. Life in Egypt means 25 years.
Three more senior members of the organization -- Khairat Al Shater, Mohamed Beltagy and Ahmed Abdel Alaty -- were sentenced to death by hanging.
The political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice Party, called the decision "politicized" and the charges "fabricated."
"President Morsy's trial has fallen far below the most basic international legal standards," a statement from the Muslim Brotherhood said. "Today's announcement is another nail in the coffin for democracy in Egypt."
It called on the international community to stop what it called the "cruel dictatorship" of Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi .
The military ousted Morsy, Egypt 's first democratically elected leader, in 2013.
CNN's Ian Lee reported from Cairo, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Sarah Sirgany contributed to this report.

Egypt hopes Suez Canal expansion will see cash flood in

Egypt set to open new Suez Canal in August 02:37
Story highlights
Egypt's President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi hopes facelifted Suez Canal will breathe new life into economy
Canal earned $5.5 billion in 2014, which government hopes to increase to $13.5 billion by 2023
(CNN)
It's arguably the most strategic waterway in the world. One that affects most lives on the planet. The Suez Canal may cut Africa off from Asia but it's a vital lifeline connecting the East and West.
Now Egypt's President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi hopes its facelift will breathe new life into Egypt's economy.
Everything about this project is ambitious. The funds needed for the new 70 kilometers of canal was raised within eight days. Only Egyptian citizens could invest in the project.
The President gave responsibility of completing the task to Vice Admiral Mohab Mameesh of the Suez Canal Authority. After consulting experts he concluded it would take five years to complete -- but that wasn't good enough.
"It would take five years, but we pushed and we made a pressure at the time and it will arrive in three years," Mameesh said. "But when [President el-Sisi] told me in one year, I said yes and changed all the plans."
Since the project began 10 months ago, 41,000 people have been working around the clock. They'll move a total of half a trillion cubic meters of earth -- equivalent to moving 200 Great Pyramids.
To help accomplish that task, Mameesh says he has employed 75% of the world's dredgers.
The goal is to turn this one-way canal into a two-lane highway. Currently, ships have to wait to be part of three convoys with room for only eight megaships per day.
Nearly 10% of all global maritime trade passes through the Suez Canal. That's 18,000 ships a year, a figure that Mameesh hopes the new canal will increase to 20,000.
The navigation time will be reduced from 22 hours to 11 hours meaning the latest must-have electronics from Asia will arrive sooner.
Security concern
Last year, the canal earned roughly $5.5 billion, which the government hopes to increase to $13.5 billion by 2023. It's an ambitious projection when global trade increases at roughly 5% annually.
"The projected 13 billion are slated to come from passage fees and from the increase in number of ships but also efficiency and increase of maritime services presented to passing ships," says Mameesh.
The new canal is envisioned to be the cornerstone of Egypt's next grand industrial project that'll be situated along its shores. The government hopes it'll create $100 billion in revenue and produce 1 million jobs. How this will be accomplished is not entirely known, as details are scarce.
One potential roadblock to all of this is security.
Militants aligned with ISIS wage a deadly insurgency next to the canal in Northern Sinai. Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting.
About two years ago, militants fired a rocket propelled grenade at a passing boat in the canal, but no one was killed in the attack.
Mameesh insists the boats are safe, with Egypt's military patrols helping to keep the roughly 100-mile (160 kilometer) canal secure.
But the admiral's most pressing concern is making the August deadline and bringing the 150-year-old canal into the 21st century.

The unforgiving heat has spared no one. The very young, the very old and those in the prime of their lives.
Corpses covered in flies lie outside city morgues. Inside, bodies up on bodies are piled high.
Hospitals are overwhelmed, relying on volunteers and donors for ice, water and even spare beds.
By Thursday, the death toll from the oppressive heat wave in Sindh province topped 1,000, officials told CNN.
But even without the numbers, the full extent of the misery isn't hard to gauge.

Overwhelmed hospital
At the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center in Sindh's capital, Karachi, heat stroke victims are wheeled in daily, swelling the numbers well beyond capacity.
The overwhelmed doctors and nurses do what they can.
But with supplies limited, the government-run hospital is relying on volunteers and donors for even the basic necessities, they say.
Family members tend to many of the patients, wiping their brows with sponges and keeping them cool with wet, grimy towels.
"I felt so hot, I was vomiting," an elderly man told CNN. "I felt weak and my heart sank."

Rare double rainbow frames Sydney skyline
By Georgia McCafferty, for CNN
Updated 0936 GMT (1636 HKT) June 18, 2015
A double rainbow captured by a lifeguard at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Wednesday.
(CNN)
It's one of the world's most beautiful cities, but Sydney's sunset was twice as spectacular Wednesday when its beaches, harbor and city skyline were framed by a rare double rainbow.
Social media was awash with breathtaking pictures, with the sight literally stopping traffic on the city's streets.
A rainbow is a natural phenomenon, formed when sunlight hits falling rain. The rain's tiny drops refract the sun's light into its individual color components and reflect it back at different angles, forming the seven colors of the rainbow. A double rainbow happens when these rays of light are refracted twice.
Science aside, there's no arguing with these amazing pictures.

        <MainBody>Tour English mansion fit for a king 03:15
(CNN)
The grounds of the Medmenham Abbey in Buckinghamshire, England, could easily be the set of a romanticized period drama.
Ducks bask on the riverbanks while rolling fields of green stretch off into the distance. Sprawled over 1,123 square meters (12,000 square feet), this 18th-century mansion is only an hour outside London.
And with long wooden corridors and 42 acres of lush green upon which to gaze out on to, the site has all the trappings fit for a king -- as well as a scandalous past.
"This property has an interesting, slightly checkered history," said Nicholas Brown, partner at real estate firm Knight Frank.
"It belonged to the Hell-Fire Club (a secret organization where members of high society were rumored to commit a range of debauched acts) at one point."
"Their moto (was) 'over the fireplace here -- do as you please.'"
On sale for a princely sum
Once occupied by knights of a brotherhood order, Medmenham Abbey is now on the market for more than $15 million.
That's a princely sum, but its location in the designated green belt of England makes it a sound investment.
The grounds of Medmenham Abbey in Buckinghamshire, England.
Properties in protected areas that forbid development sell for a 10% to 20% premium.
"Being in a protected area, you are able to make sure that your investment is well covered; you're not having the chance of developments going on locally," Brown said.
But not all of England's countryside is afforded the same level of protection.
70 miles away in the county of Hertfordshire, the small town of Buntingford sits in unprotected countryside.
A prime section of country land here, now filled with rapeseed, has just had planning permission approved for over 200 new homes.
A big development just spoils everything for the people who live here
Kevin Fitzgerald, Campaign to Protect Rural England
Yet that's still a fraction of Britain's demand. It's estimated the UK needs to build 250,000 residential properties each year.
Meeting these needs poses a dilemma for developers and countryside dwellers.
Kevin Fitzgerald is the honorary director of the Hertfordshire branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England , a volunteer group that lobbies to protect the countryside.
He explained he's not against building homes, but that development should be focused on previously developed land.
Countryside at a premium
"Not far up the road, one to two hours away, there is space (and) disused factories. There is a need for economic growth (there), Fitzgerald said.
"In the rich southeast, where countryside is at a premium, there is not the same need," he added.
The rolling hills of Buckinghamshire, England.
Buntingford locals are also weighing in.
Joyce Dubner has been living here for 48 years and hopes the imminent developments will benefit everyone in the community.
"I think if they're going to build houses they should be starter homes and more property to rent," she said.
Yet the new houses don't come cheap. A 3 bedroom costs over $500,000. However, their setting makes them popular.
"Clearly excessive development can have a detrimental effect in the initial stages but later on once it is all established it will soon be forgotten about," Brown said. "The fact that it's a convenient setting, pretty countryside, there will still be people who want to buy there."
And for some, paying a premium to keep the countryside quaint is a price worth paying.

Edwin Sabuhoro's nonprofit turns gorilla poachers into protectors
Iby'lwacu Cultural Village offers income opportunities near a habitat for endangered gorillas
(CNN)
Edwin Sabuhoro will never forget the first time he saw a gorilla in the wild.
"It was magical," he said. "He sat right there and looked me straight in the eye. I felt something in me that I couldn't define."
The experience inspired Sabuhoro to leave his law career and become a warden at Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. There he was in charge of protecting the endangered mountain gorillas.
Fewer than 900 mountain gorillas are living in the wild today . Their biggest threats come from deforestation and the region's growing population.
"We had a lot of cases of poachers ... killing, setting snares, cutting bamboo," Sabuhoro said.

In 2004, he helped track down a group of poachers by posing as a potential buyer for a baby gorilla. The baby was saved, and the poachers were imprisoned.
But Sabuhoro wanted to find a solution to the bigger problem. So he met with more than 100 poachers and their families to find out why they were killing wildlife.
"One old man looked at me and said, 'Your kids are starving to death. Would you poach to feed your family?' " Sabuhoro said. "It was an eye-opener for me."
In 2006, he set out to help the local community improve its livelihood. What started as a farming program has since grown into a nonprofit, the Iby'Iwacu Cultural Village , which helps families generate income through tourism.
CNN talked with Sabuhoro about his efforts. Below is an edited version of the conversation.
CNN: Your program now helps families and protects wildlife. How does it work?
Sabuhoro: In the cultural village, we share with tourists our local food, our traditional culture, our ways of living. Tourists can give back to the community, and the local communities have an incentive to conserve the park.
We also train villagers how to do crafts, products that they can sell in markets. And that money they take back to their families. They're able to send their kids to school; they're able to buy food; they're able to start businesses.
We also have communities working directly with rangers to provide intelligence about poachers. This is voluntary work. They understand why they need to protect the gorillas. We educate that this is their park and they have to protect it.

CNN Hero Edwin Sabuhoro: Saving the mountain gorillas 02:24
CNN: How did you first use farming to start your program?
Sabuhoro: I thought of an idea of turning poachers to farmers. I had $2,000, money I saved through my work in the park. I decided to withdraw all that money and divided the poachers into groups to rent land, buy seeds and start farming.
Six months later, they had harvested enough that they had enough food at home and they were selling the rest in the market.
It was so emotional for me to see how the little that I had helped could make a huge difference in people's lives. I thought we could do more here. We built the cultural village in 2006. Before we finished, we had tourists coming to visit us, and that gave communities a lot of hope and expectation.
CNN: How did your personal experiences lead you to this work?
Sabuhoro: My parents and my grandparents left Rwanda as refugees after the killings and tumult that took place. It was so painful as a kid growing up in absolute poverty. We would spend two, three days without food.
But our mom kept giving us this hope that tomorrow is going to be better. Tomorrow is going to be different. And we grew up with that idea. That kept happiness in us, kept us going.
I got my law degree in 2001 and was interested in pursuing environmental law. I thought, "This nature needs an advocate." But in a country still suffering from the aftermath of war and genocide, wildlife protection wasn't a priority for most Rwandans.  I realized that in order to keep gorillas safe, we needed to help the villagers.
Edwin Sabuhoro's nonprofit turns poachers into protectors by offering income opportunities near a habitat for endangered gorillas.
CNN: You are passionate about saving gorillas. Why is this work so important to you?
Sabuhoro: During my time at the park, I grew fond of the gorillas and built relationships with them. It's unbelievable to see them every day.
After being away to get my master's degree in the UK, when I came back to the park one of the gorillas recognized me. He came over almost like to ask, "How have you been?" He showed me a wound on his foot from getting caught in a snare, and that was very touching for me. I began to understand that gorillas are so similar to human beings. I wanted to make sure the gorillas can survive and live with the same dignity.
If we don't do anything, they will go extinct. We can't afford to fail the wildlife. It was passed on to us by ancestors, and we have to work hard to make sure that we pass it on to the next generation.

Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath.
Anuradha Koirala , who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12.
The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry.
"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard," said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year.
The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food.
Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster.
"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them," Koirala said. "They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can."
About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard.
"They're not injured, but they are terrified," Koirala said. "Everything is broken in the hospice."
Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged.
"It's really very sad for me and for my children," Koirala said.
"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next."

A dream shattered
Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field.
"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are," said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated.
Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down.
She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves.
"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field," Basnet said. "We are really scared."
They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive.
"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life," she said. "(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me."
Basnet's "Butterfly Home" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October.
Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year .
"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered," she said. "I have to restart again."
Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid.

        <MainBody>Mission to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, passes big hurdle
Icy moon may have ingredients for life
NASA has included $30 million in its 2016 budget to plan the mission
(CNN)
NASA wants to go to Europa. No, it's not in Europe. And for soccer fans, it has nothing to do with the Europa League .
Europa is one of Jupiter's larger moons . It's about the size of Earth's moon, and it's thought to be one of the best places to look for life in our solar system -- besides Earth, of course.
An artist's concept of a plume of water jetting above the icy surface of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons.
Interest in the icy world heated up in 2012 when the Hubble Space Telescope observed water vapor above the south polar region of Europa. NASA says those observations gave scientists strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface.
Long before Hubble made those findings, a NASA spacecraft named Galileo traveled to Jupiter in 1995 and found evidence that Europa has a salty ocean beneath its frozen crust. NASA says that ocean may have more than twice as much water as Earth.
"Europa has tantalized us with its enigmatic icy surface and evidence of a vast ocean, following the amazing data from 11 flybys of the Galileo spacecraft over a decade ago and recent Hubble observations suggesting plumes of water shooting out from the moon," John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement in May.
"We're excited about the potential of this new mission and these instruments to unravel the mysteries of Europa in our quest to find evidence of life beyond Earth."
An artist's concept of what a NASA spacecraft would look like approaching Europa.
NASA hopes the new probe will help determine if Europa really does have the ingredients for life, according to Barry Goldstein, manager of the Europa Project at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
The mission took a big step forward Wednesday when NASA announced it had been moved to what's called the "formulation phase," Goldstein told CNN in an email.
"In this phase we mature the mission design and requirements to assure we are asking the correct science questions, and designing the correct mission to answer those questions," he said.
The space agency has included $30 million in its 2016 budget to plan the mission. Goldstein said there's still work to do before NASA officially clears mission managers to build the hardware and software for the mission.
If the mission does get final approval, the spacecraft would be launched in the 2020s . It would take several years to get to Jupiter, and when it arrived it would "orbit the giant planet about every two weeks, providing many opportunities for close flybys of Europa," according to a NASA statement.
NASA says the mission plan includes 45 flybys at altitudes ranging from 16 miles to 1,700 miles (25 kilometers to 2,700 kilometers). With each pass, the spacecraft would collect information about Europa's surface and use instruments to look deep inside the small world.
Nine science instruments have been selected so far, including cameras, ice penetrating radar and a magnetometer.
A bit more about Europa and Jupiter
Europa is one of the four largest moons orbiting Jupiter , the biggest planet in our solar system -- so big that 1,000 Earths would fit inside. Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei is given credit for discovering Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto in 1610, and so the four are known as Galilean satellites or moons. German astronomer Simon Marius claimed to see the moons at about the same time, but Galileo published his findings first. Jupiter also has dozens of other smaller moons .
Jupiter is about 390 million miles (629 million kilometers) from Earth when the two planets are at their closest.
Despite the distance, you can see Jupiter with the naked eye on a clear night. In fact, Jupiter and the much brighter Venus are putting on quite a show in the evening sky this month. If you go out after sunset and look west, you can see the two planets fairly close together. They look like two bright lights. In late June and early July, the two planets will be at their closest until August 2016.
If you have binoculars or a telescope, you can see Jupiter's largest moons , including Europa. They will look like tiny lights near Jupiter.
Jupiter's other visitors
This image of Jupiter is a composite of four images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in December 2000.
While the new probe will focus on Europa, Jupiter has had a steady stream of visitors from Earth over the past few decades:

(CNN)
"Jurassic World" hit over 4,200 theaters last week, reintroducing the man-meets-dinosaur disaster to a new generation of fans.
The movie has already smashed records, becoming the highest grossing global opening in history by bringing in $511.8 million over the weekend.
While real-life scientists have yet to resurrect the terrible lizards from mosquito DNA, they have recently discovered remnants of what look like red blood cells and soft tissue in the fossils of a 75-million-year-old dinosaur.
But they say it'll be a long time before a "Jurassic Park"-style theme park is feasible. (As if anyone who's seen any of the films would want to visit one anyway.)
Fortunately there are already plenty of museums worldwide that (safely) bring humans face to face with dinosaurs -- and not always just their skeletons.
1. Museum fr Naturkunde (Berlin)
Berlin's natural history museum houses a serious collection of bones excavated largely from Tanzania in the 20th century, featuring all sorts of species.
Most impressive is the 41-foot, 5-inch Brachiosaurus, the tallest dinosaur in the world on display.  It's a Guinness World Record holder and dominates the first gallery.
The museum also has the most important Archaeopteryx fossil in the world, demonstrating the birdlike link between dinosaurs and birds.

2. Field Museum (Chicago)
The world's biggest version of the world's most famous dinosaur.
The museum's Evolving Planet exhibit, dedicated to the last 4 billion years of evolution, features dinosaurs from as far away as Madagascar and Antarctica.
The main attraction stands at the entrance. Meet Sue, the largest Tyrannosaurus in the world, who greets visitors at Chicago's natural history museum.
She's a terrific specimen -- the original skull, weighing 600 pounds and flashing 58 teeth, is on display in the museum's balcony level along with information on the most notorious of dinosaurs.
It's easy to imagine the enormous tooth-filled snout crashing through the sunroof of a "Jurassic Park" jeep.

3. Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Science (Brussels)
With the largest dinosaur hall in the world, this museum has an impressive collection of fossilized skeletons and casts.
The standouts are 30 Iguanodons, the second dinosaur to be classified in the 1800s.
They're the ones with the curious spike that early paleontologists mistook for a horn on their nose.
Interactive displays in the gallery also detail the fossilization process and dinosaur digs, among other topics.

4. National Dinosaur Museum (Canberra, Australia)
This is the place to explore prehistory in Australia.
The place has the country's largest collection of dinosaur fossils.
Alongside fossils, bones and impressive footprints from all sorts of animals and beasts, the museum features a garden with imposing dinosaur sculptures and animatronics inside that add a bit of Spielberg magic to displays.
Fossil digs, children's learning events and weekend tours help attract 200,000 people a year, making it one of the area's biggest tourist attractions.
National Dinosaur Museum , Gold Creek Road and Barton Highway, Nicholls, ACT, Australia; +(02) 6230 2655
5. Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology (Alberta, Canada)
More than 130,000 fossils call this paleontological research center home, including the original "Black Beauty" Tyrannosaurus skeleton with its unique dark sheen.
A recreation of a pack of Albertosaurus, inspired by a bone bed of 22 specimens found in Alberta, pays homage to Joseph Tyrrell, who discovered the carnivore in 1884.
The museum also displays sabertooth tigers attacking a mammoth as well as a living garden that recreates life during the Cretaceous period in Alberta.
Visitors can watch paleontologists at work in the preparation lab to see how they prepare fossilized bones, like those of an Ankylosaur found in a Canadian mine.

6. Wyoming Dinosaur Center (Wyoming)
This museum's standout attraction is a 106-foot Supersaurus.
The museum has acquired the most complete archaeopteryx in the world (after the one in Berlin) and boasts skeletons of Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Velociraptor, among others in all sorts of dynamic poses.
The real draw is getting to talk with real paleontologists, like those who inspired Alan Grant's character in "Jurassic Park."
All ages are invited to "dig for a day" by signing up to participate in excursions to one of the world's richest bone fields, just down the street.

7. Zigong Dinosaur Museum (Zigong, China)
Another vast space given to prehistoric fossils, the Dinosaur Museum in Zigong sits atop the Dashanpu fossil site, allowing visitors to get a firsthand glimpse of an excavation site.
This top Chinese attraction has 18 complete skeletons among the 200 individuals pulled from the graveyard, and they're displayed among foot prints, skin fossils and other prehistoric finds.
Specimens are renowned in the dinosaur community and attract nearly 7 million people a year in China.
Zigong Dinosaur Museum , No. 238 Dashanpu, Zigong, Sichuan, China; +86 813 580 1236
8. Iziko Museum (Cape Town, South Africa)
Africa's oldest and biggest.
South Africa doesn't conjure images of T. Rex and Brachiosaurus, but the Izikio Museum does feature some of the prehistoric beasts from its Karoo region.
In addition to dozens of other exhibits, the prehistoric section deals with lesser known dinosaurs and their cousins that inhabited the continent from Cape Town to Marrakech.
The "African Dinosaurs" exhibit features the Euparkeria, a distant relative of the dinosaurs, native to South Africa; as well as the Jobaria, a sauropod from Africa.
The Carcharodontosaurus skull from North Africa is part of a creature that trumped the mighty T. Rex in size and stature, making it one of Africa's most imposing killers.
Iziko Museum , 25 Queen Victoria St., Cape Town, South Africa; +27 (0)21 481 3800
9. Jurassic Land (Istanbul)
Opened in 2011, Jurassic Land is as close as you'll get to fleeing dinosaurs alongside Sam Neil and Laura Dern.
One part education, another part entertainment, the 10,000-square-meter experience mixes skeletons and fossils with writhing animatronic dinosaurs in an Ingen-esque setting, including a "veterinarian" taking care of an injured Stegosaurus and egg incubators.
While Spielberg may not have given his blessing, the center does offer a creative and engaging educational experience for children, though connoisseurs may question the seemingly anachronistic placing of a Spinosaurus next to a Triceratops.
Jurassic Land , Kocatepe Mahallesi Paa Caddesi Forum stanbul AVM SF Blok, Bayrampasa, Istanbul; +90 212 640 8088
10. Fernbank Museum of Natural History (Atlanta)
The true giants of the prehistoric world may have been unearthed in Patagonia, but you have to go to Atlanta to see them on display.
The Giants of the Mesozoic exhibit features the carnivorous Gigantosaurus, which rivaled the T. Rex in size, as well as the Argentinosaurus, the 100-ton sauropod that scientists say is the largest dinosaur ever classified.
A flock of more than 20 pterosaurs glides overhead. The museum also offers a glimpse into prehistoric Georgia, with murals and life-sized dinosaur models.

        <MainBody>British family recognized 17-year-old in ISIS photo
ISIS claims seven suicide attacks this weekend conducted by seven foreign nationals
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)
The family of a British boy said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS apparently released a photo showing their 17-year-old relative smiling in front of an ISIS flag.
ISIS media posted images of a boy the group called Abu Yousef al Britani. In one picture, the teen known as Talha Asmal back in England raises his index finger. A black flag hangs behind him.
In another shot, he's posing inside a black Toyota.
The family's heartache played out this weekend against the backdrop of two waves of car bombings in Iraq, notable for the role foreigners were said to have had in them.
Family: 'A loving and affable' boy
Asmal's relatives in West Yorkshire, England, were in shock after British media published the pictures of him.
Asmal was a "loving, kind, caring and affable" and had no "ill will against anybody nor did he ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind," his family said in a lengthy statement Sunday.
It seems that ISIS targeted the teen and "exploited" his "tender years and naivety," they said, adding that the terror group apparently carried out a "process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him."
"As a result of this and completely unbeknown to us, his family, and entirely against our wishes, he ended up traveling it seems to Iraq," the family's statement reads.
On Sunday, the United Kingdom's North East Counter Terrorism Unit said that police are aware of media reports that allege a British national has died in Iraq. The identity of the person has not been confirmed, and the office unable to give further comment, it said.
"We are aware that large numbers of British nationals are traveling to the Middle East for a variety of reasons, and we understand that some of those traveling have resided in West Yorkshire," it said.
Seven bombers, all foreigners?
ISIS is known for staging multiple bombings at a single time to rattle its enemy, but this weekend's violence stands out -- the seven car bombers who attacked near the city of Baiji were all from countries outside of Iraq, the terror group claimed. According to ISIS, the attackers were a Brit, a German, a Kuwaiti, a Palestinian, two Dagestanis and one national of Turkmenistan.
The bombings happened in two waves.
During one, four car bombers raced toward and drove through an Iraqi security forces checkpoint. At least 16 were killed and 29 wounded.

In another attack, three car bombers blew themselves up near security forces, causing numerous injuries but no deaths, an Iraqi Security Forces paramilitary commander told CNN.
The commander told CNN that in the first attack security forces mistook four speeding SUVs heading toward them as a convoy escorting a high-level official.
Violence in Iraq continued Sunday. A parked car exploded near a shopping area in Shaab, a predominantly Shia district northern Baghdad. Two people were killed and seven wounded, police told CNN.
A family waits, worries
Other families around the world share in the pain Asmal's family is experiencing.
British teens have been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Earlier this year, three teenage British girls were seen on airport surveillance footage heading to Syria. A Scottish teenager wrote extensively on her Tumblr account about her love of ISIS. She stunned her family, left her country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. An American teenager from suburban Chicago, Mohammed Hamzah Khan, allegedly was on his way to join ISIS in October when he was stopped at an airport.
Asmal's family said he comes from a "close knit, hardworking, peace loving and law abiding British Muslim family."
"It appears Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability," they said.
If he was one of the suicide bombers, the boy was "ordered to his death by so called ISIS handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work," they said.
ISIS does not represent Islam, they stressed.
"They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like ISIS to hijack our faith," their statement said. "ISIS Not and Never in our name."
They are grieving, they said, and need a break from talking to reporters.
They need "time and understanding to come to terms," they said, "with our unimaginable and painful loss."
CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad while Ashley Fantz wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Anas Hamdan and Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report.

England's King John signs the Magna Carta in 1215.
Story highlights
Magna Carta is said to have been sealed on June 15, 1215 under the title of the "Great Charter"
Core values set out by the Magna Carta are still very much at the heart of Britain's constitution

Around 20 miles from central London, where modern-day government and democracy shape the lives of citizens throughout the United Kingdom, the Thames meanders peacefully through nondescript English countryside. This is just another part of the green and pleasant land that has come to define much of these shores.
Except that there's something rather different about this rural corner of England. These riverside fields at Runnymede are reputed to be the setting for one of the most significant moments in UK democratic and constitutional history. The National Trust labels it "the birthplace of modern democracy," while an impressive monument commemorates a "symbol of freedom under law." It was here, of course, that the Magna Carta is said to have been sealed on June 15, 1215 under the title of the "Great Charter."

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  In north-west Cameroon, a cooperative of women beekeepers gently nurture hives in the rural outskirts of the town of Bamenda. Through the sales of their honey, these enterprising women are able to provide for their families and pay for their children to attend school. Award-winning documentary photographer Eleri Griffiths traveled to the region to meet them.

The women beekeepers of Cameroon  Mariana Tanda Fumsi, pictured, wanted to help women in her village generate some sort of disposable income for themselves. Shortly after graduating from high school, she found herself working in a honey shop. Intrigued about where the products came from and the subjects of sustainability and conservation, Fumsi quickly realized this could be a powerful pastime for local women in the area. Seventeen years on, and The Village Women Organization for Sustainable Development Cameroon has become a thriving apiary association.

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  Fumsi explains: "I'd always had this idea of working with women because I came from a single home where my mother raised me all by herself. She was a widow and I was two. So this passion of working with women I developed from there." Here, local beefarmer Bridget Mbah extracts honey from a top bar bee hive.

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  Griffiths' spent three weeks traveling around the north-west region visiting keepers who had set up their own hives. She explains that there is now a strong network of apiculturists high up in the mountain.
"Once you know one beekeeper there, you go through a network who are all in touch with one another, learn from one another. Also things like sharing equipment. Beekeeping equipment is strangely quite expensive, even to have a suit. Beekeeping suits protect yourself from stings but are quite expensive, so its easier to get together and share these things."

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  While beekeeping was not uncommon in the region, it was mainly reserved for the men of the villages, explains Fumsi. "But I said, 'the women could still do something. They shouldn't just allow them because the man is already on the farm. The woman can have a little piece of it.'"

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  Fumsi founded the cooperative in 1997 but it wasn't until she met traveling beekeeping trainer Alan Morely from volunteer organization, Bees for Development , that things really started to buzz. The international philanthropic group assists would-be beekeepers by training them in the art of apiculture and teaching them how to build and manage hives.

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  At the beginning, there were just 15 beekeepers-in-training, but over the years the group has increased to over 50 women. Fumsi puts this success to its ease when compared with traditional farming in the region. "With beekeeping -- it's less costly, its less timely, it's just within their reach. That's why I got interested in it at the beginning."

The beekeeping women of Bamenda  Before taking up beekeeping, many women in the area struggled to make ends meet while also maintaining all the regular homemaker jobs -- a fact that spurred Fumsi to push for local women to be trained in the craft. She explains: "Actually most of the chores in the house are left to the women. And she has to get washing soap for the family, she's got to get ingredients for the family, even the school fees of the children -- she's got to pay for fees, uniform and shoes. And at times hospital bills, if its not an emergency -- she takes care of that."

The proceeds help many of them to pay for their children's tuition. But that doesn't mean the cooperative is without problems -- in recent years, the beekeepers have noticed some of their little workers are absconding due to changes in climate, a challenge they are still working out to overcome.

"The market is not really that organized. At times the women have to travel far to sell their products or they have to give it to the cooperative," says Fumsi. "There's also a problem of quality because we still do it on a local level so bee farmers have a good product but we need to do better bottling."

Bees are dying at an alarming rate; even the White House acknowledged the dire situation
David Schubert: Bees are dying from some of the pesticides that are found in our human food supply
David Schubert is professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN)
We love our bees. They make honey and pollinate our flowers and crops.
But bees are dying at an alarming rate. Even the White House acknowledged the dire situation and recently released a task force report about it.
While the report acknowledges that pesticides are involved in the demise of bees, it could have discussed more how for the first time in the history of agriculture the same chemicals are inside not only the pollen that bees consume but the foods we eat.
Recent data published in Science, Nature and other scientific journals show that bees are dying from some of the pesticides that are found in our food supply.
One of these groups of chemical insecticides is the neonicotinoids that are similar in structure to nicotine and poison the nervous system.  The exposure of bees and people to neonicotinoids has increased enormously since it was discovered that by coating seeds with them the plants systemically take up the insecticide and distribute it to all parts of the plant and kill insects that eat the plant.  They are used on about 80% of commercial food crops in the United States , are found in pollen, honey and other foods, and are exceptionally resilient in the environment.
David Schubert
The other is glyphosate, the active ingredient in most herbicides. Glyphosate not only kills weeds, it also kills many of the beneficial kinds of bacteria that are found in the guts of bees, dogs and humans. These bacteria are an integral part of our body and play major roles in both physical and mental health. The World Health Organization has declared glyphosate a probable carcinogen. Because glyphosate is required for the production of most genetically modified, or GM, crops, its use has increased a lot since the introduction of these crops about 20 years ago .
Neonicotinoids are banned in Europe. It has been documented that the systemic treatment of some plants by seed coating is ineffective in preventing insect predation.
Is our government doing its best to protect our health, as well as the busy pollinators?
Two recent books say that the responsible agencies -- the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency  -- do not independently safety test pesticides or GM crops before their introduction.
" Altered Genes, Twisted Truth ," by Steve Druker, details how FDA administrators often disregarded the advice of their scientists and hardly questioned the fact that most GM crops require the use of herbicides in order to work properly. Herbicides used on GM crops are food additives, because they must be in the plant to be effective. It is the FDA's mandate to test additives that are found in food that are potentially unsafe , which should include things like glyphosate and neonicotinoids. However, as Druker documents, the FDA shrugs responsibility for GM food safety.
The book about the EPA, " Poison Spring: The Secret History of Pollution and the EPA ," by Evaggelos Vallianatos, carefully documents how the agency is beholden to large agricultural chemical companies. For example, although it is now well documented that bees are dying due to long-term exposures to pesticides , the EPA has only requested that producers do short-term toxicity studies.  Therefore, unless the chemical kills the bee outright, its use will be allowed.
Since the science has become clear that pollen containing agricultural chemicals is contributing to the death of bees, what are these same chemicals in our food doing to us?
In the absence of proper safety tests, this is a difficult question to answer.  But there is a striking correlation between the decline of the bee population, which was first widely noted in the late 1990s -- soon after the introduction of neonicotinoids and glyphosate resistant crops -- and an increase in the relative frequency of several human diseases , such as autism and gastrointestinal conditions, in the same time frame.
Perhaps the dying bees are telling us something about the future of human health.  Unless the system of chemical-based agriculture is changed, the chemical exposure of both bees and humans will continue to increase.
Individuals can demand that their state governments phase out the use of the most dangerous agricultural chemicals. Creating a sustainable and safe food supply is essential for the health and future of both bees and humans.

New planet discovered by 15-year-old intern
Updated 2310 GMT (0610 HKT) June 11, 2015
Tom Wagg was an intern at Keele University's observatory when he discovered the planet.

Advice to interns: work hard and make your mark. And if you can discover a new planet while you're at it, you could also be pushing the boundaries of our knowledge.
Believe it or not, a 15-year-old boy did just that, according to Keele University in England , UK. While undertaking work experience at the university, Tom Wagg noticed a tiny dip in the light of a star as a planet passed in front of it -- that planet had supposedly not been on anyone's radar until then. The university said it has since taken two years to verify his findings.
"I'm hugely excited to have a found a new planet, and I'm very impressed that we can find them so far away," Tom said, according to a statement from the university. He apparently spotted the planet by scouring the data collected by Keele University's WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project, which scans millions of stars in night skies and searches for tiny dips, or transits, caused by the passing of planets.
An artist's impression of WASP-142b orbiting its star.
Nameless for the time being, the new planet has been labeled with the catalog number WASP-142b, as it's the 142nd discovery by the WASP collaboration.
Invisible to the naked eye and 1,000 light years away, the planet is the same size as Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, but orbits its star in only two days. Such frequent orbits make such planets easier to find -- if you can describe the feat as easy.
After the discovery of the planet, astronomers at the University of Geneva and the University of Liege confirmed that it had the required size and mass to be identified as a planet. And the university is planning a competition to find a name.
A star student at a nearby school and a science enthusiast, Wagg had requested the work experience after learning that Keele University had a research group studying extrasolar planets, or exoplanets -- planets that exist around stars other than the sun.
According to NASA, the first exoplanet was spotted in 1995 and 5,000 have been discovered ever since. The space agency says on its website that such findings provide hope in finding another Earth.

This might look like a painting, but it's actually a photograph. Its author, Serge Najjar, has the ability to find the visually arresting in everyday life.
Drawn to bold geometry and possessing a keen eye with which to frame it, the Lebanese photographer -- who's also a practicing lawyer -- uses Instagram to take stills of interesting buildings and make them appear like works of art.

The overarching theme is to challenge the viewer's assumptions. Through each image, he seeks to examine the "thin line between the ugly and the beautiful; between the ordinary and the extraordinary; between chaos and order; between reality and abstraction."

Talking to CNN, Najjar says he only discovered photography four years ago -- and even then, at the behest of his mother.
"She registered me and my brother at a course her friend was running. The professor needed another two or three students for the class to go ahead, so she was helping her out," he says. "It's typical of the Lebanese mother, very present in her children's lives -- I was 37!"

He arrived at his first class a complete novice, but with what describes as the inherent ability to "sense when an art piece is good."
Najjar set out trying to treat his traditional camera as he would that on his phone, opting to use unconventional angles and the square aspect ratio found on Instagram. Whilst he developed his technical abilities, a clear focus began to develop in his output.

Najjar says he "was obsessed with architecture straight away." Drawing on constructivism, Parisian avant-garde and MC Escher, Najjar's work is all about finding art in architecture," describing his subject as a "playground for abstract photography."
"In Lebanon," he says, "we don't have very exciting architecture, but I always say it's not about what you see, but how you see it."

His first show, "Lines, Within" in 2012 -- for which Najjar had to teach himself how to develop his own photographs -- was a runaway success, with nearly all of the 32 displayed works selling. A nomination for the prestigious Prix Pictet arrived shortly after. In 2014, he exhibited at the prestigious Paris Photo.

Today he rises at 5 am at the weekends to capture his images, driving to nondescript locations.
"I try not to show the surroundings of the buildings," Najjar says, arguing it helps emphasize his photography's abstract qualities. The effect deprives the observer of context, creating an "anonymous message" to be decoded. Najjar believes the presence of people in his images is important however, as it provides "a certain scale and warmth to the architecture."

His methods still raise some eyebrows around Beirut. Najjar often struggles not only to convince security guards that he's not a spy, but that the locations he visits are worthy of his lens.
"The common and the ugly may not be as boring as we think it is," he contends.

BlackJet  For those still happy to take to the air with strangers, BlackJet, launched in 2012 with the backing of a raft of Hollywood celebrities, offers individual seats aboard private jets.

Here's the scenario:
The business meet wraps up in Boston, now an urgent situation is developing in Los Angeles.
A quick check of flight schedules reveals there's a premium-rate business-class seat available.
However, the flight doesn't depart until first thing tomorrow.
But hang on, there's another option.
A private jet, leaving when you want it to leave.
And it's cheaper too.
Seriously.
In the wake of Uber 's shake-up of the taxi market and AirBnB 's impact on accommodations, that most exclusive industry of all, executive aviation, could soon be disrupted in the same way.
So does that mean that ordinary business travelers could soon be switching to low-cost private aircraft in the same way they've been switching to cheaper, convenient cabs across town?
Some aviation entrepreneurs think so.
They're creating simple, sleek mobile apps to optimize spare capacity in the private jet market and create a smooth booking experience.
Obviously private aviation isn't going to be for the masses, but what if this exclusive preserve of the super-rich is about to become accessible to the merely affluent -- those that today fill the front cabin section of commercial aircraft?
Instead of calling a broker or buying into shared exec jet ownership, these new apps allow travelers to secure a private aircraft with just a few clicks and no membership fees.
Online marketplaces like Jetsmarter , Victor or Ubair rely on complex predictive algorithms to aggregate aircraft availability data from hundreds of private jet operators and provide quotes within seconds.
Cheaper than driving?
"We are a high tech big data company at core," says Sergey Petrossov, Jetsmarter's founder, adding that most of his company's clients are newcomers to executive aviation.
Petrossov sees a future where the executive jet industry goes the way of the Uber-reshaped taxi market.
He believes apps could even become so efficient that prices drop to the point where private aircraft not only take business from traditional operators and airlines, but from road transport.
Fleets of small propeller aircraft could lure people away from cars and into the skies.
Richard Koe, managing director of aviation market intelligence consultancy WINGX, is more cautious.
Yes, some new players are streamlining the booking process, he says, but that might not be enough to bring prices down to levels that'll open up private flights to greater numbers.
Victor recently acquired YoungJets, responsible for masterminding music tours for the likes of Rihanna.
Empty-leg solutions
Koe instead thinks the online players might simply end up taking business from traditional brokers rather than disrupt the industry's structure.
They could, however, offer an efficient solution to the problem of so-called empty legs.
These happen when private jets fly without passengers as operators reposition them.
According to some industry estimates, empty legs account for more than a third of all private flights.
Jetsuite , a light-jet operator based in California, pioneered discounted online sales of empty legs and others have followed suit.

Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world.
(CNN)
On the surface, James Harrison is just an average guy. He loves his daughter and grandchildren, collects stamps, and goes for walks near his home on Australia's central coast. But it's what's under the surface that makes him extraordinary -- specifically, what's flowing in his veins.
Known as "The Man with the Golden Arm," nearly every week for the past 60 years he has donated blood plasma from his right arm. The reasons can be traced back to a serious medical procedure he underwent as a child.
"In 1951, I had a chest operation where they removed a lung -- and I was 14," recalls Harrison, who is now aged 78.
"When I came out of the operation, or a couple days after, my father was explaining what had happened. He said I had (received) 13 units (liters) of blood and my life had been saved by unknown people. He was a donor himself, so I said when I'm old enough, I'll become a blood donor."
A deadly problem
Soon after Harrison became a donor, doctors called him in. His blood, they said, could be the answer to a deadly problem.
"In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didn't know why, and it was awful," explains Jemma Falkenmire, of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service . "Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage."
Read: The worms that invade your brain
It was the result of rhesus disease -- a condition where a pregnant woman's blood actually starts attacking her unborn baby's blood cells. In the worst cases it can result in brain damage, or death, for the babies.
Rhesus disease happens when a pregnant woman has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive), inherited from its father. If the mother has been sensitized to rhesus-positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an rhesus-positive baby, she may produce antibodies that destroy the baby's "foreign" blood cells.
Harrison was discovered to have an unusual antibody in his blood and in the 1960s he worked with doctors to use the antibodies to develop an injection called Anti-D. It prevents women with rhesus-negative blood from developing RhD antibodies during pregnancy.
"Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time," says Falkenmire.
Precious gift
Harrison's blood is precious. He and Anti-D are credited with saving the lives of more than 2 million babies, according to the Australian Red Cross blood service: That's 2 million lives saved by one man's blood.
"Every bag of blood is precious, but James' blood is particularly extraordinary," says Falkenmire. "His blood is actually used to make a life-saving medication, given to moms whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. Every batch of Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James' blood.
"And more than 17% of women in Australia are at risk, so James has helped save a lot of lives."
One of those lives is that of baby Samuel, who is just five weeks old. His mother, Kristy Pastor, first received the Anti-D injection during her second pregnancy. With Harrison's antibodies in her blood, little Samuel is her fourth happy and healthy baby.
"They just said you needed the vaccine," she said. "I didn't think about it any further, and then looking into it a bit more, I found out about James and how amazing he is and how many donations he's made, and that it was all because of him.
"I'm grateful and I think James is really selfless to continue to donate, so that we can keep having this vaccine."
Read: The contact lens with a built-in telescope
Doctors still aren't exactly sure why Harrison has this rare blood type but they think it might be from the transfusions he received when he was 14, after his lung surgery. He's one of no more than 50 people in Australia known to have the antibodies, according the Australian Red Cross blood service.
"I think James is irreplaceable for us," says Falkenmire.
"I don't think anyone will be able to do what he's done, but certainly we do need people to step into his shoes," she adds. "He will have to retire in the next couple years, and I guess for us the hope is there will be people who will donate, who will also ... have this antibody and become life savers in the same way he has, and all we can do is hope there will be people out there generous enough to do it, and selflessly in the way he's done."
Harrison is considered a national hero, and has won numerous awards. He's now donated his plasma more than 1,000 times, but no matter how many times he's given blood there's one thing that will never change: "Never once have I watched the needle go in my arm," he says.
"I look at the ceiling or the nurses, maybe talk to them a bit, but never once have I watched the needle go in my arm. I can't stand the sight of blood, and I can't stand pain."

Her career has been a rollercoaster both on and off the pitch, but USWNT goalkeeper Hope Solo produced a display in the Women's World Cup that one teammate described as "freaking huge."
Solo's performance in the USWNT's 3-1 win over Australia in its opening game of the tournament rekindled memories of Tim Howard's heroics in last year's men's World Cup.
Howard was dubbed the "Secretary of Defense" by adoring fans on social media.
Solo had gone into the match in Winnipeg under something of a storm.

The United States is considered by many to be the favorite in this year's Women's World Cup, and a big reason why is goalkeeper Hope Solo. Solo has made headlines for some off-the-field troubles in recent years, but on the field she is simply one of the best keepers in the world. She won the award for best goalkeeper at the 2011 World Cup, and she was the starter for the gold-medal teams at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.

Wambach, who at 5-foot-11 is the tallest person on the team, is an imposing figure in the penalty box and a clinical header of the ball. She was the 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year.

The 33-year-old has been embroiled in a domestic violence case since June 2014, though charges against her were dismissed by a judge in Washington state in January.
However later that month, Solo was suspended by U.S. Soccer for 30 days following "an incident that occurred during a WNT training camp being held in Carson, California."
Solo's husband, former pro football player Jerramy Stevens, was charged with driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California, about 12 miles from Carson. The Los Angeles Times reported that Solo was in the passenger seat.
"I am perfectly focused, sir, perfectly focused," Solo responded when asked if her preparations had been affected by new details ESPN provided ahead of the match against Australia.
USWNT team media officials then cut short Solo's interview.
Her first standout moment came after just five minutes when she tipped Emily van Egmond's shot onto the bar and out for a corner.

 U.S. Soccer WNT (@ussoccer_wnt) June 8, 2015
She then produced another show-stopping save, getting down low to her right to deny Samantha Kerr what would have been a sublime volley just seconds after the Americans had taken the lead.
"Hope Solo was freaking huge," star player Megan Rapinoe told Fox Sports. "I think she had three saves that I don't think anybody else in the world can make.
"It was a little bit of a shaky game for us, especially the first 30 minutes. It's big and obviously the first tournament for a lot of people, only my second, so to get out of here with three points is huge."
Despite all of Solo's efforts in goal, there was still work to be done at the other end -- and 35-year-old veteran Rapinoe duly obliged.
Her deflected effort from distance after 12 minutes deceived Aussie 'keeper Melissa Barbieri to open the scoring.
Lisa De Vanna found a way past Solo 15 minutes later before Christen Press restored the U.S.'s lead just after the hour mark.
Rapinoe sealed the win on 78 minutes, a mazy dribble and finish that she described as her "best Lionel Messi impression."

"I probably shoot too much," joked Rapinoe. "It doesn't matter what kind of shot it is for me  I'll take it."
"A couple bits of class in the end from Rapinoe changed the game," said Alen Stajcic, the Australian coach.
The U.S. will be hoping for more moments of magic from Solo and Rapinoe when it plays Sweden on Friday.

ISIS twins: From schoolgirls to jihadi widows 02:37
Just a year ago, twins Salma and Zahra Halane were popular, high-achieving teens, studying hard at school in northern England and aspiring to careers in medical science.
But in June 2014, the pair - then aged 16 -- ran away from what the local community describes as a "very religious family home in northern England, in June 2014, traveling first to Turkey and then across the border into Syria.
Within weeks, according to the ISD, they had both been married to ISIS fighters; on what's believed to be Salma's account, there is advice to other would-be recruits on how to find a husband in ISIS territory.
The ISD says her sister Zahra uses her strong Twitter presence to celebrate and encourage the work of Islamic terrorists.
On September 11, she is said to have tweeted: "Happy #9/11 Happiest day of my life. Hopefully more to come InSha Allah #IS" and she also appeared to revel in news of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in January.
The ISD believes both girls' husbands were killed within days of each other last December. Zahra purportedly announced her husband's "martyrdom" in a tweet on December 6: "He was a blessing from Allah ... I will join him very sooooon :')".
Less than a week later, a post believed to be from Salma: "May Allah accept my husband ... I am among the [wives] of shuhada [martyrs] and [I'm] honoured to be chosen".
CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of either of the posts attributed to the girls by ISD.
The girls, who are of Somali descent, are thought to have been influenced by their older brother, who, according to authorities, traveled to the battlefields of Syria in 2013. He has reportedly left the war behind and is now in Denmark, according to the ISD and a community leader in Denmark.
The family has not responded to CNN's request for comment on this story.
The twins appear defiant on social media, but analysts say such combative public profiles often mask private doubts. But even if the girls do want to leave ISIS, they face a tougher journey than their brother.
"If you are a female and you journey to ISIS territory, it's 10 times harder for you to return back to Western society," explains Saltman. "We have a few hundred cases of men who have returned, but for women it's almost impossible.
"This is because just to leave your house you need to have male permission. You need to have an escort to take you around. Once you arrive in ISIS territory your passport is ... confiscated.  For you to try and leave and wander towards to border is almost impossible."

        <MainBody>How China's astronauts prepare for space 01:23
PLAY VIDEO
In October last year, China launched its most ambitious unmanned space mission to date: to orbit the moon and then return to Earth.
Nicknamed "Xiaofei," or "Little Flyer" on Chinese social networks, the unmanned orbiter traversed 840,000 kilometers on its eight-day mission that saw it round the far side of the moon and take some incredible pictures of Earth and the moon together, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported .
It then successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and parachuted down to the surface in Inner Mongolia.
Wu Yanhua, vice director of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said at the time the successful test mission has gathered a lot of experimental data and laid "a solid foundation for future missions."
While China hasn't committed to it, many analysts think it wants to put a man on the moon.
However, when asked, Commander Nie won't be drawn on whether this is the ultimate goal of the country's space program.
"For the next step, the focus is Tiangong-2  and then we will do more preparatory work for the space station."

        <MainBody>India's poor hit hardest by deadly heat wave 01:35
PLAY VIDEO
India is experiencing Loo winds, hot and dry westerly gusts from Pakistan and northwest India which dries out the region, according to CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett. That means that air moisture, or dew point, is low. When a monsoon advances, and one is expected to hit as early as the end of this week, there is always more dry heat.
Isn't it hot in nearby countries?
Neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan are hot, with temperatures well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but India appears to be suffering far worse, due in part to its many densely populated areas.
About two-thirds of India's 1.2 billion people have access to electricity. That would mean that in India alone about 400 million people do not have reliable access to air conditioning and refrigeration.
And India suffers because of geography. High mountains block cool air coming from the northeast, said Garrett.
It's 42 degrees celsius. A warm wind makes it feel even hotter. #indiaheatwave pic.twitter.com/bclIRPbNB0

Is a hotter future ahead?
India is used to intense early summers. May is typically India's hottest month with temps in some parts of the country hovering around 104 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (around 40 degrees Celsius). Heatwaves are common in India. Hundreds died in 2002 and 2003 as a result of the heat.
Studies suggest India is in for more rough summers . The southern part of the country, which has mostly escaped the buckling heat, is predicted to suffer more heat waves. Overall, more parts of India will suffer heat waves that last longer -- possibly 30 days.
Recent analysis by Verisk MapleCroft suggests that over the course of just one generation, the heat stress currently felt in the worst-hit states of Andra Pradesh and Telangana will be felt across most of the country.
When will the heat wave end?
It's possible that a monsoon could hit by the end of the week and bring relief. On Wednesday night, a light shower in Hyderabad brought some relief to millions who had been praying for rain.
In the meantime, water camps are open and commuters are doing their best to survive.

Man, 41, reunites with his biological mother in Chile after four decades
His mother was told that her baby died shortly after birth, but he was instead adopted by U.S. couple
Chile has thousands of cases of illegal adoptions from the 1970s and 1980s under dictatorship
Santiago, Chile (CNN)
It was a hug kept on hold for more than 41 years. The hug of a mother and son whose lives were abruptly separated four decades ago.
Nelly Reyes had been waiting for hours in the international arrivals lounge at Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport in Santiago, holding a hand-made red poster board sign that said "Lovingly waiting for Travis, your mother Nelly and family." A granddaughter in her early 20s and a 10-year-old grandson keep her company.
On the other side of the terminal, going through immigration and customs, Travis Tolliver was anxious and nervous.  Up until the last minute, mainly because of a language barrier, he didn't know if anybody would show up to greet him.
When he finally came out of the terminal, no words were needed. They rushed to each other's arms and held on for a long hug. Few relatives knew the real story.
Tolliver had tears of joy. "I don't know how I feel. It's crazy! I never thought this could happen," he said.
Reyes, 61, could barely talk. "I'm going to hug him every day. I love him so much," she said.
The emotions released in that hug at the airport were the culmination of four decades of heartbreak, lies, deception, criminal acts and an injustice that separated mother and son at birth.
Stolen at birth
The newborn baby ended up living thousands of miles away, being raised in Tacoma, Washington, by a couple who had no knowledge of what had happened, while his biological mother cried and desperately tried to find her son.
Tolliver says he always knew he was adopted. What the 41-year-old supervisor at an imports distribution center didn't know was that he was stolen as a baby in his native Chile, only hours after his birth.
He hopes that knowing the truth about his past will now allow him to overcome a psychological trauma he has suffered for as long as he can remember. He says he has "abandonment issues."
"You know, I wasn't given up willingly like I thought for all these years, so that makes my heart feel wonderful; but it's just coming to terms with that. This whole thing still seems unreal to me," Tolliver said.
Reyes says she had a normal pregnancy with no medical issues. The mother of six children, including Tolliver, says she gave birth to a healthy baby boy at 4 p.m. on November 15, 1973. She was 19.
But her joy quickly turned to sadness when a nurse told the baby was born with a heart condition and was unlikely to survive.
"Hours later they told me he had died," Reyes said. Despite her multiple pleas, Reyes says she was never shown a body and was never given a death certificate.

Tolliver's case is not unique in Chile, according to Marcela Labraa, the director of the country's child protection agency (SENAME, by its Spanish acronym).
"This is no longer a myth. We know nowadays that this happened and it was real. It's not a tale that a couple of people were telling," Labraa said.
Her agency is currently investigating hundreds of cases, but Labraa says there could be thousands of cases of illegal adoptions from the 1970s and 1980s, when the country was ruled by a repressive dictatorship.
Tolliver and Reyes believe he was stolen. He is now working with authorities to find out what exactly happened to him.
In Chile they call them "Children of Silence."  Some babies were stolen and sold. Other newborns were given away by their grandparents who conspired with doctors, priests and nuns to hide a daughter's socially embarrassing pregnancy.
'Children of Silence' seek truth
Priest investigated
Prosecutor Mario Carroza investigated Gerardo Joannon, a priest accused of acting as a secret liaison between well-to-do families in Chile and adoptive parents as a part of a scheme also involving doctors, nurses and nuns in the 1970s.
Carroza says the priest, who belongs to the Sacred Hearts congregation, was investigated for the crimes of theft of minors, falsification of documents, and usurpation of identity.
To the dismay of those seeking answers, Carroza determined that even though Joannon might have committed those crimes, it was so long ago that he couldn't be prosecuted.
"In this case we're talking about a period between 15 and 20 years ago, which means the statute of limitations has run out," Carroza said.
The congregation to which Father Joannon belongs also conducted an internal investigation last year into the allegations and sent its findings to the Vatican. The Holy See later determined that even though the priest had made ethical and moral mistakes, none of his actions had risen to the level of a violation of canon law.
In his only on-camera interview in April 2014 with Chile's Channel 13, Joannon denied all the accusations, including telling women their children had died in order to give the babies to other couples.
"I never told anybody the babies had died because I didn't even know if they had been born, or if they were male or female," he said on Channel 13. "I never knew anything."
Still
In Tolliver's case, it's not clear who took him from his mother or whether there was any money involved.
Tolliver says his U.S. adoptive parents never knew he had been stolen. They were told he was an abandoned baby.
Tolliver also says he tried to find his biological parents when he was in his 20s but didn't have the connections to make it happen.
It was not until last year, he says, that he determined he needed to find the truth about his past not only for himself, but also for his two children. He says the decision was, in part, motivated by seeing several news stories about stolen children in Chile, including CNN's "Children of Silence."
The news that he was matched to his biological mother through DNA testing has been difficult to digest, Tolliver says, especially for his adoptive mother.
"But she's always going to be my mom --  it's just that I have two now -- she raised me. I am who I am because of what she did for me. She's always going to have a place in my heart and it's not like I'm replacing her or anything like that," Tolliver said.
Reuniting with siblings
Since reuniting with his biological mother, Tolliver has been busy meeting four brothers and one sister and seeing the sights of the country.
"Now I'm back here in my homeland I guess. I'm going to explore and see what the country is all about," he said.
One of his stops was the site where the hospital where he was born once stood. The Enrique Deformes Hospital in the coastal city of Valparaso has since been demolished and Chile's main congressional building now sits in its place.
As to why he would travel such great distance from his home in Yelm, Washington, and spend so much money -- some of it raised through a GoFundMe appea l -- to find the truth about his past, Tolliver is unequivocal. "To become whole," he says choking up and fighting back tears. "I've always felt incomplete, always kind of the outsider. My adoptive parents have blonde hair blue eyes. I just kind of stood out like a sore thumb."
Reyes, his biological mother, has been cooking for him daily and going out of her way to make him feel welcome.  He doesn't speak Spanish and she doesn't speak English.
But more than anything, she's been showing him her love, giving her son the hugs and kisses that she was unable to give him all of the years gone by.

A botanist and historian believes he's discovered picture of Shakespeare
Only two verified likenesses are thought to exist
(CNN)
Is this the Bard I see before me?
That's what botanist and historian Mark Griffiths believes. He says that a drawing of a man on the cover of a 1598 book about plants is a picture of William Shakespeare.
If Griffiths' theory holds up, it would be a major find -- and it's being trumpeted as such by the UK magazine Country Life, which is revealing the discovery in its new issue .
It's "the literary discovery of the century," Country Life editor Mark Hedges told the UK Guardian. "This is the only known verifiable portrait of the world's greatest writer made in his lifetime. It is an absolutely extraordinary discovery; until today, no one knew what William Shakespeare looked like in his lifetime."
There are only two verified likenesses of Shakespeare known today, both from after his death in 1616. One is the famed one of a balding man in a wide collar, taken from the First Folio , published in 1623. The other is a memorial at a church in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon.
If the man on the book, "The Herball," is Shakespeare, he would have been in his early 30s and would have already written a number of the plays based on English kings, including "Richard III" and both parts of "Henry IV." Still in his future were "Hamlet," "Othello," "King Lear" and "Macbeth," all of which probably date from the early 1600s.
To determine that the picture is Shakespeare, Griffiths had to unlock some elaborate Elizabethan codes, he told the Guardian. There are four men pictured on "The Herball," and he figured who three of them were relatively easily: the book's author, John Gerard, the subject of some Griffiths research; botanist Rembert Dodoens; and royal minister William Cecil, Lord Burghley.
But the fourth took some doing.
"He's dressed as a Roman, wearing laurels and meant to make us think of Apollo and poetry. ... I couldn't think of anybody really who was a direct intimate of Gerard's and was involved in writing his book," he told the Guardian.
Through a variety of clues, including an arrowhead, a peculiar flower and a W, Griffiths deduced that the man was Shakespeare.
Hedges believes the theory is correct. "The more you find out about the story, the more it glues together," he said in a Country Life video.
But not to a number of experts.
"There's no evidence that anybody thought that this was Shakespeare at the time," professor Michael Dobson, director of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC .
And in a Guardian essay , art critic Jonathan Jones compared the theory to something Dan Brown would have come up with: "fanciful tosh."
"There is no 'proof' at all here that the moustachioed man in the engraving is Shakespeare," he wrote. "His complex strings of argument are massive acts of overinterpretation."
Griffiths, though, is convinced.
"It is not an assumption that he is Shakespeare, it is algebra. ... It is an equation," he said.
Interpretation, then, may be in the eye of the beholder.
Or as Shakespeare wrote in "Antony and Cleopatra," "In nature's infinite book of secrecy / A little I can read."

Rohingya migrant boat missing in the Andaman Sea 02:32
In the Andaman Sea, aboard a fishing vessel searching Thai waters for vessels carrying refugees, a CNN crew saw several Thai navy vessels on patrol.
Kraiwut Chusakul, a local fisherman, said he's seen one of the many boats filled with Rohingya refugees. "There are so many children on the boat," he said. "I think there must have been around 100 small children."
The boat Kraiwut saw hasn't been seen since, and despite searching and asking other fishing boats if any refugee ships had been spotted, the CNN crew also turned up a blank.
"I feel so sorry for them," Kraiwut said. "It's so different to when you see these refugees on land, and the conditions are so terrible."
Late last week, residents on Koh Lipe Island in southern Thailand could be seen collecting food, water and clothes to take to the migrants on board the boats, but since then the military has told them not to take supplies out to the boats, or to talk to journalists about the situation.
Fortify told CNN that patrol ships stay ahead of those searching for these ships, chasing them out of territorial waters, so journalists and rights groups cannot get a clear understanding of the situation.
The country will host trilateral talks between the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand this week in an attempt to resolve the current impasse, and will again host a larger meeting of ASEAN nations on May 29.
Indonesia
Indonesian military spokesman Fuad Basya told CNN on May 18: "We have four navy vessels guarding our territorial waters in Aceh now. The policy remains -- we won't let any illegal migrants in."
Its foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, will attend meetings in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday in an attempt to find a solution to the growing humanitarian crisis.
However, she told reporters Tuesday that Indonesia has "given more than it should" to help those stranded at sea.
The UNHCR reports that, in the last week, Indonesian fishermen have rescued more than 1,300 Bangladeshis and Rohingya, whose vessels had entered Indonesian territorial waters after they drifted or swam to shore in Aceh and North Sumatran provinces.
The chief of the Aceh Search and Rescue Agency (SAR), Budiawan tells CNN approximately 100 migrants were rescued Wednesday by fishermen and the SAR.
However, Indonesian fishermen were being discouraged from actively searching for and rescuing stranded refugees.
"If they encounter any boats then of course they can rescue and tow them in, for humanitarian reasons. But their job is to catch fish and they shouldn't be going out to search for these boats," Basya said.
The Philippines
Despite being geographically distant from the epicenter of this growing humanitarian crisis, the Philippines has offered to allow the migrant boats landing rights.
The government quickly reacted to a report in local press saying that it would "push back to sea" any refugees that tried to land on Filipino soil.
Herminio Coloma Jr., a spokesperson for the country's Presidential Communications Operations Office said in a statement May 18 that the Philippines has extended humanitarian assistance for "boat people" in the past, citing its establishment of a processing center for Vietnamese migrants in the 1970s.
Citing the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, or which the Philippines is a signatory, Coloma said: "We shall continue to do our share in saving lives under existing and long-standing mechanisms pursuant to our commitments under the Convention."

The Rohingya are a persecuted Muslim minority who are effectively stateless in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are forced to live in crowded camps -- which they are generally forbidden to leave --  and are considered to be interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, despite the fact that many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

More than 1,600 migrants -- both Rohingya and economic migrants from Bangladesh -- have landed in Malaysia and Indonesia since Sunday, May 10, officials say, after Thai officials began cracking down on human trafficking camps operating in the country's south near the Malaysian border, disrupting established people-smuggling networks.

Rohingya migrants swim to collect food supplies dropped by a Thai army helicopter after they jumped from the boar adrift in Thai waters on May 14.  With the Thai pipeline for illegal migrants closed, overcrowded traffickers' boats have begun offloading their human cargo on the shores of Malaysia and Indonesia -- Muslim-majority countries that have shown sympathy to the Rohingya in the past. Alternatively, crews have simply abandoned them to drift.

Ronan Yver took fun photos of farm animals, getting to know their personalities
"I am also telling a story about human beings," Yver said. "I wanted to create caricatures"
(CNN)
You can tell a lot about a person from their expressions. Perplexed eyebrows, pursed lips.
Animals are no different.
From raised noses to lowered heads, outward displays of emotion are not exclusive to humans. But perhaps that isn't the message inked in these portraits taken by Ronan Yver .
Farm animals have their own stories. Their lives consist of more than rolling in the mud and grazing the fields. The perception of farm life cannot be taken at face value. You have to dig deeper for the truth under the skin.
But it's a story they cannot share -- at least not verbally. So Yver decided to document it for them through two lenses: his Canon camera and his literary prowess.
Photographer Ronan Yver
"I shot animals, but I am also telling a story about human beings," Yver said. "I wanted to create caricatures."
As a primary school teacher in Brent, France, he sees the world through tales of personification, from the legendary "Little Red Riding Hood" to the modern "Puss in Boots."
In French poetry, Jean de La Fontaine is well known for his fables that criticized Louis XIV during the 17th century. Fontaine replaced humans with animals: Louis XIV was a lion, aristocracy became wolves or foxes, and the weak were portrayed as lambs.
And thus, Yver's series "Animal Moods" was born out of a respect for allegoric storytelling, a passion for photography and a heavy dose of Animalia.

Yver spent several years with farm animals, getting to know their personalities through his wide-angle lens. Seeing the humanity in their eyes, he began to create a catalog of common feelings and moods and character traits, labeling the photos with captions such as "pride" or "elegance" or "innocence."
"We love our pets, but what about these (animals)?" Yver said. "We feed them and we eat them. But we can also take photographs and tell a story."
And telling that story was not always so easy.
"It's so difficult to take photographs of animals," he said. "I'm so close to them I can't hide! ... Sometimes they want to fight!"

In 2010, photographer Vlad Sokhin gained rare access to the rituals and practices of the Nyau brotherhood, a secret society of the Chewa people that exists in communities in Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. He reveals how he managed to infiltrate, and ultimately join, this secret group. Photographs by Vlad Sokhin.

Vlad Sokhin: "From 2010-2011, I lived in Mozambique's Tete province, where I was doing different jobs. One of them was for a coal exploration company. One day they asked me to photograph the opening ceremony for a new camp. While I was waiting for the ceremony to start, I saw someone pop out of the bush wearing feathers and a mask. Locals started screaming, 'Nyau,' and started to run."

"I had no idea what Nyau was, so I started to do some research," said Sokhin.
"I learned it was a secret society within the Chewa culture. Chewa people live in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. I found out that many locals, and even policemen, were afraid of the Nyau and considered them dangerous. One type of Nyau, known as Nyau 'kampini,' or 'dangerous Nyau,' (pictured) walk around with machetes and have a reputation for attacking people."

"One policeman told me they are never prosecuted. 'How can you put an elephant or snake in jail? The same is with Nyau,' he said. In spite of the rumors, I never heard of any accident involving a Nyau while I was there."

"The performance I witnessed was the Gule Wamkulu, a secret cult and ritual practiced by the Nyau brotherhood during the harvest, as well as important ceremonies, like weddings and funerals. Gule Wamkulu means 'The Great Dance' in the Chewa language. It is performed by the Nyau, who wear masks and costumes that represent the spirits of animals, called 'nyama,' and of their ancestors, called 'mizimu.' The ritual has had UNESCO protection since 2005, when it was included as one of 90 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity."

"After my first encounter with the Nyau, I spent a year in Mozambique looking for more dances, and trying to find members, so I could photograph them. This proved difficult, since everything about the Nyau is kept secret. If you're part of the Nyau cult, you're not supposed to tell anyone."

"Nyau keep both their rituals and their identity a closely-guarded secret. I later learned that during a ritual, the dancers will rotate so no one can tell their identity.
"If you see a whole family watching a dance, maybe the husband will leave for a bit then go to a secret place to change and dance, then come back so his mother, sister or wife won't know he's a member. If one dancer falls down and injures himself and starts limping, all members of the Nyau will start limping so no one can identify the injured dancer. "

"One day I met a teacher from Zimbabwe named Ofis, who started to ask me why I was so interested in the Nyau. We ultimately became friends, and he confessed that he was a member. I started to learn about the cult from him, but he said if I wanted to know more, I'd have to join."

"Ofis talked to the chiefs, and they agreed I could be a spectator at first, but nothing more. I started to go every week and take pictures of the dances, but I wanted to see more. I wanted to go inside and see how they made their masks.
"First, I had to be accepted as a member of the Nyau. One day, they said they were willing to accept me, but I would have to go through a ceremony."

"Afterward, I had to kill a chicken with the other new members, so we could take the feathers and add them to our costumes later. Later, I was brought to a nearby village, where I was covered in a fabric and flowers, and the Nyau came out, already in costume."

"This photograph is of the initiation. When I was initiated, they hit me a little bit with a stick -- hitting is an important part of the ceremony as it serves as a warning not to reveal the secrets of the Nyau.
"They removed the fabric and started dancing and I danced with them. We danced the whole night, then they took me to their hidden place -- the cemetery. They told me, 'Now, you're Nyau.' They gave me my own mask and costume and started to teach me how to dance."

6,400 employees at a Chinese company were sent to France for a company paid trip
The staff also broke a Guinness World Record for building the largest human sentence in Nice
(CNN)
More than 6,000 employees of Tiens Group -- a Chinese conglomerate -- were given the VIP treatment on an all expenses paid trip to France to celebrate the company's 20th birthday.
The tour group -- the largest to visit the country -- was given a private tour of the Louvre museum and a private shopping session  at luxury department store Galeries Lafayette during their four-day trip, reported French news agency Agence France-Presse.
After two days in Paris, the group headed down to the southern resort town of Nice on Friday, where they also broke a Guinness World Record for forming the largest human sentence.
All staff members lined up on the waterfront, Promenade des Anglais, to spell out the phrase "Tiens' dream is nice in the Cte d'Azur" that was visible from above.
The Chinese company broke a Guinness World Record for building the largest human sentence in Nice, France.
According to local media, the company booked 4,760 rooms in 79 hotels between Cannes and Monaco, and 146 tour buses.
"We have mobilized public services as well as tourism professionals, hotels, restaurants, shops and designer brands," Christian Mantel, head of the French tourism development agency told AFP.
It's estimated that the group will spend $15 million during their visit added Mantel, and France is seen to reap up to $20 million in total economic benefits.
Chinese tourists, who are known to be the world's biggest holiday spenders, are said to spend an average of $7,200 when they go overseas.
It's not the first time a Chinese company has arranged for massive tours overseas. Last year, a group of 7,000 made a trip to the U.S. to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties.
Tiens Group operates in a diverse range of business interests, including biotechnology, tourism and trade.

About 12,000 Mormons practice their faith in Cambodia
Mormons believe that families can be eternally connected through the practice of posthumous baptism
Cambodia's history of civil war and genocide make tracing family genealogy challenging
(Special to CNN)
When Eng Bunhuoch joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the late 1990s, there were just a handful of families practicing Mormonism in Cambodia.
Today, the Salt Lake City-based church claims more than 12,000 parishioners in this predominantly Buddhist nation.
That growth has come with a challenge for church leaders, who are now working to encourage fellow converts to engage in what Mormons consider a sacred duty: digging into family history for a Mormon ritual intended to give the dead an opportunity for a better afterlife.

But in a nation cursed by decades of civil war and one of the worst genocides in history -- a place where dredging up the past can be a tremendously painful experience -- that hasn't been an easy sell.
"Most people," said Eng, now the lay leader of a Mormon church in Phnom Penh, "prefer not to do it."
The Mormon preoccupation with family history research is connected to a belief that families can be eternally connected through the practice of posthumous baptism. The rite has stirred controversy in the past: The church has apologized on several occasions in which it was revealed that members performed such proxy baptisms for Jewish victims of the Nazi regime. Mormons now are instructed to only submit for baptism the names of those who are in their own family lineage.
Sophat Yin, who grew up in the western Cambodian city of Battambang during the Khmer Rouge regime and is now an organizer at the Cambodian Buddhist Society in Fresno, California, is troubled by the proxy baptisms for many of the same reasons Jewish survivors of the Holocaust were. Most of the estimated 1.8 million people killed during the Khmer Rouge's brutal four-year rule in the 1970s were Buddhist. And Buddhist leaders, he said, weren't consulted about the practice. It was just assumed, he noted, that they'd be fine with the same rules as were settled upon with leaders of other religions.
"We Buddhists believe in afterlife, reincarnation and karma," he said. "If I were to die during the Khmer Rouge time, I would ask Mormons to leave me alone."
Still, he said, since he doesn't believe the practice holds any spiritual weight on the souls of the dead, he is trying to not feel offended and trying to look at it as a harmless offered blessing.
In Cambodia, Mormon believers' efforts to baptize family members -- including some of those slaughtered during the Khmer Rouge rule -- have also thus far met with little public backlash. But that might be because, at least for the moment, the work is quite limited.
Samnang Kang, who was recently appointed to work as a family history consultant for church members in Phnom Penh, said last's year's goal was to submit 1,600 names to LDS temple workers in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Parishioners could only manage 1,322.
This year, she said, "we haven't set a goal."
A big part of the challenge is a lack of records. The Khmer Rouge, which occupied the nation from 1975 to 1979, is thought to have destroyed about half of all government records -- the kinds of documents frequently used by Mormons in other nations and which are provided even to non-believers through the church's FamilySearch.org service.
Many more documents weren't specifically targeted for destruction, but were left unprotected during the regime and either looted or ruined by nature, said Khamboly Dy, a staff member at the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has worked since 1995 to recover and restore the record of the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign.

"It is important to us to collect all the remaining documents and conduct interviews to reconstruct the record," he said.
To that end, the center has recorded conversations with more than 6,000 people -- a tiny fraction of the millions of individuals who survived the regime. But those oral histories are driven by an open-ended questionnaire and don't necessarily include genealogical information that would be helpful to those trying to trace their ancestry.
The center does have what might amount to a treasure trove of information for family history sleuths: As militaries are wont to do, the Khmer Rouge created detailed personnel records for many in its cadres. Center staffers said those records often do include information about soldiers' parents and other family members.
While Cambodian society generally treats Khmer Rouge foot soldiers as victims of the regime, that tolerance is at least partially contingent on a general disinclination to re-examine the past, as opening military personnel files might do. Equally if not more potentially painful: In studying the center's documents, family history searchers might happen upon the name of an ancestor only because another family member gave up that person's name under interrogation or torture.
Local Mormon leaders said they haven't yet asked to look into the documentation center's vaults, though the center's director, Youk Chhang, said he would welcome their queries. He noted that religion, in general, "was the enemy of the Khmer Rouge revolution" and that any avenue "for healing, forgiveness, and moving on" is worth exploring in a nation in which victims and perpetrators of atrocities still live, work and worship side by side.
The center's records potentially could help equalize family history resources in Southeast Asia. The LDS church has managed to acquire an extensive collection of government records from other countries across the region and has published those records on its family history website. However, the site has no historical records from Cambodia.
Paul Nauta, a public relations specialist for the LDS Church who specializes in family history, said even without records "the average person can usually remember three generations back. If you are fortunate to have a parent or grandparent still living, that affords the individual to trace their family history back up to six generations."
But Nauta said only a small set of patrons in Cambodia have listed more than four generations.
Including herself and her children, that's all Vanna Kim has been able to produce. And even at that, she said, "I had to pray for a miracle" that her Buddhist aunt and uncle would help her identify the names of her grandparents.
She's glad to have done her part to build the record base, but genealogy isn't for her. "It was an obligation," she said.
Khoem Samphon, whose written family tree is also only four generations deep, said it isn't just the governmental records that were lost in the Khmer Rouge years. The types of keepsakes many people use to trace back their lineage were often lost, too.
He was 27 years old when the Khmer Rouge swept into Phnom Penh and forced the relocation of millions of people across the country.
"We didn't bring any records with us," he said. "At that time, records were not important. Food was important."
Some of what was left behind -- family photographs, for instance -- are now sold, apparently for souvenirs, at ephemera shops catering to foreign tourists. Some of the pictures have names penciled on the back, but few have any more context than that.
Even if they did, it might not be helpful. Cambodians cycle through family names every few generations, and a lot of people changed their names when the Khmer Rouge came to power to hide familial affiliations.
"Because we were a political family, we did not want anyone to know where we came from," said Sok Mony, whose family didn't reclaim its name until long after the Khmer Rouge had left power.
For a time, during those years, she went by the name Eang Bunna.
"My family kept hiding until 1991," she said, "but my mother wouldn't open up about the past for many years after that."
Cambodians are rightfully proud of their distant past, said physician Lim Keuky, who lives and works minutes away from Angkor Wat, a thousand-year-old temple that draws hundreds of thousands of tourists to Cambodia each year and whose iconic towers appear on everything from the nation's favorite beer to its red, white and blue flag. But, he said, fellow Cambodians -- about 60% of whom are under the age of 30 -- generally prefer to ignore the much more recent past.
"That is why, if you go to someone who is 18 years old and talk about how genocidal the Khmer Rouge was, she would say, 'It's not possible -- you must be lying,' because the parents who lived at that time they don't want to remember," he said. "In trying to forget, then the same thing can come again."
But Lim, the president of the Cambodian Diabetes Association, noted that family history is also important for helping identify those most at risk for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. And increasingly, he added, researchers are demonstrating such conditions may be worse among those whose ancestors suffered traumatic stress, as so many Cambodians have.
"I want to say it strongly -- I cannot say it strongly enough -- that Cambodians must work to remember the past," Lim said.
Eng, who last year was appointed as a stake president to lead a new church by his home, said he also is hopeful his fellow Cambodians will wake up to the importance of learning about their family history, and not just for the purposes of Mormon rituals.
Logging into a computer at the church, he called up his family history profile on the genealogy website. Soon he was face to face with a black and white photograph of his father.
"You see," he laughed, "he is handsome like me."
Eng understands why Cambodians are hesitant to dig into their family roots; he was a member of the LDS church for more than a decade before he began to do so.
But now, Eng said, he'd like everyone to have the same experience he had once he began looking for long-lost relatives.
"When I would work on finding relatives," he said, "I pulled out my dad's picture and it felt like he was close to me again."

CNN's Moni Basu reported this story last week from the region where the epicenter of Tuesday's earthquake was located.
Lukla, Nepal (CNN)
The Goma Air flight makes a swift turn over jagged white peaks and lush Himalayan farmlands before a herky-jerky landing in what's been called the world's most dangerous airport.
Phurba Sherpa hurtles off the prop plane that on this day has carried four adults, two children and 16 gray bags that each weigh 53 pounds. Inside are industrial-strength, family-size tents donated by the German Red Cross.
In the aftermath of the enormous earthquake that shook Nepal, Phurba, a 49-year-old Kathmandu entrepreneur, has made it his business to get relief to his people. By that he means the Sherpas, the ethnic minorities who inhabit the towns and villages in the shadow of Mount Everest and are known worldwide as expert climbers.
The Sherpas prop up Nepal's lucrative trekking and tourism business, but the government, Phurba says, has never looked out for them. Isolated in remote mountainous villages, they have been a forgotten people in Nepal and now, after the earthquake, they fear being forgotten again.
For Phurba, the journey from the Kathmandu Valley up to the soaring peaks is not just a humanitarian mission to help thousands of people living in quake-affected villages.
It's personal.
"It is my duty," he says of the responsibility he feels to give back to the majestic land and people who shaped him as a man.
Phurba has no time to lose.
Namche Bazaar is usually bustling at this time of year in Nepal with mountaineers on their way to Everest Base Camp. Now, the town is dotted with tents filled with displaced people.
Few others are here to help. There's no Nepalese government presence. Nor do I see any of the hordes of international aid workers and members of the media who descended on Kathmandu within days of the earthquake.
Granted, the villages and towns that dot the hills and mountains under Everest are not as badly affected as other areas closer to the earthquake's epicenter. People here are not lacking for food and water at the moment. This is a region in eastern Nepal where the tourism industry has helped people fare better moneywise.
But Nepal is not just a poor nation; it is one of the poorest. And now, the tourist season has abruptly ended for two years in a row. Last year, a giant block of ice broke free and crashed down into the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp, killing 16 Sherpas.
The people here worry if they will ever be able to recover from tragedy. They wonder if tourists and trekkers will even consider returning to a place of such risk and sorrow.
Their villages are also places that can be extremely difficult to access -- there are no roads and the only way to travel is on foot. Some say it's hard to get aid delivered. But Phurba says there are ways -- donkeys are a popular means of transporting goods.
"If we wait for the government, it will take a lot of time," he says, blaming red tape and a lack of will.
I watch him make arrangements in his orange puffy down jacket, standing against the Himalayan vistas that tourists pay a lot of money to experience. I see a man who is determined amid a crisis of gigantic proportions.
I'd met Phurba in Kathmandu a few days earlier when I wrote about American mountaineer and filmmaker Tom Taplin , one of 19 known to have died on Everest. Phurba, who owns his own Himalayan tourism compan y, helped make all the arrangements for Taplin's body to be brought back down the mountain.
Phurba lamented to me then about the plight of his people. The attention, he said, has been cast on foreigners who were killed, injured or trapped, but not the Sherpas without whom Nepal's bustling trekking industry would not be possible. He told me a young man from his village was killed at the base camp and that the family is in mourning.
I asked if I could accompany him on his whirlwind trip to Solukumbhu District, thousands of feet above sea level. Two days later, I find myself racing to keep up with him.
Phurba Sherpa, center, discusses the earthquake's toll with Bal Bahadur KC, left, a  member of Nepal's Parliament who represents the district in which most of the affected Sherpa villages fall.
'Please help us'
At the Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla, the town where thousands of trekkers fly in to begin their journeys toward the skies, Phurba oversees the unloading of the Red Cross tents. Then he hops into a Fishtail helicopter that whisks him away to Phakding, where the lawmaker who represents this district is waiting.
Phurba invited Bal Bahadur KC on this assessment tour because he wanted someone from the government to see the earthquake's devastation in this part of country. Maybe then, Phurba thought, someone in Kathmandu would pay attention to the needs of his people.
We land in Phakding and find Bal Bahadur with his right arm in a sling. He has trouble getting onto the chopper. I ask him if he was injured in the earthquake. "No," he laughs. "I hurt it before then. But now I know what it feels like to have a broken arm."
The helicopter has no seats -- they were taken out to bring down the bodies of the dead from Everest Base Camp.
Pilot Mauritzio Folini tells me he used to love flying here -- joy rides in the sky in a place that arguably has the most fantastic views on Earth. The Nepalese name for Everest is Sagarmatha. Sagar means sky in Nepalese and matha, head. I am in a land that touches the heavens. From the helicopter, it's plain to see why that name is appropriate.

Only now, after the earthquake, this land is dotted with pockets of hell.
In the last few days, maneuvering the light helicopter around the peaks and through deep canyons has turned into a gruesome chore as Folini has made countless rescue flights up and down to Everest Base Camp.
"I am a climber myself. I love my job," Folini says. "But now ... it's a tragedy."
We land at a gravel heliport in front of the police station in Khunde, 13,000 feet above sea level, and walk down narrow dirt lanes that snake around clusters of stone, cement and wooden houses.
The landscape has a recent addition: hundreds of colorful tents made by North Face, Marmot and Mountain Hardwear. Households in Khunde and other Sherpa villages have at least one person employed in the tourism industry and many own high-end outdoor gear given to them by foreigners or knockoffs sold in the local markets.
Phurba surveys the destruction, writes down names and the amount of loss. Some houses have been flattened; others are severely damaged. Few have escaped unscathed.
This is where his wife grew up. It's shocking for Phurba to witness the devastation.
"How are you doing?" he asks everyone he sees.
The answer is like a song's refrain that he hears over and over.
"I was at the Saturday market and that is why I am alive," says Da Tsering Sherpa, 40. "But my house is destroyed."
"I have lost everything," says Pasang Lamu, 55, breaking down. "Please help us."
Phurba finds his wife's relatives. They are camping out in a tiny tent; their broken houses still stand as constant reminders of their suffering. Phurba has stayed in those houses so many times, shared meals there with loved ones.
"All gone," Phurba says to me. "This will all have to be rebuilt."
I can tell Phurba is making a heroic effort not to betray his emotions at this moment.
"We are the lucky ones," he says. "We are alive. There is no time to be sad. We have lots of work to do."
We trek through several villages, up and down dirt paths laden with rocks.
The same scenes of despair -- and frustration -- play out everywhere. Foundations shaken to the core, roads blocked off by falling rocks and with the upcoming monsoons, the threat of massive landslides along the fresh cracks in the earth.
In nearby Khumjung, Bal Bahadur doles out $400 -- a token amount -- to people who lost loved ones. That's what the government gave as compensation to the families of the 16 Sherpas who died on Everest last year. They saw the meager sum as derisory, government indifference to the Sherpas and the dangerous jobs they perform.
Those who lost their houses receive $100 on this afternoon. In this area alone, 164 houses are documented as gone. Bal Bahadur tries to assure residents that help is on the way.
"I will not forget you," he tells the people.
But few believe the government's intentions are true.
"We are citizens of Nepal," says Phurba's friend, Chungbu Sherpa. "And that is all. Beyond that there is no relationship. We have to take it upon ourselves to help each other."
Schoolteacher Chhunjing Dorjee Sherpa, 50, listens to what Bal Bahadur has to say but has little faith that the lawmaker will come through.
"Do you feel that aid is coming?" I ask.
"This is the Nepal government," he says. Maybe he will rely instead on a grant from a nonprofit or perhaps a bank will issue him a low-interest loan.
A woman who runs a small restaurant has few customers. Sherpas who serve the tourist community are hurting after two failed Everest climbing seasons.
Near Phakding, we see a centuries-old teaching monastery that barely withstood the earthquake. The 28 Buddhist monks and 18 students who live here are busy putting up wood supports to mitigate the risks of everything crashing down.
Phurba has made it a priority to generate money to get the monastery repaired. It's his history. His culture. It's like seeing the fallen temples and palaces in Kathmandu's UNESCO World Heritage site, national treasures that will never be the same.
He stays behind to discuss reparations. Nawang Nuru Sherpa, 38, works as a guide for Phurba and accompanies me to Phakding. On the way we stop to survey Nawang's property.
He gazes at the fertile farmlands. The fields are a vibrant green with new wheat; potatoes abound in the soil the color of charcoal. Beyond that, he sees his home, still standing but precariously.
He pitched a tent for himself, his wife, 9-year-old son and infant daughter. He saved as many things as he could from the house and arranged them in the tent as though it were home.
But it isn't.
"I am afraid no tourists will come here anymore," Nawang says. "Then how will I get money to rebuild my house?"
It is something that preoccupies Phurba.
He had planned to let me stay at a lodge he built a few years ago. But we arrive instead to heavy damage to all 20 rooms and 22 bathrooms. Boulders lie in front of a fireplace on the second-floor landing as though they, like an evil Santa Claus, hurtled down the chimney.
It took Phurba five years to build this lodge; nature took a few seconds to destroy it. He suspects he will have to demolish and rebuild by mid-September when the monsoons have ended and the fall Himalayan season begins. He estimates it will easily cost $300,000 to make the necessary fixes.
I tell him I am sorry for his losses and that even amid the destruction, it's hard not to be overcome by the beauty of this land.
"Bahut sundar hai," I say in Hindi to some of Phurba's employees. "It's very beautiful here."
One replies. "Bauhut sundar tha."
"It was very beautiful."
Helicopters usually ferry climbers to Everest Base Camp. This year, they have been carrying those who died or were injured in the quake back to lower ground.
A day of suffering
Seeing his wife's village in ruins was hard enough, but Phurba's heart shattered when he learned of the earthquake's wrath on Chaurikharka, the village he calls home. He dreaded seeing it. On the second day of our trek, he tells me to go ahead to Chaurikharka. He will follow later.
It takes six hours to reach the village. There is no doubting nature's wrath here.
Sheets of corrugated metal that flew off roofs and sides of houses obstruct the main dirt path. Chunks of stone and cement tumbled to the earth.
Nima Kiter, 74, rushes toward me waving his hands in the air.
"Everything gone," he says in broken English. "We would all be dead if this had happened at night."
Most of the residents of Chaurikharka know Phurba and are relieved that a native son has taken charge of rebuilding the village.
When Phurba was born 49 years ago, most Sherpas, including his father, either worked the land growing buckwheat and potatoes or they were traders selling goods from Tibet and India. But Phurba grew up as a new industry was blossoming: tourism.
Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary scaled to the summit of the world's tallest mountain in 1953, challenging climbers from all over the world to match their feat.
Many Sherpa men began charging foreigners money for acting as their guides, porters and support staff through this unforgiving terrain.
Purbha's father pushed him from an early age to get into the trekking business. But the headmaster at his school recalls how Purbha snuck away to study. He was determined to learn, leave the village and carve out a successful life for himself.
"My parents were disappointed in me," Phurba had told me when I first met him. "But I knew education was the key to seeing the world."
He saved the money from his occasional trekking jobs and left for Kathmandu. He paid for college tuition with his earnings from an aunt's tea shop and earned a degree in journalism and then a master's in sociology.
"There were no Sherpas in journalism then," he told me. "I wanted to make a difference."
But then Mount Everest became big business, and in 1992, Phurba launched his own firm: Himalayan Sherpa Adventure. With it has come success, a large house and a comfortable existence for Phurba and his family in one of the poorest nations on Earth. A huge number of Nepalese live on $15 a month, and poverty is worst in remote mountainous villages.
The Sherpa guides I speak with all tell me Mount Everest saved them, that the trekking business has been lucrative. But the work is seasonal and meant for the young and strong. And now, after the earthquake, the future looks grim.
In popular tourist spots like Lukla and Phakding, I see empty guesthouses. Lodge owners say that after the earth shook, everyone and everything went downhill.
The planes landing at Lukla airport are normally full of people this time of year. But these days, they land only with cargo. Rice, tents, medical supplies. The tourists who are still here are clamoring to go the other way.
Phurba knows the worst may still be on the horizon for his people whose livelihoods are dependent on trekkers. The end result of falling tourism will mean no jobs.
"And the people will suffer even more," he says.
On this day, the suffering is greatest at Dawa Chiri Sherpa's house.
The 27-year-old worked as an assistant for mountaineers attempting to reach the summit. He was at the base camp when a quake-triggered avalanche thundered down the mountain.
Inside the heavily damaged family home, everyone is still mourning. They invite me inside and for a moment I think about what might happen if the second floor came crashing down. I climb the creaky stairs and see a Buddhist monk. He is sitting by a window chanting prayers in front of 13 flickering oil lamps. Dawa's mother cannot stop her tears.
Dawa owned a yak and used to work as a porter, his brother Tenzing tells me. But that was a hard life, walking uphill with hundreds of pounds of gear and not making that much money.
So Dawa completed a mountaineering course and became a climbing Sherpa; some of them earn as much as $7,000 in the two-month Everest season. That's more than 10 times the average Nepalese wage.
Everyone knew it was tiring and extremely dangerous work, especially Dawa's wife, Phura Yangzi. She last spoke with her husband the day before the earthquake.
"Tomorrow is my rest day at base camp," he told her. That was the last time she heard from him.
It took the family two days to retrieve Dawa's body, even though he worked for a trekking company that had the resources to bring him down. Ultimately, it was Phurba's friend, Chungba Sherpa, who made the arrangements.
"My brother died, but no one helped us," Tenzing tells me over a traditional Sherpa meal of boiled potatoes and freshly ground chili sauce. "No one from the government or from his company has contacted us. No one has said sorry. Who will take care of his wife and baby?"
Phura Yangzi carries 18-month old Chiring Dolma on her back as she carries on with her chores. Sometimes, she thinks it's all a bad dream; that her husband is still on Everest. She got married two years ago and at age 22, she is a widow with a child.
She tells me she is worried for her daughter's future. How will she get an education without a father earning money? She says she will try her hand as a street vendor, selling sodas and mineral water to tourists.
"It will be difficult but I will try," she says. "I have to."
In this land of incredible beauty, nature exacted a heavy toll.
The eternal mountain
I ponder the tough lives of the Sherpas on the uphill trek back to Lukla. I only have a backpack -- a porter is carrying my heavier bag, just like they do for tourists. I have been walking all day and the last stretch seems the most strenuous.
On the way, I see a 63-year-old man carrying what he estimates to be 130 pounds of goods on his back. I am in awe of his strength and his ability to carry on without complaint.
In Lukla, I meet back up with Phurba, who has come from seeing his own village and is making arrangements to fix damaged structures and bring in more aid to his people.
"Base camp has become very big news, but you see how thousands of people have been affected," he says. "There are many places that are really poor, are really miserable. It is my job to support those in need."
"Wasn't it hard to see your wife's village, to see your own village lie in ruins?" I ask.
"Some people cry with their eyes," he says, "and others don't. But that doesn't mean I am not sad."
He says he has to worry about his people's livelihoods in the future.
During the recession, when his company felt the sting of fewer Americans spending money on global travel, his friends assured him.
"Don't worry," they said. "You will have no problem as long as you have Everest."
Phurba -- and his people -- are counting on that again.

FAA questioned mental health of Germanwings pilot

Germanwings pilot identified
Washington (CNN)
Years before Andreas Lubitz crashed a commercial airliner into the French Alps, the Federal Aviation Administration raised questions about his mental health, declining to give him a medical certificate.
The agency switched course about three weeks later in 2010 after a physician working with Lubitz said his treatment was complete.
That and other findings are revealed in documents obtained by CNN through a public records request that cover a time frame between April 2008 and July 2010 -- the period in which Lubitz was in Arizona training to be a pilot for Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Lubitz is accused of purposely slamming a Germanwings jetliner into the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. He suffered from bouts of depression and the incident sparked a global debate over how to properly monitor the mental health of pilots.

OPINION: Germanwings co-pilot -- an accident waiting to happen?
According to the documents, Lubitz suffered from "reactive depression," which the medical examiner said was caused by "modified living conditions" and "decompensation subsequent to excessive demands." Reactive depression can resolve itself when the individual recovers from an overwhelming event, according to Jacqueline Brunetti, who works as a medical examiner for commercial pilots.
From January through October 2009, Lubitz received psychotherapeutic treatment, which included two medications for depression -- Cipralexone and Mirtazapine, both anti-depressants.
"The use of 2 drugs would suggest that maybe a single drug was not sufficiently effective," said Burnetti, who did not treat Lubitz, but said pairing anti-depressants could indicate an inability to "cope with either day to day work and/or home demands.'"
It is not entirely clear when his depression began. But a document from April 2008 identifies Lubitz as medically fit to fly . Lufthansa CEO Carsten Sphor told reporters after the crash that Lubitz interrupted his training at some point in 2009. That break lasted several months. Medical documents do not reference that break or reveal why he took it.
But it is clear from the documents that once treatment for his reactive depression was complete in October 2009, Lubitz applied to have his medical certificate and student pilot certificate renewed.
Then, there is something of a mystery.
On a June 14, 2010 questionnaire for a medical and student pilot certificate, Lubitz checked "no" when asked whether he presently or in the past experienced "mental disorders of any sort; depression, anxiety, etc."
There is another copy of the same questionnaire with the same June 14, 2010 date. But on this form, Lubitz checked "yes." That second document indicated that the medical examiner modified the questionnaire to reflect Lubitz suffered from "reactive depression" from November 2008 through July 2009.
Contacted by CNN, the FAA couldn't definitively explain the existence of the two questionnaires.
Germanwings 'black box' shows co-pilot Andreas Lubitz sped up descent
"The questionnaire is done electronically," said Laura Brown, a spokesperson for the FAA. "In some cases an airman may fill out the first page of the questionnaire before visiting with the doctor and once the doctor's visit is complete the form is updated," she said.
She added that even after it's updated, the original form "still lives in the system."
When asked if they were aware of the existence of two conflicting medical documents, Germanwings Senior Vice President of Communications Joachim Shttes said "no" and that they were "unaware" if both of the documents were submitted to the airline.
"I want to point out that the (First Officer) had been medically cleared to fly and hold all the requisite licenses," he said.
Lubitz had not always been cleared to fly, however.
A July 8, 2010 letter from the FAA's  Aerospace Medical Certification Division informed Lubitz that after reviewing his medical examination results the FAA was "unable to establish your eligibility to hold an airman medical certificate" due to his history of "reactive depression."
Dr. Warren Silberman, who prepares FAA medical certifications, signed that letter and requested a detailed medical status report from Lubitz' prescribing physician detailing "when medication(s) were discontinued  and confirmation of no reoccurrence of the symptoms since discontinuing medication(s)."
In the letter, Silberman also requested "a diagnosis, prognosis with medication(s) and  follow-up plan" before consideration of reinstating Lubitz medical certificate and student pilot certificate.
The tortuous trail to 'Why?'
In order to fly again, Lubitz would need his physician to vouch that he had successfully been treated and was no longer suffering from reactive depression.
Lubitz' medical records show the medical specialist treating him wrote two letters saying Lubitz had successfully completed treatment. One was addressed to Lubitz and the other to an airline medical examiner, although the name of that person was redacted.
That letter to the airline official states "considerable remission has been obtained" and "medication has been tapered." It described Lubitz as being "without memory disorders and phobias" and "mentally stable."
After he was cleared by his psychotherapist, the FAA sent a new letter to Lubitz stating he was cleared to fly. That letter was also signed Silberman and it included that precautions must be taken in order for Lubitz to fly.
"You are cautioned to abide by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR's), Section 61.53, relating to physical deficiency. Because of your history of reactive depression, operation of aircraft is prohibited at any time new symptoms or adverse changes occur or any time medication and/or treatment is required," Silberman wrote.
But Silberman says this is nothing more than a self-monitoring system.
"You don't see the airman with the number of cases so you have to rely on how good the letter is," he said.
In other words, FAA certifiers don't see the actual airman. CNN was unable to reach Jrg Siedenburg, the aviation medical examiner listed in the documents as the physician Lubitz visited for clearance to fly.
But the decision to approve or deny a pilot who was once deemed ineligible to fly is based on doctors' letters, Silberman said. And in his opinion, the letter Lubitz' physician provided "was a very complete and legit letter."
Silberman added: I "had no reason to question its accuracy."

Jimmy Savile abused at least 22 pupils at a former girls' school, a Surrey police report says
Since Savile died in 2011, he has been exposed as a serial sex abuser and pedophile
The abuse at Duncroft school occurred during visits by the TV star in the 1970s, police say
London (CNN)
At least 22 pupils and a visitor at a former school for troubled girls in southeast England were sexually abused by the late British TV star Jimmy Savile in the 1970s, a report by Surrey police has concluded.
The report said that at least 46 offenses of abuse occurred, including one rape, at the Duncroft Approved School in Staines, a town to the west of London.
An initial police investigation into Savile's behavior at Duncroft, a school for socially vulnerable girls, began in 2007 and ended with Savile being interviewed under caution in 2009, when he denied the allegations of 14 pupils.
A second investigation, dubbed Operation Outreach, was launched in 2012 after a documentary by UK broadcaster ITV revealed that Savile -- once one of the most beloved people in Britain, a radio DJ and television star with big hair, a big cigar and an even bigger attitude -- was a serial sex abuser.
Since then Savile, who died in 2011 , has become one of the most reviled figures in the country as it becomes clear that he sexually abused untold numbers of people over decades.
The latest revelations about his abuses at Duncroft school come on the heels of other reports detailing assaults by Savile on children, hospital patients or those with mental health problems .
Operation Outreach found that Savile visited Duncroft at least 16 times between 1974 and 1979, and that he stayed overnight at the school on at least two occasions.
He was likely to have taken the pupils out unaccompanied by staff on several occasions and was given "significant" access to the school's grounds and buildings, which appears to have been unrestricted and largely unsupervised, the report said.
Pupils were abused in multiple locations throughout the school, including the principal's office, and in vehicles brought to the school by Savile, police found.
Of the 23 victims, "ten were abused on a single occasion by Savile," the report says, and "thirteen were abused on at least two occasions."
The four types of abuse listed in the report are rape, assault by penetration, causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and sexual assault.
The school was closed from late 1979 until 1982, and shut its doors for good in 1991.
As well as seeking to establish the scope of Savile's offenses at the school, Operation Outreach also looked at what was known by former members of staff there -- and whether any had committed offenses as a result.
Surrey police submitted a file last year to the Crown Prosecution Service on two of those former staff members, but the agency decided not to bring criminal charges on the grounds there was no realistic prospect of conviction.
In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Cundy said Surrey police "has always accepted there are things which should have been done differently" in the force's original 2007-2009 investigation.
But he added those inquiries "predated much of what we now know about Savile and his pattern of abuse."

The conservationist grew up in Uganda after his parents fled Rwanda as refugees.
His father traveled to other countries in search of work, leaving his mother to raise him and his four siblings. In 1995, his family reunited in Rwanda where a trip to the Volcanoes National Park would change everything.

Nineteen of the 43 eggs are completely intact, a museum official says
Hong Kong (CNN)
The Chinese city that boasts the largest number of dinosaur eggs in the world has added a new batch to its impressive collection.
Construction workers unearthed 43 fossilized dinosaur eggs during road repair work in Heyuan city in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong on Sunday, officials said.
The city, which calls itself the "Home of Dinosaurs," won a Guinness World Record for the world's largest collection of dinosaur eggs at its museum in 2004.
A crowd gathered around the site along a main road where the fossils were discovered in Heyuan city.
EXPAND IMAGE
Huang Zhiqing, deputy director of the Heyuan Museum, told CNN that it was the first time the fossils have been discovered in the bustling city center.
Major road repair work was halted as a team of researchers and construction workers jumped down into a ditch to dig out the fossils.
Eggs as wide as 5 inches
Nineteen of the eggs are completely intact, with the largest measuring as much as 13 centimeters (5 inches) in diameter, Huang said.
Researchers said they will continue to examine the fossils to determine which dinosaur species they belong to.
Most of the eggs in the museum's existing collection belong to oviraptorid and duck-billed dinosaurs, which roamed the earth 89 million years ago.
Nearly 17,000 dinosaur eggs have been uncovered in the city since the first group of fossils was found in 1996 by children playing at a construction site, the China's official news agency Xinhua reported.

        <MainBody>WHAT did they do this Shih Tzu?!
Sudan's female companions,  Fatu and Najin, live at the conservancy, where experts are scrambling to ensure the subspecies does not go extinct.
The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs.
In addition to round-the-clock security, the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching.
The conservancy is also raising funds to help equip and train rangers who guard the rhinos.
On the verge of extinction
At 42, Sudan is elderly in rhino years. Fatu, 15, is a spring chicken, while Najin is 25.
Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy.
"Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female," he says.
Najin could conceive, but her hind legs are so weak, she may be unable to support a mounted male .
"There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years, but not conceptions," Paul says. "Based on  a recent health examination conducted, both animals have a regular estrus cycle, but no conception has been recorded."
And if one is not recorded soon, the beloved animal will go extinct.
Alternative methods to conceive
In a race against time, international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies.
The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. Though the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts say.
A committee at the conservancy is also looking at various alternative reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization.
"In other countries, success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species, thus that, as a technique, can be presupposed to be the most promising," Paul says. "However, consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward."
Countdown to extinction
The need to preserve the northern white rhino is dire.
"Realistically, we are looking at these animals dying in the next decade or so. But hopefully, using artificial methods of reproduction, we might be able to bring them back in the future," Paul says. "This might mean that it will happen when the current animals are already deceased, but it could happen."
The conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos --  two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year.
In another incident, another male, Angalifu, died at the San Diego Zoo last year, bringing the subspecies closer to extinction.
There are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild.
A total of five remain in captivity worldwide: three in Kenya,  and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic.
But Sudan, a male, is in a company of one.

The professor's statistics confirm what they have seen in the glaciers above their town and in the ice beneath their boots.
"When I came here as a boy, the (Bossons) was several hundred meters below," says Seb, was we dig our axes into the ice. "At the moment we can still enjoy it but in 40, 50 years what are going to say to our next generation? 'Oh, it was great! You should've been here.'"
Since the time when America was a newborn nation and the first men climbed Mont Blanc in woolens and top hats, the Bossons glacier we're climbing has retreated nearly a mile.
"Maybe one day there will be no glaciers and mountain guides will have to be biking guides," says Fleur, a Chamonix native and one of the most accomplished female alpinists in the world. "We are revolted."
Of course, providing thrills and business in the "death-sport capital of the world" is far from the most important role for glaciers like the Bossons.
The Wonder List with Bill Weir
This frozen playground is also the water tower of Europe, and glacier run-off provides drinking water for hundreds of millions around the world. Which is why the rate of "la grande fonte" is so alarming.
But not to guys like Yan Giezendanner.
"Everyone says 'global warming, global warming.'" he says. "But for me, I'm not so sure."
For over 30 years, Yan has been forecasting for France's national weather service in Chamonix and is convinced other glaciers around the world are growing, despite the science of those like Ohmura. He believes the fear is manufactured by politicians and the wind industry.
"That's their job to say these things," he shrugs.
I found plenty of similar conspiracy theories at the Heartland conference in Vegas, and had a few exchanges that frankly, you have to see to believe. But when I ask Ohmura about the allegations of hackery or corruption, he just sighs.
"Skeptics close their eyes while telling people to close their eyes from the reality. One must use simple thinking. Think. Open your eyes and think. It may sound a bit insulting, but there is no other suggestion I can use."
There will be plenty of frozen food for thought -- and plenty of gorgeous, high alpine adventure -- as " The Wonder List " hits the Alps. Come hang.

Protecting Chad's Elephants from poachers 02:05
"Formation! Prepare yourselves! Fire!" shouts Patrick Duboscq, a retired French police officer instructing the Zakouma rangers.
A handful of men throw themselves flat to the ground, aim, and fire their Glock pistols, hitting distant targets.  They jump up, run, and fire again from standing positions, repeating the drill with Kalashnikovs.
Duboscq, who is a volunteer, runs the Mamba team through its paces.  His passion for elephants, conservation and the park brings him back every year to keep Zakouma's troops sharp -- and the animals safe.
Duboscq leads the men through a rallying cry for Zakouma; the rest of the exercise is all business. They're capable of taking on armed poachers, handling sniper rifles, and engaging in a firefight.  They're trained in making arrests, judicial procedures and presenting evidence in court.
A deadly game
It's a sharp learning curve, but it's necessary to fight off the lethal threat poachers present.  Often organized criminal gangs, international trafficking mafias and terror groups are behind the poaching raids, providing skills and sophisticated arms to carry out the killing.
"Of course it's dangerous," says Mamba team member Ahmat Assilek.  "But we do it because it's our national patrimony ... that's why we're ready to die."
And these men have skin in the game.  Among the group training today, four lost fathers to poachers when a six-man Zakouma anti-poaching unit was gunned down outside the park in September 2012 during morning prayers.
The raid was a suspected retaliation killing for the capture of a group of poachers who had slaughtered six elephants the previous month north of the park. According to park staff, the raid on the poacher camp netted satellite phones, solar chargers, stamped Sudanese army leave slips and insignia, and 1,500 rounds of ammunition.
The poachers weren't minor league opportunists. They were well equipped to slaughter elephants for their ivory -- and to kill anyone trying to stop them.
23 Zakouma guards have died on the job since 1998.
New management
Park manager Rian Labuschagne understands the dangers confronting Zakouma and its staff. Along with his wife, Lorna Labuschagne, the conservationists were tasked with safeguarding the surviving elephant herds in 2010, when African Parks, a South Africa-based non-profit organization, took over the management of the embattled park following a decade-long elephant killing spree.
Before the Labuschagnes and African Parks took over the 3,000-plus-square-kilometer area, the territory suffered huge losses.
In 2002, an estimated 4,300 elephants lived in Zakouma. A decade later that figure had plummeted by 90 percent, most of them slaughtered by poachers for their ivory. The elephants were in danger of being wiped out.
About 450 elephants make Zakouma their home today -- roughly half the entire elephant population of Chad, says the park's field operations manager Darren Potgieter.  It's a far cry from the 50,000 elephants that roamed the country's savannahs and scrublands 50 years ago.
The statistics for the region are equally dire. As recently as 1970, Potgieter says, 300,000 elephants roamed a Texas-sized area that included southern Chad, eastern Central African Republic, southwestern Sudan, and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Today, only small pockets of elephant populations remain, and they remain under threat.
This is not one of the world's thriving neighborhoods; each of these countries has experienced protracted wars, and all have impoverished populations.
Poaching, shrinking habitats, human-animal conflict, war and a seemingly insatiable appetite for ivory in Asia -- particularly in China -- have all contributed to the disappearing populations of elephants and many other species.  Zakouma is no exception.
Turning the tide
So the Labuschagnes, with their African Parks staff and volunteers, set out to reverse the grim Zakouma statistics, which eclipsed even the worst trends of vanishing elephant populations across much of the African continent.
For years, the constant fear of being hunted and killed had made the elephants too stressed out to reproduce. But by the end of 2011, Zakouma started to see a dramatic turnaround. Since then, no elephants have been poached in the park, and no ivory has been taken from the park in five years.
More than 40 calves have been welcomed into the herd since the end of 2013. The births are an important step towards the park's goal of increasing the herd's size to more than one thousand within the next decade.
The gains of the past few years were hard-earned. And the benefits have been reaped not only by the animals but by people living nearby as well.
Communities around Zakouma have been given a stake in the battle against poachers.  It has not only meant well-paid jobs as guards, rangers and support staff, but the patrols in and on the periphery of the park also mean better security for the surrounding villages and nomads.
24-hour tracking
There's even a toll free number to call with any concerns regarding the security of the elephants or the people, and many villages have radios to connect them to the park's nerve center -- a 24-hour military-style operations room with radios, computers, and near real-time tracking of elephant herds.
As Potgieter gives a tour of the command center, the radio crackles with constant communication from guard teams on the ground.  Computers and maps display elephant groups' locations.  "We have 11 collars on as many family groups as possible," says Potgieter, pointing to black marks on a map showing the positions of the elephants. The satellite collars enable monitoring and protection, and there's always a guard unit within a few kilometers of the herds.
Another 4 elephants were outfitted with satellite collars in late February.  In one collaring operation, Potgieter circled overhead in a Cessna light aircraft, guiding Labuschagne's team through kilometers of scrub and high grasses to an acacia forest.  It was midday, the elephants a bit more dozy in the searing heat.  They may feel somewhat safer in this seemingly inhospitable forest of thorn trees. But it's tough tracking them through the scratchy terrain.
Legendary wildlife veterinarian and consultant to the park Dr. Pete Morkel flew to Chad from southern Africa on his annual mission to help with the collaring. After preparing the necessary drugs and tranquilizer gun, Morkel and Rian Labuschagne set out on foot to get close to the 90-strong herd.  The two worked without words, silent gestures sufficing for the pair who have done this together before.
A few large female elephants were visible through a gap in the thick acacias as they fanned their ears to cool themselves.  Morkel watched and waited for a suitable individual to tranquilize, wanting to avoid a mother with a calf. After few minutes' wait, he took aim and darted one with the tranquilizer gun.
A single trumpet from the forest signalled alarm, and the herd quickly dispersed into the tangle of thorns. Morkel and Labuschagne approached a teenage female, now lying on her side.  The pair, followed by the rest of their team, set to work quickly, fitting the collar while pouring water over the sedated elephant to keep her cool. Lorna Labuschagne held the tip of the trunk to enable the elephant to breathe unencumbered.
As the team adjusted the collar, Morkel treated an old festering wound in the elephant's right front foot. He guessed it was likely from a spray of gunfire in the days when poaching in the park was out of control. This female's darting may have been lucky for her.
Rian Labuschagne says the collaring isn't just necessary to track and protect the elephants -- it is the main goal of the operation.
Will Zakouma's success be contagious?
Kenyan officers burn 15 tons of ivory on March 3.
The success in and around Zakouma has been noted by Chadian President and conservation advocate Idriss Deby, who has asked African Parks to come up with an elephant protection scheme for the entire country.
Chad, under its National Elephant Protection Plan, burned the country's ivory stockpiles in February 2014. A number of African countries have likewise burned their ivory stockpiles in order to stop poaching and illegal trafficking of the highly profitable commodity.  Kenya set alight a 15-ton pyre of tusks in early March of this year, and Ethiopia followed suit two weeks later.
But reviving the elephant population isn't the only goal Zakouma and African Parks have in mind.
Their stewardship of the wilderness area is evident in the richness of the ecosystem here. Buffalo herds have rebounded, the lion population is rising, and about half of the continent's Kordofan giraffes live here -- not to mention an abundant variety of antelope and bird species.
Conspicuous by its absence from this list is the black rhino, last spotted in Zakouma in 1972, according to the Rhino Resource Center. In April, African Parks hopes to reintroduce the species into the park.  Asked whether this would bring unwanted attention from poachers -- rhino horn commands an even higher price than elephant tusks on the illegal market -- Potgieter replies: "Someone has to take the bold step and reintroduce rhino. There are lots of responsibilities and lots of risks in park management."
'These animals are our legacy'
No doubt additional patrols will need to match new protection needs.
So far, African Parks and Zakouma have met those security demands and challenges, but the battle to protect some of the world's most iconic species is far from over.
Armed guards on horseback are a constant reminder of the battle to protect the park. The guards have been bolstered by new equipment, including sniper rifles. But the financial stakes in this fight are high, and well-armed poaching gangs are always upping the ante.
The pressure on the animals won't let up, and this war will continue. The Zakouma guards know this, and are prepared to fight, even if it means death.
The reason is simple, Mamba team ranger Ahmat Assilek says:  "The animals you see are the legacy for future generations."

Footnote: This remote wilderness, far from the usual spots on the safari circuit, doesn't get a stream of camera-toting visitors.  CNN's Ingrid Formanek joined some of Africa's top safari guides, some of them old friends, on a tour hosted by the non-profit African Parks at their newly established Camp Nomade.
This is unexplored territory, and has a draw not only for its wildlife but for its remarkable conservation efforts.  African Parks has taken on management of areas few others will touch - marginal and often war-torn sectors in countries such as the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The photos were contributed by a few of Ingrid's fellow traveller guides. On the trip, they discovered a bird species previously unknown in Chad.

Spring is in the air and underwater -- especially off the coast of British Columbia.
Four orca babies have been born in the last three months, a higher number than usual, according to the Center for Whale Research.
Orcas in the area are called the Southern Residents and this baby boom brings their total to 81 whales.
"We hope this is a sustained upswing in the population, but they are endangered and will remain endangered until we can get their population up over 100," said Ken Balcomb with the Center for Whale Research.
The first calf of the season was spotted in December, followed by two in February and this last one in March.
Balcomb said CWR has been studying the Southern Residents for nearly 40 years. "Early on we used to have seven, eight orca babies, but recently we've had substantially less."
Michael Harris, executive director of the Pacific Whale Watch Association, said efforts to improve the numbers of orcas include beefing up salmon in the area. "We're going to keep a careful watch on these babies and our fingers crossed -- and of course continue to do everything we can to rebuild these salmon runs and feed these whales."

In 1923, Cecil B. DeMille became a believer in the power the Bible held with moviegoing audiences. After finding success with his Old Testament epic "The Ten Commandments," DeMille enlisted H.B. Warner to help him tell "The Greatest Story Ever Told." The result was 1927's "The King of Kings," a film for which Warner was virtuous both on and off the set. According to Turner Classic Movies , he signed an agreement not to be involved in any sort of scandal -- even divorce -- for a year following the movie's release.

Story highlights
If you turned on the television this past Sunday, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal.
According to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong.
(CNN)
It's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like.
Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image.
A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean.
If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer.
Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from "Killing Jesus," a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. "A.D.," NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries "The Bible," and "Finding Jesus," CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare.
Does God have a prayer in Hollywood?
What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business , is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood.
Haaz Sleiman, from "Killing Jesus," was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians , who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure.
Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in "Finding Jesus."
And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in "A.D.," replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed "hot Jesus, " by some, "smarmy Jesus" by others.
You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past.
But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say.
"Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed," said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of "Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."
"A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India," Humphries-Books continued. "That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways."
The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings , which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf.
But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't wear long hair, said the New Testament scribe .

        <title>How Stone-Age blades are still cutting it in modern surgery</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/HEIfTb7oI9I/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels
Some surgeons still use the blades in procedures today
Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world.
(CNN)
Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out?
In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines.
It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds.
But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian.
Cutting edge
Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels.
At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge.
When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce.
Read: The worms that invade your brain
Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring.
Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades.
"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring," he said.
"It makes for the best cosmetic outcome."
He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut.
Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian.
Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel.
The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference.
Cut with a chainsaw
"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh'," Dr. Green said. "Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw."
Read: Contact lens with built-in telescope
Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal.
Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw
Dr Lee Green
"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'" he said. "If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically.
"It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery.
"You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!"
And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel.
"What's really fun is seeing it heal," he said. "Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring."
Specialist use
In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal.
"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer," the company says.
At 99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at 712.50 ($772.60).
But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use.
Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone.
"If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it," he said. "It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off."

"My goal was to show diverse personalities in a broad age range, to show that although they share the syndrome, they are all unique."

Sigga Ella's portraits show people with Down syndrome from 9 months to 60 years old
She hopes her photos shine a light on "the beauty and diversity of mankind"
(CNN)
Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world.
Ella's series, "First and foremost I am," consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21 , the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavk Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography.
Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport.
The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on "the beauty and diversity of mankind" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable.
"I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world."
The title of the series, "First and foremost I am," comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project.
"I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora," Jonsdottir writes. "I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies."
Jonsdottir goes on to say, "Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?"
Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects "to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together." The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot.
"My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness."

Researchers: World's largest asteroid impact zone found in Australia
By Jethro Mullen , CNN
Updated 0151 GMT (0951 HKT) March 25, 2015
Imaging taken from rock along the border of South Australia and the Northern Territory shows evidence of a massive impact.

Two pieces of asteroid crashed into Australia many millions of years ago
Researchers stumble across traces of the impact zone deep in the earth's crust
(CNN)
The massive meteorite split in two shortly before smashing into Earth, wiping out large numbers of species.
The devastating event took place on our planet many millions of years ago, but researchers are only now beginning to discover what happened.
In a remote part of Central Australia, the two pieces of asteroid left what geophysicists say is the largest impact zone ever found on Earth, spreading over an area 400 kilometers (250 miles) wide.
"The two asteroids must each have been over 10 kilometers across -- it would have been curtains for many life species on the planet at the time," said lead researcher Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University .
The team published its research in the journal Tectonophysics this month.
The crater caused by the asteroids vanished long ago. But Glikson said the researchers stumbled across scars from the impacts during drilling for geothermal research.
Traces are buried more than 2 kilometers inside the Earth's crust, under an area near the borders of South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.
"There are two huge deep domes in the crust, formed by the Earth's crust rebounding after the huge impacts, and bringing up rock from the mantle below," Glikson said.
Mystery over timing
The researchers are still trying to figure out just how long ago the shattering event happened.
The surrounding rocks are 300 million to 600 million years old, according to the team, but they haven't been able to find the sort of evidence left by other meteorite strikes.
A big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks.
But the researchers say they haven't come across a similar layer in sediments from about 300 million years ago.
"It's a mystery -- we can't find an extinction event that matches these collisions. I have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300 million years," Glikson said.
The discovery of the huge asteroid impacts could lead to new insights about the Earth's history.
"Large impacts like these may have had a far more significant role in the Earth's evolution than previously thought," Glikson said.

Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) has taken delivery of the Izumo, the largest Japanese military vessel to see service since World War II.
The warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the Yokusuka naval base near Yokohama, also home to the U.S Navy's Seventh Fleet.
The Izumo has a crew of 470, and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones (24,000 tonnes at full load, according to military publication Jane's ), it is as large as the storied Yamato-class battleships which fought U.S. naval forces in the Pacific theater of World War II.

        <title>A really big fish story</title>

        <MainBody>Is this 280 pound catfish real? Fisherman provides proof 02:04
Story highlights
Dino Ferrari snaps photos of a 280-pound catfish he says he caught in Italy
It took him 40 minutes to reel in the fish, according to his sponsor
(CNN)
Catfish come in all varieties, shapes and sizes, some big and some small.
And one downright gigantic, apparently now swimming in a river in Italy.
That's the fish story being told by Dino Ferrari, who reeled in a 280-pound (127-kilogram), 8.75-foot-long catfish last Thursday along the Po River, said Davide Valla, who is with Ferrari's sponsor company Sportex. (The sponsored fisherman wouldn't say exactly where he caught the big fellow, choosing to keep his favorite spots secret.)
Assuming the world isn't being hooked, this would not be the first time someone has caught a whopper of a catfish and lived to tell the tale.
In fact, it wouldn't be the biggest catfish ever caught. That would be a nearly 342-pound lau-lau (or piraiba) type of catfish snared in 2009 in Brazil's Amazon region, according to the International Game Fish Association.
Heck, it's not even the biggest catfish ever snared in Italy. That honor goes to a 298-pound wels catfish -- which is reportedly the same variety caught by Ferrari -- also from the Po River. And Ferrari didn't necessarily bring his fish in alone, with stories linked from Sportex's Facebook page indicating that twin brother Dario was by his side.
One thing that makes the latest Po River catch unique is that it was done with a spinning reel, said Valla, who called it a record for such fishing tackle. It took Ferrari 40 minutes to bring in the fish, then bring it to shore, his sponsor said.
Once it was on land, the Ferraris snapped some photos and weighed their catch. But they didn't dig in, savoring it with fresh bread, cheese and a glass of pinot grigio.
That's because this fish story has a happy ending for the star of the show: the catfish. According to Valla, Ferrari released his big catch back into the river.

Some take to social media to speculate about what the new look means
(CNN)
Who doesn't like a new look? New Year, new you, amiright?
An updated 'do can "hair-ald" a new phase in your life, signifying a fresh start.
And maybe that's what the reclusive leader of North Korea was going for when he modified his almost boyish over-the-top-flop to a higher, angular, more severe cut. The look first debuted at his New Year's address in January.

From refugees to photojournalists  Adil Mustafa Hamdan, 21, is a student at the Soba Secondary Refugee School. He was one of 21 students selected to take a digital storytelling course through the UN Refugee Agency project. Like many of the students that graduated from the course, he aspires to be a photojournalist.
"I would go to the Nuba Mountains and photograph people with no clothes, no shoes; I'd photograph soldiers while they are fighting; I'd photograph airplanes that drop bombs. I would show through my photos and explain through my stories the situation in the Nuba Mountains," he says.

"What do you want to hunt?"
"I want to hunt gazelles, monkeys, hawks and other animals that you find in the bush.
"What is the hardest thing about hunting?"
"When you get caught by the police."

"I left the Nuba Mountains because of the war in '83. At that time, we left in a group of 57 people. Only nine of us survived the journey. I was the youngest, only seven years old.
One day, my father was very sick and he began to tell me the names of all of my uncles. When he finished he died. I stayed for seven more years until the people signed a peace agreement, which was in 2005.
I said to myself, let me see what will happen. After six years I prepared to go back to my homeland, but when I was about to start my journey the war broke out. I thought, 'I'll never see my family. I will die as my father died.'
Then people began to arrive from the Nuba Mountains to the camp. The first person I spoke to turned out to be my uncle. It was the best moment of my life. This is why I am happy. Because I have found my relatives."

From refugees to photojournalists  Aziz Hassan Eidiie was born in 1990 in the Nuba village of Kauda. When war broke out in his home in 2011, he had to stop his schooling. He was able to resume it at the Soba Secondary School. Many of his photographs focus on the lives of the young men inside the camp.
"I am happy to have become a photographer, because this was one of my dreams," he says.
"I hope that God may help me learn more and more about journalism so I can put it into practice."

From refugees to photojournalists  Awatif Kawaja Matile is 20 years old. Education has always been very important to her. At ten, she walked long distances to attend her primary school. Later, she attended a private school, where she lived without her parents."I struggled because I didn't have their financial support to help me buy clothes, shoes and other materials," she admits.
When the war broke out in 2011, she made her way to the Ajuong Thok  Refugee Camp so that she could continue her studies. "Being in school is an opportunity to learn, and to change your life from bad to better," she says, though she admits she doesn't view education as a cure-all. "It doesn't mean that you will have a comfortable life; you may face challenges and problems, but education makes you a better person in the future. You must think and reason wisely," she says.As a participant in the project, she focused a lot on the everyday struggles of families in the camp.

From refugees to photojournalists  Roda Tia Hamdan was pulled out of school as a young girl, because she needed to take care of her cousin."Even though I wanted to continue my education, my uncle wouldn't let me, because I was a babysitter," she recalls. At 11 years old, she started cutting grass to earn money for school fees, but soon afterward her education was stalled again due to the conflict in the Nuba Mountains. "I dared to continue my studies as a refugee," she says. Like many in Ajuong Thok refugee camp, she arrived solo, without her parents.
"I went to live with my friend so that I wouldn't have to live alone," she says.

They call themselves the "eyes and ears of Nuba", a reference to the mountains from which they fled.
Young, mainly in their 20s, sometimes younger, these student refugees share a similar narrative. Their villages, tucked away in the remote regions of South Kordofan in the Sudan, became uninhabitable : They were rained down on with rockets; they could no longer grow food, keep cattle, go to school.
They joined 15,000 other refugees in Ajuong Thok camp in South Sudan (Yida camp, closer to the Sudanese border, houses an additional 70,000). Now, they want their stories to be heard. They are citizen journalists in the making.
Last November, Kathryn Mahoney, a communication officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and a self-described "repository of stories" launched an initiative that trained 21 students from the community in digital storytelling through smartphones.
"I travel around and meet these amazing refugees who have been through some of the most horrifying situations, and my responsibility is to help them get their story out, to amplify their voice," she says.
"But as humanitarians, we forget that these are their stories to tell."
At first, she recalls, the students didn't know how to turn the phones on.
"Growing up in the west, we take for granted our visual literacy. We're literally bombarded with images from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep. These students don't come from that culture, so even with issues like framing and point-of-view, we were really starting from scratch," she recalls.
By the end of the course, Mahoney says, "they knew how to use the phones better than I did."
The phones have since gone to the local school, which has adopted a kind of lending library for other students who want to learn photojournalism skills and sign the equipment out.
The students paired the photos they took with a narrative. Some opted for straight quotes from their subjects, a la Humans of New York . Others wrote essays.

        <MainBody>In the past few weeks, Houthi rebels have taken control of Yemen's capital
The move pushes country closer to failed state status, giving al Qaeda greater foothold
Nic Robertson joins Saudi border police trying to staunch the human tide
Nic Robertson will take your questions about his reporting from Saudi Arabia today at 4 p.m. ET/9 p.m. GMT on Reddit .
Jizan, Saudi Arabia (CNN)
Driving out of the sleepy Saudi seaside town of Jizan at dawn, I had no idea what to expect.
I'd been asking the Saudi Interior Ministry to take me there for several years. Now I was in the desert kingdom covering King Salman bin Abdulaziz's ascent to the throne, and that permission had finally come through.
In the past few weeks, Houthi rebels have taken control of Yemen's capital, pushing the country ever closer to "failed state" status and giving the al Qaeda franchise there -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP -- a greater foothold.
The Saudi minister of interior, now second-in-line to the throne, has a personal stake in seeing AQAP eradicated. The terror group's top bomb-maker put a sophisticated bomb in his own brother's rectum, exploding it when the brother met the leading royal a few years ago. The brother died, the minister was only lightly injured.

This is the same bomb-maker who made the underpants bomb that came close to bringing down an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Despite extensive drone campaigns targeting him, he is believed to still be alive and remains a significant global threat.
There is no doubt in anyone's mind here that al Qaeda in Yemen will use any chance it gets to export terror over the border to their northern neighbor, with the royal family being the targets of choice.
Col. Omar al Kahtani, our escort for the day, was in a voluble mood as we sped toward the looming mountains that mark the border. "Anything could happen," he told us. "Be ready with your camera." Gun battles are rare on this border, he said, but only three weeks earlier, on Saudi's northern frontier,  ISIS fighters broke through the defenses, killing three Saudi soldiers, including their commander.
The gun battle, footage of which was posted on the Internet, was a salutary reminder that the desert kingdom, the West's biggest regional partner in fighting the terror groups, is surrounded by battle-hardened enemies.
This corner of the country is remarkably green. Relatively lush vegetation -- in Saudi terms, at least --  sprouts in profusion from the semi-arid fields.
As our four-wheel-drive truck swung through the rickety metal gate, marking the edge of the border exclusion zone, we got our first taste of what has mostly been a hidden war down here.
A sprawling Saudi village of large ornate villas came into view. Pretty, until we got close, when we realized the buildings were all shot up. Rockets had torn gaping holes in the walls and gardens were overgrown with spindly tentacles of creepers that slowly consumed the once-vibrant homes.
Our host explained this was a village overrun by Houthi rebels from Yemen six years ago. In a three-week battle, Saudi Apache gunships had nearly destroyed the hamlet in the battle to save it. The government moved the residents away, creating a buffer between them and their fractious neighbor.
As we drive on, he tells us Yemen's security is worsening and Saudi Arabia is spending almost $3 billion on beefing up border security. Our trucks are bumping and slipping their way up the newly cut rough rock tracks. At moments, it feels as if we are almost climbing vertically.
These mountains are as rugged and rough as they are beautiful. Villages cling precariously to their higher reaches. No fence reaches up this far, the tiny smattering of guards solidifies the impression that at these altitudes, border control works on an honor system.
No line on a map will stop these mountain men from rounding up their stray goats. Even from the roadside I can see tiny footpaths crisscrossing the steep terrain from Yemen to Saudi and back.
Massive drugs haul
In the foothills, control is much more effective. Watch towers are equipped with thermal imaging equipment, super zoom cameras watching over mile upon mile, and layer upon layer of razor wire. It needs to be like this.
What we saw was staggering. I had no idea so many people and such a massive amount of drugs are moving over the border every day.
At our first stop, we saw two men captured that day. We saw another one caught soon after. Then a whole vanload, about a dozen people crowded inside a mesh cage welded to a pickup truck. One of them was just 11 years old.
They all told us they had come to Saudi for work. The 11-year-old was earning about $100 a month on a supermarket till in Jizan. All told the same story: about poverty and increasing chaos in Yemen and the Houthis getting stronger. The risk of jail in Saudi, they said, was better than the certainty of poverty in Yemen.
Our government escort told us they'd all be sent to the nearest large police station where they would be fingerprinted and officials would check their records to make sure none had ties to terrorism.
The men -- and they were all men -- admitted that sneaking over the border is getting much harder amid the increase in guard posts and border fences.
Border guards told us in the past three months alone, they have picked up 42,000 people along the 800-kilometer (about 500 miles) border.
Of course we are unable to verify that figure, but if the volume of illegal migrants we saw in the morning was shocking, then the afternoon was mind-blowing.
We were taken to a room where three children were standing with bundles of qat, the narcotic shrub that most Yemenis chew every day, at their feet.
The youngest, a 10-year-old, told me drug barons pay him $50 for hauling 10-kilos (about 22 lbs) of the green leaves over the border. It's the second time he has been caught.
I was told that the boy, who had been given a banana and a bottle of water by the guards, would be taken back to the border and told to return home. All three looked small for their age. No one, particularly them, doubted they would be back.
Continual stream of infiltrators
Unemployment among younger people is running at 40% in Yemen, likely higher in their villages. Putting food on the table at the end of the day is as far ahead as they think.
Between them, they had been caught with about 30 kilos of the narcotic. Piled up outside the guard post were several tons more -- the haul of the past week, or so we were told. I'd seen similar piles outside many of the other posts we'd already visited.
According to statistics given to us at the Jizan headquarters of the border guards, qat is a multi-million-dollar business. In the last three months, they say, they have seized more than 500,000 tons along the border, with a street value close to $100 million.
They also showed us 50 kg of cannabis resin they had confiscated that day. Over the past three months, more than 6,000 kg of hashish -- with a street value in Saudi of about $36 million -- had been seized, we were told.
Guns and ammunition are also smuggled in: 2,562 weapons have been seized in the past three months, as well as 380,088 rounds of ammunition, the border guards said. And the list goes on.
And so did our day and the near-continual stream of infiltrators. The problem for the Saudis is that they cannot ignore this deluge. Any one of the thousands they stop could be a terrorist.
Said Kouachi, one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers in Paris, is believed to have slipped in to Yemen not far from Saudi's border, making his way there for terror training from Oman. The attack he and his brother carried out also shows the lengths that AQAP is willing to go to in order to export terror.
Hajj pilgrimages to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, draw millions of Muslims to the kingdom. Knowing who comes and who goes is vital.
As the sun began to set, we jumped in police gun trucks as another group of men were spotted near the razor wire border fence. Tearing over the bumpy ground, we raced to intercept them. Surprisingly, they didn't run. They know they'll be freed soon, and from what we saw none of the six were beaten or abused.
Within minutes, as we were driving away, the sun sinking over the horizon and our day done, we thought we passed another eight men being caught. We stopped as police emptied the men's pockets. Cheap cellphones, not much else. They were illegal workers on their way back to homes in Yemen after weeks of work in Saudi, their wages already sent over the border by local money exchangers.
It was already darkening as we pulled away, once again trying to set off back to Jizan. And yet again,  we stopped as we saw a group of guards searching two small figures. More child qat smugglers, rope and sack bags on their backs bulging with the big wraps that protect the delicate green leaves. Each boy carrying bundles with the drug baron's name on them.
Later, when we finally did get back to Jizan, we ate dinner sitting on rugs next to the Red Sea: fish, meat, salads, bread and Saudi "champagne," non-alcoholic fizzy grape juice.
This is a land of plenty, Yemen is not. Stanching the human tide flowing over the border is only going to get more difficult, and finding the terrorist hiding in so much human misery even harder.

Illegal loggers are moving into their territory and threatening their way of life
(CNN)
Portuguese photographer Daniel Rodrigues had always dreamed of visiting the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, and he finally got his chance last year.
After two years of fundraising and wrestling with government bureaucracy, Rodrigues arrived at a place some might call a version of Eden: the Alto Turiacu reserve where the Awa-Guaja roam.
"I wanted to show the daily life in the world's most endangered tribe," he said.
The Awa-Guaja's way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally encroaching on their land, according to Brazil's National Indian Foundation. Many Awa Indians have had little to no contact with the outside world, but that is beginning to change, the foundation reports, as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on.
Daniel Rodrigues
Rodrigues set out to document the tribe's existence -- pure, pristine and, tragically, fleeting.
"I had traveled to Africa and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was," Rodrigues said. "Here I was, in the 21st century, with other humans who (until recently) had never seen a camera, a computer ... never seen a shower and were shocked when they saw a helicopter. And yet they are extremely happy."
Calling themselves Awa, Tupi-Guarani for "man," the tribe is made of forest foragers and dexterous hunters. Challenges abound, said Rodrigues, who was forced to communicate with hand gestures for several weeks because the tribespeople did not speak Portuguese.
"I pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting," Rodrigues recalled. "They were incredibly friendly, and I was very well-received."
Spending weeks without uttering words, Rodrigues immersed himself in the visual resplendence of the Awa-Guaja life in the forest. Twelve-hour hunting expeditions were common, cutting through thick jungle growth during the monsoon rains. Nature's orchestral sounds rang behind every moment, something his photographs seem to allude to.

Detouring from the use of formal portraiture often seen in ethnophotography, Rodrigues' black-and-white photos are filled with an honesty that could only come as a result of an amicable pact with his subjects. The Awa clearly trusted Rodrigues' camera, and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well-versed he became with the ins and outs of the Awa way of life. The cinematic quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the photographer's endurance and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of sportsmanship.
"We walked and walked for hours, slashing through the forest overgrowth to look for the prey," Rodrigues said. "The Awa were barefoot the whole time."
Rodrigues nonchalantly talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red puma.
"The hunter had missed a shot, and the puma jumped right over towards me," he said. "In the meantime, I was having an allergic reaction to a spider bite. It wasn't easy."
There are several groups of the Awa-Guaja in this part of the forest. Some have been known to exist since the 1970s. Others have been contacted in the early 1980s. Many are believed to still be in hiding.
Earlier this month, Brazil's official news agency reported that three isolated Awa Indians had made contact with the other mainstream Awa-Guaja. The group's leader, Amakaria, reportedly said that loggers were marking trees and threatening to kill them.
The Brazilian government has launched a massive military operation into the states of Para and Maranhao, today the epicenter in the war between loggers and Indians. Latest satellite imagery shows that new logging tracks are constantly being carved.
Monitoring and preserving such a large expanse of tropical forest is a challenge. In the meantime, how can the so-called civilized world understand what is being lost?
Rodrigues tries to explain:
"Getting out of my comfort zone, my comfortable bed, to walk for hours through virgin forest, crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck ... hearing the triumphal songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their brethren -- this experience can completely change a human being."

A new sex park for Taiwan?
By Maggie Hiufu Wong , CNN
Updated 0719 GMT (1519 HKT) January 27, 2015
Not everyone loves the idea of a new sex theme park in southwestern Taiwan, though this installation, set up in Beimen for wedding photos, suggests a local appetite for romance.
Story highlights
Proposal to build the first sex park in Taiwan posted online
The sex theme park will explore topics from different sex positions to sex toys
The park's spokesperson confirmed the plan but stressed that it's just an idea at this stage
(CNN)
Taiwan, are you getting a new sex theme park or just teasing us?
The word on the street -- or on the Internet at least -- is that plans are afoot to develop an erotic entertainment attraction on the island's Southwest Coast National Scenic Area.
After interest was aroused by details posted on the region's official website , however, the page was quickly taken down.
The park's administration director, Cheng Rong-fong, confirmed with CNN that the proposal is real, but he insists it's just a concept at this point.
"The ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government," said Cheng.
Details of the plan , circulated by a user on Taiwan's popular PTT online bulletin board, outlined a "Taiwan Romantic Boulevard" sightseeing route with four zones stretching across three counties.
'Silk road of love'
Tainan's Jingzaijiao Salt Farm is famous for its romantic sunset views.
Each stage has a different theme: "dating paradise," "scenic spot for wedding gowns," "silk road of love" and a proposed 10,000-meter-square "sex theme park."
The sex theme park -- or "Garden of Eden" as it's called in the proposal -- will be modeled after other erotic parks around the world including Jeju's Loveland in South Korea and Vigeland Park in Oslo, Norway.
Claiming to be educational, the park will serve as the final stop of the four-stage journey of love.
It'll be divided into different sections, covering topics including sex positions, unusual sex lives and sex toys.
"The dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but aren't officially a couple yet," the proposal said.
Cheng said that the proposal shouldn't have been made public before being finalized, but insisted, if realized, that it will help regenerate a neglected area.
"The southwestern coast of Taiwan has been an important salt farm since the Qing Dynasty," he says.
"It has a unique background, culture and ecological value. Yet, a decade after it was declared a national scenic area, it still hasn't received much attention from tourists. So we thought to ourselves, is it time to try a new mode of thinking?
"The white powdery salt hill and salt farm have always emitted a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area," said Cheng. "That's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating/wedding-themed park in Taiwan."
'Too out of line'
The proposal generated heated debate online.
"This is the first time I find a government proposal interesting," said one online critic, according to Taiwan's Now News .
Another said: "We surpass Japan. The pride of Taiwan."
"This is too out of line," posted another. "And soon the government will start promoting sex tourism."
Beimen is so popular for wedding photos it has fake churches as backdrops.
Chang Huang-chen, the deputy commissioner for Yunlin County, the sex park's proposed home, told the Taipei Times that the idea may not be suitable for traditional-minded locals.
Cheng said he'd received mostly supportive comments, but he welcomed different opinions.
"Sex has always been a taboo in Chinese society," he added. "But it's a part of our lives and a very natural thing -- why can't we discuss it openly and generously?"
Aside from the sex park, the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions.
"We're planning to add around 100 landmarks and installations to each of stage to enrich the experience," said Cheng.
The proposed route starts at the scenic six-story-high salt hill in Cigu County.
It then leads to Beimen, a place famous for its vibrant pre-wedding photo-shooting industry, where "churches" and dozens of other romantic landmarks are built for that purpose.
The third destination, Budai, is a fishing town in Chiayi.
The proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park.

Most of us are happy with being flung around in a roller coaster or spun high in a Ferris wheel.
The rush of fear and the brief re-acquaintance with breakfast are part of the thrill.
But when does a theme park ride stop being scarily fun and start being just plain scary?
We're talking about the rides on which the fear turns into the kind of pure psychological terror that only weeks of counseling -- or a night of martinis -- can resolve.
The rides on which it's not just breakfast that flashes before your eyes, but your entire life (plus some diced carrots that you have no recollection of eating).
These are the scariest theme park rides on Earth.
Thankfully, we don't have to try them, because Stefan Zwanzger, aka the globetrotting Theme Park Guy , already has.
And lived to tell the tale.
The rusty roller coasters of Pyongyang (North Korea)
Just when life in a totalitarian state couldn't get any more terrifying, North Korea unleashes some creaking fairground rides on its unsuspecting citizenry.
To be fair, the Kaeson Youth Park is a rare attempt to sprinkle genuine joy on the gray Stalinist cityscape of Pyongyang.
The fear here, says Zwanzger, is an emotional response in no way soothed by geopolitics.
"When you visit North Korea you naturally never feel completely safe and relaxed, so you enter the rides wondering if they've been maintained at all since most were built decades ago.
"The cobwebs aren't a good sign."

Baku's gross ghost train (Azerbaijan)
Most ghost trains are so lame that it's interesting to hear of one that actually does spook its passengers.
Unfortunately, at the time of Zwanzger's visit, this boardwalk ride on Baku's Caspian seafront was getting its screams the lazy way: via pain.
"Imagine you're alone in a ghost train, driving through the dark, and all of a sudden a sticky curtain drops on you from above and sticks itself to your nose and teeth," Zwanzger says.
"And while the ghost train keeps moving forward, the curtain and your nose and teeth don't.
Zwanzger says he complained to the operator.
"Due to the language barrier and the lack of any internationally recognized sign language for 'my nose got stuck to a curtain,' I don't think he got the message. I don't think he really cared about anything, either."
He adds: "Man, that was painful! My love and pity goes out to those who ride it next."

The Tehran neck cracker (Iran)
At Iran's Eram Park, it's a tossup between which is more disturbing.
The badly drawn Mickey Mouse cartoons, or the soda can roller coaster?
For Zwanzger, the coaster -- which plays fast and loose with physics by flinging passengers in a such a tight loop they can almost see the backs of their own heads -- wins.
"When I saw this the first time, with Coke can-shaped cars hurtling noisily around a narrow loop, I thought, that's going to hurt.
"And it did. Two to three hours of neck pain followed.
"This roller coaster makes one of the narrowest loopings known to mankind. It's as if your head stays in the same place while the coaster spins around."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: Skip roller Iran's coasters altogether and enjoy the country and its wonderful people.
Ferris wheel of misfortune (Nepal)
Take an ordinary Ferris wheel.
Fill it with starry-eyed couples and happy families.
Then crank the speed dial up to 11.
That's how they do it in Nepal.
Because maybe when you live on the slopes of the Himalayas, gaining a few extra meters in height just isn't thrilling enough.
"That thing had speed," says Zwanzger, who says he didn't board the wheel in Kathmandu's Fun Park because the line was too long -- and he was afraid of being propelled into orbit.
"You could hear screams. And these were not the normal Ferris wheel screams of 'ooooh, let's take a photo.'
"These were more like 'argghhh, let me down, I wanna get outta here' screams."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: The London Eye (South Bank, London; +44 871 781 3000)
Qingdao chairoplane of pain (China)
Chairoplanes are called chairoplanes because, as with chairs, it's possible to sit in them, and as with planes, all logic says these things should not leave the ground.
Typically chairoplanes rise a few meters off the ground, giving passengers a thrill as they ride in a chair or model aircraft attached by chains to a rotating overhead gantry.
At Fantawild, a new theme park in the Chinese coastal city of Qingdao, the chairoplane ride is less chair, more plane, lofting startled passengers up to almost cruising altitude.
"I was the only rider, and once up in the air, the chains were making creaking and groaning noises and my chair was turning wildly on its own axis," says Zwanzger.
"It was a long ride. And cold.
"It was new so maybe my fear was just psychological, but I'd rather fly a plane from the 1970s than get back in that Qingdao chairoplane."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: Any chairoplane in a European theme park with a budget of more than 100 million euros.
Disney's secret weapon (Various locations)
There is of course, nothing remotely scary about a kid-compatible classic that takes passengers on a mini-tour of a world populated by friendly animatronic puppets.
And yet, says Zwanzger, Disneyland's "It's a Small World" ride, as seen in its U.S., French, Japanese and Hong Kong parks, has untapped potential as a psychological weapon.
"One ride is fun, but try it about six or seven times and it becomes one of the scariest rides on Earth.
"You ask yourself, 'what if I was trapped here listening to that song and seeing these puppets forever?'
"If you were to chain someone in this ride and have them go around over and over, I think it would actually break them."

The Cannonball Loop (United States, closed)
Like many unnecessary things assembled in the 1980s -- among them the Cadillac Cimarron and mid-career films of Sylvester Stallone -- the Cannonball Loop must've seemed like a good idea at the time.
Looking back, however, it's hard not to view it as the work of an unhinged mind.
The Cannonball was a giant water tube that sent riders sliding through a full 360-degree loop. (See it in action in this YouTube video at 8.19: http://youtu.be/vDHqfhyCbbM )
It enjoyed a brief life in the summer of 1985 at the now-defunct Action Park in Vernon, New Jersey, before being shut down in 1996, reportedly after a series of accidents.
"I've been to almost 300 theme and water parks now, but this is by far the scariest thing I've ever seen," says Zwanzger.
"Looking at it, it's just so obvious that if you have one wrong move, you're going to experience a lot of pain or get trapped inside.
"I can't believe this was actually built in the United States, the country where you can be sued by anyone for just about anything."

Story highlights
The jobs that we aspired to when we were children reflect our passions and talents, say experts
LinkedIn's childhood jobs survey reveals 30.3% of people are either currently in that dream job or a related role
Childhood aspirations are shaped by the people, standards and social expectations that surround us
Leading Women connects you to extraordinary women of our time -- remarkable professionals who have made it to the top in all areas of business, the arts, sport, culture, science and more.
(CNN)
When you were young, what did you dream of being "when you grew up"? Is it what you've ended up doing?
You may dismiss those childhood aspirations as unrealistic now you're an adult with responsibilities and bills to pay, but that role reflected what you enjoyed doing and who you were at that time.
"The dream jobs we aspire to as children are a window into our passions and talents," says LinkedIn 's career expert Nicole Williams. "Identifying and understanding those passions are key to improving our performance and enjoyment of the jobs we currently do, even if they aren't specific to the careers we dreamed of as kids."
So, what influences our childhood aspirations?
When she was a young girl, Meredith Haberfeld wanted to be a librarian like her grandmother was.
"When we're small most of us have a limited idea of what's out there," explains career coach Meredith Haberfeld . "It is shaped by the exposure we have -- the people that have a big impact on us and the standards and social expectations around us".
Our families greatly influence our outlook on life. If we look up to one family member in particular, we tend to be drawn to their careers as we want to be like them. Indeed, when Meredith was a little girl, she wanted to be a librarian because her grandmother, who she admired, was one.
And it's not just our relatives' roles at work that can influence children's aspirations. The gender roles that our parents take on at home can also dramatically impact our childhood career choices.
A study by Alyssa Croft, of the University of British Columbia , found that the division of labor at home had implications for how girls' identities developed in gender roles.
Croft told CNN that fathers' behavior around the house seems to be "predicting their daughter's career aspirations" beyond what they "might be publicly endorsing or specifically saying about gender roles."
She found that if fathers talked about supporting gender equality but didn't take on an equal role in domestic tasks then this sent conflicting signals to their daughters, which led to daughters placing more weight on their father's actions, rather than his words.
By contrast, where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles "that are more gender neutral or even sort of male-stereotypic like being a scientist or athlete," Croft says.
When she was younger, Alyssa Croft wanted to be an artist because she enjoyed painting and drawing.
And that could have a major impact on our pay check down the line. Research by the London School of Economics , published in the journal Social Forces, found that girls who aspired to traditionally female-dominated occupations were far more likely to earn lower wages in their first job, since stereotypically "female" jobs tend to pay less.
"Stereotypically 'male' or 'female' preferences that children exhibit during childhood continue into, and affect, their adult lives," says Lucinda Platt, Professor of Social Policy and Sociology at LSE .
Our early experiences can also have a bearing on what we see as our "dream job" -- a positive experience linked to a potential career can be hugely inspiring.
"I went through an intense marine biologist phase fueled by a life-changing snorkeling expedition when I was seven years old," reveals Hayley Barna , co-founder and co-CEO of beauty start-up Birchbox .
And inspiration can also strike at school, if we learn about a career that resonates with us.
"When I was in the 4th grade [aged 9-10] I learned about lobbyists. I thought it would be amazing job to try and influence important issues," says Joanne Bradford , head of partnerships at Pinterest .
When we are young, our aspirations are a response to our circumstances; but Haberfeld says that when the time comes to start "designing" our careers we begin tuning in to what we feel "compelled to express" about ourselves.
Clara Shih , founder of Hearsay Social , started out with a long and varied list of possible careers -- she went through phases of wanting to be a teacher (like her mother), a police officer, an astronaut and an attorney.
"Only in high school when I began programming computers, did I become interested in tech and start-ups, which led me to attend Stanford and major in Computer Science," she says.
"Even as an eight-year-old, swinging ponytails et al, I would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little 'scripts' to deliver to a pretend audience!"
Shivvy Jervis, Creator and presenter, Digital Futures
While many of us turn our backs on our childhood ambitions when faced with the realities of life as a "grown-up," some really do end up in their dream jobs.
A survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than 8,000 professionals from around the world, carried out for social networking site LinkedIn, found that 30.3% of the site's members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of, or in a career linked to those plans.
Creator and presenter of Digital Futures Shivvy Jervis is one of those living out her early dreams.
"Even as an eight-year-old, swinging ponytails et al, I would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little 'scripts' to deliver to a pretend audience!" she says.
"When I was fifteen, I announced with assured clarity to my family that my 'dream job' was to be a producer and TV journalist."
Sometimes our careers begin at such an early age that there's little to think about.
Four-time Paralympic champion Ellie Simmonds OBE started swimming when she was five; by the time she was eight she was competing against able-bodied children.
"I'm not sure I thought too much on what career I was interested in when I was a child," she says. "I always just wanted to have a farm and work with horses when I was very young, though the thought of working with children is something I've thought about since.
"I'm very fortunate that my swimming career took off when I was very young, so it was never really a question."
But no matter how early we step on to that treadmill, it's never too late to change tack; thinking back to our childhood ambitions can help us work out which aspects of our current job we love.
After Hayley Barna's marine biologist phase passed, she says, "I never had a single career in mind. I always pictured myself being able to do many things at once: engineer, President of the United States, investment banker, professional skier, magazine editor...
"I haven't checked the box on any of those specifically, [but] I feel lucky that my current role blends a lot of different disciplines."
When we were children, our aspirations were limitless and anything seemed possible; by recapturing that excitement and allowing it to inform your research and networking, 2015 could be the year you find your dream job.

        <MainBody>Five-year-old artist Iris Halmshaw has been compared to Monet
She has autism and is unable to speak, but paints for hours at a time
Demand for her paintings is rocketing around the world
Original artworks sell for thousands of dollars
(CNN) -- At first glance, they could almost pass for masterpieces by Monet or Renoir.
But these impressionist-style paintings -- which are changing hands for thousands of dollars -- were painted by a five-year-old girl who is unable to speak.
Meet Iris Halmshaw, an autistic child from Leicestershire, UK, who has been producing these striking artworks since she was three.
She has autism, a condition that has made her unable to communicate except through the medium of art.
"From the first painting, she filled the paper with color and it wasn't random -- it was considered and thought out," says her mother, Arabella Carter-Johnson.
Five-year-old painter Iris Grace Halmshaw
"She was so excited and happy I knew that we had found a key into her world and a way of interacting with her."

Autism changed everything
The journey started when Iris was two. Carter-Johnson and her husband, Peter-Jon Halmshaw, realized that something was wrong: she had not picked up any words, and rarely made eye contact.
"We researched it ourselves," her mother recalls, "but as parents, you are always hoping that there was some other explanation."
Iris was officially diagnosed as a child with autism. According to Carter-Johnson, the doctor was "depressing" because he told them that very few therapies worked.
Not to be deterred, the couple embarked on "long nights of research", which led them to the idea of art therapy.
The little girl picked up painting techniques astonishingly quickly, and before long was spending much time at work on her canvases.
Remarkably for a child of her age, her sessions involved about two hours of consistent concentration.
Savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them.
Professor Allan Snyder, Australian National University
How one girl's talent captured the world
To begin with, Carter-Johnson, who is a photographer herself, started sharing her daughter's paintings on Facebook .
The overwhelming response from her friends convinced her that she hadn't been blinded by mother's pride. Iris was special.
Fast forward two years, and Iris' paintings are in high demand, and are starting to be worth a lot of money.
Due to the high level of demand for Iris' art, her mother has set up a website to sell both originals and prints.
It was a runaway success, quickly attracting over a million pageviews from more than 200 countries.
"All profits from the originals go into Iris's savings account," says Carter-Johnson.
"We also sell cards and prints, and the profits from those go towards her speech therapy, occupational therapy, music and yoga."
The money generated from sales of the prints has had profoundly beneficial effects on Iris' day-to-day life.
According to Carter-Johnson, systems like Gemiini speech therapy, for instance, have made an immeasurable difference to her ability to communicate.
"She has a tendency to drift off into her own world, if you let her," says Carter-Johnson.
"So by using her interests, we manage to engage her, and she changes into a giggly little girl dancing around the house.
"Her speech isn't at a stage yet where we can have conversations, so it's hard to tell exactly how much she is understanding everything that has happened surrounding her art.
"We have shielded her from a lot of it. She hasn't been to TV studios or done interviews."
She has a tendency to drift off into her own world, if you let her.
Arabella Carter-Johnson, Iris' mother
Extraordinary artworks
Many of Iris' paintings show an astonishingly mature interpretation of natural scenes, including waterfalls, fields and skies.
Her abstracts often depict particular moods or experiences after which they are titled, like Patience, Separation, and Immersion.
All are united by a distinctively contemplative and often lightly melancholy atmosphere, as well as a mysterious sense of depth.
This growing body of work has led to Iris being widely accepted as a savant.
According to Professor Allan Snyder from the Centre for the Mind at the Australian National University, people like Iris are able to unlock the hidden wells of potential that lie in all of us, but are rarely accessed.
"I think it's possible for a perfectly normal person to have access to these abilities," he says. "[But] savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them."

Story highlights
A conservator tells state-owned Ahram Online that the beard broke off during cleaning
He says it was stuck back on with epoxy, which "was not a proper material to use"
Museum director denies claims of damage, tells Ahram a committee will inspect the mask
(CNN)
Was the priceless funeral mask of King Tutankhamun damaged and hastily glued back together? That's the claim made by a museum conservator to Egyptian media.
The conservator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Egypt's state-owned Ahram Online that the mask's beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being cleaned last year at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
He said the blue-and-gold braided beard was fixed back in place quickly with epoxy, a type of strong adhesive.
"The epoxy was not a proper material to use to restore the mask, although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for attaching metal and stone," he is quoted as saying.
The conservator said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the glue had dried.
However, the Egyptian Museum's general director, Mahmoud El-Halwagi, dismissed the claims in an interview with Ahram Online, saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in October.
"An archaeological committee was assigned to inspect the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the mask's condition," he said.
Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh Eldamaty also told Ahram Online that media reports of damage to the mask were unfounded.
The boy king's elaborate burial mask, discovered in his tomb in 1922, is one of Egypt's most outstanding artifacts.
Tutankhamun, who ruled from 1336-1327 BC, is thought to have been about 17 years old when he died, based on analysis of his mummy, according to the British Museum . His cause of death is not known.
If confirmed, it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe.
In 2006, a visitor to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, famously tripped on a staircase and smashed three hugely valuable Chinese Qing dynasty vases. The thousands of porcelain fragments were eventually painstakingly reassembled .

        <MainBody>Chinese man who disappeared in alleged abduction as a child was reunited with his father
Sun Bin's mother died "constantly murmuring" his name, father says
Child trafficking is a major business in China
Hong Kong (CNN)
A Chinese man has been reunited with his father 24 years after he was abducted as a toddler from a vegetable market.
In 1991, 4-year-old Sun Bin was taken by child traffickers from his hometown in Sichuan province and sold to a family thousands of miles away, in Jiangsu province on the country's eastern coast, Chinese state media reported .
Sun Bin when he was four with his father.
On Tuesday, Sun was finally reacquainted with his 60-year-old father, Sun Youhong, and a younger sister he had never met. The moment was captured in a moving series of photographs.
"I was happy. I was grateful," the father said. "But I was also bitter."
Child trafficking is still a major business in China, as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents in China and elsewhere.
Boys, prized because they carry on the family line, are in great demand and fetch higher prices.
Earlier this week, Chinese police said they had rescued 37 newborn babies after busting a trafficking ring that sold the babies for up $13,000 each.
The reunion Tuesday took place at a police station in Chengdu. When a police officer introduced Sun Bin to his father, the 28-year-old dropped to his knees and wept in his father's embrace.
"You're a man. Don't cry," said the elder Sun, according to a report released by the state news agency Xinhua.
The Search
Sun Bin was just a toddler when he disappeared at a vegetable market in 1991. Sun Youhong said that he and his wife had dropped everything to search for him.

India's Environment Minister has announced a 30% increase in wild tigers in India since 2011
Debbie Banks from the Environmental Investigation Agency says this has "set India apart from other tiger range countries"
One of the major challenges that continues to exist, however, is the sophistication of the illegal tiger trade
The significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, says Banks
(CNN)
Wild tigers in India appear to be staging a comeback in the battle against extinction, with the country's Environment Minister announcing a 30% increase in the endangered species' population since 2011.
"Our latest estimate today is that India has 70% of the world's tiger population and we have now 2,226 tigers presently in 47 tiger reserves [up from 1,706 in 2011] and this is a great achievement. It is a net increase of 30% over the last estimation,"  Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a statement Monday.
Researchers involved in the study, the third of its kind carried out in India, say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats.
Debbie Banks, head of the Tiger Campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade, welcomed news of the study, saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in March.
"I think it has set India apart from some of the other tiger range countries. If you look at China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, there's more emphasis on tigers in captivity, farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild," she says to CNN.
India's once-thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching, a reduction in prey, habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area.
Although preliminary results of the government's study are promising, Banks warns against complacency.
"While this is good news from India, I don't think anyone is sitting back and saying 'we've won.' The demand within China for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue. And so it's a constant battle."
A major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade, where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders, such as mountain passes. "The criminals have changed their practice. And there's no evidence of any enforcement there," she says.
A historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as India and China, the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, Banks says.
"Tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment, certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit. But they are the water gods, if you like. They are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change.
"There's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers."
And if today's results are anything to go by, Banks says India appears to be leading that charge.
"India, despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas, is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation."

The Open Worm Project aims to recreate the behavior of the common roundworm in a machine
The open source project has taken four years to model 302 of the worm's neurons in its software
It had its first major breakthrough recently when the software independently controlled a Legobot
The robot mimicked some of the behaviors of the worm, responding to external stimulus through sensors
(CNN)
A humble roundworm is leading the race in artificial intelligence, showing that it may be possible one day to upload our brains to a computer.
Called the Open Worm Project , the research brings together scientists and programmers from around the world with the aim of recreating the behavior of the common roundworm ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) in a machine.
The open source project recently had its first major breakthrough when its software -- modeled on the neurons of the worm's nervous system -- independently controlled a Lego robot.
The machine's sensors, without any prior programming, made the robot behave in a similar fashion to C. elegans, approaching and backing away from obstacles or stimulated by food.
While the developers say it will be some time before the Lego bot will be avoiding predators or searching for a mate, scientists say the project shows that artificial intelligence, or AI as it is known, is coming out of the realm of science fiction.
"We've been working on it for four years and while we have a lot more to achieve it's been the most surprising project I've been involved in," project coordinator Stephen Larson told CNN. "It's certainly exceeded my expectations."
With the worm's nose neurons replaced by a sonar sensor and the motor neurons running down both sides of the worm replicated on the left and right motors of the Lego bot, the robot could emulate the worm's biological wiring.
Larson said that while the open source project is still awaiting peer review, and the scientists and researchers in the experiment are reluctant to make any bold claims about how closely it resembled biological behavior, the result were nevertheless impressive.
"We definitely have further to go, but I think what captures people's imagination is how much information we have managed to put together," Larson said.
"We know we have the correct number of neurons, we have them connected together in roughly the same way that the animal has, and they're organized in the same way in that there are some neurons that give out information and other neurons that receive information."
"We feel we've gone a long way down the road, but we still know that there's a lot that's been left out and there are a lot of assumptions -- at the moment it represents one point in a line of iterative improvements.
I'd say we're only 20 to 30% of the way towards where we need to get
Stephen Larson
"I'd say we're only 20 to 30% of the way towards where we need to get."
The project aims to digitally model the worm entirely in a virtual environment; creating a robot with an elastic body complete with stretchy muscles.
"Something with wheels that is rigid is an interesting application but it still falls short of reproducing the anatomy of the worm," Larson said.
He said the scientific road map is to model the worm completely, equipping it with the same physics right down to the cells in all the right places.
While the C. elegans nematode was chosen because of the simplicity of its biological structure, the complexity of the experiment has been such that the team has had to narrow down the project to just a third of the worm's neurons, restricting it to those parts of the worm's make-up that would display behavior.
The digital version of the worm will be released on the web in June this year, allowing anyone with an interest to tinker with the project.
Larson said the open source and collaborative nature of the project has been key to its success, allowing it to make fast progress over the four years of its existence.
So far, it's had input from more than 60 contributors from 15 countries, all of them bringing a unique take on the problems thrown up by the project.
The project has now split into various sub-teams, all of them dealing with different elements: one team is looking at the physical and mechanical model, while another is fleshing out the neurons and the muscles and their electrical models.
The great part of the open source experiment is that the team can take onboard left-field suggestions that push it beyond its boundaries.
"I'd say that this robot was just one of those left-field suggestions," Larson said. "A contributor was able to come along and re-use our material, put it up online.
"The fact that it caught so many people's attention was really a bit of a surprise."

Tourism revival?  After hitting rock bottom in 2008, Zimbabwe is experiencing a tourism revival, but visitors have yet to rediscover Great Zimbabwe.

Story highlights
Great Zimbabwe was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s
Zimbabwe is making a tourism comeback after hitting rock bottom in 2008
Visitors have yet to rediscover Great Zimbabwe, however, leaving it almost deserted
(CNN)
About halfway up the cobblestone stairwell, the screeching starts.
Loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop.
All around me, tree limbs shake.
It's just after dawn, and I'm alone, climbing the trail to the 15th-century royal compound on the hilltop at Great Zimbabwe in southern Africa.
Alone, except for the baboons.
Like all the stone structures here, the stairwell is open to the sky, but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that I can't see more than 10 feet in front of me.
Sure enough, around the next bend a baboon is waiting for me on one of the dozens of terraces that skirt the hillside.
We watch each other for a few moments until I'm certain he's not interested in me, and then I keep walking.
Baboons freak me out, but these moments are part of what makes Great Zimbabwe such an incredible place to visit.
Monkeys are often the only other visitors to the ruins.
Baboon standoffs
Unlike the world's more visited ruins -- which is basically every other ruin -- here it's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place, even if that means the occasional standoff with a baboon.
The stairwell leads to a narrow passage through a cleft in the rocky hilltop. Stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead.
They once would've extended even farther out over the stairs, but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned, bringing a wall down with it.
It's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex.
The old city, which was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s, stretches over 1,800 acres.
Essentially the hilltop functioned as a palace and cathedral, the center of political and religious power.
On the planes below, circular stone walls form a series of enclosures.
The most iconic, aptly called the Great Enclosure, is the largest pre-colonial structure south of the Sahara. The walls rise up 36 feet and stretch 820 feet around.
At one end, an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a conical tower, the most distinctive landmark in the old city.
I like the hill complex more.
Here the walls curve around each other and the granite boulders, which are incorporated into the design. Different chambers are linked by a labyrinth of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks.
At the far side is a chamber with a towering stone ledge that once held a small stone wall that acted like a balustrade.
Destructive treasure hunters
Like all the structures here, the stones were assembled without mortar.
Each layer was slightly recessed, creating a slope that held it all together. Over the centuries, some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters, or just by the elements.
The chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found.
Most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park, which is worth a visit if only to see them.
The image of a bird appears on the national flag, and is as much a symbol of Zimbabwe's national identity as the Statue of Liberty is to the United States.
A labyrinth of narrow passages snakes among the hill complex.
There's a good chance of being here alone.
Visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class, or the occasional park worker, but not many other visitors.
Tourism in Zimbabwe has been in a long and slow recovery.
In the 1990s, Zimbabwe was for a moment the most visited country in sub-Saharan Africa.
By the time the nation hit rock bottom in 2008, hardly any foreign visitors came.
Now major attractions like Victoria Falls are bouncing back, but places like Great Zimbabwe have fallen far off the radar.
The ruins are easily accessible by road, but it takes several hours from Harare or a full day from Johannesburg, so not many people make the effort.
But this is a place I love returning to.

An estimated 300,000 civilians are stuck in rebel-held areas around Aleppo
They are at risk of barrel bombs and warring militias and are short of food, water and fuel
Fierce battle under way for control of Handarat hill, on the road in to the rebel-held area
(CNN)
It is difficult to know at what point things of horror become forgotten and slip out of the world's view. Perhaps it is when they are eclipsed by another, seemingly more pressing crisis. Or when it becomes almost impossible -- for safety or other reasons -- for outside observers to bear witness to their daily toll.
Aleppo has, somehow, sometime between late 2012 when it was the open sore of the Syrian civil war, and today -- when the fight against ISIS has completely grabbed the world's attention span -- slipped off the radar screen.
But here is why it must not: there remain an estimated 300,000 civilians there, in rebel-held areas alone.
These are people who suffer any one -- or all -- of the following litany of afflictions daily: Barrel bombs -- randomly dropped, crudely made devices intended to maim, kill and terrify; warring rebel militia, also fighting with the regime; radical Islamic groups; shortages of food and water; people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel.
And above all a sense, for months now, of hopelessness that their world has only worsened since the fight for Aleppo began in June 2012. That their fight has been deemed by some to be so incurable and intractable that the outside world has left Aleppo to its own devices -- willing to help the winner, but not to assist a victory.
Aleppo is the greatest prize in the fight for Syria's north, but also its greatest victim. Aleppo, the biggest city, its commercial hub, its cultural heart, is a skeleton of what stood proudly merely three years ago.

Is this the site of Jesus' trial?
Joel Baden, special to CNN
Updated 1737 GMT (0137 HKT) January 6, 2015
Archaeologists say they've found evidence that Jesus' trial was held near the Tower of David in Jerusalem.
Joel Baden is professor of Hebrew Bible at Yale University.
(CNN)
Every few years, it seems, an archaeological find of major biblical significance is announced, almost always to do with either Jesus or King David. This week, it's Jesus, and it's a big one.
Just inside the western walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, beneath the tall Ottoman-era fortification known misleadingly as the Tower of David, archaeologists this week proclaimed the discovery of the site of Jesus' trial by Pontius Pilate, at which he was condemned to die by crucifixion.
More accurately: They proclaimed the opening to visitors (read: tourists) of the site, which has now been excavated and prepared for public viewing.
Without pinpointing the precise location, scholars have known for a long time that the trial must have taken place somewhere in this general vicinity -- despite the fact that tradition has put the spot of the trial on the very opposite side of the Old City, in the Antonia Fortress.
First, the background:
According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus' trial before Pilate happened in a place called the praetorium. Originally a term used to signify the tent of the general when encamped for war -- and thus the place where the important military decisions were made -- praetorium came to signify the palace or administrative center for very high-ranking officials.
In Jerusalem, this was the palace of Herod the Great, and according to ancient witnesses, it was at Herod's palace that visiting Roman prefects, like Pilate, would hold any necessary trials during their visits to the capital city.
These same ancient writers declared that Herod's Palace was in the western part of Jerusalem -- near the Tower of David.
On these grounds scholars have long doubted, indeed outright rejected, the notion that the Antonia Fortress on the northeastern side of the city was where the praetorium was located and the trial occurred.
This most recent announcement is being hailed as a blockbuster, in large part because the Antonia Fortress is the first station of the cross on the Via Dolorosa, the path that Jesus is thought to have taken from his trial to his crucifixion and burial at Golgotha, ending at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
The Via Dolorosa is an important pilgrimage site and a massive tourist attraction. But if its first station is on the completely wrong side of the city, then the whole thing is cast into doubt.
The Tower of David museum, which is housing the exhibit of the newly discovered trial site, is openly hoping to draw pilgrims and other interested visitors, and it is certain to get them.
What should not be overlooked, however, is that an important archaeological revelation about the life and death of Jesus was effectively kept under wraps for nearly 15 years -- the discovery of Herod's Palace beneath the Tower of David was first made in 2001 as part of a museum expansion project.
The timing of the announcement is linked entirely to the potential for tourist dollars, rather than to the remarkable historical and religious significance of the discovery on its own terms.
This may sound cynical, but it is par for the course, especially in Jerusalem, where the integration of history, religion, archeology, and tourism is at the very heart of the city's economy.
It is a safe bet that this discovery will not significantly diminish interest in walking the Via Dolorosa --customs and traditions are awfully hard to break, even with the best historical evidence.
What is more likely to happen is that there will be two sites of Jesus' trial, happily coexisting, just as there are two sites of Jesus' burial: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Garden Tomb.
Jerusalem, despite being riven by conflict, remains one of the most religiously pluralistic places on Earth, and that pluralism is nowhere better exemplified than in the sharing, duplicating, and often just plain old creating of religious sites.
From a scholarly perspective, however, it is nice that in this case, the significance for the tourism industry of an archeological discovery really does match up with its significance in history.
Better 15 years late than never.

Rounding out the rest of the top 10 in alphabetical order are: Air New Zealand,  British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, Finnair, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.
"Our top 10 safest airlines are always at the forefront of safety innovation and launching new planes," says Thomas.
AirlineRatings.com's rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations as well as government audits and the airlines' fatality records.
It also examines airlines' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence.
Of the the 449 airlines it monitors, 149 have the top seven-star safety ranking.
This year, the site also included a list of the top 10 safest low cost airlines for 2015.
These are, in alphabetical order:  Aer Lingus (Ireland), Alaska Airlines (U.S), Icelandair (Iceland), Jetblue (U.S.), Jetstar (Australia), Kulula.com (South Africa), Monarch Airlines (UK), Thomas Cook (UK), TUIfly (Germany) and WestJet (Canada).
"Unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit audit and have excellent safety records," says Thomas.
"Low cost does not mean low safety."

One fatal accident for every 1.3 million flights
The release of the AirlineRatings.com list comes at a particularly sensitive time for fliers.
While 2013 was one of the safest years in global aviation history, 2014 is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities, due to several high-profile air incidents.
AirlineRatings.com says there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities in 2014 -- higher than the 10-year average.
However, looking to the positive there were only 111 crashes in 2014, the lowest number in more than 80 years says the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, or BAAA.
The last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927.
"If you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes, flying today is safer," says Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group.
"However, there are more aircraft in the sky, so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and, in some categories of disaster, higher."
According to a report on AirlineRatings.com , the world's airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights in 2014.
"Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number," says the website.
"Another twist is that fatal accidents for 2014 were at a record low 21 -- one for every 1.3 million flights. Two of the crashes last year -- MH370 and MH17 -- were unprecedented in modern times and claimed 537 lives."
In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 aboard.
Officials believe that plane is somewhere in the Indian Ocean. But, nearly 10 months later, MH370 hasn't been found.
In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard.
Malaysia Airlines has a five out of seven ranking on AirlineRatings.com.
AirAsia Indonesia -- still reeling from the crash of Flight QZ8501, which went down over the Java Sea on December 28 with 162 people on board -- has a four out of seven star ranking.
Prior to December, AirAsia had a near flawless safety record, with no previous fatal accidents.
World's unsafest airlines
AirlineRatings.com says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically receive a deduction of one star, giving it a lower safety rating.
"A crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star deduction for 10 years from the date of the incident," says the website on a page explaining its ratings system.
Of the 449 airlines surveyed by AirlineRatings.com, nearly 50 have just three stars or less.
Four airlines only achieved one star for safety.
Two are from Nepal -- Tara Air and Nepal Airlines -- joining Kazakhstan's Scat Airlines and Afghanistan's Kam Air.
All four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the European Union .
The United States doesn't blacklist individual airlines, but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards.
