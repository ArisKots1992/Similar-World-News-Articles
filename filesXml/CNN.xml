In October last year, China launched its most ambitious unmanned space mission to date: to orbit the moon and then return to Earth.
Nicknamed "Xiaofei," or "Little Flyer" on Chinese social networks, the unmanned orbiter traversed 840,000 kilometers on its eight-day mission that saw it round the far side of the moon and take some incredible pictures of Earth and the moon together, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported .
It then successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and parachuted down to the surface in Inner Mongolia.
Wu Yanhua, vice director of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said at the time the successful test mission has gathered a lot of experimental data and laid "a solid foundation for future missions."
While China hasn't committed to it, many analysts think it wants to put a man on the moon.
However, when asked, Commander Nie won't be drawn on whether this is the ultimate goal of the country's space program.
"For the next step, the focus is Tiangong-2  and then we will do more preparatory work for the space station."

China is considering landing a spacecraft on the moon's "dark side" in 2020
The feat is more technically challenging than landing on the near side
China is the third nation to successfully land on the moon
(CNN)
China is considering landing a spacecraft on the moon's "dark side" in 2020 -- a mission, which, if successful, would make it the first country to do so, state media reports.
The planned mission will see the Chang'e 4 spacecraft orbit the moon before sending a rover to the surface, Wu Weiren, the chief engineer for China's Lunar Exploration Program told state-run broadcaster CCTV.
"We probably will choose a site on which it is more difficult to land and more technically challenging... Our next move will probably see some spacecraft land on the far side of the moon," Wu said.
China successfully landed a spacecraft - the Chang'e 3 - on the moon in December 2013, becoming only the third nation after the United States and Russia to land on the moon's surface.
While the side of the moon not visible from earth has been observed by various probes, a landing has never been attempted .
When contacted by CNN, Wu declined to comment further.
The Chang'e 4 spacecraft was initially designed as a backup for the Chang'e-3, which released a lunar rover named "jade rabbit," which is still working on the moon.
The Chang'e-3 mission marked the completion of the second phase of China's lunar exploration program, which focused on orbiting and landing on the moon.

Next phase
In March, China's official news agency Xinhua reported that China will start its third phase in 2017 by launching the Chang'e-5 spacecraft.
Its mission includes orbiting, landing on the moon and then returning to earth.
After making a soft landing on the moon, the lander will dig and collect a rock sample from up to two meters below the surface.
Ouyang Ziyuan, a senior consultant in the lunar exploration program and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that Chang'e-5 will be launched at the newly-built Wenchang Satellite Launch Center in Hainan, an island off southern China.
"Since Chang'e-3 successfully completed its mission, we have had more time to explore a more comprehensive mission for Chang'e-4," he said.
"That's why it's possible for Chang'e-5 to launch to the moon before Chang'e-4."
Ouyang said he wasn't authorized to give details of the mission to the moon's far side.
Space race?
Some security experts fear China's ambitious lunar exploration program could mean a future of Chinese dominance over the moon's resources.
These include water and Helium 3 -- a clean-burning fuel that could potentially offer an alternative to nuclear power.
Other nations are trying to match China's accomplishments in space -- in what some observers are calling an Asian space race.
Last month, Japan's space agency announced that the country would land an unmanned rover on the surface of the moon by 2018.
China's current space program doesn't commit to it, but many analysts believe a manned mission to the moon is on the table

Why the world is wary of China's 'great wall of sand' in the sea
Clive Schofield
Updated 0716 GMT (1416 HKT) May 14, 2015
Satellite imagery from 30 March, 7 August 2014 and 30 January 2015 shows the extent of Chinese progress in building an island at Gaven Reefs in the Spratly Islands.
Story highlights
Regional tempers are flaring over China's "great wall of sand" in the South China Sea
Its island-building in contested waters could impact vital fisheries
China and other states are trying to shore up power in this strategically important zone

(CNN)
The leaders of Southeast Asian nations recently took the extraordinary step of warning China that its island-building activities in the contested South China Sea "may undermine peace, security and stability" in the region.
That's strong language from the usually reticent 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and shows just how high tempers are flaring over what has been called China's "great wall of sand" in a strategically important area.
The commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Harry Harris, has described China's island enhancement program as part of a "pattern of provocative actions" towards smaller South China Sea states.
But island-building in regions like the Spratly Islands plays well to China's nationalistic domestic audience and also appears to be aimed at reinforcing China's territorial and maritime claims in a potentially resource-rich area.
Such activities could, however, have dire consequences for the region's marine environment and vital fisheries.
Ensuring stability and maritime security in this area is crucial to Australian and global interests. An estimated 60% of Australian trade passes through the South China Sea, with $5 trillion in trade overall flowing through the region.

An island of one's own
The Spratly Islands, located in the southern part of the South China Sea, are claimed in whole or in part by China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam.
The Spratly Islands comprise over 120 islands, islets, rocks and reefs scattered over 240,000 square kilometers of maritime space.
These are insignificant fly specks on the map -- but they are close to vital sea lanes. They also potentially give rise to broad maritime claims, within which valuable resources exist.
Around 10% of the global fishing catch is estimated to come from the South China Sea, making access to its waters critical to regional food security.
There has also long been speculation concerning potential oil and gas resources underlying disputed waters -- but that's uncertain precisely because of the existence of the competing claims.
The nations fighting over the Spratly Islands care deeply about territory, no matter how tiny and seemingly intrinsically worthless. Safeguarding sovereignty claims therefore helps to underpin and legitimize the governments concerned.
China is something of a latecomer to the island occupation game. Taiwan is the most longstanding occupant of an island among the Spratly Islands group, having occupied the largest of the Spratly Islands, Itu Aba (all of 1.4km long and 370m wide), since 1956. The Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam all occupied features in the 1960s and 1970s. China did not really get in on the act until 1980s.
As a result, China was left with the smaller, more tenuous features to occupy, often comprising extremely low elevation or at least partially submerged features. Of the eight features occupied by China in the Spratly Islands, five of them are no more than low-tide elevations (that is, features submerged at high tide but exposed at low tide). These do not even qualify for the definition of "island" under international law. The remainder are arguably mere rocks.
So building up and expanding these tiny features is an attractive option in order to add substance (literally) to China's physical presence among the disputed islands of the South China Sea.
An island in the eyes of the law?
Can you build your own island? Certainly! But it won't be the same as a "normal" island -- not in the eyes of international law, anyway.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which China and all of the South China Sea claimant states are party, draws a sharp distinction between naturally formed and artificial islands.
UNCLOS is explicit in stating that man-made structures do not possess the status of islands, have no territorial waters of their own and their presence does not impact on the delimitation of maritime boundaries.
While land reclamation may indeed be possible around features that already qualify as islands, simply building up a feature so that it is elevated above the high tide mark will not transform it into a "real" island.
READ MORE: China building islands in disputed waters -- report
China has painted its reclamation efforts as being of benefit to the region. For example, it has suggested that its newly reclaimed land will enhance China's maritime search and rescue capabilities in an area prone to typhoons.
Beijing has assured the U.S. that its reclamation efforts will not threaten freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. And it has suggested that other countries, including the U.S., might be able to use its new facilities "when conditions are ripe."
The other claimant states are unlikely to take up this offer, since to do so would imply that they recognize China's right to build such facilities and thus its sovereignty claims.
More ominously, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying has said that while certain other countries were keeping silent regarding their own island construction activities, they "point the finger at China's normal activities on its own territory", something that was "an out-and-out double standard."
It's true that other claimant states have undertaken their own reclamation efforts on islands they occupy among the Spratlys, but what is distinctive about the Chinese activities is their scale and pace.
The U.S. Pacific Fleet's commander Admiral Harris has said that China had "created over four square kilometers of artificial landmass."
To put that in context, the combined total land area of the largest dozen Spratly Islands has previously been estimated to be less than half this area.
More conflict ahead
The sovereignty dispute over the Spratly Islands shows little sign of resolution, with the present furore just the latest in a string of incidents among the claimants.
While China is correct to point out that it is, essentially, only doing what others have done before, that is hardly a compelling justification.
In 2002 China and the other Spratly Islands claimants agreed to a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which included an undertaking that they exercise self-restraint.
But despite that, it seems China and other states are continuing their efforts to shore up power in this strategically important zone.
Finally, despite assurances from the Chinese that their land reclamation activities followed a "high standard of environmental protection," it is difficult to reconcile this with depositing tonnes of dredged sand on top of coral reef systems.
This is especially the case when these reefs are crucial to sustaining the viability of the fisheries of the South China Sea which, in turn, provide the primary protein intake for hundreds of millions of people around its shores.
Unfortunately, it seems that this great wall of sand is unlikely to wash away anytime soon.

Alarming increase in near-collisions
Hong Kong (CNN)
A Singapore Airlines Airbus A330-300 with more than 180 passengers on board temporarily lost power to both of its engines as it passed through a storm, the airline has said.
Flight SQ836 was en route to Shanghai from Singapore on Saturday when it "encountered bad weather at 39,000 feet about three and a half hours after departure," a spokesperson for the airline told CNN Wednesday.
"Both engines experienced a temporary loss of power and the pilots followed operational procedures to restore normal operation of the engines. The flight continued to Shanghai and touched down uneventfully at 10:56pm local time," the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that both engines were thoroughly inspected and tested upon arrival in Shanghai with no anomalies detected.
Descent
According to Flightradar 24, the problem caused the Airbus to descend 13,000 feet before the crew was able to power up the engines -- though Singapore Airlines did not comment on this.
The carrier said it was in the process of reviewing the incident with engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, as well as Airbus.
Airbus could not be reached for comment at this stage.
The airliner was carrying 182 passengers and 12 crew.

The bodies are believed to be those of Iraqi military cadets, whom ISIS claimed to have killed in June 2014 in a massacre at Camp Speicher , a fortified Iraqi base near Tikrit.

        <title>Australia: ISIS mom should be punished</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/f7HTXV54REc/index.html</Link>
        <Description>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the wife of an Australian ISIS fighter who posted a photo of their son holding a severed head would face the "full severity" of the law if she dared to return home.</Description>

Concerns about the children
Concern was expressed Wednesday about the fate of Sharrouf and Nettleton's children, who can be assumed to have witnessed violent crimes in Syria, not least the young boy who was encouraged to hold the head.
Nettleton's father, Peter, who hasn't seen his daughter in 10 years, told Sky News: "I still love my daughter and I hope she comes home safely." Asked whether she deserved to be allowed back into the country, he said, "I can't comment -- that's all I have to say."
Earlier this year, it was reported that Sharrouf and Nettleton's 14-year-old daughter had married his best friend, Mohamed Elomar , another Australian fighting for ISIS who has posted shocking images of himself posing with corpses.
On Wednesday, Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said parents who exposed their children to such atrocities in foreign wars had "destroyed the lives of their own children."
However, he said that Australia was "a compassionate country that provides support to children in particular who are in need, and the Government will meet their obligations."
Tougher citizenship laws
Australia has taken a tough line with citizens who have left the country to fight for ISIS .
On Tuesday, the government announced plans to strip dual nationals of their citizenship if they're found to have participated in "serious terrorist-related activities."
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Parliament on Monday that the government had canceled more than 110 passports of people deemed to pose a security risk to the country.
Bishop has long expressed concerns about the risk of "homegrown terrorists," who bring back ideas and skills acquired overseas to Australia for local attacks.
The foreign minister said a precedent was set in Afghanistan, where around 30 Australians traveled to fight with extremists between 1990 and 2010. Bishop said that of 25 who had returned to Australia, "about 19 engaged in activities that were of concern to our security forces after they returned, and eight of them were convicted of terrorism-related offenses."

Perepally, India (CNN)
Mallayia Baddula sits barefoot beneath the shelter of his hut in Perepally, a small village outside Hyderabad.
He's 76-years old and mourning the death of his son Venkatesham, who at half his age succumbed to the heat during the recent hot, dry spell.
"He had gone to get some medicine for me," Baddula told CNN. "I am informed that he died of sunstroke."
Venkatesham is one of the 70 people who have died in the district of Nalgonda, and one of the 340 deaths recorded in Telangana state.
The 38-year old was the family's breadwinner. Now the elderly grandfather will have to find a way to provide for his own wife and two grandchildren -- a 13-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy. The children lost their mother several years ago.
"Now I have to look after my family. Only God knows how will I do it," he said.

Hundreds dead
At least 1,020 people have died in the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh, along with 11 in Odisha, taking the national toll from this heat wave to 1,371.
The highest maximum temperature recorded on Wednesday was 47 C or 116.6 F, at Daltonganj in eastern state of Jharkhand and Titlagarh in Odisha.
Daytime temperatures were up to 7 C higher than average in coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh State, said meteorological chief B.P. Yadav.  However, in coming days, temperatures in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were expected to fall up to 2 C, he said.
Earlier this week, it got so hot in Delhi that roads started showing signs of melting.

People stop by Bai's stall every two minutes or so, as the temperature rises toward its daily peak, typically in mid-to-late afternoon. On Wednesday, temperatures in Hyderabad hit a high of around 42 degrees C, or around 107 F. At night, the temperature dropped to 30 C or 86 F.

During the day, India's homeless try to find shelter. But in Delhi on Wednesday night, many were seen sleeping on footpaths, and on the concrete strips between roads. Even at night, when CNN's Omar Khan took these photos, the temperature ranged from between 35 and 37 C, or 95 to 98.6 F.
Two old men were seen sleeping under a flyover, as cars sped by spewing even hotter, polluted air in their direction. Construction workers stretched out on top of huge steel pipes.

Asked to explain his comments, B.R. Meena said: "Cover properly, have light color clothes, take umbrella, take care, be in cool area --  had they taken such care, this could have been avoided."
He said people were being urged to use an umbrella, hat or turban, and drink plenty of water and avoid going outside between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.

(CNN)
It's often hot in India. But the past 10 days have been exceptional, even for one of the hottest places on the planet. The highest temperature recorded on Wednesday reached 116.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the eastern states of Jharkhand and Odisha.
Commuters aren't just sweating and dizzy -- they can't drive because the roads are melting.
The pain and loss the heat has caused is devastating. More than 1,400 people have died.
One elderly man shared his grief with CNN Wednesday over losing his 38-year-old son to heat stroke. The man had simply ventured out to buy his father's medicine.
So what's behind India's heat, is it unusual and when will it end?
What's behind the heat?
There are at least a couple things. Climate change is likely is a factor, according to Benjamin Cook, a research scientist with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. But it's not possible without a lot of research to know exactly how much climate change is affecting conditions in India, he said.
India is experiencing Loo winds, hot and dry westerly gusts from Pakistan and northwest India which dries out the region, according to CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett. That means that air moisture, or dew point, is low. When a monsoon advances, and one is expected to hit as early as the end of this week, there is always more dry heat.
Isn't it hot in nearby countries?
Neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan are hot, with temperatures well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but India appears to be suffering far worse, due in part to its many densely populated areas.
About two-thirds of India's 1.2 billion people have access to electricity. That would mean that in India alone about 400 million people do not have reliable access to air conditioning and refrigeration.
And India suffers because of geography. High mountains block cool air coming from the northeast, said Garrett.
Is a hotter future ahead?
India is used to intense early summers. May is typically India's hottest month with temps in some parts of the country hovering around 104 to 105 degrees. Heatwaves are common in India. Hundreds died in 2002 and 2003 as a result of the heat.
Studies suggest India is in for more rough summers . The southern part of the country, which has mostly escaped the buckling heat, is predicted to suffer more heat waves. Overall, more parts of India will suffer heat waves that last longer -- possibly 30 days.
When will the heat wave end?
It's possible that a monsoon could hit by the end of the week and bring relief. On Wednesday night, a light shower in Hyderabad brought some relief to millions who had been praying for rain.
In the meantime, water camps are open and commuters are doing their best to survive.

Watch special coverage of Natalee Holloway's disappearance this week at 8 p.m. ET on "Anderson Cooper 360."
(CNN)
It's been 10 years since Natalee Holloway vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba, and after a decade of false hopes and dead ends, her father has never stopped looking for her.
Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub with three men -- two brothers and Joran van der Sloot, then 17.
At first, they told police they dropped Holloway off at her hotel. Then, the brothers said they took Holloway and van der Sloot to a different hotel. Van der Sloot said he left Holloway on the beach.
Hundreds of tourists and locals joined the search for Holloway. For months, international media covered the case.

Despite the effort and attention, the case went cold. Van der Sloot, now in a Peruvian prison after being convicted of murdering Stephany Flores in 2010, has never been charged in Holloway's disappearance.
Dave Holloway believes his daughter was the victim of foul play, her body thrown in the ocean.
Natalee Holloway declared legally dead
Holloway recently got a tip from a man claiming to have witnessed van der Sloot carrying Holloway's body on the night she disappeared. Years ago, Dave Holloway received a call from the alleged witness, Jurrien de Jong, asserting his daughter was not in the ocean, but on land. Holloway originally brushed aside the call, one of many he received at the time from people claiming to know where is daughter was.
Holloway recently sat down with CNN's Martin Savidge in Meridian, Mississippi, to talk about the latest development and his daughter. Below is a portion of that interview, edited for brevity and clarity.
CNN's Martin Savidge: What did de Jong describe in his conversations with you?
Holloway: He says that a car pulls up and Joran and Natalee get out of the vehicle. This is on May 30, (2005) and this vehicle pulls into the parking lot at the Marriott hotel, and you can see a construction site and you can see the Holiday Inn ... and this area is enclosed with a chained fence. He says that Natalee says, "Well the gate's locked," and (Van der Sloot) says something about, "Well I know a trick," and somehow he, I guess, unwraps the chain and they go in ...
Then he sees them go across the construction site, and they get up on the platform, which I presume to be the foundation of the Spyglass Tower, and they run up to an area that's got half of a stairway built and they go up that and he loses sight of them. Then, approximately five minutes later he says they emerge with Joran carrying Natalee in his arms and apparently he knew that she was not living. He put her down on the concrete slab and then jumped down off of it and put her body down on the ground and then went and dug an opening under the slab and then put her body in it and then covered it back up and walked out.
Savidge: The Marriott has at least told the authorities down there that there wasn't construction or any significant construction of which the witness described.
Dave Holloway: I can tell you for a fact. I was there on June 1, and there was definitely construction in that area. June 1, 2005, because it was all chained up. And that's one of the areas we never searched because we assumed it's locked up and secured at all times, and they have construction workers there on site. It was something we assumed that that would never need to be searched and it wasn't.
Savidge: What changed your perception of de Jong and his story?
Holloway: Well I kept looking at it and looking at the facts and what he said, and I thought, man, I can't go here because I've gone through so many of these where they had details and facts and it turned out to be nothing...  I called TJ Ward, (a private investigator), and said, "TJ I need a second opinion on this guy."
I said, "Can you look at this guy and talk to him and see what you think?" and so he did, and a couple of days later he called me back and said, "Hey, Dave, the guy passed this voice analysis test."
"I thought 'Oh my gosh,' and then I started digging more and more into it. I'm thinking maybe there's something to this, but I told TJ, I'm not going to get my hopes up. ... We had the opportunity about three weeks ago to go to Aruba and check this out and we did with a cadaver dog. We were kind of blocked in the areas that we wanted to do the search so it was kind of a failed mission I guess, so to speak.
Savidge: What were you hoping for?
Holloway: Maybe to get lucky, you know? And see and put this to rest.
Savidge: Did de Jong ever ask you for money?
Holloway: No.
Savidge: Do you believe his story?
Holloway: I want to believe it, but I don't want to get myself into a situation where I put all the marbles into this story and then it doesn't pan out and then I'm in a situation mentally where it's going to take a while to get over so I'm just cautiously watching and thinking, "How does this story fit in with what he is saying?"
Savidge: What would you like to see happen next?
Holloway: I would like to see that area in question is searched by a dog.
Savidge: Do you get the sense that people, at least, in Aruba would just like this to go away?
Holloway: Oh, I believe that absolutely.
Savidge: Is there ever a point you stop?
Holloway: No. As a parent you'll never stop. Never. I mean, your child is off in a foreign country and you want to bring her back home, and I've got the means and the ability to go down there and check and do it, and if I'm willing and able to do it, then I always will.
Savidge: You think about Natalee every day?
Holloway: Yeah. It always passes your mind. More so now with this new lead.
Editor's note: CNN's Martin Savidge received this statement from Jeff Flaherty, in Global Corporate Relations at Marriott International, Inc.
"As we have done all along, we cooperate fully with the authorities whenever they are conducting an official investigation."

So far this year, there have been more than 20 similar mob burnings in the country, according to Mario Polanco of Guatemala's Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo human rights organization.
"It is unfortunate these types of situations occur," Polanco said. "They are produced by the weakness of the state's institutions to guarantee safety and justice for the population, and so (people) take justice into their own hands."
Guatemala is one of the world's most violent countries, according to the United Nations, which created a commission in 2006 to investigate corruption and impunity there. Nearly every murder in Guatemala goes unsolved , and convictions are achieved in only about 6% of all criminal cases , the commission says on its website.
Witnesses: Mob stopped police from stepping in
The video purporting to show the teen's death in Rio Bravo, which was posted on YouTube and numerous Guatemalan media websites, begins with an image of the girl stumbling with blood streaming down her face.
A large crowd of people standing shoulder to shoulder watches as men and women slam her face into ground and kick her head. Then, someone sets her on fire and douses her with gasoline.
Some in the crowd record the incident on their cell phones. No one steps in to put out the blaze.
Residents who spoke with CNN affiliate Noti7 said the teenager in the video and two men robbed and shot dead a tax driver. The two men -- one of whom is believed to have fired the deadly shot -- escaped the crime scene, but a group of residents captured the girl and attacked her.
Police eventually arrived at the scene, witnesses told Noti7, but the mob quickly turned on officers and blocked any attempts at rescue.
Reactions mixed
The Catholic Church and government officials have condemned the incident, Noti7 reported.
And on social media and in the comments sections of local media reports about what happened, many people have blasted the town's residents.
"They are just as much murderers as the those who killed the taxi driver," one person posted in response to an article about the incident on the Guatevision website. "May God pardon them. She was almost a girl. It hurts me to see that there was not even one good soul who helped this girl. Remember that we will all be measured by the same bar."
But reactions have been mixed. Some have even applauded what they said was justice being served.
"Let's see if all of you who are speaking out here would have defended this girl if she'd killed your son, mother, father or grandfather," another post on the Guatevision article said.

Researchers say they have found teeth and jawbones belonging to a new species of human ancestor
The remains, dating back 3.3 million to 3.5 million years, were found in Ethiopia's Afar desert region
(CNN)
Meet Australopithecus deyiremeda, a newly discovered species of hominin that sheds light on our earliest ancestors, scientists say.
In a study published in the journal Nature , the researchers say their discovery in Ethiopia of teeth and jawbones dating back between 3.3 million and 3.5 million years supports the idea that several hominin species coexisted during this period.
The remains show clear similarities to "Lucy," the famous 3.2 million-year-old remains of the species Australopithecus afarensis, found in 1974.
But, the researchers say, there are sufficient differences in the jaw architecture and size and shape of the teeth to mean that this is a new species, indicating that our ancestry is more complicated than previously thought.
The remains were found in the Woranso-Mille area in the deserts of Ethiopia's central Afar region, only 22 miles from the site where Lucy was discovered.
The name, Australopithecus deyiremeda, derives from the local Afar language and means "close relative" -- referring, the researchers say, to "the species being a close relative of all later hominins."

Researchers use the term "hominin" to refer to a group that includes humans and human ancestors.
The leading scientist on the project is Yohannes Haile-Selassie , head of physical anthropology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, who has been carrying out field research in the Woranso-Mille area for more than a decade.
"The new species is yet another confirmation that Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, was not the only potential human ancestor species that roamed in what is now the Afar region of Ethiopia during the middle Pliocene," he said, in a news release on the museum's website.
"Current fossil evidence from the Woranso-Mille study area clearly shows that there were at least two, if not three, early human species living at the same time and in close geographic proximity."
Haile-Selassie said the discovery of a new species would take "the ongoing debate on early hominin diversity to another level" and was likely to be met by skepticism in some quarters.
"However, I think it is time that we look into the earlier phases of our evolution with an open mind and carefully examine the currently available fossil evidence rather than immediately dismissing the fossils that do not fit our long-held hypotheses," he said.
What remains to be investigated further is how these different species were related to each other and to later hominins, the study adds, and what environmental and ecological factors led to such diversity.

Washington (CNN)
CNN's Jim Sciutto recently got exclusive access to a U.S. Navy surveillance plane on a secret mission near China, where they flew over a string of man-made islands. China's Navy issued eight warnings to the plane and told it to leave the area. On Tuesday, Jim answered questions from the Reddit community during an " Ask me anything " session. Below are highlights from the conversation.
1.  If your flight was warned eight times, I guess the flight crew didn't take it very seriously then?
The flight crew was prepared -- and read a scripted response saying that the U.S. considers the airspace there international. Frankly, both sides were very professional and calm, although I did hear frustration in the voice of one of the Chinese Navy radio operators when he yelled, "You go now!"
This was not the first U.S. flight over the islands but it is the first one the U.S. advertised broadly by bringing a TV crew on board. That was intentional and, judging by the Chinese government reaction, seems to have accomplished its goal of sending a message.
2.  Did the crew show any change in posture/emotion when the warnings were received?
Frankly, it did not. They have flown these flights before and been challenged by the Chinese Navy before. A few months ago, it was a different story when a Chinese fighter did a barrel roll in front of a U.S. surveillance flight much closer to the Chinese coast. The U.S. formally complained to China and -- I'm told -- China promised it wouldn't happen again.
CNN exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane
3.  How capable is China of shooting down the aircraft, even if flying at around 15,000 feet? Do eight warnings seem a bit redundant in their case?
Good question: for now, the flights are too far from to Chinese coast to be in range of Chinese fighter aircraft. Chinese naval ships are nearby though -- we saw them! -- and could have the weapons on board to threaten a U.S. aircraft but at this point, firing at a U.S. plane would be a clear act of war and therefore extremely unlikely.

        <MainBody>Russia conducts surprise military drills 01:40
Story highlights
Russia deploys 12,000 troops and numerous aircraft in snap exercise
NATO, bemoaning lack of notice, urges transparency
Dueling drills take place as tension increases along 900-mile line between Russia and West
(CNN)
You flex your muscles and I'll flex mine. Or so it seems to go in international relations these days.
Russia has deployed 12,000 troops along with numerous aircraft and weapons in a surprise military exercise in the country's northwest -- a show of strength that may be a response to a long-planned European military exercise led by Norway.
The Russian news agency Tass, quoting the country's defense ministry, reported Monday that the exercise involves as many as 250 combat planes and helicopters and 689 units of "various weapons and military equipment."
Cruise missiles will be aimed at an "imaginary enemy," the report said.
Competing spheres of influence
The seemingly competing military exercises come as tension is increasing along a range of former Soviet states -- from Moldova in the south to Latvia, 900 miles to the north -- over whether they will fall under the influence of Russia or the West.
The EU and NATO eye these states as potential members, and indeed Latvia, for example, is already a member of both organizations. But Russia views that as a threat.
Part of that struggle has involved the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and its encouragement of separatists in eastern Ukraine.
NATO: Transparency needed
The Arctic Challenge Exercise is not a NATO-led drill, but several of NATO's 28 countries are participating. And NATO is not happy about Russia's surprise maneuvers.
"We are concerned by the size, scale and frequency of Russia's snap exercises," a NATO official said. "Three of them have included over 80,000 troops. Some of them have been used to deploy troops to annex Crimea, mass forces on Ukraine's border and support the separatists."
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
The official declined to be named because of NATO policy.
She said that NATO announces its military exercises in advance -- including a large exercise this coming autumn that was announced a year ago, and to which international observers, including from Russia, have been invited.
"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discussed the importance of transparency and predictability in military activities with Russia Foreign Minister Lavrov last week," the official said, referring to Sergey Lavrov, who has been Russia's Foreign Minister since 2004.
On orders of Supreme Commander-in-Chief
Tass called the Russian exercise a "surprise combat readiness check," and said it was being conducted "to assess capabilities of the Air Force and air defense forces of the Central Military District to fulfill tasks to destroy an enemy."
A check of the Norwegian Armed Forces website showed that the European military exercise was made public some time ago, and members of the press were invited to apply for accreditation to cover the event.
Tass reported that Russia's surprise exercise was launched on the orders of the Russian Supreme Commander-in-Chief, otherwise known as President Vladimir Putin.

Amnesty report says Hamas committed war crimes against Palestinians

Group alleges Hamas forces carried out extrajudicial killings of at least 23 Palestinians

Abductions. Beatings. Torture. Summary executions of political opponents.
These are among the allegations made Wednesday against the Palestinian group Hamas in a damning new report by the international human rights watchdog Amnesty International .
During last year's Gaza conflict, which took place in July and August, Hamas used the chaos to settle scores and carry out "horrific abuses . . . some of which amount to war crimes" against fellow Palestinians, said Philip Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Amnesty International.
'Brutal campaign'
The report alleges that Hamas forces waged "a brutal campaign of abductions, torture and unlawful killings" against Palestinians it accused of collaborating with Israel. But some of the victims were supporters of Fatah, Hamas' political rival.
Hamas is a Palestinian Islamic organization that operates in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere in the Middle East. It controls Gaza, while Fatah, a secular party, controls the West Bank.
The U.S. State Department has included Hamas on its official list of foreign terrorist organizations since 1997.
Amnesty: Killings in public, with children watching
Among the allegations made in the Amnesty report:
 Hamas forces carried out "the extrajudicial execution of at least 23 Palestinians" and the arrest of dozens of others.
 Six men were killed by Hamas forces outside al-Omari mosque in Gaza's Old City "in front of hundreds of spectators including children."
 Palestinians abducted by Hamas "were subjected to torture, including severe beatings with truncheons, gun butts, hoses and wire or held in stress positions."
"It is absolutely appalling that, while Israeli forces were inflicting massive death and destruction upon the people of Gaza, Hamas took the opportunity to ruthlessly settle scores, carrying out a series of unlawful killings and other grave abuses," Luther said.
No action has been taken against the perpetrators, the report said.
"Not a single person has been held accountable for the crimes committed by Hamas forces against Palestinians during the 2014 conflict, indicating that these crimes were either ordered or condoned by the authorities," Amnesty said.
Hamas' military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, was responsible for many abuses, according to the report.
'His arms and legs were broken'
It cited the case of Atta Najjar, a former Palestinian police officer who had a mental disability. Najjar was serving a 15-year prison term after having been convicted of collaborating with Israel, Amnesty reported.
On August 22, Najjar was taken from prison and killed, according to Amnesty.
His brother retrieved the body.
"There were marks of torture and bullet shots on his body," the report quoted the brother as saying. "His arms and legs were broken ... His body was as if you'd put it in a bag and smashed it. ... And from behind the head -- there was no brain. Empty."
Torture and cruel treatment of detainees in an armed conflict is a war crime, Luther said.
Amnesty called on the Palestinian authorities, including the Hamas administration in Gaza, to cooperate with independent investigations, among them one conducted by the Commission of Inquiry set up by the U.N. Human Rights Council in July.

Tens of centuries ago, animals were increasingly seen as sacred representation of gods in ancient Egypt. Pilgrims would often pay for the mummification of an animal, in return for divine favor or revelation. And so a lucrative industry began (made up of animal keepers, embalmers, priests, and laborers building the cemeteries and catacombs) and, over time, up to 70 million animals were carefully preserved -- or so Ancient Egyptians thought.
Now, 3,000 years later, researchers in England have uncovered what by modern standards appears to be a scam of epic proportions. Using the latest medical imaging technology, radiographers and Egyptologists have scanned hundreds of animal mummies and found a considerable number contain only partial animal remains or are completely empty.
The researchers from Manchester Museum and the University of Manchester used a CT scanner and X-ray machine that would normally be used on children, to see beneath the wrappings without damaging the ancient specimens inside. On their findings, Lidija McKnight , who led the team, says: "We always knew that not all animal mummies contained what we expected them to contain, but we found around a third don't contain any animal material at all -- so no skeletal remains."
To explain the phenomenon McKnight told the BBC that even the smallest parts of the animal may have been considered sacred and worth the effort of embalming. "We don't think it's forgery or fakery. It's just that they were using everything they could find."
'Genre of fake mummies'
Indeed the scale of animal mummification was so huge that other experts suggest that the use of fakes would have become inevitable.
According to professor Selima Ikram, who in 2011 helped curate an exhibition of animal mummies at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, baboons were mummified into near extinction .
"If you wanted to have a baboon as an offering, you make it look like a baboon -- and if you say it is a baboon, then it magically becomes a baboon. The real ones were very expensive and hard to come by and that's why the whole genre of fake mummies started."
Modern myths and climate lessons
McKnight corroborates this idea that the belief systems of ancient Egyptians made the use of fake mummies acceptable. "Today, we want to think that what we are buying is what we are getting. But the ancient Egyptians were different. They were buying a mummy as a representation of a god. They believed that whatever was inside could be transformed magically."
But if the animal mummies do not reveal some ancient hoax, what does the discovery actually tell us? McKnight suggests that the research, (which has been the most comprehensive to date, bringing various museum collections and different types of animals together in one study), holds interesting lessons for those studying climate change in Africa.
"There are lessons to be learned about what ancient Egypt was like. From the mummies we can presume that Egypt might have been greener. For example, there would have been water sources that attracted large colonies of the sacred ibis -- one of the most mummified birds," says McKnight.

Elephant snatches man's camera, takes amazing 'elphie'
By Jethro Mullen , CNN
Updated 1104 GMT (1804 HKT) May 24, 2015
An elephant on the Thai island of Koh Phangan grabbed tourist Christian LeBlanc's camera and captured what he's calling an "elphie."
Story highlights

"I got the selfie of a lifetime, which I can't take full credit for," he tells CNN
(CNN)
Plenty of tourists have snapped a selfie of themselves posing with an elephant during their travels. Even U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has done it .
But how many have had their photo taken by the elephant?
Christian LeBlanc , a 22-year-old Canadian, found himself the subject of an extraordinary "elphie" on a Thai island earlier this year.
"My girlfriend and I were exploring the island when we came across a couple elephants," he told CNN by email. "For 50 cents, you could buy a basket of bananas to feed them, so we decided to get one."
The elephant LeBlanc was feeding decided what was on offer wasn't enough and started ferreting for more food with its trunk.
"Next thing I knew, it grabbed my GoPro by the mount and I got the selfie of a lifetime, which I can't take full credit for," he said.
Elephant was 'very playful'
LeBlanc's GoPro, a mountable sports camera, was set to shoot continuously, so it captured the view from the elephant's trunk. But he's not ruling out the possibility that the beast knew what it was doing.
"Elephants are incredibly intelligent, and it definitely makes you wonder if it was a conscious action," he said.
The photo was taken on the island of Koh Phangan about two months ago, but it has picked up attention online and also from the international media in recent days.

The photographically inclined elephant, meanwhile, remains something of a mystery.
"I know nothing about the actual elephant other than its love for selfies," LeBlanc said. "Its personality was very playful and it clearly had a craving for bananas because it devoured them."
Not the first 'elphie' on record
LeBlanc had been studying abroad in Bangkok before he and his girlfriend embarked on their travels . This was his first encounter with an elephant.
"At first, I was a little cautious of its size," he told CNN. "However, a few minutes in, I realized that despite its power, the elephant was relatively gentle. I got comfortable enough that I let my guard down and let it grab my GoPro."
His photo is unusual, but not the first elphie on record.
Last year, an elephant at a safari park in the United Kingdom reportedly snapped a selfie with a phone dropped by a visitor.
Issues surrounding animal photos
When an animal takes a photo, it throws up thorny issues about who has copyright over the image, as David J. Slater discovered after a selfie taken with his camera by an Indonesian macaque went viral .
Some photos of tourists posing with cute creatures, like pop star Rihanna's encounter in Thailand with an endangered primate , have prompted warnings from wildlife activists about the abusive treatment of what they call "photo-prop" animals.
LeBlanc, meanwhile, has moved on to the Philippines and taken his animal selfie game underwater, capturing himself in the same frame as a whale shark , the largest species of fish in the world.

Suspected  Al-Shabaab militants attack police in Kenya's Garissa County
Attack comes weeks after students were slaughtered at a Garissa college
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)
Suspected Islamist gunmen attacked Kenyan national police Monday evening in the same county where students were slaughtered in a university attack last month, leading to a intense gunbattle that left at one officer dead and four others injured, authorities said.
Police officers were looking for Al-Shabaab militants in eastern Garissa County when gunmen attacked them on Monday evening, said James Kianda, acting county commissioner.
Police reinforcements responded and fought with the attackers, believed to be with Al-Shabaab. In the ensuing battle, five officers were injured, the national police service said.
One of the officers died while being evacuated; the other four were airlifted to the country's capital, Nairobi, for medical care, police said.
National police and the Kenyan military were conducting an operation against the attackers on Tuesday, the national police said.
The initial group of police officers was patrolling the county's Fafi and Yumbis areas, acting on the belief that Al-Shabaab fighters were hiding nearby, Kianda said.
Monday's incident came more than seven weeks after Al-Shabaab terrorists stormed a college in eastern Kenya's Garissa city and killed 147 people.
In that incident, according to Agence France-Presse, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians
Of those killed at Garissa University College on April 2, 142 were students at the university, and the rest were security forces and campus security.

They became a couple after spending time together in the university's music library, where Larde worked.
"He was very, very good looking, very intelligent," Alicia Nash told Nasar . "It was a little bit of a hero worship thing."
Nash began to experience what he called "the mental disturbances" in the early months of 1959, when Alicia Nash was pregnant, he wrote in his Nobel biography . Consequently, he resigned from his position as an MIT faculty member and spent 50 days under observation at the McLean Hospital in Massachusetts.
He spent the next few years in and out of hospitals, "always on an involuntary basis and always attempting a legal argument for release," he said -- despite Alicia Nash's efforts to keep him hospitalized. During periods of mental clarity, in which he was able to renounce his "delusional hypotheses," he returned to research that built his reputation as one of the most influential American mathematicians of his time.
In addition to the Nobel, Nash received the John von Neumann Theory Prize in 1978 and the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for a Seminal Contribution to Research (1999). Just last week, he was in Norway to accept the 2015 Abel Prize for mathematical contributions with longtime colleague Louis Nirenberg.
Nirenberg called Nash's death a "horrible loss" especially considering "the wonderful week" they had just shared.
"He was truly a great mathematician, a most remarkable mathematician," Nirenberg said. "He made deep contributions with every paper he wrote."
"His wife was also a wonderful person. She looked after him after all these years. She was very special."
The couple stayed together through it all, marrying for a second time in 2001.
"We thought it would be a good idea," Alicia Nash said in a PBS documentary . "After all, we've been together most of our lives."

Bangladesh's leader says that migrants should be punished for illegally leaving the country
(CNN)
Malaysian authorities have uncovered 139 graves of victims caught up in the human trafficking trade in forests close to the Thai border, the country's national police chief said Monday.
Khalid Abu Bakar said that each grave, near the town of Wang Kelian, may contain the remains of more than one person, according to Bernama , the Malaysian state news agency.
"(Authorities) found 139 suspected graves. They are not sure how many bodies are inside each grave," he told reporters at a news conference.
The bodies are expected to be exhumed Monday.
Khalid said police found 28 illegal camps, the largest of which may have held as many as 300 migrants. The fact that the camp was fenced and guarded by sentries shows that the trafficked people were captives, he said.
The bodies will be autopsied before burial to determine causes of death, he said.

In recent weeks, police in Thailand have reported finding graves and camps from human trafficking on their side of the border, and they have cracked down on people-smuggling there.
That has intensified the crisis at sea. Boats carrying migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh stay away from the shore, deepening the danger for the people crammed on board.
Many of the migrants are Rohingya Muslims, an ethnic minority fleeing persecution in western Myanmar. There are also economic migrants from Bangladesh seeking work in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.

'We will find more'
Monday's grim announcement came after Malaysia said Sunday that it had discovered mass graves and trafficking camps in a different area near the Thai border.
Malaysian Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said those camps were believed to have been in operation for at least five years and were abandoned only when authorities arrived.
He said officials were still counting the number of bodies in the graves, which were found near 17 tents in the Padang Besar area of Perlis state.
"With the cooperation of Thailand, we will find more and more," Zahid told reporters.
The Prime Minister, Najib Razak, vowed late Sunday in a tweet to bring the perpetrators to justice.
"I am deeply concerned with graves found on Malaysian soil purportedly connected to people smuggling. We will find those responsible," he wrote.

Conversely, Putin claims it's the United States that is guilty of unfairly going after people to protect their interests or punish their enemies.

Corruption allegations relating to the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively, have damaged FIFA and by extension Blatter's credibility.

"They are illegally persecuting people," he said of U.S. authorities. "I do not rule out the possibility that the same goes for this situation with FIFA."
The Russian President specifically slammed U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who was among those who announced the charges Wednesday.
"The United States Attorney General has already stated that these officers of the FIFA executive committee have committed a crime, as though (the) prosecutor is unaware of the presumption of innocence," Putin said. "Only a court can find a person guilty or not guilty, and only after that can anyone say anything."

(CNN)
In recent years, FIFA has made news not just for enforcing rules on the soccer field, but also for allegedly breaking them off it.
The body that governs soccer, the most popular sport in the world, is a multibillion-dollar behemoth.
Great power, yes. Great responsibility? Not so much, critics say.
FIFA has been regularly accused of bribery and kickbacks, allegations that reached a fever pitch after it awarded Russia and Qatar the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, respectively.
Afterward, the group carried out its own internal investigation and cleared itself.
So why is the United States, a country where soccer ranks far below football and basketball in popularity, now taking top FIFA officials to court on corruption charges ?
Most of the 14 people indicted aren't Americans.
But as U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch lays it out, the suspects planned their crimes in the U.S.; they used the U.S. banking system; they planned to profit through schemes that targeted the "growing U.S. market for soccer."
"This is a U.S. case," David Zirin, sports editor for The Nation magazine, said Wednesday on CNN.
In order to understand how, we'll have to take you through a journey that, as you'll see, involves Americans at all stages.
First up ...
Michael Garcia
Michael Garcia:
The World Cup is a big deal. It comes around every four years, and when it does, it's the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet.
When FIFA awarded the 2018 games to Russia and followed that with the even more head-scratching choice of Qatar in 2022, critics and other governments cried foul. They smelled shenanigans. They wanted a transparent account of the bidding process to see if Qatar and Russia cut any corners.
FIFA brought in Michael Garcia, a onetime U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. He was tasked with looking into the behavior of the two nations.
He spent 19 months scrutinizing the bids to host the two tournaments.
By the time he was done, his findings stretched to 350 pages.
So what did FIFA do?
It suppressed the report, released a puny 42-page summary -- and cleared itself of any wrongdoing in November.
Garcia hit back. He labeled FIFA's findings on his report "incomplete and erroneous."
Then you have ...
Loretta Lynch
James Comey and Loretta Lynch:
As we mentioned earlier, Garcia is a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The guy who held that job before him? James Comey.
He's the current FBI director. And the corruption charges are a result of a three-year FBI investigation.
Then there's the second New York connection: Attorney General Loretta Lynch .
She oversaw the case in Brooklyn before she was appointed to lead the Justice Department.
But why did U.S. authorities start looking into FIFA to begin with?
When FIFA cleared itself of wrongdoing, the FBI wasn't ready to do the same.
It wanted to know whether any of the allegations of bribe-taking and kickbacks by FIFA officials took place on American soil.
Enter ...
Chuck Blazer sits behind FIFA President Joseph Blatter in 2011 in Switzerland.
Chuck Blazer
Chuck Blazer, an American, was the No. 2 man in CONCACAF, the FIFA-affiliated governing body for North America and the Caribbean. The organization has its headquarters in Florida.
Blazer had found himself in a bind. He had amassed $11 million in unreported income, the IRS said, and he hadn't paid his taxes for many, many years. He was looking at some serious prison time.
He pleaded guilty in 2013 on corruption charges and  became a wire-wearing informant for the feds.
He provided documents and recordings of meetings with FIFA colleagues that hinted at not-so-kosher dealings, law enforcement officials said.
That meant looking into the dealings of ...
Jeffrey Webb, head of CONCACAF
CONCACAF
Remember when we mentioned CONCACAF? U.S. soccer falls under that governing body.
With Blazer as a cooperating witness, American officials set out to see whether corruption touched tournaments held in the Americas.
The feds say it did.
One of the people facing charges now is Jeffrey Webb. He's a FIFA vice president; he heads CONCACAF; and he was Blazer's boss.
Webb "used his position of trust to solicit bribes from sports marketing executives," acting U.S. Attorney Kelly T. Currie of the Eastern District of New York said
In return, they provided media, marketing and sponsorship rights to soccer matches in the Americas.
Prosecutors said those arrested accepted bribes and kickbacks totaling more than $100 million, from the early 1990s until now.
For example, $110 million in bribes changed hands in bringing Copa America , a soccer tournament usually held in South America, to the United States in 2016, Lynch said.
But can the U.S. actually go after FIFA officials?
Yes. Because it is ...
The seal of the FBI
The United States of America:
The United States brought charges against the suspects because the plots were allegedly hatched on American soil.
"According to U.S. request, these crimes were agreed and prepared in the U.S., and payments were carried out via U.S. banks," the Swiss Office of Justice said.
Prosecutors also say they think the broad reach of U.S. tax and banking regulations aid their ability to bring the charges.
In addition, U.S. authorities claim jurisdiction because the American television market, and billions paid by U.S. networks, is the largest for the World Cup.
CNN's Evan Perez and Shimon Prokupecz in Washington;  Harry Reekie in Zurich, Switzerland; and Ralph Ellis in Atlanta contributed to this report.

        <Description>The unprecedented U.S. investigation into FIFA, world soccer's governing body, has sent shock waves rippling across the globe.</Description>
        <MainBody>European soccer's governing body wants FIFA presidential election postponed
Sepp Blatter, the incumbent for 17 years, is expected to win again
U.S. officials are seeking the extradition of senior FIFA officials
(CNN)
The unprecedented twin investigations into FIFA have demonstrated that the opaque organization is subject to the law, not above it.
The Swiss are looking into the controversial 2018 and 2022 World Cup soccer bids, which awarded the games to Russia and Qatar, respectively.
The Americans have outlined a case that sounds like a mafia movie script, with allegations of fraud, racketeering and money laundering over a period of more than 20 years. Several senior FIFA officials are among the defendants facing extradition from Europe, South America and the Caribbean.
"This really is the World Cup of fraud," said Richard Weber, head of the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation division.
Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, with 240 million people regularly playing the game, according to a FIFA estimate. Even in the United States, traditionally considered indifferent to soccer, interest is growing. More Americans watched last year's U.S.-Portugal World Cup game than watched the 2014 NBA Finals or baseball's 2013 World Series.
The bombshell announcement of the U.S. indictments was met with the sense that somebody was finally doing something substantial about the corruption allegations that have dogged soccer's global gatekeeper for years.
"We could make a case that this is the biggest sports bust in history today," USA Today Sports columnist Christine Brennan told CNN. "This is historic. This is monumental."
So, what comes next in the investigations?
Here are some of the key questions:
What will happen with the extraditions?
Seven of the 14 defendants wanted by U.S. officials were arrested Wednesday in Zurich, Switzerland, said U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The majority of them are contesting extradition to the United States, according to Swiss authorities.

May 14, 2010  A turbulent period for FIFA began in May 2010 when the world's governing body for soccer was presented with official bid documents by Australia, England, Netherlands/Belgium, Japan, South Korea, Qatar, Russia, Spain/Portugal and the United States for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. During the ceremony at its Swiss headquarters, FIFA announced dates for inspections of the bidding nations from July-September.

November 18, 2010  FIFA's Ethics Committee confirms the suspension of six FIFA officials including executive committee members Amos Adamu (pictured) and Reynald Temarii, after claims by Britain's Sunday Times newspaper that they offered to sell their World Cup votes. Adamu receives a three-year ban and $11,947 fine and Temarii a 12-month ban and a $5,973 fine. The committee also rules that there is no evidence to support allegations of collusion between rival bid teams. Both Adamu and Temarii appeal unsuccessfully to FIFA's Appeal Committee and Adamu later also files an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In May 2015, FIFA bans Temarii for another eight years for allegedly accepting money from former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam to cover legal costs of his appeal of FIFA's 2010 ban.

November 29, 2010  Issa Hayatou from Cameroon (pictured) is one of three FIFA officials -- the others Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay and Ricardo Teixeira from Brazil -- who are named in a BBC program which alleges they took bribes from the International Sports and Leisure (ISL) marketing company who secured World Cup rights in the 1990s. A day later, Hayatou says he is considering legal action against the BBC. All three would have voted on the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The International Olympic Committee's Ethics Commission later looks into the claims against Hayatou -- as he was an IOC member. It finds he had personally received a sum of money from ISL as a donation to finance the African Football Confederation (CAF)'s 40th anniversary and recommends he be reprimanded. In 2013, an internal investigation finds Leoz and Teixeira accepted illegal payments from ISL but says the acceptance of bribe money was not punishable under Swiss law at the time. Its report says that as both have resigned their positions with FIFA further steps over "the morally and ethically reproachable conduct of both persons" are superfluous.

December 2, 2010  The winning bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals are announced. Russia wins the bid to host the 2018 tournament. But the big shock came when Blatter announced that Qatar would host the 2022 finals, despite FIFA's bid inspection report stating that hosting the World Cup in June and July would be "considered as a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken."

May 10, 2011  Just a few weeks before FIFA's presidential vote, former English Football Association chairman David Triesman testifies at a UK parliamentary enquiry into England's failed 2018 bid. Under the cover of parliamentary privilege, Triesman accuses FIFA Executive Committee members Jack Warner, Nicolas Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi of trying to secure cash and privileges in return for their vote. In other evidence submitted to the committee from the Sunday Times, it was alleged that FIFA vice-president Issa Hayatou along with fellow Executive Committee member Jacques Anouma has been paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar as the 2022 World Cup host. All those accused, and the Qatar Football Association, strenuously deny the allegations.

It follows a report by fellow Executive Committee member Chuck Blazer alleging that they paid $40,000 worth of bribes to secure the support of members of the Caribbean Football Union.  They deny the claims, with Warner promising a "tsunami" of revelations to clear his name. Bin Hammam claims the accusations are part of a plan to force him to withdraw as a candidate for FIFA's presidency. He is incumbent Sepp Blatter's only opponent in FIFA's presidential election due to be held June 1.

May 29, 2011  But FIFA's Ethics Committee upholds the complaints against Mohamed Bin Hammam (pictured) and Jack Warner. Bin Hammam is effectively barred from standing in the FIFA leadership election. Warner's tsunami turns out to be an email, where secretary general Jerome Valcke seems to suggest that Qatar "bought" the right to host the 2022 World Cup. After initially threatening legal action, Qatar withdraws its complaint when Valcke explains he was referring to Qatar's large, and legal, campaign budget, rather than bribes. Warner faces no further action following his resignation and the presumption of innocence remains.

The battle is set to play out in Swiss courts.

"There are always outs under these extradition treaties," Callan said.
Extradition proceedings have also begun in Argentina and Trinidad and Tobago for defendants named in the U.S. indictment.
Are there more arrests in the pipeline?
U.S. law enforcement officials say they're not done yet.
The indictment unsealed Wednesday "is the beginning of our work, not the end" of an effort to rid global soccer of corruption, said Kelly Currie, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

According to a video aired by CNN affiliate CNC3, Warner arrived at a Port-of-Spain police station in Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday. The government has received a request from the U.S. government for Warner's extradition.
In May 2011, Warner and fellow FIFA member Mohammed bin Hammam of Qatar were suspended by FIFA's Ethics Committee, pending the outcome of an investigation of corruption allegations against them.
Warner resigned from his position the following month , and FIFA announced that "all Ethics Committee procedures against him have been closed and the presumption of innocence is maintained."
How FIFA makes its billions
The Justice Department on Wednesday also unsealed information on four people and two "corporate defendants" who pleaded guilty to various charges in recent years.
One of them, Charles Blazer, a former member of the FIFA Executive Committee, "decided early on to use his position for personal gain," and between 2005 and 2010 amassed $11 million in unreported income, said the IRS'  Weber.
Also included are Warner's sons Daryll, a former FIFA development officer who pleaded guilty in 2013 to two counts related to wire fraud and structuring of financial transactions, and Daryan, who has forfeited $1.1 million as part of his plea and will forfeit an undisclosed sum when he is sentenced for wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and the structuring of financial transactions.
Jose Hawilla, the owner of the Brazilian sports marketing company, Traffic Group, also saw his 2014 indictment unsealed. At that time, he agreed to forfeit $151 million while pleading guilty to racketeering, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
Swiss probe
Details on the Swiss investigation were not as readily available.
"The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG) has opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 Football World Cups," the office said Wednesday. "In the course of said proceedings, electronic data and documents were seized today at FIFA's head office in Zurich."
The same office added later that it has blocked accounts at banks in Switzerland where alleged bribes flowed and seized related bank documents.
Swiss federal police will question Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko about how FIFA awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, an official with knowledge of the investigation has confirmed to CNN.
Mutko is one of 10 people who took part in the voting and is being investigated, according to Swiss authorities.
The attorney general's office of Switzerland said it is looking into criminal mismanagement and money laundering as part of its investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bids.
"The files seized today and the collected bank documents will serve criminal proceedings both in Switzerland and abroad," a statement from the attorney general's office said .
England was one of the countries that submitted a failed bid for the 2018 World Cup, while the United States saw its 2022 bid shot down. Soccer bodies in both countries issued statements regarding Wednesday's developments, though the U.S. Soccer Federation said it wouldn't comment on specifics.
"There is no higher priority, and nothing more important, than protecting the integrity of our game. We are committed to the highest ethical standards and business practices, and we will continue to encourage CONCACAF and FIFA to promote the same values," the U.S. federation said.
Dyke, chairman of England's Football Association, said, "As one of the associations who nominated Prince Ali it will not surprise you to learn that if the election for president goes ahead The FA will be voting for him. However, there must be a question mark over whether the election should take place in these circumstances.
FIFA has cleared itself
FIFA has been at the center of corruption investigations for years, but the organization has long dismissed allegations that top officials were on the take.

In December, FIFA's Ethics Committee said it was closing its investigation into alleged corruption in the 2018 and 2022 bidding process that awarded the World Cup to Russia and Qatar, respectively.
Criticism immediately followed. There were allegations of corruption in the bidding process. Qatar's oppressive heat also drew ridicule, as did its labor rights record.
FIFA said its investigation found no corruption and it had no reason to reopen the bidding process.
In December 2012, FIFA banned for life bin Hammam, the Qatari member of its top governing body who had previously been suspended along with Warner for ethics violations.

        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/ZQPr6YE8F7M/index.html</Link>
        <Description>Philip Cheung's photo series "Desert Dreams" shows the contrast between modern and traditional life inside the United Arab Emirates.</Description>
        <MainBody>Photographer Philip Cheung has captured life in the United Arab Emirates
His 'Desert Dreams' series contrasts modern life with traditional Arab culture
(CNN)
There's no Photoshop going on here: Those are Muslim women draped in traditional head-to-toe black coverings huddled in front of an endless row of vending machines.
Look familiar? It's where they filmed the latest Fast and Furious film, "Furious 7."
"What's interesting about the UAE is the speed at which it is developing and adapting," Cheung said.  "It's a place like no other in the Middle East, where you can see residents or citizens of the country living the lifestyles of the West or the local Bedouin lifestyle -- and sometimes both."
Cheung spent three years capturing the contradictions of Emirati life in a collection of photographs called "Desert Dreams." His images show how the country -- which consists of seven Emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi -- balances modern growth and Arab culture.
"Foreign and local cultures come together to form a surreal environment at the intersection of tradition and modernity," he said. "I wanted to document this change."
Rapid growth
When Cheung moved to Abu Dhabi in 2007 from Beirut, Lebanon, he said he "noticed how fast the landscape had changed in just one year."
Photographer Philip Cheung
He began this photography project in 2010, the same year as anti-government uprisings began unfolding across North Africa and the Middle East . The so-called Arab Spring movement never took root in the oil-rich UAE.
"In my experience, there isn't a sense of any unrest or frustration toward the rulers," Cheung said. "As I spent most of my time in the UAE while living in the Middle East, I can say that Emiratis are a deeply patriotic population and revere the royal family with great admiration and see them as leaders of the nation."
Most of Cheung's photos have an element of mismatch: something or someone who doesn't quite fit with the location. Tall dinosaur replicas hover over a dusty, inactive construction site in his image of the Falcon City of Wonders on the outskirts of Dubai.
"The Falcon City of Wonders is a planned residential, commercial and entertainment city that had been delayed being built after the 2008 global financial crisis," Cheung said of the photograph. "Not even the oil-rich Dubai was able to escape the adverse effects of the global financial crisis."
Social media
Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.
Construction on Falcon City has recently resumed, he added.
The UAE's economic boom is heavily reliant on foreign workers -- so much that Emirati citizens make up only about 15% of the population .
In one of Cheung's photographs, a foreign laborer sits alone in a ratty armchair in the middle of a dilapidated concrete lot, with gleaming skyscrapers decorating the Dubai skyline behind him.
"As the population of the city grows, so does its need for new residential and business structures, which sometimes rise out of old, outgrown neighborhoods," Cheung said of the image.
Biggest, fastest, tallest
The Emirates boasts a lot of superlatives: the tallest building , the fastest roller coaster , the largest mall , the tallest hotel .
And despite its desert climate, the UAE is also home to the world's largest natural flower garden, aptly named "The Miracle Garden."
"It has 45 million flowers," Cheung explained. The Emirates gets less than half an inch of rainfall each year, so the gardens are kept alive with recycled water.
The harsh, arid climate of the region is evident in Cheung's photograph "Sandstorm," which shows workers obscured by the blowing desert sands as they make their way to Yas Island, a man-made island in Abu Dhabi.
"It is a multipurpose entertainment, leisure and shopping center which holds the Yas Marina Circuit, which has hosted the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ; Ferrari World , the world's largest indoor theme park; and most importantly, IKEA ," Cheung said.
While it wasn't his intention to directly point out the contradictions of life in the United Arab Emirates, there's no escaping the very different worlds that coexist in this small, rapidly growing country.
"Within a day, you can move seamlessly between cool marble interiors to dusty labor camps, meet affluent VIPs and poor laborers," Cheung said. "This dichotomy is a part of what forms the character of the UAE."

China's 'nail houses': The homeowners who refused to budge 11 photos
A three-story house stands in the middle of a newly built road in China's Henan province on May 16, 2015. Construction was put to a halt as the owner refused to move because of a dispute about compensation. Like a nail that refuses to be hammered down, the dwelling is one of many "nail houses" that have sprung up in China as some homeowners resist development of their land or hold out for more money. According to construction workers, the owner is still living inside the house even though the rest of the road is complete.

In China, they're known as "nail houses"  -- homes where owners refuse to accept compensation offered by road builders and developers in exchange for the demolition of their property.

French Open 2015: The evolution of tennis fashion in 22 outfits 22 photos
1900s  Judging by this 1908 photograph of two tennis players lounging in crisp white shirt and trousers, the sport has come a long way in the last century.
"Back then, the men would play in long trousers and long shirts and sometimes even neckties. And the women would wear big skirts and occasionally corsets and big bellowing sleeves," says Ben Rothenberg, author of "The Stylish Life: Tennis."
"They would look at someone on court today and think they were practically naked by their standards."
With the French Open in full swing in Paris -- a city often described as one of the "fashion capitals of the world" -- we take a look back at some of the sport's most memorable, and downright bizarre, style moments.

1910s  A young lady enjoys a hit at the Queen's Club lawns in London, 1918, dressed in a long pleated skirt and stockings.
"Tennis started out in the Victorian era in England as a lawn sport for the aristocracy," says Rothenberg.
"It would be something that happened at social occasions; people would string up a net just in the front lawn of their manor, and they would play in fairly similar attire to what they were wearing at the time."

1920s  "One of the earliest innovations they had was the wearing of all-white, which caught on pretty quickly because it was a way for sweat to be hidden," explains Rothenberg of a dress code that still remains at Wimbledon today.
"Especially for the women, being seen to be perspiring was unthinkable and incredibly unsightly."
By the 1920s, sportswear had become less restrictive, with these two women wearing sleeveless tops and sun visors in 1926.

1920s  One of the most controversial players of the 1920s was chic French star Suzanne Lenglen (pictured in 1925).
"She was scandalous in many different ways; sometimes sipping brandy in the changeovers," says Rothenberg.
"Suzanne really was a tennis icon who had a lot of influence on general fashion. Even the head wraps she'd wear to keep the hair out of her eyes became a fixture of 1920s fashion for women around Europe and the U.S."

1930s  Off the court, French player Rene Lacoste made his name as a fashion icon with his crocodile motif (pictured here in 1932).
"Lacoste, which became the polo shirt, has really become a staple of American and European menswear," says Rothenberg.
"It's the most lasting fashion footprint worldwide coming from tennis."

1960s  "You still see wooden tennis rackets showing up in clothing catalogs a fair amount today. It's become an iconic symbol of leisure, relaxation, wealth and elegance," says Rothenberg.
"You see models holding them over their shoulder with a sweater tied around their neck, and it's become a timeless, preppy prop."
Here, two models show off their stylish sports attire in 1964.

1980s  Perhaps you'd be upset too, if you had hair like this. John McEnroe lets rip during a tournament in 1980.
"I think a lot of people identified with McEnroe," says Rothenberg. "It was right when punk music was around, and people saw him as anti-establishment in a way they found really appealing and relatable -- even though it was a love-hate relationship at times."

"That said, if you're going to wear something bold, you want to have the talent to pull it off. Everything looks better when you're winning."

"This is a type of photography that cannot be posed. This is street photography," she said.
"I have no ethical concerns because I am not ridiculing people. I have to like people in order to photograph them, and this is all a commentary."
A commentary, she says, on the aging population of Europe and how some of them reinvent themselves at the end of their lives.
"They are bizarre, exaggerated, eccentric," she said of people she photographed.

Moldes paints the scene on her iPhone 6, sending images straight into Instagram. While her subjects slept on the beach, Moldes' photos of them went viral.
"When I started taking these photos two years ago, I had no idea it would get this kind of reaction," she said.
A wave of followers, including well-known photographers, began adding her to their Instagram accounts. Reporters from various media publications began chasing her for an interview.
Her work brings to the surface very contemporary questions about the growing demographic of retirees and elderly citizens that, according to International Monetary Fund studies , is a critical issue in Europe's rich industrial nations.
"Spain is a nation of elderly people. Benidorm attracts the British and German retirees. We have a very end-of-life atmosphere here," Moldes said. "You are left with the decay of human life, of the human body. But many are very alive with their exaggerated hairdos, enjoying what is left."
We have a very end-of-life atmosphere here. ... But many are very alive with their exaggerated hairdos, enjoying what is left.
Photographer Maria Moldes
Some of her subjects have a plastic-like humanoid look of a sci-fi movie, and the word "death" is discreetly whispered in some of these photos -- as with the case of a woman being buried in the sand by her granddaughter.
There is a terminal atmosphere in the photos, Moldes said. She said many of her subjects appear as though they are waiting for a big life event, an inevitable force they cannot mentally grasp.
"The people in my photographs are looking into the unknown infinite, another world," she said. "I wanted it to have a science-fiction feel to it. So I looked for characters who could be in a movie, like extraterrestrials.
"Sometimes they look like they are dead, but what I really wanted was to show them in a static position, looking at the infinite."
Many photos might seem unflattering to the common viewer raised on a diet of thin models and images of wealth.
"These people don't have the prototype of beauty we are used to seeing," Moldes said. "But you end up liking them. Some women I found stunningly beautiful.
"You end up seeing beauty in places you wouldn't. So why not photograph them all?"

        <Description>Jan and Jay Roode capture Africa's hidden moments from the seat of their plane.</Description>
        <MainBody>By Daisy Carrington , for CNN

South African couple Jay and Jan Roode share a unique view of the African continent; it's a view from above. The husband-and-wife team operate Skyhawk Photography , and have flown to over 65 countries, sometimes risking their lives for the perfect shot from the air.
"There's no way to fly, especially over wilderness, and not be philosophical," says Jay, who takes the pictures while her husband, Jan, flies the plane.
"When you're up there, you step out of your everyday life, and you reevaluate everything that is important to you as a human being," she adds.

Through their unique vantage point, the Roodes gained a particular appreciation for wildlife, and have used their photography to highlight threats to the environment. They've partnered with conservation groups, including the Endangered Wildlife Trust , which receives a portion of the proceeds from sell of their photographs.
"We want to portray the landscape as an entity all its own, one that holds so much life," notes Jay, adding:
"Conservation is not just the face of the rhino or chimpanzee."

Jan says that he spends a lot of time in the air contemplating perspective.
"We perceive things as important because of the size of them. It sounds quite simple, but once you fly, you understand it," he says.
"As a normal human being, you'll easily look at ants and think that they're a very small insect, and without any real reverence, you would step on them and dismiss them. When you're on the ground, an animal like an elephant you'll revere because they happen to be very impressive. But when you fly, sadly, the elephant becomes the ant."

The duo say their passion doesn't come without its dangers. Jan recalls one time when Jay wanted to take a picture of an Oryx in a remote area of northern Namibia. The area was flooded with fog, which he says, "can wreak havoc on your engine."
"We have a very different perspective sometimes. I look out for the safety of us; she looks out for the image. It can create some interesting moments," he confesses.

To get the best shots, the pair have rigged their high-wing aircraft for the task, installing photographic windows in key places.
"Jan has had to put his foot down with me," confesses Jay. "When I asked him if we could cut a hole at the bottom of the aircraft he said 'no.'"

The pair have photographed many local fisherman from the air, particularly around Mozambique. The view, says Jan, is deceptively idyllic.
"When we shot these photographs to people, it looks like heaven because of the azure blues of the Indian Ocean," he says. "But one man's heaven can be another man's hell."

He notes that many of the local fisherman have a less serene view of their profession, often working 12-hour days in small dugouts.
"It's actually an extremely hard life in quite a harsh environment," notes Jan.

"It looks very romantic from our view, but the man in the dugout won't see the beauty. All he'll see is the hard reality of trying to fish every day and find food for his family," he adds.

"You do question your sanity when you do something like this," admits Jay.
"We'll be hundreds of kilometers from any civilization, just the two of us crazies in the airplane, and sometimes reality just hits you and we think we've lost our minds. But it's just a passion."

"I wish I could take everyone up and just show them how amazing this planet can be," says Jay.
"For us, it's just about showing a different perspective of this incredible planet and how wonderful it can be."

Though the latest crop of newly opened hotels is impressive, nothing can compare to the grand dames of the world: the handful of century-old institutions that have set global standards for luxury and hospitality.
These legendary hotels, spotlighted in countless films and literature, weren't just a part of history; they helped to shape it.
From the landmark Taj Mahal Palace in India to the 117-year-old Hotel Ritz in Paris -- due to reopen this year after extensive renovations that began in 2012 -- here are the world's 10 most iconic hotels.
The Plaza, New York
Opened in 1907 and designated an official landmark in 1969, The Plaza is arguably the most famous hotel in New York.
Located on Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, the 20-story building is the setting of the 1950s "Eloise" children's book series and the backdrop for classic films such as "Funny Girl," "The Great Gatsby" and "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York."
Notable guests have included Liza Minnelli, Eleanor Roosevelt, Miles Davis and The Beatles.
The hotel offers weekly tours of its interior to the public, led by an architectural historian.

Hotel Ritz Paris
The legendary Ritz Paris is due to reopen this year following extensive renovations.
Famously the headquarters of Coco Chanel, Ernest Hemingway and Ingrid Bergman, the legendary Hotel Ritz Paris has set the standard for luxury hotels since its 1898 opening.
Located by the Tuileries gardens and overlooking Place Vendome, it was declared "the most romantic hotel in the world" by Sophia Loren.
Besides its A-list clientele and silver screen cameos -- it's starred in classics like "Funny Face," "Love in the Afternoon" and "How to Steal a Million" -- the hotel is renowned for its lavish belle epoque decor, crystal chandeliers and impeccable white-glove service.
The hotel was closed in 2012 for renovations and is set to reopen this year.

Opened in 1898, this Mayfair institution was the London residence of Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and Yul Brynner. (Spencer Tracy once famously declared that, upon passing, he'd rather go to Claridge's than heaven.)
The art deco beauty is also the most storied hotel in England: During World War II, it was the haven for countless dignitaries and heads of state. In fact, Suite 212 was declared Yugoslavian territory in June 1945 so that Crown Prince Alexander II could be born on his own country's soil.
Its daily afternoon tea, served in the foyer and accompanied by a live cellist, is as iconic as the hotel itself.

Raffles, Singapore
Named after Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, this opulent, colonial-style hotel had surprisingly humble beginnings: It was originally built as a small 10-room bungalow.
It's now arguably the most famous hotel in Asia and, more than 125 years after opening, was declared a national monument.
In addition to hosting literati like Hemingway, Alfred Hitchcock and Rudyard Kipling (who penned "The Jungle Book" while residing in one of its suites), the hotel is the birthplace of the famed Singapore Sling cocktail.

The Taj is renowned across the world for its vast elegance, impeccable service and sheer magnitude: It has 560 rooms, 44 suites and 1,500 staff, including 35 butlers.
Despite being the site of a deadly terrorist attack in 2008, the hotel remains popular among tourists and celebrities alike: President Barack Obama reportedly rented out the entire property during his 2010 visit.

Since its opening in 1928, the Peninsula has set the standard for luxury in Hong Kong, from its glossy fleet of green Rolls Royce Phantoms to the private jet available for guest use.
It's also Hong Kong's oldest hotel and the first to feature pageboys and buffet dining.

The Waldorf-Astoria has hosted every U.S. president from Hoover to Obama.
Located on Park Avenue, the Waldorf Astoria was once the world's tallest hotel. Though it no longer lays claim to that title, it's still a registered New York landmark.
It has, after all, hosted every U.S. president from Hoover to Obama and even features a "secret" train platform beneath the hotel, used by high-security VIP guests such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (It is no longer operational.)
The hotel is credited with inventing the concept of 24-hour room service -- changing the hotel industry forever -- as well as the Waldorf salad, crafted by matre d' Oscar Tschirky in 1893.

The Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin
Located on St. Stephen's Green in the heart of Dublin, the lavish Shelbourne Hotel is Ireland's oldest and most historic hotel, built in 1824.
In 1916, it was taken over by British troops during the Easter Rebellion, and it served as a hub of military activity during World War I.
In 1922, the Irish Constitution was drawn up in Room 112 (now known as the Constitution Room).
Colorful history aside, it's the grandest and most beautiful hotel in Dublin, with its Renaissance-style facade, ornate crystal chandeliers, marble pillars and sumptuous decor.

        <Description>From a mossy forest in the Philippines to the sand slopes of Morocco, this past year has seen some staggering biological discoveries. Among the 18,000 new species named during the past year, an international committee of taxonomists selected their top 10 favorites for SUNY's College of Environmental Science and Forestry's annual list. Previous years have recognized such luminaries as the Pancake Batfish and the Dragon Tree. This year's top 10 was no less surreal. Click through to see pictures.</Description>

Feathered dinosaurs, cartwheeling spiders: SUNY's top 10 new species 10 photos
A 600 pound, feathered dinosaur or a 'chicken from hell'  An international committee of taxonomists selected their top 10 favorite newly discovered species for an annual list by State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry.
Scientists working in the Hell Creek Formation of North and South Dakota found three partial skeletons of 10-foot long dinosaurs from the time of T. rex. It soon became clear that a massive, feathered dinosaur once lived in what is now North America.
This species, nicknamed the "chicken from hell," had traits of both birds and dinosaurs (though did not have much in common chickens).
They sported feathers and parrot like beaks, and weighed about 600 pounds. This finding follows a trend that indicates the evolutionary commonalities between today's birds and long extinct dinosaurs.

A new plant that may not be around for long  The coral plant , discovered in Philippines and named for its coral like appearance, was one of two plants that made the list. Unlike most plants, this one does not produce its own nutrition through photosynthesis, instead drawing from other organisms.
The parasitic plant has only been found in the forest areas of the Philippines' Mount Mingan.
According to ESF, its rarity makes it critically endangered, which means people may need to enjoy this unique parasite while it lasts.

A spider that inspired a robot  When people flee from something, they run as fast as they can, try their best to walk away inconspicuously or just close their browser.
A newly discovered species of spider found in the sand dunes of Morocco opts to cartwheel away when confronted with a high level threat. Of course, that only comes after it tries other strategies, such as striking a threatening posture or strikes out at danger directly.
Cartwheeling is apparently hard work, especially in a desert, which means the cartwheeling spider can only perform its eponymous feat for a short period. Nevertheless, its ability to roll up and down sand dunes with ease has inspired a robot designed to explore the surface of mars.

A mushroom-like animal that could defy classification  The above species looks like a strange mushroom. Scientists are certain that it is an animal, but any further classification is still up for debate.
According to ESF, this species, the X-phyla, could be related to various existing sea animals like jellyfish and coral, or the X-phyla could be in a phylum all its own. This was found on the sea floor off the coast of Australia.

A wasp with a morbid childrearing strategy  The bone-house wasp , discovered in China's Gutianshan National Nature Reserve, has an appropriately creepy name.
To protect her young, the female bone-house wasp build nests with several cells. She then proceeds to kill spiders and place them in each cell for her future young to eat. After she lays an egg in a spider tomb, she seals it and continues onto the next one. She fills the final cell with dead ants, whose corpses emit chemicals that camouflage the nest.
The process is apparently as effective as it is morbid.

A fanged frog that gives live birth  The limnonectes larvaepartus, or Indonesian Frog , is a rarity among rarities as far as frogs are concerned. Most frogs lay eggs that grow into tadpoles which grow into frogs. Barely any frogs give live birth, and those that do give birth to small frogs.
As far as scientists know, the Indonesian Frog is alone in giving live birth to tadpoles after internal fertilization.

A culprit behind underwater 'mystery circles'  According to ESF, elaborate circles on the ocean floor off the cost of the Ryukyu Islands in Japan have puzzled scientists for 20 years. Apparently these "mystery circles" were spawning nests for a newly discovered species of pufferfish . The male pufferfish dig these ridged figures to attract females and protect their eggs from the perils of the ocean.
According to a video of the fish captured by BBC One, the male works for a full week, without stopping, to create the circles. Apparently the mystery created and the dedication proven by this species earned this strain of pufferfish a spot in the top 10.

In front of a white building, with a Belgian flag flying high in the yard, a black man in a striped t-shirt and shorts is being strangled with a chain.
Nearby, another black man is lying face down on the ground, his trousers pulled down to reveal deep bleeding cuts in his buttocks. Above him stands another black man, smartly dressed in a colonial police officer's uniform, whip raised above his head, ready to strike. The guard looks furtively over at a white man, in a white uniform with the Belgian flag sewn into his lapel, and a white pith helmet on his head. He smokes a pipe and has one hand in his pocket. The other hand casually directs the violence in the yard.
This scene is from one of the paintings in a new exhibition, 53 Echoes of Zaire , which opens on 27 May at the Sulger-Buel-Lovell gallery in London. The painting, titled "Congo Belge II," was made in the 1970s and depicts a period in the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (previously know as Zaire), a former Belgian colony.
The Kingdom of Kongo rose in the 1300s, and part of it became Congo Free State, the private holding of Belgian King Leopold II, in the 1880s. Speaking of that colonial history, Christian Sulger-Buel, who co-founded the gallery says: "Belgian Congo is an extraordinary exception to the colonial norm. It was dramatically exploited by one man, King Leopold (II), who treated the people and the land like his private property. He owned Congo the way you'd own your car."
Political art
The artist, T. Kalema, was part of a group that came to be known as the "Lumumbashi Movement," artists living and working in the southeastern city of Lumumbashi. The work of the Lumumbashi Movement served as a way to document Congo's turbulent history.
The political nature of the art created in Lumumbashi in the 1970s is particular to the city, which is the copper mining heartland of Congo.  "In Kinshasa (the capital of the DRC) the subjects of art were typically social, lighter and with a lot of humor," says Salimata Diop, head of programs at London's Africa Centre, and the exhibition's curator.
By contrast, artists who were part of the Lumumbashi Movement painted scenes from the slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, through to the brutality by the colonial masters and right up to their contemporary struggles: miners strikes, independence, the secession of Katanga, and hope in Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba that turns to despair as he's arrested and later killed.
"These artists were not making 'airport art' -- art for foreigners or tourists to buy," says Diop. "They saw themselves as artisans and were making art for local people."
Among these visual historians in Lumumbashi a sub-genre called "Colonie Belge" became popular. "These paintings typically depict a white man -- the colonial master -- impeccably dressed, doing nothing except watching a black man flog another black man, often while his family look on," explains Sulger-Buel.
The images are striking not just for their graphic content but also for their use of color, a remarkable achievement considering the poverty in which the artists lived. "They had access to only basic primary colors and despite the fine lines in some of the paintings, only worked with large brushes," says Sulger-Buel.
'The demons of Africa'
Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu, the lead artist in the exhibition with over 30 works, had aspirations to be a teacher but became an artist. He was already prolific when he met Etienne Bol, a Belgian man his age with whom he struck up a friendship. Between 1971 and 73, Bol commissioned Kanda-Matulu and four other artists to paint the images displayed in the exhibition.
Diop says: "Paintings (usually created on canvasses made from flour sacks) sold for very modest sums. Kanda-Matulu lived in a small one bedroom house and found it difficult to make a living from his art. He was very poor."
Despite his contribution to popular Congolese art, Kanda-Matulu's life is shrouded in mystery. He met Etienne Bol in 1972, 10 years later, in 1982, he disappeared. People he knew thought he had gone back to his village, others speculated that he may have moved to neighboring Zambia. Given the political nature of his art, could his disappearance have been politically motivated?
Diop doesn't think so but says: "Tshibumba was easy to find -- he was always working from home. But suddenly, he wasn't there anymore. In the troubled times (under the autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko) it was not uncommon for people to move a lot in search of a peaceful life.  We don't know if he's alive or dead."
The exhibition, which closes on June 30, the day Congo gained independence from Belgium 55 years ago, is overall a portrayal of what Sulger-Buel calls "the demons of Africa -- forced labor, civil war, violent repression of student protests," which still haunt Congo today.
Whether seen as a retelling of the past or a perspective on its present day, the art and artists of the Lumumbashi Movement deserve a place in Congo's national history and on the global art scene.

(CNN)
An Al-Shabaab leader wanted by the United States has died in Somalia, the Somali-based militant group announced Thursday.
A mouthpiece radio channel for the group carried a message saying Sheikh Hassan Turki (also known as Hassan Abillahi Hersi Turki) died Wednesday. The circumstances of his death were not immediately clear.
Turki was believed to be in his 70s and had transitioned from being a military leader into a spiritual figurehead after falling ill.
What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want?
The United States first sanctioned him in 2004 for alleged links to terror attacks and association with al Qaeda.
The U.N. Security Council said Turki played a role in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

        <MainBody>Ciudad Acua, Mexico, is struck by a tornado
At least 13 deaths have been reported
It is the same storm system causing floods in Texas
(CNN)
In six seconds, a tornado ripped through the border city of Ciudad Acua, Mexico, with a ferocity that officials said hasn't been witnessed in more than 100 years.
At least 13 people were killed, including three children, Acua Mayor Evaristo Lenin Perez said. Another 200 were injured.
Photos from the scene, which sits right across the border from Del Rio, Texas, showed cars blown upright, front bumper on the ground and leaning against homes. The twister flipped over school buses and damaged about 400 homes.
Officials said records don't show such a powerful tornado hitting the city in more than a century.
The storm system that spawned the deadly tornado is the same one whose rains have caused flooding in Central Texas.

Monday's thunderstorm dumped rain and hail on both communities straddling the border, but it was Acua that bore brunt of the severe weather.
The part of Acua where the tornado struck is densely populated, making the damage all that more severe.
One resident, walking around the damaged area, said he saw part of a car that had been tossed to the summit of a hill.
"You can also see another truck that was flung by the wind into the side of the hill," Homero Iracheta said.

Acua is a historic border city that people outside of Mexico know as the setting for Robert Rodriguez's films "El Mariachi" and "Desperado," and George Strait's song, "Blame it on Mexico."
Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto announced that he will visit Acua, about 155 miles west of San Antonio, Texas, to survey the damage.

Brazilian gymnasts suspended after posting video using racist term
By Shasta Darlington, CNN

Angelo Assumpcao of Brazil celebrates during day one of the Gymnastics World Challenge Cup Brazil 2015 at Ibirapuera Gymnasium on May 2, 2015.
Story highlights
Gymnasts compare black teammate to a trash bag and the color of a broken phone screen
They have apologized and the teammate says, "But there's no problem, we're friends"
Sao Paulo (CNN)
Three Brazilian gymnasts were suspended after posting a video on social media teasing their black teammate about his skin color and comparing him to a trash bag.
The three young men recorded a cell phone video joking with their teammate, 18-year-old teammate Angelo Assumpcao.
"The plastic bag at the supermarket is white ... and the trash bag? Black!" the voices shout, using a word that is a racist term in Brazil for blacks.
They also joke that when a cell phone is working, the screen is white. But when it's broken, the screen is black.
The video was posted by Arthur Nory, one of the gymnasts involved, on Snapchat last week. A day later he tweeted that Snapchat had shut his account down. That tweet has disappeared from his account.
In the video, also posted on Globo newspaper's website , Assumpcao appears to be annoyed. When the gymnasts try to apologize, he accuses them of being "fake."
The video quickly went viral, prompting angry responses and accusations of racism.
Many people said it set a bad example as Rio de Janeiro prepares to host the 2016 Olympics.
The Brazilian Gymnastics Confederation has suspended Nory, 21, and the two other gymnasts involved: Felipe Arakawa, 21, and Henrique Flores, 24. They will also have to appear before a sports tribunal.
Before the confederation announced its decision, the three gymnasts posted a second video along with Assumpcao on Nory's Instagram site .
In it, Nory expresses his "sincere apologies" and Arakawa says they were misunderstood.
Assumpcao says, "But there's no problem, we're friends."

        <MainBody>FIFA boss tackles Israeli-Palestinian tensions 02:15
Story highlights
Israel says it approved 95% of travel; Palestinians say travel bans ensnare coaches, goalies
FIFA members could vote on Palestinian bid to suspend Israel, which FIFA leader hopes to avoid
Palestinians say Israel restricts players' movements; Israel says they're mixing sports, politics
Jerusalem (CNN)
FIFA President Sepp Blatter is trying to broker a deal between the Palestinian and Israel football associations ahead of this week's FIFA World Congress at which the Palestinians have called for a vote to suspend Israel.
Blatter met with both associations, as well as Israeli and Palestinian political leaders, during a visit to the region in hopes of finding a way to ease the tension. FIFA is the international soccer governing body.
"Football has the power to connect people," Blatter said at a press conference last week in Jerusalem. "Football has the power to construct bridges. I am coming here and going to your neighbors ... to try to construct bridges and to try and make sure that football is not dividing, but football is uniting."
Instead of a vote, Blatter suggests a game between the two national teams, offering Zurich, Switzerland, as a possible location.
The Palestinian group objects to Israeli teams playing in the West Bank. They also say Israel restricts movements of Palestinian players between the West Bank and Gaza as well as for international matches.
"They keep bullying here and there, and I think they have no right to keep being the bully of the neighborhood," Palestinian Football Association President Jibril Rajoub said of Israel. "If the Israelis are using the issue of security, I can say that their security concern is mine. I am ready to fix parameters for security concerns, but security should not be used ... as a tool in order to keep this racist, apartheid policies."
He declared the situation in the West Bank far worse than apartheid that existed in South Africa because right-wingers and extremists in Israel want to "delete Palestine." In the 1960s, FIFA suspended South Africa for decades after it failed to comply with the association's nondiscrimination policies. The nation was also expelled from FIFA a month after the Soweto Youth Uprising of 1976 .
"I am not asking for the suspension of the Israeli association; I am asking to end the suffering of the Palestinian footballers," Rajoub said. "I am asking to end the grievances, the humiliation we are facing."
Israel Football Association President Ofer Eini said the restrictions on movement are a question of security. Eini said the association has no influence over such matters. He said the Palestinians are mixing sports and politics.
Association CEO Rotem Kemer said 95% of travel requests for players have been approved in 2015.
"We will continue helping the Palestinian association," Eini said. "We will extend a hand to them. If football is to be the unifying thing, I embrace them because I want football to flourish there just like I want it to flourish here."
While it may be true that 95% of permits have been approved this year, Susan Shalabi, director of the Palestine Football Association's international relations department, said even denying one permit can have a hugely detrimental effect on competition.
"So they say they've approved 95% of the permits. Let's be more optimistic and assume that they approve 99%. What's the point if the 1% includes the head coach, captain or goalkeeper of the national team? Or those of a visiting team? Will any association accept to play without all or any of these? It's about the principle, not statistics. Footballers should not be denied to move at all," Shalabi said.
Blatter said he is working to remove the suspension vote from the agenda. The vote would require 75% of FIFA's 209 member associations to succeed. Blatter said Israel has not violated any FIFA rules, and that other mechanisms exist to address issues between FIFA members, such as an ethics committee and a disciplinary committee, but he said FIFA rules allow the Palestinians to call for a vote.
The Palestinian bid to have Israel suspended from FIFA is part of much broader international pressure coming to bear on Israel to recognize a Palestinian state. The Vatican's recent recognition of Palestinian statehood is the latest in a series of such successes for the Palestinian Authority.
The International Criminal Court has recognized Palestinian membership, and the United Nations recognized the Palestinians as a nonmember observer state. A bid for full recognition failed to get the necessary U.N. Security Council votes in December.

        <MainBody>Addressing the unspoken apartheid of Southeast Asia 03:30
Story highlights
HRW calls for victims' rights to be prioritized in international meeting held Friday
Malaysian authorities confirm arrest of two officers related to graves discovered near Malay-Thai border
(CNN)
The rights of those people stranded at sea or in holding camps should be the top priority, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned ahead of a regional meeting in Bangkok designed to provide solutions to Southeast Asia's migrant crisis.
"Regional governments should work with the United Nations and others to agree on binding solutions to this human tragedy -- not sweep it under the rug as they have done for years," said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director, in a statement.
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), an estimated 25,000 Southeast Asian migrants took to the seas in the first three months of 2015.
The Special Meeting on Irregular Migration in the Indian Ocean, which takes place Friday, will bring together representatives from Southeast Asian nations as well as Australia, New Zealand, Afghanistan and Iran, among others. The U.S., Switzerland and representatives from the UNCHR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) will be present as observers.
At a meeting last week, Indonesia and Malaysia agreed to temporarily accept thousands of migrants, as long as the international community helps to resettle them within one year.
But HRW has called for "unimpeded and unconditional access" for internationally-recognized organizations like UNHCR and IOM to rescued migrants and refugees in order to assess their claims for refugee status.
"It's going to be very important for front-line states to provide full and unimpeded access to the UNHCR and assess whether they are eligible," Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, told CNN Wednesday.
"The one-year deadline is only going to happen if there are impartial assessments (of refugee status claims) by international agencies like the UNHCR."
Short- and long-term solutions
The advocacy group has also called for better search and rescue capabilities now and in the future, and urged participants at Friday's meeting to demand that Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries permit disembarkation of seaborne migrants.
In order to secure longer term solutions, HRW says they should "exert pressure on Burma as the main source of the problem," and provide basic health, education, and other services for Rohingya in an effort to curb illegal migration. Burma is also known as Myanmar.
"This regional meeting will only be a success if every government commits to effective search and rescue operations, meeting the protection needs of refugees, prosecuting traffickers, and resolving the root causes that drive these desperate people onto boats," Adams said.
"International burden sharing, including resettling refugees, is also important, but will only be a lasting solution if all governments agree that human rights must be at the center of all current and future policies."
Arrests made over Malaysia camps
Two police officers have been arrested thus far in connection to migrant graves discovered on the Malay-Thai border earlier this week, according to CNN's Ivan Watson, who is with Malaysian authorities in the area.
Malaysian authorities said that the 139 graves and 28 abandoned camps found were related to human trafficking.
Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said Thursday that Malaysian police and border guards working as part of a joint operation, found a burial site that contained corpses which had decomposed to the level that only skin and bones remained.
Fences and sentry posts indicated the camps held captive migrants, he said.
Malaysian officials told CNN that evidence pointed to the graves being part of a established burial ground.
"You must see the Muslim aspect of the grave, it seems like a  Muslim ceremonial burial," said Deputy Inspector-General of Police Noor Rashid, pointing to the existence of traditional Muslim burial shrouds as evidence.
Four bodies have been exhumed thus far, and officials expect the exhumation process to be finished by June 8.
Those who have experienced the camps tell of a brutal existence as the brokers seek to extort the migrants' relatives.
"Brokers told our relatives to send the money and beat us when we were on the phone. They're very bad people," Sharuf Khan, a Rohingya migrant who spent seven months in a jungle camp, told CNN affiliate ITN. "There's little to eat here. Some people starve. Many are sick.
"One man didn't have the money to pay the ransom, so the brokers beat him. They handed him over to the camp guards, and said, 'you can finish him.' The guards took a rope and hanged him."

The Rohingya are a persecuted Muslim minority who are effectively stateless in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are forced to live in crowded camps -- which they are generally forbidden to leave --  and are considered to be interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, despite the fact that many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

More than 1,600 migrants -- both Rohingya and economic migrants from Bangladesh -- have landed in Malaysia and Indonesia since Sunday, May 10, officials say, after Thai officials began cracking down on human trafficking camps operating in the country's south near the Malaysian border, disrupting established people-smuggling networks.

Forced onto boats
Earlier in the week HRW alleged that some of the thousands of displaced boat people -- many of whom are still stranded at sea -- were forcibly removed from their homes and put on migrant ships.
The agency has collated witness reports from Rohingya Muslims -- a minority which endures persecution in Myanmar -- who say they were forced to leave the country by groups of men armed with knives and guns.
Yasmine, a 13-year-old girl, told HRW that a dozen men came to her home in Rakhine State, home to many Rohingya, and told her she needed to leave Myanmar to join her brother in Malaysia.
"They dragged me to the boat, they had sticks and threatened to beat me," she said. "I screamed, I cried loudly. My parents were weeping, but they couldn't do anything. I went onto the boat with three men. When I got to the big boat... I cannot explain my feeling, I was so scared."
Another, 16-year-old Arefa, said six Rakhine Buddhists from Bangladesh, armed with knives and guns, forced her to get on a boat.
"They told me I was leaving Myanmar," she said. After a six-hour journey to a larger vessel she spent two months at sea with 95 other migrants, amid dwindling food supplies and abysmal sanitary conditions, before arriving in Malaysia.
"I don't know what I'll do in Malaysia, I have no money. I miss Myanmar, but I know I cannot go back," she said.
GO DEEPER: How to end modern-day slavery
Worsening crisis
Whether seeking a new life voluntarily or forcibly removed from their homes, migrants and refugees from Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh have no choice but to put their lives into the hands of unscrupulous brokers and traffickers.
After weeks or even months at sea, they are either dumped in unfamiliar countries like Thailand, with no money, to fend for themselves, or are herded into camps in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia where they are held captive and further mistreated.
"Survivors describe how they flee persecution in Burma only to fall into the hands of traffickers and extortionists, in many cases witnessing deaths and suffering abuse and hunger," said Adams.
"Interviews with officials and others make clear that these brutal networks, with the complicity of government officials in Burma, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia, profit from the desperation and misery of some of the world's most persecuted and neglected people."

(CNN)
Mass graves of refugees caught up in the human-trafficking trade have been found in northern Malaysia near the border with Thailand, authorities said Sunday.
Malaysian Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the trafficking camps were believed to have been in operation for at least five years and were only abandoned when authorities arrived on the scene, according to Bernama, the Malaysian state news agency.
He said officials were still counting the number of bodies in the graves, which were found near 17 tents in the Padang Besar area of Perlis state.
"With the cooperation of Thailand, we will find more and more," Zahid told reporters.
Graves previously found in Thailand
Police in Thailand have reported finding graves and camps from human trafficking on their side of the border in recent weeks, prompting a crackdown on the trade from authorities.
But that has intensified the crisis at sea . Boats carrying the migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh have chosen to stay away from the shore, deepening the plight of the people crammed on board, who often lack food and drinking water.
Many of the migrants caught up in the crisis are Rohingya Muslims , an ethnic minority fleeing persecution in western Myanmar. There are also Bangladeshi economic migrants seeking work in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.

Sport and politics collide in Azerbaijan 06:13
Its leaders want to use sport to change the way you see it. To make that happen, President Ilham Aliyev reportedly has spent about $10 billion of the oil-rich state's money on this event alone.
Next will come a Formula One race, hosted -- like the European Games -- in the Azeri capital Baku in 2016. Following that will be the 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games.
Elevating Azerbaijan through sport even extends to sponsoring the shirts of Spanish football team Atletico Madrid, which are emblazoned with that "Land of Fire" slogan.
 en.AzVision.az (@AzvisionEn) May 18, 2015
Aliyev is at the heart of this movement. Prior to becoming president in 2003, he led the country's national Olympic committee -- a position he still holds.
"You could say that he comes from sport, he understands sport, he gets sport," says Simon Clegg, former leader of the British Olympic Association, now the chief operating officer of the European Games.
"He realizes how sport can be used to deliver political objectives, whatever those political objectives are."
Comparisons have been drawn with the likes of Russia and Qatar, whose leaders also sought to reposition themselves through sport.
President Vladimir Putin oversaw vast expenditure on Sochi's Winter Olympics last year, while Qatar won the right to stage the 2022 FIFA World Cup -- which follows Russia in 2018 -- not to mention the 2019 athletics world championships and other, similar events.
Both Russia and Qatar face -- and largely dismiss -- allegations of human rights abuses and corruption in relation to major sporting events.
Human rights campaigners say Azerbaijan, in attempting to emulate them, is no different. Just days from the start of Baku 2015, they say the freedom of Azeri citizens is now more restricted than ever.
'Empty society'
"The past year, I would argue, has been the worst on record for human rights in Azerbaijan since the breakup of the Soviet Union," says Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch.
"I don't think it's fair to expect countries to have perfect transitions overnight, or maybe even in 24 years (since Soviet disintegration in the region, in 1991). But I do think it's fair to expect them to not regress significantly."
Denber accuses Azeri authorities of imprisoning dozens of political, youth, and human rights activists on spurious grounds, as the country clamps down on freedom of expression.
Journalist Mehman Huseynov says he was one of those targeted.
Huseynov told CNN he was arrested after helping to found a pro-democracy campaign during the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, also hosted by Azerbaijan.
"I allegedly beat four or five police officers," said Huseynov, arguing the charge was laughable.
"These policemen are an elite unit. It took them one and a half months to bring up that charge. They were waiting for the end of Eurovision to start the revenge campaign."
Huseynov says he has been barred from leaving Baku, let alone Azerbaijan, for most of the past four years. He believes his phone is tapped.
"We are living in something like an 'empty society.' Everybody is frightened. Independent journalists are intimidated," he told CNN.
"International events are not helpful for us."

Azad Rahimov is Azerbaijan's minister of youth and sports. He is a crucial figure in the organization of the European Games, and the man tasked with building the nation's profile through similar events.
Speaking to CNN, Rahimov directly addressed human rights concerns in his country for the first time.
"We have no journalists sitting in prison," says Rahimov.
"We have our open, opposition press. We have a lot of different newspapers and magazine opposition, we have open internet. How do we have so many newspapers, if they are all in prison?
"I, personally, really don't understand the link between human rights and the European Games. I don't understand that. Because it's a totally different issue."
Rahimov prefers to see the European Games through the lens of positive change being brought to Azerbaijan. As an example, he points to dozens of Olympic sports complexes that have been built there in the past 15 years.
"As a government, we pay big, big attention to sports construction involving young people," he says. "We want to see our future generation healthy, and sport is the best opportunity and possibility to get that."
'We are treated very well'
Azeri athletes happily supported this vision when CNN visited some of Baku's fast-improving facilities.
"Thanks to God, I have everything. Our government gave us everything we need," says wrestler Rovshan Bayramov.
The 28-year-old has won two Olympic silver medals, and a world title, in one of his country's most popular sports. He says the European Games will be a "great celebration" for Azerbaijan.
"Nobody is pushing us to train hard, it is just our own heartfelt drive," says Bayramov.
"Whatever we do is for our country ... and we have great support from our federation, from the head of our country. We hope we can justify that confidence and support.
"I can just be happy that other sports are improved (alongside wrestling). It would be good if the number of stars in Azerbaijan increases. It would be perfect if we have more stars."
Not long ago, when you looked for Azeri sporting stars, you would find former soccer official Tofiq Bahramov. A linesman in the 1966 World Cup final, it was Bahramov who ruled that Geoff Hurst's infamous second goal for England against West Germany had crossed the line.
Later in life, Bahramov -- who died in 1993 -- had a stadium in Baku named after him. It will host archery at the European Games.
Now, sports minister Rahimov wants new stars, but he will not say precisely how many in terms of European gold medals. But, he confides, he wants the country to finish 10th or higher in the medals table.
 UEG (@UEGymnastics) May 12, 2015
Rahimov says his country is doing this to inspire young people like Marina Durunda, a 17-year-old rhythmic gymnast.
Born in Ukraine, she grew up in Cyprus and accepted an invitation to compete for Azerbaijan in 2012.
"The facilities here are great. They are the best in the world of rhythmic gymnastics," says Durunda, who won bronze in the ribbon event at this year's European Championships.
"Gymnastics in Azerbaijan is moving very rapidly forward and the facilities are getting better and better ... it cannot be compared with any other country. We are treated very well here."
But Denber and Human Rights Watch insist the real motives of Rahimov, and Azerbaijan, don't put the country's people first.
"I think that they are eager to boost their prestige -- not just the prestige of their country, but also their personal prestige globally and domestically," says Denber.
"(When) they put their country on display, they put their own sort of personal clout and power on display."
Clegg says that is not true. He believes the nation's ambitions are "incredibly healthy" and that a "stunning sporting event" is on the way in June. But he also declined to answer any questions regarding human rights, claiming they are best left to politicians, not sports organizers.
Huseynov, by contrast, says Azeri people know that clout and power all too well.

Ireland becomes first country to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote
The measure passed by more than 60%
Dublin, Ireland (CNN)
Same-sex couples will soon be able to walk down the aisle in the Emerald Isle.
Voters in Ireland overwhelmingly chose to change their nation's constitution Friday, becoming the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote.
The official results were announced Saturday at a Dublin Castle press conference: 1,201,607 voted in favor of the landmark referendum, while 734,300 voted against it, said Rona N Fhlanghaile, an elections official.
Voter turnout  in the majority Catholic nation was more than 60%, according to Fhlanghaile.
Despite speculation in the run-up that opposition to the measure might have been understated because people were too shy to tell pollsters that they planned to vote "no" -- the outcome was lopsided, with the measure passing by just over 61% of the total vote cast.
Once the votes began to be tallied,  the result was never in doubt.
Only one of the country's 43 parliamentary constituencies failed to pass it.
Support from Ireland's political leaders
As is the case in many other countries around the world, the issue is a polarizing one in Ireland, a country that didn't decriminalize homosexuality until the 1990s.
This referendum was seen as a test of whether more liberal thinking can trump Ireland's traditionally conservative, Catholic leanings.
The "yes" campaign enjoyed considerable support from the country's political establishment.
Prime Minister Enda Kenny said prior to the vote that the country could "create history" and that a "yes" vote would "obliterate" prejudice along with irrational fears of difference.  On Saturday, Kenny said the outcome "disclosed who we are -- a generous, compassionate, bold and joyful people."
"In Ireland, we're known as a nation of storytellers," added Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton. "And today, the people have told quite some story. This is a magical, moving moment."
Gerry Adams, leader of the Sinn Fein political party, called it "a huge day for equality," and over the border in Northern Ireland --  the only part of the United Kingdom where same-sex marriage is still prohibited -- Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness hoped they'll take notice.
"The world is moving on and Ireland is taking the lead," said McGuinness. "Politicians, particularly in the north need to reflect on this progress."
About civil marriage equality
While same-sex "civil partnerships" were introduced in Ireland in 2010, advocates for marriage equality said those fell short of the recognition and protections afforded by marriage.
Gay and lesbian couples will now be able to enter into civil marriage, which "is different and distinct from religious marriage," according to Yes Equality , the umbrella group that spearheaded the campaign. "No religious institution can be forced to marry a lesbian or gay couple against their beliefs," the group's website says. "Churches will be able to continue with religious ceremonies and will not be required to conduct wedding ceremonies for same-sex couples."
Opposition was largely organized by Catholic groups that focused on a message of protecting the traditional family.
Yes Equality says however that the outcome will have no bearing on surrogacy or adoption rights.
Despite the pounding they took at the polls, opposition groups struck a conciliatory tone after it was over.
"Congratulations to the Yes side. Well done. #MarRef," tweeted a conservative Catholic think tank that advocated against legalizing same-sex marriage.
Congratulations to the Yes side. Well done. #MarRef
 David Quinn (@DavQuinn) May 23, 2015
"This is their day, and they should enjoy it," said another group opposing same-sex marriage, Mothers and Fathers Matter.
"Though at times this campaign was unpleasant for people on all sides, nobody who involves themselves in a campaign does so with anything but the good of their country at heart," read a group statement. "There is no better way to resolve difference than the way we are using today."

Article 19 condemns Turkmen human rights 01:24
True, it has some of the most incredible buildings and monuments -- all made of white marble and gold. It's clean -- incredibly clean -- with workers out first thing every morning hard at work scrubbing the streets.
But shops are nowhere to be seen; nor adverts for international brands. Even people are hard to come by.
We'd been on Turkmenistan soil for 30 seconds when we glimpse our first Berdimuhamedov portrait. It took just 10 minutes from exiting the airport to be told: "You can't film that."
So just how is Turkmenistan -- a country seemingly so unaccustomed to international visitors, let alone the media -- going to cope with 8,000 athletes and officials from around the world when it hosts the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games in 2017?
The National Television and Radio Company of Turkmenistan helps keep the nation in check. It's based in a Guinness World Record winning star shaped building perched on  hillside overlooking Ashgabat.
All channels and newspaper are under state control. Guess whose picture appears on the front pages every day?

Berdimuhamedov has come to the conclusion that sport is not only a way to sell his country internationally, but also improve Turkmenistan internally and he preaches the importance of a fit and healthy nation.
Our student guide Gee tells us: "The first thing that our president always says is that our children, our new generation should be healthy and to be healthy the first thing is to do sports -- that is why he is opening new complexes, he is giving us new opportunities, and also we are doing here some kind of new sports."
Like Russian president Vladimir Putin, Berdimuhamedov is a leader who likes to lead by example.
There are pictures of him taking part in all kinds of sport -- from taekwondo to football to shooting.
And like Putin, Berdimuhamedov is a fan of horses, even riding as a jockey at the local race track.
Berdimuhamedov encourages his people to take "The Walk of Health" -- a 36 kilometer long stepped path that wends it way through the mountains of Ashgabat.
And the new apartment blocks being built in the city all have sports courts and pitches at the back of them -- for tennis, basketball and five-a-side football.
Nobody we met would say anything against Berdimuhamedov. Then again we struggled to find anyone to say very much at all about anything.
We asked to speak to Turkmenistan officials about their drive for sport and their campaign -- the "Month of Health" -- that coincided with our visit.  We were negotiating past midnight to speak to them, but as our trip went on, our interviewees dropped out.
In the end there was a very short media conference -- the first for international journalists the country has ever held -- with the head of the Turkmenistan Olympic Committee, which marks progress to a degree.
We were told it wasn't a case of not wanting to speak or open up, but after being so closed for so long, there was a real fear of getting it wrong.  Whether that fear is of those inside or outside Turkmenistan we never found out.

There's no doubt Turkmenistan is visually stunning. As well as all that white marble, there's "The Gateway to Hell," a 70-meter wide crater in the desert that's home to a naturally burning gas fire.
We managed to escape the confines of the media conference to sample "The Walk of Health" that citizens are encouraged to walk every year.
We drove through a village where a lady was walking her cow through a field. We spoke to some children in the old part of Ashgabat, away from the marble-riddled parts of city.
The racecourse and stables where Berdimuhamedov keeps his famed Akhal-Teke horses are very impressive.
We asked to visit these places and although it took a lot of phone calls and manoeuvring we did manage to see them. Off camera we met some incredibly welcoming, hospitable and engaging individuals, people who just didn't want to get things wrong on it.
But I don't think I've ever been anywhere where I've asked so many questions, but received so few answers.
Forty eight hours after landing, we were back at the airport to return home via Istanbul -- armed with some exclusive footage of a country that seems to be taking some steps to open up.
But will we be heading back with a host of colleagues as Turkmenistan plays host to an Olympics? That prospect might be some way off.

New Horizons launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on January 19, 2006, beginning a 3 billion-mile journey to Pluto. The probe, about the size of a piano, weighed nearly 1,054 pounds at launch. It has seven instruments on board to take images and sample Pluto's atmosphere. After it completes its five-month study of Pluto, the spacecraft will keep going deeper into the Kuiper Belt.

Since Pluto was discovered in 1930, it has only been a speck of light in the best telescopes on Earth. That all changed in February 2010, when NASA released this photo. It was created by combining several images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope -- each only a few pixels wide -- through a technique called dithering. NASA says it took four years and 20 computers operating continuously to create the image.

No civilians or members of Afghan security forces were killed, authorities say
The Taliban say they targeted a hotel where "foreign invaders" were staying
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)
Four Taliban militants who launched an hourslong gun and grenade attack in an upscale district of central Kabul have been killed, Afghan authorities said Wednesday.
The sounds of explosions and gunfire echoed through the Afghan capital as fighting between the Taliban attackers and Afghan security forces raged, starting around 11 p.m. Tuesday and continuing into the early hours of Wednesday.
No civilians or members of the security forces were killed in the battle, Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi told CNN.
The Taliban said the target of the attack was a hotel owned by the son of Afghanistan's former President. The militants singled out the Heetal Plaza Hotel because "foreign invaders" were staying there, the Taliban said in a statement.
It's the latest in a long series of Taliban attacks targeting foreigners in Afghanistan.
Rocket launcher and other weapons seized
The hotel's manager said its defenses hadn't been breached. The Heetal Plaza is owned by the son of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
Afghan officials said security measures at the hotel and the security forces' response prevented the insurgents from harming anyone before they were killed.
Security forces seized a rocket launcher, three AK-47s and a grenade launcher from the attackers, Salangi said.
The Taliban have targeted hotels in Kabul previously.
Less than two weeks ago, a gun attack on the Park Palace Guest House killed 14 people, many of them foreigners. In March 2014, Taliban militants carried out a deadly assault on the luxury Serena Hotel.
CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.

(CNN)
An Air France passenger jet had a near miss with an active volcano in Africa earlier this month, according to French aviation authorities who are investigating the incident.
Air France Flight 953, a Boeing 777 with 37 people aboard, was on a short evening journey from Equatorial Guinea to Cameroon on May 2 when it steered off its planned route to avoid thunderstorms.
As the aircraft turned back toward its destination, the city of Douala in Cameroon, it got too close to Mount Cameroon, the highest mountain in the region whose volcano is still active, said the BEA, France's air accident investigation agency.
The "pull up" alarm started sounding and the pilots responded by ascending from 9,000 feet to 13,000 feet, the BEA said. The alarm stopped and the flight went on to land in Douala, it added.
In a list of open investigations, the agency described the close shave as "a serious incident" that involved "controlled flight into or toward terrain."
Passengers unaware of incident
Air France said Flight 953's pilots responded "immediately" to the alarm from the ground proximity warning system "by applying the appropriate procedure." It said its pilots "receive regular training in this type of maneuver."
An Air France official told CNN affiliate BFMTV that the passengers were unaware of the incident at the time.
The airline said in a statement that it is conducting its own internal investigation and has also given more information to the crew about "the specifics of the land around Douala."
The crew members are receiving educational, managerial and medical support, it added.
Flight 953 had departed from Malabo, which is the capital of Equatorial Guinea and is situated on Bioko Island, off the western coast of Africa.

Man, 41, reunites with his biological mother in Chile after four decades
His mother was told that her baby died shortly after birth, but he was instead adopted by U.S. couple
Chile has thousands of cases of illegal adoptions from the 1970s and 1980s under dictatorship
Santiago, Chile (CNN)
It was a hug kept on hold for more than 41 years. The hug of a mother and son whose lives were abruptly separated four decades ago.
Nelly Reyes had been waiting for hours in the international arrivals lounge at Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport in Santiago, holding a hand-made red poster board sign that said "Lovingly waiting for Travis, your mother Nelly and family." A granddaughter in her early 20s and a 10-year-old grandson keep her company.
On the other side of the terminal, going through immigration and customs, Travis Tolliver was anxious and nervous.  Up until the last minute, mainly because of a language barrier, he didn't know if anybody would show up to greet him.
When he finally came out of the terminal, no words were needed. They rushed to each other's arms and held on for a long hug. Few relatives knew the real story.
Tolliver had tears of joy. "I don't know how I feel. It's crazy! I never thought this could happen," he said.
Reyes, 61, could barely talk. "I'm going to hug him every day. I love him so much," she said.
The emotions released in that hug at the airport were the culmination of four decades of heartbreak, lies, deception, criminal acts and an injustice that separated mother and son at birth.
Stolen at birth
The newborn baby ended up living thousands of miles away, being raised in Tacoma, Washington, by a couple who had no knowledge of what had happened, while his biological mother cried and desperately tried to find her son.
Tolliver says he always knew he was adopted. What the 41-year-old supervisor at an imports distribution center didn't know was that he was stolen as a baby in his native Chile, only hours after his birth.
He hopes that knowing the truth about his past will now allow him to overcome a psychological trauma he has suffered for as long as he can remember. He says he has "abandonment issues."
"You know, I wasn't given up willingly like I thought for all these years, so that makes my heart feel wonderful; but it's just coming to terms with that. This whole thing still seems unreal to me," Tolliver said.
Reyes says she had a normal pregnancy with no medical issues. The mother of six children, including Tolliver, says she gave birth to a healthy baby boy at 4 p.m. on November 15, 1973. She was 19.
But her joy quickly turned to sadness when a nurse told the baby was born with a heart condition and was unlikely to survive.
"Hours later they told me he had died," Reyes said. Despite her multiple pleas, Reyes says she was never shown a body and was never given a death certificate.

Tolliver's case is not unique in Chile, according to Marcela Labraa, the director of the country's child protection agency (SENAME, by its Spanish acronym).
"This is no longer a myth. We know nowadays that this happened and it was real. It's not a tale that a couple of people were telling," Labraa said.
Her agency is currently investigating hundreds of cases, but Labraa says there could be thousands of cases of illegal adoptions from the 1970s and 1980s, when the country was ruled by a repressive dictatorship.
Tolliver and Reyes believe he was stolen. He is now working with authorities to find out what exactly happened to him.
In Chile they call them "Children of Silence."  Some babies were stolen and sold. Other newborns were given away by their grandparents who conspired with doctors, priests and nuns to hide a daughter's socially embarrassing pregnancy.
'Children of Silence' seek truth
Priest investigated
Prosecutor Mario Carroza investigated Gerardo Joannon, a priest accused of acting as a secret liaison between well-to-do families in Chile and adoptive parents as a part of a scheme also involving doctors, nurses and nuns in the 1970s.
Carroza says the priest, who belongs to the Sacred Hearts congregation, was investigated for the crimes of theft of minors, falsification of documents, and usurpation of identity.
To the dismay of those seeking answers, Carroza determined that even though Joannon might have committed those crimes, it was so long ago that he couldn't be prosecuted.
"In this case we're talking about a period between 15 and 20 years ago, which means the statute of limitations has run out," Carroza said.
The congregation to which Father Joannon belongs also conducted an internal investigation last year into the allegations and sent its findings to the Vatican. The Holy See later determined that even though the priest had made ethical and moral mistakes, none of his actions had risen to the level of a violation of canon law.
In his only on-camera interview in April 2014 with Chile's Channel 13, Joannon denied all the accusations, including telling women their children had died in order to give the babies to other couples.
"I never told anybody the babies had died because I didn't even know if they had been born, or if they were male or female," he said on Channel 13. "I never knew anything."
Still
In Tolliver's case, it's not clear who took him from his mother or whether there was any money involved.
Tolliver says his U.S. adoptive parents never knew he had been stolen. They were told he was an abandoned baby.
Tolliver also says he tried to find his biological parents when he was in his 20s but didn't have the connections to make it happen.
It was not until last year, he says, that he determined he needed to find the truth about his past not only for himself, but also for his two children. He says the decision was, in part, motivated by seeing several news stories about stolen children in Chile, including CNN's "Children of Silence."
The news that he was matched to his biological mother through DNA testing has been difficult to digest, Tolliver says, especially for his adoptive mother.
"But she's always going to be my mom --  it's just that I have two now -- she raised me. I am who I am because of what she did for me. She's always going to have a place in my heart and it's not like I'm replacing her or anything like that," Tolliver said.
Reuniting with siblings
Since reuniting with his biological mother, Tolliver has been busy meeting four brothers and one sister and seeing the sights of the country.
"Now I'm back here in my homeland I guess. I'm going to explore and see what the country is all about," he said.
One of his stops was the site where the hospital where he was born once stood. The Enrique Deformes Hospital in the coastal city of Valparaso has since been demolished and Chile's main congressional building now sits in its place.
As to why he would travel such great distance from his home in Yelm, Washington, and spend so much money -- some of it raised through a GoFundMe appea l -- to find the truth about his past, Tolliver is unequivocal. "To become whole," he says choking up and fighting back tears. "I've always felt incomplete, always kind of the outsider. My adoptive parents have blonde hair blue eyes. I just kind of stood out like a sore thumb."
Reyes, his biological mother, has been cooking for him daily and going out of her way to make him feel welcome.  He doesn't speak Spanish and she doesn't speak English.
But more than anything, she's been showing him her love, giving her son the hugs and kisses that she was unable to give him all of the years gone by.

A botanist and historian believes he's discovered picture of Shakespeare
Only two verified likenesses are thought to exist
(CNN)
Is this the Bard I see before me?
That's what botanist and historian Mark Griffiths believes. He says that a drawing of a man on the cover of a 1598 book about plants is a picture of William Shakespeare.
If Griffiths' theory holds up, it would be a major find -- and it's being trumpeted as such by the UK magazine Country Life, which is revealing the discovery in its new issue .
It's "the literary discovery of the century," Country Life editor Mark Hedges told the UK Guardian. "This is the only known verifiable portrait of the world's greatest writer made in his lifetime. It is an absolutely extraordinary discovery; until today, no one knew what William Shakespeare looked like in his lifetime."
There are only two verified likenesses of Shakespeare known today, both from after his death in 1616. One is the famed one of a balding man in a wide collar, taken from the First Folio , published in 1623. The other is a memorial at a church in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon.
If the man on the book, "The Herball," is Shakespeare, he would have been in his early 30s and would have already written a number of the plays based on English kings, including "Richard III" and both parts of "Henry IV." Still in his future were "Hamlet," "Othello," "King Lear" and "Macbeth," all of which probably date from the early 1600s.
To determine that the picture is Shakespeare, Griffiths had to unlock some elaborate Elizabethan codes, he told the Guardian. There are four men pictured on "The Herball," and he figured who three of them were relatively easily: the book's author, John Gerard, the subject of some Griffiths research; botanist Rembert Dodoens; and royal minister William Cecil, Lord Burghley.
But the fourth took some doing.
"He's dressed as a Roman, wearing laurels and meant to make us think of Apollo and poetry. ... I couldn't think of anybody really who was a direct intimate of Gerard's and was involved in writing his book," he told the Guardian.
Through a variety of clues, including an arrowhead, a peculiar flower and a W, Griffiths deduced that the man was Shakespeare.
Hedges believes the theory is correct. "The more you find out about the story, the more it glues together," he said in a Country Life video.
But not to a number of experts.
"There's no evidence that anybody thought that this was Shakespeare at the time," professor Michael Dobson, director of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC .
And in a Guardian essay , art critic Jonathan Jones compared the theory to something Dan Brown would have come up with: "fanciful tosh."
"There is no 'proof' at all here that the moustachioed man in the engraving is Shakespeare," he wrote. "His complex strings of argument are massive acts of overinterpretation."
Griffiths, though, is convinced.
"It is not an assumption that he is Shakespeare, it is algebra. ... It is an equation," he said.
Interpretation, then, may be in the eye of the beholder.
Or as Shakespeare wrote in "Antony and Cleopatra," "In nature's infinite book of secrecy / A little I can read."

Rohingya migrant boat missing in the Andaman Sea 02:32
In the Andaman Sea, aboard a fishing vessel searching Thai waters for vessels carrying refugees, a CNN crew saw several Thai navy vessels on patrol.
Kraiwut Chusakul, a local fisherman, said he's seen one of the many boats filled with Rohingya refugees. "There are so many children on the boat," he said. "I think there must have been around 100 small children."
The boat Kraiwut saw hasn't been seen since, and despite searching and asking other fishing boats if any refugee ships had been spotted, the CNN crew also turned up a blank.
"I feel so sorry for them," Kraiwut said. "It's so different to when you see these refugees on land, and the conditions are so terrible."
Late last week, residents on Koh Lipe Island in southern Thailand could be seen collecting food, water and clothes to take to the migrants on board the boats, but since then the military has told them not to take supplies out to the boats, or to talk to journalists about the situation.
Fortify told CNN that patrol ships stay ahead of those searching for these ships, chasing them out of territorial waters, so journalists and rights groups cannot get a clear understanding of the situation.
The country will host trilateral talks between the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand this week in an attempt to resolve the current impasse, and will again host a larger meeting of ASEAN nations on May 29.
Indonesia
Indonesian military spokesman Fuad Basya told CNN on May 18: "We have four navy vessels guarding our territorial waters in Aceh now. The policy remains -- we won't let any illegal migrants in."
Its foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, will attend meetings in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday in an attempt to find a solution to the growing humanitarian crisis.
However, she told reporters Tuesday that Indonesia has "given more than it should" to help those stranded at sea.
The UNHCR reports that, in the last week, Indonesian fishermen have rescued more than 1,300 Bangladeshis and Rohingya, whose vessels had entered Indonesian territorial waters after they drifted or swam to shore in Aceh and North Sumatran provinces.
The chief of the Aceh Search and Rescue Agency (SAR), Budiawan tells CNN approximately 100 migrants were rescued Wednesday by fishermen and the SAR.
However, Indonesian fishermen were being discouraged from actively searching for and rescuing stranded refugees.
"If they encounter any boats then of course they can rescue and tow them in, for humanitarian reasons. But their job is to catch fish and they shouldn't be going out to search for these boats," Basya said.
The Philippines
Despite being geographically distant from the epicenter of this growing humanitarian crisis, the Philippines has offered to allow the migrant boats landing rights.
The government quickly reacted to a report in local press saying that it would "push back to sea" any refugees that tried to land on Filipino soil.
Herminio Coloma Jr., a spokesperson for the country's Presidential Communications Operations Office said in a statement May 18 that the Philippines has extended humanitarian assistance for "boat people" in the past, citing its establishment of a processing center for Vietnamese migrants in the 1970s.
Citing the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, or which the Philippines is a signatory, Coloma said: "We shall continue to do our share in saving lives under existing and long-standing mechanisms pursuant to our commitments under the Convention."

The Rohingya are a persecuted Muslim minority who are effectively stateless in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are forced to live in crowded camps -- which they are generally forbidden to leave --  and are considered to be interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, despite the fact that many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

More than 1,600 migrants -- both Rohingya and economic migrants from Bangladesh -- have landed in Malaysia and Indonesia since Sunday, May 10, officials say, after Thai officials began cracking down on human trafficking camps operating in the country's south near the Malaysian border, disrupting established people-smuggling networks.

Rohingya migrants swim to collect food supplies dropped by a Thai army helicopter after they jumped from the boar adrift in Thai waters on May 14.  With the Thai pipeline for illegal migrants closed, overcrowded traffickers' boats have begun offloading their human cargo on the shores of Malaysia and Indonesia -- Muslim-majority countries that have shown sympathy to the Rohingya in the past. Alternatively, crews have simply abandoned them to drift.

Ronan Yver took fun photos of farm animals, getting to know their personalities
"I am also telling a story about human beings," Yver said. "I wanted to create caricatures"
(CNN)
You can tell a lot about a person from their expressions. Perplexed eyebrows, pursed lips.
Animals are no different.
From raised noses to lowered heads, outward displays of emotion are not exclusive to humans. But perhaps that isn't the message inked in these portraits taken by Ronan Yver .
Farm animals have their own stories. Their lives consist of more than rolling in the mud and grazing the fields. The perception of farm life cannot be taken at face value. You have to dig deeper for the truth under the skin.
But it's a story they cannot share -- at least not verbally. So Yver decided to document it for them through two lenses: his Canon camera and his literary prowess.
Photographer Ronan Yver
"I shot animals, but I am also telling a story about human beings," Yver said. "I wanted to create caricatures."
As a primary school teacher in Brent, France, he sees the world through tales of personification, from the legendary "Little Red Riding Hood" to the modern "Puss in Boots."
In French poetry, Jean de La Fontaine is well known for his fables that criticized Louis XIV during the 17th century. Fontaine replaced humans with animals: Louis XIV was a lion, aristocracy became wolves or foxes, and the weak were portrayed as lambs.
And thus, Yver's series "Animal Moods" was born out of a respect for allegoric storytelling, a passion for photography and a heavy dose of Animalia.

Yver spent several years with farm animals, getting to know their personalities through his wide-angle lens. Seeing the humanity in their eyes, he began to create a catalog of common feelings and moods and character traits, labeling the photos with captions such as "pride" or "elegance" or "innocence."
"We love our pets, but what about these (animals)?" Yver said. "We feed them and we eat them. But we can also take photographs and tell a story."
And telling that story was not always so easy.
"It's so difficult to take photographs of animals," he said. "I'm so close to them I can't hide! ... Sometimes they want to fight!"

In 2010, photographer Vlad Sokhin gained rare access to the rituals and practices of the Nyau brotherhood, a secret society of the Chewa people that exists in communities in Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. He reveals how he managed to infiltrate, and ultimately join, this secret group. Photographs by Vlad Sokhin.

Vlad Sokhin: "From 2010-2011, I lived in Mozambique's Tete province, where I was doing different jobs. One of them was for a coal exploration company. One day they asked me to photograph the opening ceremony for a new camp. While I was waiting for the ceremony to start, I saw someone pop out of the bush wearing feathers and a mask. Locals started screaming, 'Nyau,' and started to run."

"I had no idea what Nyau was, so I started to do some research," said Sokhin.
"I learned it was a secret society within the Chewa culture. Chewa people live in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. I found out that many locals, and even policemen, were afraid of the Nyau and considered them dangerous. One type of Nyau, known as Nyau 'kampini,' or 'dangerous Nyau,' (pictured) walk around with machetes and have a reputation for attacking people."

"The performance I witnessed was the Gule Wamkulu, a secret cult and ritual practiced by the Nyau brotherhood during the harvest, as well as important ceremonies, like weddings and funerals. Gule Wamkulu means 'The Great Dance' in the Chewa language. It is performed by the Nyau, who wear masks and costumes that represent the spirits of animals, called 'nyama,' and of their ancestors, called 'mizimu.' The ritual has had UNESCO protection since 2005, when it was included as one of 90 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity."

"After my first encounter with the Nyau, I spent a year in Mozambique looking for more dances, and trying to find members, so I could photograph them. This proved difficult, since everything about the Nyau is kept secret. If you're part of the Nyau cult, you're not supposed to tell anyone."

"Nyau keep both their rituals and their identity a closely-guarded secret. I later learned that during a ritual, the dancers will rotate so no one can tell their identity.
"If you see a whole family watching a dance, maybe the husband will leave for a bit then go to a secret place to change and dance, then come back so his mother, sister or wife won't know he's a member. If one dancer falls down and injures himself and starts limping, all members of the Nyau will start limping so no one can identify the injured dancer. "

"One day I met a teacher from Zimbabwe named Ofis, who started to ask me why I was so interested in the Nyau. We ultimately became friends, and he confessed that he was a member. I started to learn about the cult from him, but he said if I wanted to know more, I'd have to join."

"Ofis talked to the chiefs, and they agreed I could be a spectator at first, but nothing more. I started to go every week and take pictures of the dances, but I wanted to see more. I wanted to go inside and see how they made their masks.
"First, I had to be accepted as a member of the Nyau. One day, they said they were willing to accept me, but I would have to go through a ceremony."

"Afterward, I had to kill a chicken with the other new members, so we could take the feathers and add them to our costumes later. Later, I was brought to a nearby village, where I was covered in a fabric and flowers, and the Nyau came out, already in costume."

6,400 employees at a Chinese company were sent to France for a company paid trip
The staff also broke a Guinness World Record for building the largest human sentence in Nice
(CNN)
More than 6,000 employees of Tiens Group -- a Chinese conglomerate -- were given the VIP treatment on an all expenses paid trip to France to celebrate the company's 20th birthday.
The tour group -- the largest to visit the country -- was given a private tour of the Louvre museum and a private shopping session  at luxury department store Galeries Lafayette during their four-day trip, reported French news agency Agence France-Presse.
After two days in Paris, the group headed down to the southern resort town of Nice on Friday, where they also broke a Guinness World Record for forming the largest human sentence.
All staff members lined up on the waterfront, Promenade des Anglais, to spell out the phrase "Tiens' dream is nice in the Cte d'Azur" that was visible from above.
The Chinese company broke a Guinness World Record for building the largest human sentence in Nice, France.
According to local media, the company booked 4,760 rooms in 79 hotels between Cannes and Monaco, and 146 tour buses.
"We have mobilized public services as well as tourism professionals, hotels, restaurants, shops and designer brands," Christian Mantel, head of the French tourism development agency told AFP.
It's estimated that the group will spend $15 million during their visit added Mantel, and France is seen to reap up to $20 million in total economic benefits.
Chinese tourists, who are known to be the world's biggest holiday spenders, are said to spend an average of $7,200 when they go overseas.
It's not the first time a Chinese company has arranged for massive tours overseas. Last year, a group of 7,000 made a trip to the U.S. to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties.
Tiens Group operates in a diverse range of business interests, including biotechnology, tourism and trade.

About 12,000 Mormons practice their faith in Cambodia
Mormons believe that families can be eternally connected through the practice of posthumous baptism
Cambodia's history of civil war and genocide make tracing family genealogy challenging
Matthew D. LaPlante is an assistant professor of journalism at Utah State University.
(Special to CNN)
When Eng Bunhuoch joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the late 1990s, there were just a handful of families practicing Mormonism in Cambodia.
Today, the Salt Lake City-based church claims more than 12,000 parishioners in this predominantly Buddhist nation.
That growth has come with a challenge for church leaders, who are now working to encourage fellow converts to engage in what Mormons consider a sacred duty: digging into family history for a Mormon ritual intended to give the dead an opportunity for a better afterlife.

But in a nation cursed by decades of civil war and one of the worst genocides in history -- a place where dredging up the past can be a tremendously painful experience -- that hasn't been an easy sell.
"Most people," said Eng, now the lay leader of a Mormon church in Phnom Penh, "prefer not to do it."
The Mormon preoccupation with family history research is connected to a belief that families can be eternally connected through the practice of posthumous baptism. The rite has stirred controversy in the past: The church has apologized on several occasions in which it was revealed that members performed such proxy baptisms for Jewish victims of the Nazi regime. Mormons now are instructed to only submit for baptism the names of those who are in their own family lineage.
Sophat Yin, who grew up in the western Cambodian city of Battambang during the Khmer Rouge regime and is now an organizer at the Cambodian Buddhist Society in Fresno, California, is troubled by the proxy baptisms for many of the same reasons Jewish survivors of the Holocaust were. Most of the estimated 1.8 million people killed during the Khmer Rouge's brutal four-year rule in the 1970s were Buddhist. And Buddhist leaders, he said, weren't consulted about the practice. It was just assumed, he noted, that they'd be fine with the same rules as were settled upon with leaders of other religions.
"We Buddhists believe in afterlife, reincarnation and karma," he said. "If I were to die during the Khmer Rouge time, I would ask Mormons to leave me alone."
Still, he said, since he doesn't believe the practice holds any spiritual weight on the souls of the dead, he is trying to not feel offended and trying to look at it as a harmless offered blessing.
In Cambodia, Mormon believers' efforts to baptize family members -- including some of those slaughtered during the Khmer Rouge rule -- have also thus far met with little public backlash. But that might be because, at least for the moment, the work is quite limited.
Samnang Kang, who was recently appointed to work as a family history consultant for church members in Phnom Penh, said last's year's goal was to submit 1,600 names to LDS temple workers in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Parishioners could only manage 1,322.
This year, she said, "we haven't set a goal."
A big part of the challenge is a lack of records. The Khmer Rouge, which occupied the nation from 1975 to 1979, is thought to have destroyed about half of all government records -- the kinds of documents frequently used by Mormons in other nations and which are provided even to non-believers through the church's FamilySearch.org service.
Many more documents weren't specifically targeted for destruction, but were left unprotected during the regime and either looted or ruined by nature, said Khamboly Dy, a staff member at the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has worked since 1995 to recover and restore the record of the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign.

"It is important to us to collect all the remaining documents and conduct interviews to reconstruct the record," he said.
To that end, the center has recorded conversations with more than 6,000 people -- a tiny fraction of the millions of individuals who survived the regime. But those oral histories are driven by an open-ended questionnaire and don't necessarily include genealogical information that would be helpful to those trying to trace their ancestry.
The center does have what might amount to a treasure trove of information for family history sleuths: As militaries are wont to do, the Khmer Rouge created detailed personnel records for many in its cadres. Center staffers said those records often do include information about soldiers' parents and other family members.
While Cambodian society generally treats Khmer Rouge foot soldiers as victims of the regime, that tolerance is at least partially contingent on a general disinclination to re-examine the past, as opening military personnel files might do. Equally if not more potentially painful: In studying the center's documents, family history searchers might happen upon the name of an ancestor only because another family member gave up that person's name under interrogation or torture.
Local Mormon leaders said they haven't yet asked to look into the documentation center's vaults, though the center's director, Youk Chhang, said he would welcome their queries. He noted that religion, in general, "was the enemy of the Khmer Rouge revolution" and that any avenue "for healing, forgiveness, and moving on" is worth exploring in a nation in which victims and perpetrators of atrocities still live, work and worship side by side.
The center's records potentially could help equalize family history resources in Southeast Asia. The LDS church has managed to acquire an extensive collection of government records from other countries across the region and has published those records on its family history website. However, the site has no historical records from Cambodia.
Paul Nauta, a public relations specialist for the LDS Church who specializes in family history, said even without records "the average person can usually remember three generations back. If you are fortunate to have a parent or grandparent still living, that affords the individual to trace their family history back up to six generations."
But Nauta said only a small set of patrons in Cambodia have listed more than four generations.
Including herself and her children, that's all Vanna Kim has been able to produce. And even at that, she said, "I had to pray for a miracle" that her Buddhist aunt and uncle would help her identify the names of her grandparents.
She's glad to have done her part to build the record base, but genealogy isn't for her. "It was an obligation," she said.
Khoem Samphon, whose written family tree is also only four generations deep, said it isn't just the governmental records that were lost in the Khmer Rouge years. The types of keepsakes many people use to trace back their lineage were often lost, too.
He was 27 years old when the Khmer Rouge swept into Phnom Penh and forced the relocation of millions of people across the country.
"We didn't bring any records with us," he said. "At that time, records were not important. Food was important."
Some of what was left behind -- family photographs, for instance -- are now sold, apparently for souvenirs, at ephemera shops catering to foreign tourists. Some of the pictures have names penciled on the back, but few have any more context than that.
Even if they did, it might not be helpful. Cambodians cycle through family names every few generations, and a lot of people changed their names when the Khmer Rouge came to power to hide familial affiliations.
"Because we were a political family, we did not want anyone to know where we came from," said Sok Mony, whose family didn't reclaim its name until long after the Khmer Rouge had left power.
For a time, during those years, she went by the name Eang Bunna.
"My family kept hiding until 1991," she said, "but my mother wouldn't open up about the past for many years after that."
Cambodians are rightfully proud of their distant past, said physician Lim Keuky, who lives and works minutes away from Angkor Wat, a thousand-year-old temple that draws hundreds of thousands of tourists to Cambodia each year and whose iconic towers appear on everything from the nation's favorite beer to its red, white and blue flag. But, he said, fellow Cambodians -- about 60% of whom are under the age of 30 -- generally prefer to ignore the much more recent past.
"That is why, if you go to someone who is 18 years old and talk about how genocidal the Khmer Rouge was, she would say, 'It's not possible -- you must be lying,' because the parents who lived at that time they don't want to remember," he said. "In trying to forget, then the same thing can come again."
But Lim, the president of the Cambodian Diabetes Association, noted that family history is also important for helping identify those most at risk for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. And increasingly, he added, researchers are demonstrating such conditions may be worse among those whose ancestors suffered traumatic stress, as so many Cambodians have.
"I want to say it strongly -- I cannot say it strongly enough -- that Cambodians must work to remember the past," Lim said.
Eng, who last year was appointed as a stake president to lead a new church by his home, said he also is hopeful his fellow Cambodians will wake up to the importance of learning about their family history, and not just for the purposes of Mormon rituals.
Logging into a computer at the church, he called up his family history profile on the genealogy website. Soon he was face to face with a black and white photograph of his father.
"You see," he laughed, "he is handsome like me."
Eng understands why Cambodians are hesitant to dig into their family roots; he was a member of the LDS church for more than a decade before he began to do so.
But now, Eng said, he'd like everyone to have the same experience he had once he began looking for long-lost relatives.
"When I would work on finding relatives," he said, "I pulled out my dad's picture and it felt like he was close to me again."

CNN's Moni Basu reported this story last week from the region where the epicenter of Tuesday's earthquake was located.
Lukla, Nepal (CNN)
The Goma Air flight makes a swift turn over jagged white peaks and lush Himalayan farmlands before a herky-jerky landing in what's been called the world's most dangerous airport.
Phurba Sherpa hurtles off the prop plane that on this day has carried four adults, two children and 16 gray bags that each weigh 53 pounds. Inside are industrial-strength, family-size tents donated by the German Red Cross.
In the aftermath of the enormous earthquake that shook Nepal, Phurba, a 49-year-old Kathmandu entrepreneur, has made it his business to get relief to his people. By that he means the Sherpas, the ethnic minorities who inhabit the towns and villages in the shadow of Mount Everest and are known worldwide as expert climbers.
The Sherpas prop up Nepal's lucrative trekking and tourism business, but the government, Phurba says, has never looked out for them. Isolated in remote mountainous villages, they have been a forgotten people in Nepal and now, after the earthquake, they fear being forgotten again.
For Phurba, the journey from the Kathmandu Valley up to the soaring peaks is not just a humanitarian mission to help thousands of people living in quake-affected villages.
It's personal.
"It is my duty," he says of the responsibility he feels to give back to the majestic land and people who shaped him as a man.
Phurba has no time to lose.
Namche Bazaar is usually bustling at this time of year in Nepal with mountaineers on their way to Everest Base Camp. Now, the town is dotted with tents filled with displaced people.
Few others are here to help. There's no Nepalese government presence. Nor do I see any of the hordes of international aid workers and members of the media who descended on Kathmandu within days of the earthquake.
Granted, the villages and towns that dot the hills and mountains under Everest are not as badly affected as other areas closer to the earthquake's epicenter. People here are not lacking for food and water at the moment. This is a region in eastern Nepal where the tourism industry has helped people fare better moneywise.
But Nepal is not just a poor nation; it is one of the poorest. And now, the tourist season has abruptly ended for two years in a row. Last year, a giant block of ice broke free and crashed down into the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp, killing 16 Sherpas.
The people here worry if they will ever be able to recover from tragedy. They wonder if tourists and trekkers will even consider returning to a place of such risk and sorrow.
Their villages are also places that can be extremely difficult to access -- there are no roads and the only way to travel is on foot. Some say it's hard to get aid delivered. But Phurba says there are ways -- donkeys are a popular means of transporting goods.
"If we wait for the government, it will take a lot of time," he says, blaming red tape and a lack of will.
I watch him make arrangements in his orange puffy down jacket, standing against the Himalayan vistas that tourists pay a lot of money to experience. I see a man who is determined amid a crisis of gigantic proportions.
I'd met Phurba in Kathmandu a few days earlier when I wrote about American mountaineer and filmmaker Tom Taplin , one of 19 known to have died on Everest. Phurba, who owns his own Himalayan tourism compan y, helped make all the arrangements for Taplin's body to be brought back down the mountain.
Phurba lamented to me then about the plight of his people. The attention, he said, has been cast on foreigners who were killed, injured or trapped, but not the Sherpas without whom Nepal's bustling trekking industry would not be possible. He told me a young man from his village was killed at the base camp and that the family is in mourning.
I asked if I could accompany him on his whirlwind trip to Solukumbhu District, thousands of feet above sea level. Two days later, I find myself racing to keep up with him.
Phurba Sherpa, center, discusses the earthquake's toll with Bal Bahadur KC, left, a  member of Nepal's Parliament who represents the district in which most of the affected Sherpa villages fall.
'Please help us'
At the Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla, the town where thousands of trekkers fly in to begin their journeys toward the skies, Phurba oversees the unloading of the Red Cross tents. Then he hops into a Fishtail helicopter that whisks him away to Phakding, where the lawmaker who represents this district is waiting.
Phurba invited Bal Bahadur KC on this assessment tour because he wanted someone from the government to see the earthquake's devastation in this part of country. Maybe then, Phurba thought, someone in Kathmandu would pay attention to the needs of his people.
We land in Phakding and find Bal Bahadur with his right arm in a sling. He has trouble getting onto the chopper. I ask him if he was injured in the earthquake. "No," he laughs. "I hurt it before then. But now I know what it feels like to have a broken arm."
The helicopter has no seats -- they were taken out to bring down the bodies of the dead from Everest Base Camp.
Pilot Mauritzio Folini tells me he used to love flying here -- joy rides in the sky in a place that arguably has the most fantastic views on Earth. The Nepalese name for Everest is Sagarmatha. Sagar means sky in Nepalese and matha, head. I am in a land that touches the heavens. From the helicopter, it's plain to see why that name is appropriate.

Only now, after the earthquake, this land is dotted with pockets of hell.
In the last few days, maneuvering the light helicopter around the peaks and through deep canyons has turned into a gruesome chore as Folini has made countless rescue flights up and down to Everest Base Camp.
"I am a climber myself. I love my job," Folini says. "But now ... it's a tragedy."
We land at a gravel heliport in front of the police station in Khunde, 13,000 feet above sea level, and walk down narrow dirt lanes that snake around clusters of stone, cement and wooden houses.
The landscape has a recent addition: hundreds of colorful tents made by North Face, Marmot and Mountain Hardwear. Households in Khunde and other Sherpa villages have at least one person employed in the tourism industry and many own high-end outdoor gear given to them by foreigners or knockoffs sold in the local markets.
Phurba surveys the destruction, writes down names and the amount of loss. Some houses have been flattened; others are severely damaged. Few have escaped unscathed.
This is where his wife grew up. It's shocking for Phurba to witness the devastation.
"How are you doing?" he asks everyone he sees.
The answer is like a song's refrain that he hears over and over.
"I was at the Saturday market and that is why I am alive," says Da Tsering Sherpa, 40. "But my house is destroyed."
"I have lost everything," says Pasang Lamu, 55, breaking down. "Please help us."
Phurba finds his wife's relatives. They are camping out in a tiny tent; their broken houses still stand as constant reminders of their suffering. Phurba has stayed in those houses so many times, shared meals there with loved ones.
"All gone," Phurba says to me. "This will all have to be rebuilt."
I can tell Phurba is making a heroic effort not to betray his emotions at this moment.
"We are the lucky ones," he says. "We are alive. There is no time to be sad. We have lots of work to do."
We trek through several villages, up and down dirt paths laden with rocks.
The same scenes of despair -- and frustration -- play out everywhere. Foundations shaken to the core, roads blocked off by falling rocks and with the upcoming monsoons, the threat of massive landslides along the fresh cracks in the earth.
In nearby Khumjung, Bal Bahadur doles out $400 -- a token amount -- to people who lost loved ones. That's what the government gave as compensation to the families of the 16 Sherpas who died on Everest last year. They saw the meager sum as derisory, government indifference to the Sherpas and the dangerous jobs they perform.
Those who lost their houses receive $100 on this afternoon. In this area alone, 164 houses are documented as gone. Bal Bahadur tries to assure residents that help is on the way.
"I will not forget you," he tells the people.
But few believe the government's intentions are true.
"We are citizens of Nepal," says Phurba's friend, Chungbu Sherpa. "And that is all. Beyond that there is no relationship. We have to take it upon ourselves to help each other."
Schoolteacher Chhunjing Dorjee Sherpa, 50, listens to what Bal Bahadur has to say but has little faith that the lawmaker will come through.
"Do you feel that aid is coming?" I ask.
"This is the Nepal government," he says. Maybe he will rely instead on a grant from a nonprofit or perhaps a bank will issue him a low-interest loan.
A woman who runs a small restaurant has few customers. Sherpas who serve the tourist community are hurting after two failed Everest climbing seasons.
Near Phakding, we see a centuries-old teaching monastery that barely withstood the earthquake. The 28 Buddhist monks and 18 students who live here are busy putting up wood supports to mitigate the risks of everything crashing down.
Phurba has made it a priority to generate money to get the monastery repaired. It's his history. His culture. It's like seeing the fallen temples and palaces in Kathmandu's UNESCO World Heritage site, national treasures that will never be the same.
He stays behind to discuss reparations. Nawang Nuru Sherpa, 38, works as a guide for Phurba and accompanies me to Phakding. On the way we stop to survey Nawang's property.
He gazes at the fertile farmlands. The fields are a vibrant green with new wheat; potatoes abound in the soil the color of charcoal. Beyond that, he sees his home, still standing but precariously.
He pitched a tent for himself, his wife, 9-year-old son and infant daughter. He saved as many things as he could from the house and arranged them in the tent as though it were home.
But it isn't.
"I am afraid no tourists will come here anymore," Nawang says. "Then how will I get money to rebuild my house?"
It is something that preoccupies Phurba.
He had planned to let me stay at a lodge he built a few years ago. But we arrive instead to heavy damage to all 20 rooms and 22 bathrooms. Boulders lie in front of a fireplace on the second-floor landing as though they, like an evil Santa Claus, hurtled down the chimney.
It took Phurba five years to build this lodge; nature took a few seconds to destroy it. He suspects he will have to demolish and rebuild by mid-September when the monsoons have ended and the fall Himalayan season begins. He estimates it will easily cost $300,000 to make the necessary fixes.
I tell him I am sorry for his losses and that even amid the destruction, it's hard not to be overcome by the beauty of this land.
"Bahut sundar hai," I say in Hindi to some of Phurba's employees. "It's very beautiful here."
One replies. "Bauhut sundar tha."
"It was very beautiful."
Helicopters usually ferry climbers to Everest Base Camp. This year, they have been carrying those who died or were injured in the quake back to lower ground.
A day of suffering
Seeing his wife's village in ruins was hard enough, but Phurba's heart shattered when he learned of the earthquake's wrath on Chaurikharka, the village he calls home. He dreaded seeing it. On the second day of our trek, he tells me to go ahead to Chaurikharka. He will follow later.
It takes six hours to reach the village. There is no doubting nature's wrath here.
Sheets of corrugated metal that flew off roofs and sides of houses obstruct the main dirt path. Chunks of stone and cement tumbled to the earth.
Nima Kiter, 74, rushes toward me waving his hands in the air.
"Everything gone," he says in broken English. "We would all be dead if this had happened at night."
Most of the residents of Chaurikharka know Phurba and are relieved that a native son has taken charge of rebuilding the village.
When Phurba was born 49 years ago, most Sherpas, including his father, either worked the land growing buckwheat and potatoes or they were traders selling goods from Tibet and India. But Phurba grew up as a new industry was blossoming: tourism.
Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary scaled to the summit of the world's tallest mountain in 1953, challenging climbers from all over the world to match their feat.
Many Sherpa men began charging foreigners money for acting as their guides, porters and support staff through this unforgiving terrain.
Purbha's father pushed him from an early age to get into the trekking business. But the headmaster at his school recalls how Purbha snuck away to study. He was determined to learn, leave the village and carve out a successful life for himself.
"My parents were disappointed in me," Phurba had told me when I first met him. "But I knew education was the key to seeing the world."
He saved the money from his occasional trekking jobs and left for Kathmandu. He paid for college tuition with his earnings from an aunt's tea shop and earned a degree in journalism and then a master's in sociology.
"There were no Sherpas in journalism then," he told me. "I wanted to make a difference."
But then Mount Everest became big business, and in 1992, Phurba launched his own firm: Himalayan Sherpa Adventure. With it has come success, a large house and a comfortable existence for Phurba and his family in one of the poorest nations on Earth. A huge number of Nepalese live on $15 a month, and poverty is worst in remote mountainous villages.
The Sherpa guides I speak with all tell me Mount Everest saved them, that the trekking business has been lucrative. But the work is seasonal and meant for the young and strong. And now, after the earthquake, the future looks grim.
In popular tourist spots like Lukla and Phakding, I see empty guesthouses. Lodge owners say that after the earth shook, everyone and everything went downhill.
The planes landing at Lukla airport are normally full of people this time of year. But these days, they land only with cargo. Rice, tents, medical supplies. The tourists who are still here are clamoring to go the other way.
Phurba knows the worst may still be on the horizon for his people whose livelihoods are dependent on trekkers. The end result of falling tourism will mean no jobs.
"And the people will suffer even more," he says.
On this day, the suffering is greatest at Dawa Chiri Sherpa's house.
The 27-year-old worked as an assistant for mountaineers attempting to reach the summit. He was at the base camp when a quake-triggered avalanche thundered down the mountain.
Inside the heavily damaged family home, everyone is still mourning. They invite me inside and for a moment I think about what might happen if the second floor came crashing down. I climb the creaky stairs and see a Buddhist monk. He is sitting by a window chanting prayers in front of 13 flickering oil lamps. Dawa's mother cannot stop her tears.
Dawa owned a yak and used to work as a porter, his brother Tenzing tells me. But that was a hard life, walking uphill with hundreds of pounds of gear and not making that much money.
So Dawa completed a mountaineering course and became a climbing Sherpa; some of them earn as much as $7,000 in the two-month Everest season. That's more than 10 times the average Nepalese wage.
Everyone knew it was tiring and extremely dangerous work, especially Dawa's wife, Phura Yangzi. She last spoke with her husband the day before the earthquake.
"Tomorrow is my rest day at base camp," he told her. That was the last time she heard from him.
It took the family two days to retrieve Dawa's body, even though he worked for a trekking company that had the resources to bring him down. Ultimately, it was Phurba's friend, Chungba Sherpa, who made the arrangements.
"My brother died, but no one helped us," Tenzing tells me over a traditional Sherpa meal of boiled potatoes and freshly ground chili sauce. "No one from the government or from his company has contacted us. No one has said sorry. Who will take care of his wife and baby?"
Phura Yangzi carries 18-month old Chiring Dolma on her back as she carries on with her chores. Sometimes, she thinks it's all a bad dream; that her husband is still on Everest. She got married two years ago and at age 22, she is a widow with a child.
She tells me she is worried for her daughter's future. How will she get an education without a father earning money? She says she will try her hand as a street vendor, selling sodas and mineral water to tourists.
"It will be difficult but I will try," she says. "I have to."
In this land of incredible beauty, nature exacted a heavy toll.
The eternal mountain
I ponder the tough lives of the Sherpas on the uphill trek back to Lukla. I only have a backpack -- a porter is carrying my heavier bag, just like they do for tourists. I have been walking all day and the last stretch seems the most strenuous.
On the way, I see a 63-year-old man carrying what he estimates to be 130 pounds of goods on his back. I am in awe of his strength and his ability to carry on without complaint.
In Lukla, I meet back up with Phurba, who has come from seeing his own village and is making arrangements to fix damaged structures and bring in more aid to his people.
"Base camp has become very big news, but you see how thousands of people have been affected," he says. "There are many places that are really poor, are really miserable. It is my job to support those in need."
"Wasn't it hard to see your wife's village, to see your own village lie in ruins?" I ask.
"Some people cry with their eyes," he says, "and others don't. But that doesn't mean I am not sad."
He says he has to worry about his people's livelihoods in the future.
During the recession, when his company felt the sting of fewer Americans spending money on global travel, his friends assured him.
"Don't worry," they said. "You will have no problem as long as you have Everest."
Phurba -- and his people -- are counting on that again.

FAA questioned mental health of Germanwings pilot

Germanwings pilot identified
Washington (CNN)
Years before Andreas Lubitz crashed a commercial airliner into the French Alps, the Federal Aviation Administration raised questions about his mental health, declining to give him a medical certificate.
The agency switched course about three weeks later in 2010 after a physician working with Lubitz said his treatment was complete.
That and other findings are revealed in documents obtained by CNN through a public records request that cover a time frame between April 2008 and July 2010 -- the period in which Lubitz was in Arizona training to be a pilot for Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Lubitz is accused of purposely slamming a Germanwings jetliner into the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. He suffered from bouts of depression and the incident sparked a global debate over how to properly monitor the mental health of pilots.

OPINION: Germanwings co-pilot -- an accident waiting to happen?
According to the documents, Lubitz suffered from "reactive depression," which the medical examiner said was caused by "modified living conditions" and "decompensation subsequent to excessive demands." Reactive depression can resolve itself when the individual recovers from an overwhelming event, according to Jacqueline Brunetti, who works as a medical examiner for commercial pilots.
From January through October 2009, Lubitz received psychotherapeutic treatment, which included two medications for depression -- Cipralexone and Mirtazapine, both anti-depressants.
"The use of 2 drugs would suggest that maybe a single drug was not sufficiently effective," said Burnetti, who did not treat Lubitz, but said pairing anti-depressants could indicate an inability to "cope with either day to day work and/or home demands.'"
It is not entirely clear when his depression began. But a document from April 2008 identifies Lubitz as medically fit to fly . Lufthansa CEO Carsten Sphor told reporters after the crash that Lubitz interrupted his training at some point in 2009. That break lasted several months. Medical documents do not reference that break or reveal why he took it.
But it is clear from the documents that once treatment for his reactive depression was complete in October 2009, Lubitz applied to have his medical certificate and student pilot certificate renewed.
Then, there is something of a mystery.
On a June 14, 2010 questionnaire for a medical and student pilot certificate, Lubitz checked "no" when asked whether he presently or in the past experienced "mental disorders of any sort; depression, anxiety, etc."
There is another copy of the same questionnaire with the same June 14, 2010 date. But on this form, Lubitz checked "yes." That second document indicated that the medical examiner modified the questionnaire to reflect Lubitz suffered from "reactive depression" from November 2008 through July 2009.
Contacted by CNN, the FAA couldn't definitively explain the existence of the two questionnaires.
Germanwings 'black box' shows co-pilot Andreas Lubitz sped up descent
"The questionnaire is done electronically," said Laura Brown, a spokesperson for the FAA. "In some cases an airman may fill out the first page of the questionnaire before visiting with the doctor and once the doctor's visit is complete the form is updated," she said.
She added that even after it's updated, the original form "still lives in the system."
When asked if they were aware of the existence of two conflicting medical documents, Germanwings Senior Vice President of Communications Joachim Shttes said "no" and that they were "unaware" if both of the documents were submitted to the airline.
"I want to point out that the (First Officer) had been medically cleared to fly and hold all the requisite licenses," he said.
Lubitz had not always been cleared to fly, however.
A July 8, 2010 letter from the FAA's  Aerospace Medical Certification Division informed Lubitz that after reviewing his medical examination results the FAA was "unable to establish your eligibility to hold an airman medical certificate" due to his history of "reactive depression."
Dr. Warren Silberman, who prepares FAA medical certifications, signed that letter and requested a detailed medical status report from Lubitz' prescribing physician detailing "when medication(s) were discontinued  and confirmation of no reoccurrence of the symptoms since discontinuing medication(s)."
In the letter, Silberman also requested "a diagnosis, prognosis with medication(s) and  follow-up plan" before consideration of reinstating Lubitz medical certificate and student pilot certificate.
The tortuous trail to 'Why?'
In order to fly again, Lubitz would need his physician to vouch that he had successfully been treated and was no longer suffering from reactive depression.
Lubitz' medical records show the medical specialist treating him wrote two letters saying Lubitz had successfully completed treatment. One was addressed to Lubitz and the other to an airline medical examiner, although the name of that person was redacted.
That letter to the airline official states "considerable remission has been obtained" and "medication has been tapered." It described Lubitz as being "without memory disorders and phobias" and "mentally stable."
After he was cleared by his psychotherapist, the FAA sent a new letter to Lubitz stating he was cleared to fly. That letter was also signed Silberman and it included that precautions must be taken in order for Lubitz to fly.
"You are cautioned to abide by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR's), Section 61.53, relating to physical deficiency. Because of your history of reactive depression, operation of aircraft is prohibited at any time new symptoms or adverse changes occur or any time medication and/or treatment is required," Silberman wrote.
But Silberman says this is nothing more than a self-monitoring system.
"You don't see the airman with the number of cases so you have to rely on how good the letter is," he said.
In other words, FAA certifiers don't see the actual airman. CNN was unable to reach Jrg Siedenburg, the aviation medical examiner listed in the documents as the physician Lubitz visited for clearance to fly.
But the decision to approve or deny a pilot who was once deemed ineligible to fly is based on doctors' letters, Silberman said. And in his opinion, the letter Lubitz' physician provided "was a very complete and legit letter."
Silberman added: I "had no reason to question its accuracy."

Jimmy Savile abused at least 22 pupils at a former girls' school, a Surrey police report says
Since Savile died in 2011, he has been exposed as a serial sex abuser and pedophile
The abuse at Duncroft school occurred during visits by the TV star in the 1970s, police say
London (CNN)
At least 22 pupils and a visitor at a former school for troubled girls in southeast England were sexually abused by the late British TV star Jimmy Savile in the 1970s, a report by Surrey police has concluded.
The report said that at least 46 offenses of abuse occurred, including one rape, at the Duncroft Approved School in Staines, a town to the west of London.
An initial police investigation into Savile's behavior at Duncroft, a school for socially vulnerable girls, began in 2007 and ended with Savile being interviewed under caution in 2009, when he denied the allegations of 14 pupils.
A second investigation, dubbed Operation Outreach, was launched in 2012 after a documentary by UK broadcaster ITV revealed that Savile -- once one of the most beloved people in Britain, a radio DJ and television star with big hair, a big cigar and an even bigger attitude -- was a serial sex abuser.
Since then Savile, who died in 2011 , has become one of the most reviled figures in the country as it becomes clear that he sexually abused untold numbers of people over decades.
The latest revelations about his abuses at Duncroft school come on the heels of other reports detailing assaults by Savile on children, hospital patients or those with mental health problems .
Operation Outreach found that Savile visited Duncroft at least 16 times between 1974 and 1979, and that he stayed overnight at the school on at least two occasions.
He was likely to have taken the pupils out unaccompanied by staff on several occasions and was given "significant" access to the school's grounds and buildings, which appears to have been unrestricted and largely unsupervised, the report said.
Pupils were abused in multiple locations throughout the school, including the principal's office, and in vehicles brought to the school by Savile, police found.
Of the 23 victims, "ten were abused on a single occasion by Savile," the report says, and "thirteen were abused on at least two occasions."
The four types of abuse listed in the report are rape, assault by penetration, causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and sexual assault.
The school was closed from late 1979 until 1982, and shut its doors for good in 1991.
As well as seeking to establish the scope of Savile's offenses at the school, Operation Outreach also looked at what was known by former members of staff there -- and whether any had committed offenses as a result.
Surrey police submitted a file last year to the Crown Prosecution Service on two of those former staff members, but the agency decided not to bring criminal charges on the grounds there was no realistic prospect of conviction.
In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Cundy said Surrey police "has always accepted there are things which should have been done differently" in the force's original 2007-2009 investigation.
But he added those inquiries "predated much of what we now know about Savile and his pattern of abuse."

Nineteen of the 43 eggs are completely intact, a museum official says
Hong Kong (CNN)
The Chinese city that boasts the largest number of dinosaur eggs in the world has added a new batch to its impressive collection.
Construction workers unearthed 43 fossilized dinosaur eggs during road repair work in Heyuan city in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong on Sunday, officials said.
The city, which calls itself the "Home of Dinosaurs," won a Guinness World Record for the world's largest collection of dinosaur eggs at its museum in 2004.
A crowd gathered around the site along a main road where the fossils were discovered in Heyuan city.
EXPAND IMAGE
Huang Zhiqing, deputy director of the Heyuan Museum, told CNN that it was the first time the fossils have been discovered in the bustling city center.
Major road repair work was halted as a team of researchers and construction workers jumped down into a ditch to dig out the fossils.
Eggs as wide as 5 inches
Nineteen of the eggs are completely intact, with the largest measuring as much as 13 centimeters (5 inches) in diameter, Huang said.
Researchers said they will continue to examine the fossils to determine which dinosaur species they belong to.
Most of the eggs in the museum's existing collection belong to oviraptorid and duck-billed dinosaurs, which roamed the earth 89 million years ago.
Nearly 17,000 dinosaur eggs have been uncovered in the city since the first group of fossils was found in 1996 by children playing at a construction site, the China's official news agency Xinhua reported.

        <MainBody>WHAT did they do this Shih Tzu?!
Sudan's female companions,  Fatu and Najin, live at the conservancy, where experts are scrambling to ensure the subspecies does not go extinct.
The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards. Rhinos are targeted by poachers, fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs.
In addition to round-the-clock security, the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching.
The conservancy is also raising funds to help equip and train rangers who guard the rhinos.
On the verge of extinction
At 42, Sudan is elderly in rhino years. Fatu, 15, is a spring chicken, while Najin is 25.
Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy, age might be a factor, says George Paul, the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy.
"Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female," he says.
Najin could conceive, but her hind legs are so weak, she may be unable to support a mounted male .
"There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years, but not conceptions," Paul says. "Based on  a recent health examination conducted, both animals have a regular estrus cycle, but no conception has been recorded."
And if one is not recorded soon, the beloved animal will go extinct.
Alternative methods to conceive
In a race against time, international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies.
The northern white rhino cannot mate with a black rhino, but there is a chance it could mate with a southern white rhino, Paul says. While southern white rhinos are not endangered --  Ol Pejeta has 19 -- they are a different subspecies  from the northern white rhino genetically. Though the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts say.
A committee at the conservancy is also looking at various alternative reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization.
"In other countries, success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species, thus that, as a technique, can be presupposed to be the most promising," Paul says. "However, consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward."
Countdown to extinction
The need to preserve the northern white rhino is dire.
"Realistically, we are looking at these animals dying in the next decade or so. But hopefully, using artificial methods of reproduction, we might be able to bring them back in the future," Paul says. "This might mean that it will happen when the current animals are already deceased, but it could happen."
The conservancy acquired the northern white rhinos --  two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Suni, the other male northern white rhino at the conservancy, died last year.
In another incident, another male, Angalifu, died at the San Diego Zoo last year, bringing the subspecies closer to extinction.
There are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild.
A total of five remain in captivity worldwide: three in Kenya,  and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic.
But Sudan, a male, is in a company of one.

The professor's statistics confirm what they have seen in the glaciers above their town and in the ice beneath their boots.
"When I came here as a boy, the (Bossons) was several hundred meters below," says Seb, was we dig our axes into the ice. "At the moment we can still enjoy it but in 40, 50 years what are going to say to our next generation? 'Oh, it was great! You should've been here.'"
Since the time when America was a newborn nation and the first men climbed Mont Blanc in woolens and top hats, the Bossons glacier we're climbing has retreated nearly a mile.
"Maybe one day there will be no glaciers and mountain guides will have to be biking guides," says Fleur, a Chamonix native and one of the most accomplished female alpinists in the world. "We are revolted."
Of course, providing thrills and business in the "death-sport capital of the world" is far from the most important role for glaciers like the Bossons.
The Wonder List with Bill Weir
This frozen playground is also the water tower of Europe, and glacier run-off provides drinking water for hundreds of millions around the world. Which is why the rate of "la grande fonte" is so alarming.
But not to guys like Yan Giezendanner.
"Everyone says 'global warming, global warming.'" he says. "But for me, I'm not so sure."
For over 30 years, Yan has been forecasting for France's national weather service in Chamonix and is convinced other glaciers around the world are growing, despite the science of those like Ohmura. He believes the fear is manufactured by politicians and the wind industry.
"That's their job to say these things," he shrugs.
I found plenty of similar conspiracy theories at the Heartland conference in Vegas, and had a few exchanges that frankly, you have to see to believe. But when I ask Ohmura about the allegations of hackery or corruption, he just sighs.
"Skeptics close their eyes while telling people to close their eyes from the reality. One must use simple thinking. Think. Open your eyes and think. It may sound a bit insulting, but there is no other suggestion I can use."
There will be plenty of frozen food for thought -- and plenty of gorgeous, high alpine adventure -- as " The Wonder List " hits the Alps. Come hang.

Protecting Chad's Elephants from poachers 02:05
"Formation! Prepare yourselves! Fire!" shouts Patrick Duboscq, a retired French police officer instructing the Zakouma rangers.
A handful of men throw themselves flat to the ground, aim, and fire their Glock pistols, hitting distant targets.  They jump up, run, and fire again from standing positions, repeating the drill with Kalashnikovs.
Duboscq, who is a volunteer, runs the Mamba team through its paces.  His passion for elephants, conservation and the park brings him back every year to keep Zakouma's troops sharp -- and the animals safe.
Duboscq leads the men through a rallying cry for Zakouma; the rest of the exercise is all business. They're capable of taking on armed poachers, handling sniper rifles, and engaging in a firefight.  They're trained in making arrests, judicial procedures and presenting evidence in court.
A deadly game
It's a sharp learning curve, but it's necessary to fight off the lethal threat poachers present.  Often organized criminal gangs, international trafficking mafias and terror groups are behind the poaching raids, providing skills and sophisticated arms to carry out the killing.
"Of course it's dangerous," says Mamba team member Ahmat Assilek.  "But we do it because it's our national patrimony ... that's why we're ready to die."
And these men have skin in the game.  Among the group training today, four lost fathers to poachers when a six-man Zakouma anti-poaching unit was gunned down outside the park in September 2012 during morning prayers.
The raid was a suspected retaliation killing for the capture of a group of poachers who had slaughtered six elephants the previous month north of the park. According to park staff, the raid on the poacher camp netted satellite phones, solar chargers, stamped Sudanese army leave slips and insignia, and 1,500 rounds of ammunition.
The poachers weren't minor league opportunists. They were well equipped to slaughter elephants for their ivory -- and to kill anyone trying to stop them.
23 Zakouma guards have died on the job since 1998.
New management
Park manager Rian Labuschagne understands the dangers confronting Zakouma and its staff. Along with his wife, Lorna Labuschagne, the conservationists were tasked with safeguarding the surviving elephant herds in 2010, when African Parks, a South Africa-based non-profit organization, took over the management of the embattled park following a decade-long elephant killing spree.
Before the Labuschagnes and African Parks took over the 3,000-plus-square-kilometer area, the territory suffered huge losses.
In 2002, an estimated 4,300 elephants lived in Zakouma. A decade later that figure had plummeted by 90 percent, most of them slaughtered by poachers for their ivory. The elephants were in danger of being wiped out.
About 450 elephants make Zakouma their home today -- roughly half the entire elephant population of Chad, says the park's field operations manager Darren Potgieter.  It's a far cry from the 50,000 elephants that roamed the country's savannahs and scrublands 50 years ago.
The statistics for the region are equally dire. As recently as 1970, Potgieter says, 300,000 elephants roamed a Texas-sized area that included southern Chad, eastern Central African Republic, southwestern Sudan, and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Today, only small pockets of elephant populations remain, and they remain under threat.
This is not one of the world's thriving neighborhoods; each of these countries has experienced protracted wars, and all have impoverished populations.
Poaching, shrinking habitats, human-animal conflict, war and a seemingly insatiable appetite for ivory in Asia -- particularly in China -- have all contributed to the disappearing populations of elephants and many other species.  Zakouma is no exception.
Turning the tide
So the Labuschagnes, with their African Parks staff and volunteers, set out to reverse the grim Zakouma statistics, which eclipsed even the worst trends of vanishing elephant populations across much of the African continent.
For years, the constant fear of being hunted and killed had made the elephants too stressed out to reproduce. But by the end of 2011, Zakouma started to see a dramatic turnaround. Since then, no elephants have been poached in the park, and no ivory has been taken from the park in five years.
More than 40 calves have been welcomed into the herd since the end of 2013. The births are an important step towards the park's goal of increasing the herd's size to more than one thousand within the next decade.
The gains of the past few years were hard-earned. And the benefits have been reaped not only by the animals but by people living nearby as well.
Communities around Zakouma have been given a stake in the battle against poachers.  It has not only meant well-paid jobs as guards, rangers and support staff, but the patrols in and on the periphery of the park also mean better security for the surrounding villages and nomads.
24-hour tracking
There's even a toll free number to call with any concerns regarding the security of the elephants or the people, and many villages have radios to connect them to the park's nerve center -- a 24-hour military-style operations room with radios, computers, and near real-time tracking of elephant herds.
As Potgieter gives a tour of the command center, the radio crackles with constant communication from guard teams on the ground.  Computers and maps display elephant groups' locations.  "We have 11 collars on as many family groups as possible," says Potgieter, pointing to black marks on a map showing the positions of the elephants. The satellite collars enable monitoring and protection, and there's always a guard unit within a few kilometers of the herds.
Another 4 elephants were outfitted with satellite collars in late February.  In one collaring operation, Potgieter circled overhead in a Cessna light aircraft, guiding Labuschagne's team through kilometers of scrub and high grasses to an acacia forest.  It was midday, the elephants a bit more dozy in the searing heat.  They may feel somewhat safer in this seemingly inhospitable forest of thorn trees. But it's tough tracking them through the scratchy terrain.
Legendary wildlife veterinarian and consultant to the park Dr. Pete Morkel flew to Chad from southern Africa on his annual mission to help with the collaring. After preparing the necessary drugs and tranquilizer gun, Morkel and Rian Labuschagne set out on foot to get close to the 90-strong herd.  The two worked without words, silent gestures sufficing for the pair who have done this together before.
A few large female elephants were visible through a gap in the thick acacias as they fanned their ears to cool themselves.  Morkel watched and waited for a suitable individual to tranquilize, wanting to avoid a mother with a calf. After few minutes' wait, he took aim and darted one with the tranquilizer gun.
A single trumpet from the forest signalled alarm, and the herd quickly dispersed into the tangle of thorns. Morkel and Labuschagne approached a teenage female, now lying on her side.  The pair, followed by the rest of their team, set to work quickly, fitting the collar while pouring water over the sedated elephant to keep her cool. Lorna Labuschagne held the tip of the trunk to enable the elephant to breathe unencumbered.
As the team adjusted the collar, Morkel treated an old festering wound in the elephant's right front foot. He guessed it was likely from a spray of gunfire in the days when poaching in the park was out of control. This female's darting may have been lucky for her.
Rian Labuschagne says the collaring isn't just necessary to track and protect the elephants -- it is the main goal of the operation.
Will Zakouma's success be contagious?
Kenyan officers burn 15 tons of ivory on March 3.
The success in and around Zakouma has been noted by Chadian President and conservation advocate Idriss Deby, who has asked African Parks to come up with an elephant protection scheme for the entire country.
Chad, under its National Elephant Protection Plan, burned the country's ivory stockpiles in February 2014. A number of African countries have likewise burned their ivory stockpiles in order to stop poaching and illegal trafficking of the highly profitable commodity.  Kenya set alight a 15-ton pyre of tusks in early March of this year, and Ethiopia followed suit two weeks later.
But reviving the elephant population isn't the only goal Zakouma and African Parks have in mind.
Their stewardship of the wilderness area is evident in the richness of the ecosystem here. Buffalo herds have rebounded, the lion population is rising, and about half of the continent's Kordofan giraffes live here -- not to mention an abundant variety of antelope and bird species.
Conspicuous by its absence from this list is the black rhino, last spotted in Zakouma in 1972, according to the Rhino Resource Center. In April, African Parks hopes to reintroduce the species into the park.  Asked whether this would bring unwanted attention from poachers -- rhino horn commands an even higher price than elephant tusks on the illegal market -- Potgieter replies: "Someone has to take the bold step and reintroduce rhino. There are lots of responsibilities and lots of risks in park management."
'These animals are our legacy'
No doubt additional patrols will need to match new protection needs.
So far, African Parks and Zakouma have met those security demands and challenges, but the battle to protect some of the world's most iconic species is far from over.
Armed guards on horseback are a constant reminder of the battle to protect the park. The guards have been bolstered by new equipment, including sniper rifles. But the financial stakes in this fight are high, and well-armed poaching gangs are always upping the ante.
The pressure on the animals won't let up, and this war will continue. The Zakouma guards know this, and are prepared to fight, even if it means death.
The reason is simple, Mamba team ranger Ahmat Assilek says:  "The animals you see are the legacy for future generations."

Footnote: This remote wilderness, far from the usual spots on the safari circuit, doesn't get a stream of camera-toting visitors.  CNN's Ingrid Formanek joined some of Africa's top safari guides, some of them old friends, on a tour hosted by the non-profit African Parks at their newly established Camp Nomade.
This is unexplored territory, and has a draw not only for its wildlife but for its remarkable conservation efforts.  African Parks has taken on management of areas few others will touch - marginal and often war-torn sectors in countries such as the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The photos were contributed by a few of Ingrid's fellow traveller guides. On the trip, they discovered a bird species previously unknown in Chad.

Spring is in the air and underwater -- especially off the coast of British Columbia.
Four orca babies have been born in the last three months, a higher number than usual, according to the Center for Whale Research.
Orcas in the area are called the Southern Residents and this baby boom brings their total to 81 whales.
"We hope this is a sustained upswing in the population, but they are endangered and will remain endangered until we can get their population up over 100," said Ken Balcomb with the Center for Whale Research.
The first calf of the season was spotted in December, followed by two in February and this last one in March.
Balcomb said CWR has been studying the Southern Residents for nearly 40 years. "Early on we used to have seven, eight orca babies, but recently we've had substantially less."
Michael Harris, executive director of the Pacific Whale Watch Association, said efforts to improve the numbers of orcas include beefing up salmon in the area. "We're going to keep a careful watch on these babies and our fingers crossed -- and of course continue to do everything we can to rebuild these salmon runs and feed these whales."

In 1923, Cecil B. DeMille became a believer in the power the Bible held with moviegoing audiences. After finding success with his Old Testament epic "The Ten Commandments," DeMille enlisted H.B. Warner to help him tell "The Greatest Story Ever Told." The result was 1927's "The King of Kings," a film for which Warner was virtuous both on and off the set. According to Turner Classic Movies , he signed an agreement not to be involved in any sort of scandal -- even divorce -- for a year following the movie's release.

When in need of a man to play Jesus in 1959's Oscar-winning "Ben-Hur," the production team turned to opera singer Claude Heater. Although his portrayal of Christ is one of the best known in cinema, he still goes uncredited for the part. The movie was based on the 1880 novel, "Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ," which had previously been turned into a silent film in 1925.

Story highlights
If you turned on the television this past Sunday, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal.
According to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong.
(CNN)
It's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like.
Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image.
A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean.
If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer.
Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from "Killing Jesus," a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. "A.D.," NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries "The Bible," and "Finding Jesus," CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare.
Does God have a prayer in Hollywood?
What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business , is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood.
Haaz Sleiman, from "Killing Jesus," was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians , who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure.
Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in "Finding Jesus."
And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in "A.D.," replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed "hot Jesus, " by some, "smarmy Jesus" by others.
You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past.
But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say.
"Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed," said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of "Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."
"A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India," Humphries-Books continued. "That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways."
The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings , which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf.
But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't wear long hair, said the New Testament scribe .

        <title>How Stone-Age blades are still cutting it in modern surgery</title>
        <Link>http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/HEIfTb7oI9I/index.html</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels
Some surgeons still use the blades in procedures today
Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world.
(CNN)
Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out?
In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines.
It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds.
But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian.
Cutting edge
Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels.
At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge.
When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce.
Read: The worms that invade your brain
Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring.
Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades.
"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring," he said.
"It makes for the best cosmetic outcome."
He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut.
Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian.
Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel.
The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference.
Cut with a chainsaw
"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh'," Dr. Green said. "Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw."
Read: Contact lens with built-in telescope
Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal.
Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw
Dr Lee Green
"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'" he said. "If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically.
"It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery.
"You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!"
And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel.
"What's really fun is seeing it heal," he said. "Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring."
Specialist use
In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal.
"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer," the company says.
At 99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at 712.50 ($772.60).
But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use.
Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone.
"If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it," he said. "It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off."

Sigga Ella's portraits show people with Down syndrome from 9 months to 60 years old
She hopes her photos shine a light on "the beauty and diversity of mankind"
(CNN)
Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world.
Ella's series, "First and foremost I am," consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21 , the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavk Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography.
Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport.
The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on "the beauty and diversity of mankind" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable.
"I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world."
The title of the series, "First and foremost I am," comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project.
"I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora," Jonsdottir writes. "I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies."
Jonsdottir goes on to say, "Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?"
Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects "to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together." The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot.
"My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness."

Researchers: World's largest asteroid impact zone found in Australia
By Jethro Mullen , CNN
Updated 0151 GMT (0951 HKT) March 25, 2015
Imaging taken from rock along the border of South Australia and the Northern Territory shows evidence of a massive impact.
Story highlights
Two pieces of asteroid crashed into Australia many millions of years ago
Researchers stumble across traces of the impact zone deep in the earth's crust
(CNN)
The massive meteorite split in two shortly before smashing into Earth, wiping out large numbers of species.
The devastating event took place on our planet many millions of years ago, but researchers are only now beginning to discover what happened.
In a remote part of Central Australia, the two pieces of asteroid left what geophysicists say is the largest impact zone ever found on Earth, spreading over an area 400 kilometers (250 miles) wide.
"The two asteroids must each have been over 10 kilometers across -- it would have been curtains for many life species on the planet at the time," said lead researcher Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University .
The team published its research in the journal Tectonophysics this month.
The crater caused by the asteroids vanished long ago. But Glikson said the researchers stumbled across scars from the impacts during drilling for geothermal research.
Traces are buried more than 2 kilometers inside the Earth's crust, under an area near the borders of South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.
"There are two huge deep domes in the crust, formed by the Earth's crust rebounding after the huge impacts, and bringing up rock from the mantle below," Glikson said.
Mystery over timing
The researchers are still trying to figure out just how long ago the shattering event happened.
The surrounding rocks are 300 million to 600 million years old, according to the team, but they haven't been able to find the sort of evidence left by other meteorite strikes.
A big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks.
But the researchers say they haven't come across a similar layer in sediments from about 300 million years ago.
"It's a mystery -- we can't find an extinction event that matches these collisions. I have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300 million years," Glikson said.
The discovery of the huge asteroid impacts could lead to new insights about the Earth's history.
"Large impacts like these may have had a far more significant role in the Earth's evolution than previously thought," Glikson said.

Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) has taken delivery of the Izumo, the largest Japanese military vessel to see service since World War II.
The warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the Yokusuka naval base near Yokohama, also home to the U.S Navy's Seventh Fleet.
The Izumo has a crew of 470, and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones (24,000 tonnes at full load, according to military publication Jane's ), it is as large as the storied Yamato-class battleships which fought U.S. naval forces in the Pacific theater of World War II.

        <title>A really big fish story</title>

        <MainBody>Is this 280 pound catfish real? Fisherman provides proof 02:04
Story highlights
Dino Ferrari snaps photos of a 280-pound catfish he says he caught in Italy
It took him 40 minutes to reel in the fish, according to his sponsor
(CNN)
Catfish come in all varieties, shapes and sizes, some big and some small.
And one downright gigantic, apparently now swimming in a river in Italy.
That's the fish story being told by Dino Ferrari, who reeled in a 280-pound (127-kilogram), 8.75-foot-long catfish last Thursday along the Po River, said Davide Valla, who is with Ferrari's sponsor company Sportex. (The sponsored fisherman wouldn't say exactly where he caught the big fellow, choosing to keep his favorite spots secret.)
Assuming the world isn't being hooked, this would not be the first time someone has caught a whopper of a catfish and lived to tell the tale.
In fact, it wouldn't be the biggest catfish ever caught. That would be a nearly 342-pound lau-lau (or piraiba) type of catfish snared in 2009 in Brazil's Amazon region, according to the International Game Fish Association.
Heck, it's not even the biggest catfish ever snared in Italy. That honor goes to a 298-pound wels catfish -- which is reportedly the same variety caught by Ferrari -- also from the Po River. And Ferrari didn't necessarily bring his fish in alone, with stories linked from Sportex's Facebook page indicating that twin brother Dario was by his side.
One thing that makes the latest Po River catch unique is that it was done with a spinning reel, said Valla, who called it a record for such fishing tackle. It took Ferrari 40 minutes to bring in the fish, then bring it to shore, his sponsor said.
Once it was on land, the Ferraris snapped some photos and weighed their catch. But they didn't dig in, savoring it with fresh bread, cheese and a glass of pinot grigio.
That's because this fish story has a happy ending for the star of the show: the catfish. According to Valla, Ferrari released his big catch back into the river.

Story highlights
Kim Jong Un takes a tough stance at a meeting of the Workers Party of Korea
He also sports a more severe haircut that first debuted in January
Some take to social media to speculate about what the new look means
(CNN)
Who doesn't like a new look? New Year, new you, amiright?
An updated 'do can "hair-ald" a new phase in your life, signifying a fresh start.
And maybe that's what the reclusive leader of North Korea was going for when he modified his almost boyish over-the-top-flop to a higher, angular, more severe cut. The look first debuted at his New Year's address in January.

From refugees to photojournalists  Adil Mustafa Hamdan, 21, is a student at the Soba Secondary Refugee School. He was one of 21 students selected to take a digital storytelling course through the UN Refugee Agency project. Like many of the students that graduated from the course, he aspires to be a photojournalist.
"I would go to the Nuba Mountains and photograph people with no clothes, no shoes; I'd photograph soldiers while they are fighting; I'd photograph airplanes that drop bombs. I would show through my photos and explain through my stories the situation in the Nuba Mountains," he says.

"I left the Nuba Mountains because of the war in '83. At that time, we left in a group of 57 people. Only nine of us survived the journey. I was the youngest, only seven years old.
One day, my father was very sick and he began to tell me the names of all of my uncles. When he finished he died. I stayed for seven more years until the people signed a peace agreement, which was in 2005.
I said to myself, let me see what will happen. After six years I prepared to go back to my homeland, but when I was about to start my journey the war broke out. I thought, 'I'll never see my family. I will die as my father died.'
Then people began to arrive from the Nuba Mountains to the camp. The first person I spoke to turned out to be my uncle. It was the best moment of my life. This is why I am happy. Because I have found my relatives."

From refugees to photojournalists  Aziz Hassan Eidiie was born in 1990 in the Nuba village of Kauda. When war broke out in his home in 2011, he had to stop his schooling. He was able to resume it at the Soba Secondary School. Many of his photographs focus on the lives of the young men inside the camp.
"I am happy to have become a photographer, because this was one of my dreams," he says.
"I hope that God may help me learn more and more about journalism so I can put it into practice."

From refugees to photojournalists  Awatif Kawaja Matile is 20 years old. Education has always been very important to her. At ten, she walked long distances to attend her primary school. Later, she attended a private school, where she lived without her parents."I struggled because I didn't have their financial support to help me buy clothes, shoes and other materials," she admits.
When the war broke out in 2011, she made her way to the Ajuong Thok  Refugee Camp so that she could continue her studies. "Being in school is an opportunity to learn, and to change your life from bad to better," she says, though she admits she doesn't view education as a cure-all. "It doesn't mean that you will have a comfortable life; you may face challenges and problems, but education makes you a better person in the future. You must think and reason wisely," she says.As a participant in the project, she focused a lot on the everyday struggles of families in the camp.

From refugees to photojournalists  Roda Tia Hamdan was pulled out of school as a young girl, because she needed to take care of her cousin."Even though I wanted to continue my education, my uncle wouldn't let me, because I was a babysitter," she recalls. At 11 years old, she started cutting grass to earn money for school fees, but soon afterward her education was stalled again due to the conflict in the Nuba Mountains. "I dared to continue my studies as a refugee," she says. Like many in Ajuong Thok refugee camp, she arrived solo, without her parents.
"I went to live with my friend so that I wouldn't have to live alone," she says.

They call themselves the "eyes and ears of Nuba", a reference to the mountains from which they fled.
Young, mainly in their 20s, sometimes younger, these student refugees share a similar narrative. Their villages, tucked away in the remote regions of South Kordofan in the Sudan, became uninhabitable : They were rained down on with rockets; they could no longer grow food, keep cattle, go to school.
They joined 15,000 other refugees in Ajuong Thok camp in South Sudan (Yida camp, closer to the Sudanese border, houses an additional 70,000). Now, they want their stories to be heard. They are citizen journalists in the making.
Last November, Kathryn Mahoney, a communication officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and a self-described "repository of stories" launched an initiative that trained 21 students from the community in digital storytelling through smartphones.
"I travel around and meet these amazing refugees who have been through some of the most horrifying situations, and my responsibility is to help them get their story out, to amplify their voice," she says.
"But as humanitarians, we forget that these are their stories to tell."
At first, she recalls, the students didn't know how to turn the phones on.
"Growing up in the west, we take for granted our visual literacy. We're literally bombarded with images from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep. These students don't come from that culture, so even with issues like framing and point-of-view, we were really starting from scratch," she recalls.
By the end of the course, Mahoney says, "they knew how to use the phones better than I did."
The phones have since gone to the local school, which has adopted a kind of lending library for other students who want to learn photojournalism skills and sign the equipment out.
The students paired the photos they took with a narrative. Some opted for straight quotes from their subjects, a la Humans of New York . Others wrote essays.

        <MainBody>In the past few weeks, Houthi rebels have taken control of Yemen's capital
The move pushes country closer to failed state status, giving al Qaeda greater foothold
Nic Robertson joins Saudi border police trying to staunch the human tide
Nic Robertson will take your questions about his reporting from Saudi Arabia today at 4 p.m. ET/9 p.m. GMT on Reddit .
Jizan, Saudi Arabia (CNN)
Driving out of the sleepy Saudi seaside town of Jizan at dawn, I had no idea what to expect.
I'd been asking the Saudi Interior Ministry to take me there for several years. Now I was in the desert kingdom covering King Salman bin Abdulaziz's ascent to the throne, and that permission had finally come through.
In the past few weeks, Houthi rebels have taken control of Yemen's capital, pushing the country ever closer to "failed state" status and giving the al Qaeda franchise there -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP -- a greater foothold.
The Saudi minister of interior, now second-in-line to the throne, has a personal stake in seeing AQAP eradicated. The terror group's top bomb-maker put a sophisticated bomb in his own brother's rectum, exploding it when the brother met the leading royal a few years ago. The brother died, the minister was only lightly injured.

This is the same bomb-maker who made the underpants bomb that came close to bringing down an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Despite extensive drone campaigns targeting him, he is believed to still be alive and remains a significant global threat.
There is no doubt in anyone's mind here that al Qaeda in Yemen will use any chance it gets to export terror over the border to their northern neighbor, with the royal family being the targets of choice.
Col. Omar al Kahtani, our escort for the day, was in a voluble mood as we sped toward the looming mountains that mark the border. "Anything could happen," he told us. "Be ready with your camera." Gun battles are rare on this border, he said, but only three weeks earlier, on Saudi's northern frontier,  ISIS fighters broke through the defenses, killing three Saudi soldiers, including their commander.
The gun battle, footage of which was posted on the Internet, was a salutary reminder that the desert kingdom, the West's biggest regional partner in fighting the terror groups, is surrounded by battle-hardened enemies.
This corner of the country is remarkably green. Relatively lush vegetation -- in Saudi terms, at least --  sprouts in profusion from the semi-arid fields.
As our four-wheel-drive truck swung through the rickety metal gate, marking the edge of the border exclusion zone, we got our first taste of what has mostly been a hidden war down here.
A sprawling Saudi village of large ornate villas came into view. Pretty, until we got close, when we realized the buildings were all shot up. Rockets had torn gaping holes in the walls and gardens were overgrown with spindly tentacles of creepers that slowly consumed the once-vibrant homes.
Our host explained this was a village overrun by Houthi rebels from Yemen six years ago. In a three-week battle, Saudi Apache gunships had nearly destroyed the hamlet in the battle to save it. The government moved the residents away, creating a buffer between them and their fractious neighbor.
As we drive on, he tells us Yemen's security is worsening and Saudi Arabia is spending almost $3 billion on beefing up border security. Our trucks are bumping and slipping their way up the newly cut rough rock tracks. At moments, it feels as if we are almost climbing vertically.
These mountains are as rugged and rough as they are beautiful. Villages cling precariously to their higher reaches. No fence reaches up this far, the tiny smattering of guards solidifies the impression that at these altitudes, border control works on an honor system.
No line on a map will stop these mountain men from rounding up their stray goats. Even from the roadside I can see tiny footpaths crisscrossing the steep terrain from Yemen to Saudi and back.
Massive drugs haul
In the foothills, control is much more effective. Watch towers are equipped with thermal imaging equipment, super zoom cameras watching over mile upon mile, and layer upon layer of razor wire. It needs to be like this.
What we saw was staggering. I had no idea so many people and such a massive amount of drugs are moving over the border every day.
At our first stop, we saw two men captured that day. We saw another one caught soon after. Then a whole vanload, about a dozen people crowded inside a mesh cage welded to a pickup truck. One of them was just 11 years old.
They all told us they had come to Saudi for work. The 11-year-old was earning about $100 a month on a supermarket till in Jizan. All told the same story: about poverty and increasing chaos in Yemen and the Houthis getting stronger. The risk of jail in Saudi, they said, was better than the certainty of poverty in Yemen.
Our government escort told us they'd all be sent to the nearest large police station where they would be fingerprinted and officials would check their records to make sure none had ties to terrorism.
The men -- and they were all men -- admitted that sneaking over the border is getting much harder amid the increase in guard posts and border fences.
Border guards told us in the past three months alone, they have picked up 42,000 people along the 800-kilometer (about 500 miles) border.
Of course we are unable to verify that figure, but if the volume of illegal migrants we saw in the morning was shocking, then the afternoon was mind-blowing.
We were taken to a room where three children were standing with bundles of qat, the narcotic shrub that most Yemenis chew every day, at their feet.
The youngest, a 10-year-old, told me drug barons pay him $50 for hauling 10-kilos (about 22 lbs) of the green leaves over the border. It's the second time he has been caught.
I was told that the boy, who had been given a banana and a bottle of water by the guards, would be taken back to the border and told to return home. All three looked small for their age. No one, particularly them, doubted they would be back.
Continual stream of infiltrators
Unemployment among younger people is running at 40% in Yemen, likely higher in their villages. Putting food on the table at the end of the day is as far ahead as they think.
Between them, they had been caught with about 30 kilos of the narcotic. Piled up outside the guard post were several tons more -- the haul of the past week, or so we were told. I'd seen similar piles outside many of the other posts we'd already visited.
According to statistics given to us at the Jizan headquarters of the border guards, qat is a multi-million-dollar business. In the last three months, they say, they have seized more than 500,000 tons along the border, with a street value close to $100 million.
They also showed us 50 kg of cannabis resin they had confiscated that day. Over the past three months, more than 6,000 kg of hashish -- with a street value in Saudi of about $36 million -- had been seized, we were told.
Guns and ammunition are also smuggled in: 2,562 weapons have been seized in the past three months, as well as 380,088 rounds of ammunition, the border guards said. And the list goes on.
And so did our day and the near-continual stream of infiltrators. The problem for the Saudis is that they cannot ignore this deluge. Any one of the thousands they stop could be a terrorist.
Said Kouachi, one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers in Paris, is believed to have slipped in to Yemen not far from Saudi's border, making his way there for terror training from Oman. The attack he and his brother carried out also shows the lengths that AQAP is willing to go to in order to export terror.
Hajj pilgrimages to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, draw millions of Muslims to the kingdom. Knowing who comes and who goes is vital.
As the sun began to set, we jumped in police gun trucks as another group of men were spotted near the razor wire border fence. Tearing over the bumpy ground, we raced to intercept them. Surprisingly, they didn't run. They know they'll be freed soon, and from what we saw none of the six were beaten or abused.
Within minutes, as we were driving away, the sun sinking over the horizon and our day done, we thought we passed another eight men being caught. We stopped as police emptied the men's pockets. Cheap cellphones, not much else. They were illegal workers on their way back to homes in Yemen after weeks of work in Saudi, their wages already sent over the border by local money exchangers.
It was already darkening as we pulled away, once again trying to set off back to Jizan. And yet again,  we stopped as we saw a group of guards searching two small figures. More child qat smugglers, rope and sack bags on their backs bulging with the big wraps that protect the delicate green leaves. Each boy carrying bundles with the drug baron's name on them.
Later, when we finally did get back to Jizan, we ate dinner sitting on rugs next to the Red Sea: fish, meat, salads, bread and Saudi "champagne," non-alcoholic fizzy grape juice.
This is a land of plenty, Yemen is not. Stanching the human tide flowing over the border is only going to get more difficult, and finding the terrorist hiding in so much human misery even harder.

"We walked and walked for hours, slashing through the forest overgrowth to look for the prey," Rodrigues recalled. "The Awa were barefoot the whole time."

Photographer Daniel Rodrigues spent time with an endangered tribe in the Amazon
The people didn't speak his language, and they communicated with hand gestures
Illegal loggers are moving into their territory and threatening their way of life
(CNN)
Portuguese photographer Daniel Rodrigues had always dreamed of visiting the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, and he finally got his chance last year.
After two years of fundraising and wrestling with government bureaucracy, Rodrigues arrived at a place some might call a version of Eden: the Alto Turiacu reserve where the Awa-Guaja roam.
"I wanted to show the daily life in the world's most endangered tribe," he said.
The Awa-Guaja's way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally encroaching on their land, according to Brazil's National Indian Foundation. Many Awa Indians have had little to no contact with the outside world, but that is beginning to change, the foundation reports, as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on.
Daniel Rodrigues
Rodrigues set out to document the tribe's existence -- pure, pristine and, tragically, fleeting.
"I had traveled to Africa and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was," Rodrigues said. "Here I was, in the 21st century, with other humans who (until recently) had never seen a camera, a computer ... never seen a shower and were shocked when they saw a helicopter. And yet they are extremely happy."
Calling themselves Awa, Tupi-Guarani for "man," the tribe is made of forest foragers and dexterous hunters. Challenges abound, said Rodrigues, who was forced to communicate with hand gestures for several weeks because the tribespeople did not speak Portuguese.
"I pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting," Rodrigues recalled. "They were incredibly friendly, and I was very well-received."
Spending weeks without uttering words, Rodrigues immersed himself in the visual resplendence of the Awa-Guaja life in the forest. Twelve-hour hunting expeditions were common, cutting through thick jungle growth during the monsoon rains. Nature's orchestral sounds rang behind every moment, something his photographs seem to allude to.

Detouring from the use of formal portraiture often seen in ethnophotography, Rodrigues' black-and-white photos are filled with an honesty that could only come as a result of an amicable pact with his subjects. The Awa clearly trusted Rodrigues' camera, and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well-versed he became with the ins and outs of the Awa way of life. The cinematic quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the photographer's endurance and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of sportsmanship.
"We walked and walked for hours, slashing through the forest overgrowth to look for the prey," Rodrigues said. "The Awa were barefoot the whole time."
Rodrigues nonchalantly talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red puma.
"The hunter had missed a shot, and the puma jumped right over towards me," he said. "In the meantime, I was having an allergic reaction to a spider bite. It wasn't easy."
There are several groups of the Awa-Guaja in this part of the forest. Some have been known to exist since the 1970s. Others have been contacted in the early 1980s. Many are believed to still be in hiding.
Earlier this month, Brazil's official news agency reported that three isolated Awa Indians had made contact with the other mainstream Awa-Guaja. The group's leader, Amakaria, reportedly said that loggers were marking trees and threatening to kill them.
The Brazilian government has launched a massive military operation into the states of Para and Maranhao, today the epicenter in the war between loggers and Indians. Latest satellite imagery shows that new logging tracks are constantly being carved.
Monitoring and preserving such a large expanse of tropical forest is a challenge. In the meantime, how can the so-called civilized world understand what is being lost?
Rodrigues tries to explain:
"Getting out of my comfort zone, my comfortable bed, to walk for hours through virgin forest, crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck ... hearing the triumphal songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their brethren -- this experience can completely change a human being."

A new sex park for Taiwan?
By Maggie Hiufu Wong , CNN
Updated 0719 GMT (1519 HKT) January 27, 2015
Not everyone loves the idea of a new sex theme park in southwestern Taiwan, though this installation, set up in Beimen for wedding photos, suggests a local appetite for romance.
Story highlights
Proposal to build the first sex park in Taiwan posted online
The sex theme park will explore topics from different sex positions to sex toys
The park's spokesperson confirmed the plan but stressed that it's just an idea at this stage
(CNN)
Taiwan, are you getting a new sex theme park or just teasing us?
The word on the street -- or on the Internet at least -- is that plans are afoot to develop an erotic entertainment attraction on the island's Southwest Coast National Scenic Area.
After interest was aroused by details posted on the region's official website , however, the page was quickly taken down.
The park's administration director, Cheng Rong-fong, confirmed with CNN that the proposal is real, but he insists it's just a concept at this point.
"The ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government," said Cheng.
Details of the plan , circulated by a user on Taiwan's popular PTT online bulletin board, outlined a "Taiwan Romantic Boulevard" sightseeing route with four zones stretching across three counties.
'Silk road of love'
Tainan's Jingzaijiao Salt Farm is famous for its romantic sunset views.
Each stage has a different theme: "dating paradise," "scenic spot for wedding gowns," "silk road of love" and a proposed 10,000-meter-square "sex theme park."
The sex theme park -- or "Garden of Eden" as it's called in the proposal -- will be modeled after other erotic parks around the world including Jeju's Loveland in South Korea and Vigeland Park in Oslo, Norway.
Claiming to be educational, the park will serve as the final stop of the four-stage journey of love.
It'll be divided into different sections, covering topics including sex positions, unusual sex lives and sex toys.
"The dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but aren't officially a couple yet," the proposal said.
Cheng said that the proposal shouldn't have been made public before being finalized, but insisted, if realized, that it will help regenerate a neglected area.
"The southwestern coast of Taiwan has been an important salt farm since the Qing Dynasty," he says.
"It has a unique background, culture and ecological value. Yet, a decade after it was declared a national scenic area, it still hasn't received much attention from tourists. So we thought to ourselves, is it time to try a new mode of thinking?
"The white powdery salt hill and salt farm have always emitted a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area," said Cheng. "That's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating/wedding-themed park in Taiwan."
'Too out of line'
The proposal generated heated debate online.
"This is the first time I find a government proposal interesting," said one online critic, according to Taiwan's Now News .
Another said: "We surpass Japan. The pride of Taiwan."
"This is too out of line," posted another. "And soon the government will start promoting sex tourism."
Beimen is so popular for wedding photos it has fake churches as backdrops.
Chang Huang-chen, the deputy commissioner for Yunlin County, the sex park's proposed home, told the Taipei Times that the idea may not be suitable for traditional-minded locals.
Cheng said he'd received mostly supportive comments, but he welcomed different opinions.
"Sex has always been a taboo in Chinese society," he added. "But it's a part of our lives and a very natural thing -- why can't we discuss it openly and generously?"
Aside from the sex park, the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions.
"We're planning to add around 100 landmarks and installations to each of stage to enrich the experience," said Cheng.
The proposed route starts at the scenic six-story-high salt hill in Cigu County.
It then leads to Beimen, a place famous for its vibrant pre-wedding photo-shooting industry, where "churches" and dozens of other romantic landmarks are built for that purpose.
The third destination, Budai, is a fishing town in Chiayi.
The proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park.

Most of us are happy with being flung around in a roller coaster or spun high in a Ferris wheel.
The rush of fear and the brief re-acquaintance with breakfast are part of the thrill.
But when does a theme park ride stop being scarily fun and start being just plain scary?
We're talking about the rides on which the fear turns into the kind of pure psychological terror that only weeks of counseling -- or a night of martinis -- can resolve.
The rides on which it's not just breakfast that flashes before your eyes, but your entire life (plus some diced carrots that you have no recollection of eating).
These are the scariest theme park rides on Earth.
Thankfully, we don't have to try them, because Stefan Zwanzger, aka the globetrotting Theme Park Guy , already has.
And lived to tell the tale.
The rusty roller coasters of Pyongyang (North Korea)
Just when life in a totalitarian state couldn't get any more terrifying, North Korea unleashes some creaking fairground rides on its unsuspecting citizenry.
To be fair, the Kaeson Youth Park is a rare attempt to sprinkle genuine joy on the gray Stalinist cityscape of Pyongyang.
The fear here, says Zwanzger, is an emotional response in no way soothed by geopolitics.
"When you visit North Korea you naturally never feel completely safe and relaxed, so you enter the rides wondering if they've been maintained at all since most were built decades ago.
"The cobwebs aren't a good sign."

Baku's gross ghost train (Azerbaijan)
Most ghost trains are so lame that it's interesting to hear of one that actually does spook its passengers.
Unfortunately, at the time of Zwanzger's visit, this boardwalk ride on Baku's Caspian seafront was getting its screams the lazy way: via pain.
"Imagine you're alone in a ghost train, driving through the dark, and all of a sudden a sticky curtain drops on you from above and sticks itself to your nose and teeth," Zwanzger says.
"And while the ghost train keeps moving forward, the curtain and your nose and teeth don't.
Zwanzger says he complained to the operator.
"Due to the language barrier and the lack of any internationally recognized sign language for 'my nose got stuck to a curtain,' I don't think he got the message. I don't think he really cared about anything, either."
He adds: "Man, that was painful! My love and pity goes out to those who ride it next."

The Tehran neck cracker (Iran)
At Iran's Eram Park, it's a tossup between which is more disturbing.
The badly drawn Mickey Mouse cartoons, or the soda can roller coaster?
For Zwanzger, the coaster -- which plays fast and loose with physics by flinging passengers in a such a tight loop they can almost see the backs of their own heads -- wins.
"When I saw this the first time, with Coke can-shaped cars hurtling noisily around a narrow loop, I thought, that's going to hurt.
"And it did. Two to three hours of neck pain followed.
"This roller coaster makes one of the narrowest loopings known to mankind. It's as if your head stays in the same place while the coaster spins around."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: Skip roller Iran's coasters altogether and enjoy the country and its wonderful people.
Ferris wheel of misfortune (Nepal)
Take an ordinary Ferris wheel.
Fill it with starry-eyed couples and happy families.
Then crank the speed dial up to 11.
That's how they do it in Nepal.
Because maybe when you live on the slopes of the Himalayas, gaining a few extra meters in height just isn't thrilling enough.
"That thing had speed," says Zwanzger, who says he didn't board the wheel in Kathmandu's Fun Park because the line was too long -- and he was afraid of being propelled into orbit.
"You could hear screams. And these were not the normal Ferris wheel screams of 'ooooh, let's take a photo.'
"These were more like 'argghhh, let me down, I wanna get outta here' screams."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: The London Eye (South Bank, London; +44 871 781 3000)
Qingdao chairoplane of pain (China)
Chairoplanes are called chairoplanes because, as with chairs, it's possible to sit in them, and as with planes, all logic says these things should not leave the ground.
Typically chairoplanes rise a few meters off the ground, giving passengers a thrill as they ride in a chair or model aircraft attached by chains to a rotating overhead gantry.
At Fantawild, a new theme park in the Chinese coastal city of Qingdao, the chairoplane ride is less chair, more plane, lofting startled passengers up to almost cruising altitude.
"I was the only rider, and once up in the air, the chains were making creaking and groaning noises and my chair was turning wildly on its own axis," says Zwanzger.
"It was a long ride. And cold.
"It was new so maybe my fear was just psychological, but I'd rather fly a plane from the 1970s than get back in that Qingdao chairoplane."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: Any chairoplane in a European theme park with a budget of more than 100 million euros.
Disney's secret weapon (Various locations)
There is of course, nothing remotely scary about a kid-compatible classic that takes passengers on a mini-tour of a world populated by friendly animatronic puppets.
And yet, says Zwanzger, Disneyland's "It's a Small World" ride, as seen in its U.S., French, Japanese and Hong Kong parks, has untapped potential as a psychological weapon.
"One ride is fun, but try it about six or seven times and it becomes one of the scariest rides on Earth.
"You ask yourself, 'what if I was trapped here listening to that song and seeing these puppets forever?'
"If you were to chain someone in this ride and have them go around over and over, I think it would actually break them."
Zwanzger's fear-free alternative: Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster should banish the Small World terrors. ( Frontierland , Disneyland Resort, 1313 S. Disneyland Dr., Anaheim, California)
The Cannonball Loop (United States, closed)
Like many unnecessary things assembled in the 1980s -- among them the Cadillac Cimarron and mid-career films of Sylvester Stallone -- the Cannonball Loop must've seemed like a good idea at the time.
Looking back, however, it's hard not to view it as the work of an unhinged mind.
The Cannonball was a giant water tube that sent riders sliding through a full 360-degree loop. (See it in action in this YouTube video at 8.19: http://youtu.be/vDHqfhyCbbM )
It enjoyed a brief life in the summer of 1985 at the now-defunct Action Park in Vernon, New Jersey, before being shut down in 1996, reportedly after a series of accidents.
"I've been to almost 300 theme and water parks now, but this is by far the scariest thing I've ever seen," says Zwanzger.
"Looking at it, it's just so obvious that if you have one wrong move, you're going to experience a lot of pain or get trapped inside.
"I can't believe this was actually built in the United States, the country where you can be sued by anyone for just about anything."

Story highlights
The jobs that we aspired to when we were children reflect our passions and talents, say experts
LinkedIn's childhood jobs survey reveals 30.3% of people are either currently in that dream job or a related role
Childhood aspirations are shaped by the people, standards and social expectations that surround us
Leading Women connects you to extraordinary women of our time -- remarkable professionals who have made it to the top in all areas of business, the arts, sport, culture, science and more.
(CNN)
When you were young, what did you dream of being "when you grew up"? Is it what you've ended up doing?
You may dismiss those childhood aspirations as unrealistic now you're an adult with responsibilities and bills to pay, but that role reflected what you enjoyed doing and who you were at that time.
"The dream jobs we aspire to as children are a window into our passions and talents," says LinkedIn 's career expert Nicole Williams. "Identifying and understanding those passions are key to improving our performance and enjoyment of the jobs we currently do, even if they aren't specific to the careers we dreamed of as kids."
So, what influences our childhood aspirations?
When she was a young girl, Meredith Haberfeld wanted to be a librarian like her grandmother was.
"When we're small most of us have a limited idea of what's out there," explains career coach Meredith Haberfeld . "It is shaped by the exposure we have -- the people that have a big impact on us and the standards and social expectations around us".
Our families greatly influence our outlook on life. If we look up to one family member in particular, we tend to be drawn to their careers as we want to be like them. Indeed, when Meredith was a little girl, she wanted to be a librarian because her grandmother, who she admired, was one.
And it's not just our relatives' roles at work that can influence children's aspirations. The gender roles that our parents take on at home can also dramatically impact our childhood career choices.
A study by Alyssa Croft, of the University of British Columbia , found that the division of labor at home had implications for how girls' identities developed in gender roles.
Croft told CNN that fathers' behavior around the house seems to be "predicting their daughter's career aspirations" beyond what they "might be publicly endorsing or specifically saying about gender roles."
She found that if fathers talked about supporting gender equality but didn't take on an equal role in domestic tasks then this sent conflicting signals to their daughters, which led to daughters placing more weight on their father's actions, rather than his words.
By contrast, where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles "that are more gender neutral or even sort of male-stereotypic like being a scientist or athlete," Croft says.
When she was younger, Alyssa Croft wanted to be an artist because she enjoyed painting and drawing.
And that could have a major impact on our pay check down the line. Research by the London School of Economics , published in the journal Social Forces, found that girls who aspired to traditionally female-dominated occupations were far more likely to earn lower wages in their first job, since stereotypically "female" jobs tend to pay less.
"Stereotypically 'male' or 'female' preferences that children exhibit during childhood continue into, and affect, their adult lives," says Lucinda Platt, Professor of Social Policy and Sociology at LSE .
Our early experiences can also have a bearing on what we see as our "dream job" -- a positive experience linked to a potential career can be hugely inspiring.
"I went through an intense marine biologist phase fueled by a life-changing snorkeling expedition when I was seven years old," reveals Hayley Barna , co-founder and co-CEO of beauty start-up Birchbox .
And inspiration can also strike at school, if we learn about a career that resonates with us.
"When I was in the 4th grade [aged 9-10] I learned about lobbyists. I thought it would be amazing job to try and influence important issues," says Joanne Bradford , head of partnerships at Pinterest .
When we are young, our aspirations are a response to our circumstances; but Haberfeld says that when the time comes to start "designing" our careers we begin tuning in to what we feel "compelled to express" about ourselves.
Clara Shih , founder of Hearsay Social , started out with a long and varied list of possible careers -- she went through phases of wanting to be a teacher (like her mother), a police officer, an astronaut and an attorney.
"Only in high school when I began programming computers, did I become interested in tech and start-ups, which led me to attend Stanford and major in Computer Science," she says.
"Even as an eight-year-old, swinging ponytails et al, I would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little 'scripts' to deliver to a pretend audience!"
Shivvy Jervis, Creator and presenter, Digital Futures
While many of us turn our backs on our childhood ambitions when faced with the realities of life as a "grown-up," some really do end up in their dream jobs.
A survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than 8,000 professionals from around the world, carried out for social networking site LinkedIn, found that 30.3% of the site's members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of, or in a career linked to those plans.
Creator and presenter of Digital Futures Shivvy Jervis is one of those living out her early dreams.
"Even as an eight-year-old, swinging ponytails et al, I would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little 'scripts' to deliver to a pretend audience!" she says.
"When I was fifteen, I announced with assured clarity to my family that my 'dream job' was to be a producer and TV journalist."
Sometimes our careers begin at such an early age that there's little to think about.
Four-time Paralympic champion Ellie Simmonds OBE started swimming when she was five; by the time she was eight she was competing against able-bodied children.
"I'm not sure I thought too much on what career I was interested in when I was a child," she says. "I always just wanted to have a farm and work with horses when I was very young, though the thought of working with children is something I've thought about since.
"I'm very fortunate that my swimming career took off when I was very young, so it was never really a question."
But no matter how early we step on to that treadmill, it's never too late to change tack; thinking back to our childhood ambitions can help us work out which aspects of our current job we love.
After Hayley Barna's marine biologist phase passed, she says, "I never had a single career in mind. I always pictured myself being able to do many things at once: engineer, President of the United States, investment banker, professional skier, magazine editor...
"I haven't checked the box on any of those specifically, [but] I feel lucky that my current role blends a lot of different disciplines."
When we were children, our aspirations were limitless and anything seemed possible; by recapturing that excitement and allowing it to inform your research and networking, 2015 could be the year you find your dream job.

Original artworks sell for thousands of dollars
(CNN) -- At first glance, they could almost pass for masterpieces by Monet or Renoir.
But these impressionist-style paintings -- which are changing hands for thousands of dollars -- were painted by a five-year-old girl who is unable to speak.
Meet Iris Halmshaw, an autistic child from Leicestershire, UK, who has been producing these striking artworks since she was three.
She has autism, a condition that has made her unable to communicate except through the medium of art.
"From the first painting, she filled the paper with color and it wasn't random -- it was considered and thought out," says her mother, Arabella Carter-Johnson.

"She was so excited and happy I knew that we had found a key into her world and a way of interacting with her."

Autism changed everything
The journey started when Iris was two. Carter-Johnson and her husband, Peter-Jon Halmshaw, realized that something was wrong: she had not picked up any words, and rarely made eye contact.
"We researched it ourselves," her mother recalls, "but as parents, you are always hoping that there was some other explanation."
Iris was officially diagnosed as a child with autism. According to Carter-Johnson, the doctor was "depressing" because he told them that very few therapies worked.
Not to be deterred, the couple embarked on "long nights of research", which led them to the idea of art therapy.
The little girl picked up painting techniques astonishingly quickly, and before long was spending much time at work on her canvases.
Remarkably for a child of her age, her sessions involved about two hours of consistent concentration.
Savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them.
Professor Allan Snyder, Australian National University
How one girl's talent captured the world
To begin with, Carter-Johnson, who is a photographer herself, started sharing her daughter's paintings on Facebook .
The overwhelming response from her friends convinced her that she hadn't been blinded by mother's pride. Iris was special.
Fast forward two years, and Iris' paintings are in high demand, and are starting to be worth a lot of money.
Due to the high level of demand for Iris' art, her mother has set up a website to sell both originals and prints.
It was a runaway success, quickly attracting over a million pageviews from more than 200 countries.
"All profits from the originals go into Iris's savings account," says Carter-Johnson.
"We also sell cards and prints, and the profits from those go towards her speech therapy, occupational therapy, music and yoga."
The money generated from sales of the prints has had profoundly beneficial effects on Iris' day-to-day life.
According to Carter-Johnson, systems like Gemiini speech therapy, for instance, have made an immeasurable difference to her ability to communicate.
"She has a tendency to drift off into her own world, if you let her," says Carter-Johnson.
"So by using her interests, we manage to engage her, and she changes into a giggly little girl dancing around the house.
"Her speech isn't at a stage yet where we can have conversations, so it's hard to tell exactly how much she is understanding everything that has happened surrounding her art.
"We have shielded her from a lot of it. She hasn't been to TV studios or done interviews."
She has a tendency to drift off into her own world, if you let her.
Arabella Carter-Johnson, Iris' mother
Extraordinary artworks
Many of Iris' paintings show an astonishingly mature interpretation of natural scenes, including waterfalls, fields and skies.
Her abstracts often depict particular moods or experiences after which they are titled, like Patience, Separation, and Immersion.
All are united by a distinctively contemplative and often lightly melancholy atmosphere, as well as a mysterious sense of depth.
This growing body of work has led to Iris being widely accepted as a savant.
According to Professor Allan Snyder from the Centre for the Mind at the Australian National University, people like Iris are able to unlock the hidden wells of potential that lie in all of us, but are rarely accessed.
"I think it's possible for a perfectly normal person to have access to these abilities," he says. "[But] savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them."

Story highlights
A conservator tells state-owned Ahram Online that the beard broke off during cleaning
He says it was stuck back on with epoxy, which "was not a proper material to use"
Museum director denies claims of damage, tells Ahram a committee will inspect the mask
(CNN)
Was the priceless funeral mask of King Tutankhamun damaged and hastily glued back together? That's the claim made by a museum conservator to Egyptian media.
The conservator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Egypt's state-owned Ahram Online that the mask's beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being cleaned last year at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
He said the blue-and-gold braided beard was fixed back in place quickly with epoxy, a type of strong adhesive.
"The epoxy was not a proper material to use to restore the mask, although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for attaching metal and stone," he is quoted as saying.
The conservator said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the glue had dried.
However, the Egyptian Museum's general director, Mahmoud El-Halwagi, dismissed the claims in an interview with Ahram Online, saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in October.
"An archaeological committee was assigned to inspect the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the mask's condition," he said.
Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh Eldamaty also told Ahram Online that media reports of damage to the mask were unfounded.
The boy king's elaborate burial mask, discovered in his tomb in 1922, is one of Egypt's most outstanding artifacts.
Tutankhamun, who ruled from 1336-1327 BC, is thought to have been about 17 years old when he died, based on analysis of his mummy, according to the British Museum . His cause of death is not known.
If confirmed, it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe.
In 2006, a visitor to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, famously tripped on a staircase and smashed three hugely valuable Chinese Qing dynasty vases. The thousands of porcelain fragments were eventually painstakingly reassembled .

        <MainBody>Chinese man who disappeared in alleged abduction as a child was reunited with his father
Sun Bin's mother died "constantly murmuring" his name, father says
Child trafficking is a major business in China
Hong Kong (CNN)
A Chinese man has been reunited with his father 24 years after he was abducted as a toddler from a vegetable market.
In 1991, 4-year-old Sun Bin was taken by child traffickers from his hometown in Sichuan province and sold to a family thousands of miles away, in Jiangsu province on the country's eastern coast, Chinese state media reported .
Sun Bin when he was four with his father.
On Tuesday, Sun was finally reacquainted with his 60-year-old father, Sun Youhong, and a younger sister he had never met. The moment was captured in a moving series of photographs.
"I was happy. I was grateful," the father said. "But I was also bitter."
Child trafficking is still a major business in China, as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents in China and elsewhere.
Boys, prized because they carry on the family line, are in great demand and fetch higher prices.
Earlier this week, Chinese police said they had rescued 37 newborn babies after busting a trafficking ring that sold the babies for up $13,000 each.
The reunion Tuesday took place at a police station in Chengdu. When a police officer introduced Sun Bin to his father, the 28-year-old dropped to his knees and wept in his father's embrace.
"You're a man. Don't cry," said the elder Sun, according to a report released by the state news agency Xinhua.
The Search
Sun Bin was just a toddler when he disappeared at a vegetable market in 1991. Sun Youhong said that he and his wife had dropped everything to search for him.

India's Environment Minister has announced a 30% increase in wild tigers in India since 2011
Debbie Banks from the Environmental Investigation Agency says this has "set India apart from other tiger range countries"
One of the major challenges that continues to exist, however, is the sophistication of the illegal tiger trade
The significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, says Banks
(CNN)
Wild tigers in India appear to be staging a comeback in the battle against extinction, with the country's Environment Minister announcing a 30% increase in the endangered species' population since 2011.
"Our latest estimate today is that India has 70% of the world's tiger population and we have now 2,226 tigers presently in 47 tiger reserves [up from 1,706 in 2011] and this is a great achievement. It is a net increase of 30% over the last estimation,"  Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a statement Monday.
Researchers involved in the study, the third of its kind carried out in India, say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats.
Debbie Banks, head of the Tiger Campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade, welcomed news of the study, saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in March.
"I think it has set India apart from some of the other tiger range countries. If you look at China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, there's more emphasis on tigers in captivity, farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild," she says to CNN.
India's once-thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching, a reduction in prey, habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area.
Although preliminary results of the government's study are promising, Banks warns against complacency.
"While this is good news from India, I don't think anyone is sitting back and saying 'we've won.' The demand within China for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue. And so it's a constant battle."
A major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade, where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders, such as mountain passes. "The criminals have changed their practice. And there's no evidence of any enforcement there," she says.
A historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as India and China, the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, Banks says.
"Tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment, certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit. But they are the water gods, if you like. They are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change.
"There's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers."
And if today's results are anything to go by, Banks says India appears to be leading that charge.
"India, despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas, is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation."

The Open Worm Project aims to recreate the behavior of the common roundworm in a machine
The open source project has taken four years to model 302 of the worm's neurons in its software
It had its first major breakthrough recently when the software independently controlled a Legobot
The robot mimicked some of the behaviors of the worm, responding to external stimulus through sensors
(CNN)
A humble roundworm is leading the race in artificial intelligence, showing that it may be possible one day to upload our brains to a computer.
Called the Open Worm Project , the research brings together scientists and programmers from around the world with the aim of recreating the behavior of the common roundworm ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) in a machine.
The open source project recently had its first major breakthrough when its software -- modeled on the neurons of the worm's nervous system -- independently controlled a Lego robot.
The machine's sensors, without any prior programming, made the robot behave in a similar fashion to C. elegans, approaching and backing away from obstacles or stimulated by food.
While the developers say it will be some time before the Lego bot will be avoiding predators or searching for a mate, scientists say the project shows that artificial intelligence, or AI as it is known, is coming out of the realm of science fiction.
"We've been working on it for four years and while we have a lot more to achieve it's been the most surprising project I've been involved in," project coordinator Stephen Larson told CNN. "It's certainly exceeded my expectations."
With the worm's nose neurons replaced by a sonar sensor and the motor neurons running down both sides of the worm replicated on the left and right motors of the Lego bot, the robot could emulate the worm's biological wiring.
Larson said that while the open source project is still awaiting peer review, and the scientists and researchers in the experiment are reluctant to make any bold claims about how closely it resembled biological behavior, the result were nevertheless impressive.
"We definitely have further to go, but I think what captures people's imagination is how much information we have managed to put together," Larson said.
"We know we have the correct number of neurons, we have them connected together in roughly the same way that the animal has, and they're organized in the same way in that there are some neurons that give out information and other neurons that receive information."
"We feel we've gone a long way down the road, but we still know that there's a lot that's been left out and there are a lot of assumptions -- at the moment it represents one point in a line of iterative improvements.
I'd say we're only 20 to 30% of the way towards where we need to get
Stephen Larson
"I'd say we're only 20 to 30% of the way towards where we need to get."
The project aims to digitally model the worm entirely in a virtual environment; creating a robot with an elastic body complete with stretchy muscles.
"Something with wheels that is rigid is an interesting application but it still falls short of reproducing the anatomy of the worm," Larson said.
He said the scientific road map is to model the worm completely, equipping it with the same physics right down to the cells in all the right places.
While the C. elegans nematode was chosen because of the simplicity of its biological structure, the complexity of the experiment has been such that the team has had to narrow down the project to just a third of the worm's neurons, restricting it to those parts of the worm's make-up that would display behavior.
The digital version of the worm will be released on the web in June this year, allowing anyone with an interest to tinker with the project.
Larson said the open source and collaborative nature of the project has been key to its success, allowing it to make fast progress over the four years of its existence.
So far, it's had input from more than 60 contributors from 15 countries, all of them bringing a unique take on the problems thrown up by the project.
The project has now split into various sub-teams, all of them dealing with different elements: one team is looking at the physical and mechanical model, while another is fleshing out the neurons and the muscles and their electrical models.
The great part of the open source experiment is that the team can take onboard left-field suggestions that push it beyond its boundaries.
"I'd say that this robot was just one of those left-field suggestions," Larson said. "A contributor was able to come along and re-use our material, put it up online.
"The fact that it caught so many people's attention was really a bit of a surprise."

Tourism revival?  After hitting rock bottom in 2008, Zimbabwe is experiencing a tourism revival, but visitors have yet to rediscover Great Zimbabwe.

Story highlights
Great Zimbabwe was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s
Zimbabwe is making a tourism comeback after hitting rock bottom in 2008
Visitors have yet to rediscover Great Zimbabwe, however, leaving it almost deserted
(CNN)
About halfway up the cobblestone stairwell, the screeching starts.
Loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop.
All around me, tree limbs shake.
It's just after dawn, and I'm alone, climbing the trail to the 15th-century royal compound on the hilltop at Great Zimbabwe in southern Africa.
Alone, except for the baboons.
Like all the stone structures here, the stairwell is open to the sky, but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that I can't see more than 10 feet in front of me.
Sure enough, around the next bend a baboon is waiting for me on one of the dozens of terraces that skirt the hillside.
We watch each other for a few moments until I'm certain he's not interested in me, and then I keep walking.
Baboons freak me out, but these moments are part of what makes Great Zimbabwe such an incredible place to visit.
Monkeys are often the only other visitors to the ruins.
Baboon standoffs
Unlike the world's more visited ruins -- which is basically every other ruin -- here it's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place, even if that means the occasional standoff with a baboon.
The stairwell leads to a narrow passage through a cleft in the rocky hilltop. Stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead.
They once would've extended even farther out over the stairs, but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned, bringing a wall down with it.
It's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex.
The old city, which was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s, stretches over 1,800 acres.
Essentially the hilltop functioned as a palace and cathedral, the center of political and religious power.
On the planes below, circular stone walls form a series of enclosures.
The most iconic, aptly called the Great Enclosure, is the largest pre-colonial structure south of the Sahara. The walls rise up 36 feet and stretch 820 feet around.
At one end, an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a conical tower, the most distinctive landmark in the old city.
I like the hill complex more.
Here the walls curve around each other and the granite boulders, which are incorporated into the design. Different chambers are linked by a labyrinth of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks.
At the far side is a chamber with a towering stone ledge that once held a small stone wall that acted like a balustrade.
Destructive treasure hunters
Like all the structures here, the stones were assembled without mortar.
Each layer was slightly recessed, creating a slope that held it all together. Over the centuries, some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters, or just by the elements.
The chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found.
Most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park, which is worth a visit if only to see them.
The image of a bird appears on the national flag, and is as much a symbol of Zimbabwe's national identity as the Statue of Liberty is to the United States.
A labyrinth of narrow passages snakes among the hill complex.
There's a good chance of being here alone.
Visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class, or the occasional park worker, but not many other visitors.
Tourism in Zimbabwe has been in a long and slow recovery.
In the 1990s, Zimbabwe was for a moment the most visited country in sub-Saharan Africa.
By the time the nation hit rock bottom in 2008, hardly any foreign visitors came.
Now major attractions like Victoria Falls are bouncing back, but places like Great Zimbabwe have fallen far off the radar.
The ruins are easily accessible by road, but it takes several hours from Harare or a full day from Johannesburg, so not many people make the effort.
But this is a place I love returning to.

An estimated 300,000 civilians are stuck in rebel-held areas around Aleppo
They are at risk of barrel bombs and warring militias and are short of food, water and fuel
Fierce battle under way for control of Handarat hill, on the road in to the rebel-held area
(CNN)
It is difficult to know at what point things of horror become forgotten and slip out of the world's view. Perhaps it is when they are eclipsed by another, seemingly more pressing crisis. Or when it becomes almost impossible -- for safety or other reasons -- for outside observers to bear witness to their daily toll.
Aleppo has, somehow, sometime between late 2012 when it was the open sore of the Syrian civil war, and today -- when the fight against ISIS has completely grabbed the world's attention span -- slipped off the radar screen.
But here is why it must not: there remain an estimated 300,000 civilians there, in rebel-held areas alone.
These are people who suffer any one -- or all -- of the following litany of afflictions daily: Barrel bombs -- randomly dropped, crudely made devices intended to maim, kill and terrify; warring rebel militia, also fighting with the regime; radical Islamic groups; shortages of food and water; people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel.
And above all a sense, for months now, of hopelessness that their world has only worsened since the fight for Aleppo began in June 2012. That their fight has been deemed by some to be so incurable and intractable that the outside world has left Aleppo to its own devices -- willing to help the winner, but not to assist a victory.
Aleppo is the greatest prize in the fight for Syria's north, but also its greatest victim. Aleppo, the biggest city, its commercial hub, its cultural heart, is a skeleton of what stood proudly merely three years ago.

Is this the site of Jesus' trial?
Joel Baden, special to CNN
Updated 1737 GMT (0137 HKT) January 6, 2015
Archaeologists say they've found evidence that Jesus' trial was held near the Tower of David in Jerusalem.
Joel Baden is professor of Hebrew Bible at Yale University.
(CNN)
Every few years, it seems, an archaeological find of major biblical significance is announced, almost always to do with either Jesus or King David. This week, it's Jesus, and it's a big one.
Just inside the western walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, beneath the tall Ottoman-era fortification known misleadingly as the Tower of David, archaeologists this week proclaimed the discovery of the site of Jesus' trial by Pontius Pilate, at which he was condemned to die by crucifixion.
More accurately: They proclaimed the opening to visitors (read: tourists) of the site, which has now been excavated and prepared for public viewing.
Without pinpointing the precise location, scholars have known for a long time that the trial must have taken place somewhere in this general vicinity -- despite the fact that tradition has put the spot of the trial on the very opposite side of the Old City, in the Antonia Fortress.
First, the background:
According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus' trial before Pilate happened in a place called the praetorium. Originally a term used to signify the tent of the general when encamped for war -- and thus the place where the important military decisions were made -- praetorium came to signify the palace or administrative center for very high-ranking officials.
In Jerusalem, this was the palace of Herod the Great, and according to ancient witnesses, it was at Herod's palace that visiting Roman prefects, like Pilate, would hold any necessary trials during their visits to the capital city.
These same ancient writers declared that Herod's Palace was in the western part of Jerusalem -- near the Tower of David.
On these grounds scholars have long doubted, indeed outright rejected, the notion that the Antonia Fortress on the northeastern side of the city was where the praetorium was located and the trial occurred.
This most recent announcement is being hailed as a blockbuster, in large part because the Antonia Fortress is the first station of the cross on the Via Dolorosa, the path that Jesus is thought to have taken from his trial to his crucifixion and burial at Golgotha, ending at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
The Via Dolorosa is an important pilgrimage site and a massive tourist attraction. But if its first station is on the completely wrong side of the city, then the whole thing is cast into doubt.
The Tower of David museum, which is housing the exhibit of the newly discovered trial site, is openly hoping to draw pilgrims and other interested visitors, and it is certain to get them.
What should not be overlooked, however, is that an important archaeological revelation about the life and death of Jesus was effectively kept under wraps for nearly 15 years -- the discovery of Herod's Palace beneath the Tower of David was first made in 2001 as part of a museum expansion project.
The timing of the announcement is linked entirely to the potential for tourist dollars, rather than to the remarkable historical and religious significance of the discovery on its own terms.
This may sound cynical, but it is par for the course, especially in Jerusalem, where the integration of history, religion, archeology, and tourism is at the very heart of the city's economy.
It is a safe bet that this discovery will not significantly diminish interest in walking the Via Dolorosa --customs and traditions are awfully hard to break, even with the best historical evidence.
What is more likely to happen is that there will be two sites of Jesus' trial, happily coexisting, just as there are two sites of Jesus' burial: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Garden Tomb.
Jerusalem, despite being riven by conflict, remains one of the most religiously pluralistic places on Earth, and that pluralism is nowhere better exemplified than in the sharing, duplicating, and often just plain old creating of religious sites.
From a scholarly perspective, however, it is nice that in this case, the significance for the tourism industry of an archeological discovery really does match up with its significance in history.
Better 15 years late than never.

He says the airline is an industry benchmark for best practice and has taken the lead in virtually every major advancement in airline safety over the past 60 years.
Rounding out the rest of the top 10 in alphabetical order are: Air New Zealand,  British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, Finnair, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.
"Our top 10 safest airlines are always at the forefront of safety innovation and launching new planes," says Thomas.
AirlineRatings.com's rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations as well as government audits and the airlines' fatality records.
It also examines airlines' operational histories, incident records and operational excellence.
Of the the 449 airlines it monitors, 149 have the top seven-star safety ranking.
This year, the site also included a list of the top 10 safest low cost airlines for 2015.
These are, in alphabetical order:  Aer Lingus (Ireland), Alaska Airlines (U.S), Icelandair (Iceland), Jetblue (U.S.), Jetstar (Australia), Kulula.com (South Africa), Monarch Airlines (UK), Thomas Cook (UK), TUIfly (Germany) and WestJet (Canada).
"Unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit audit and have excellent safety records," says Thomas.
"Low cost does not mean low safety."

One fatal accident for every 1.3 million flights
The release of the AirlineRatings.com list comes at a particularly sensitive time for fliers.
While 2013 was one of the safest years in global aviation history, 2014 is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities, due to several high-profile air incidents.
AirlineRatings.com says there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities in 2014 -- higher than the 10-year average.
However, looking to the positive there were only 111 crashes in 2014, the lowest number in more than 80 years says the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, or BAAA.
The last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927.
"If you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes, flying today is safer," says Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group.
"However, there are more aircraft in the sky, so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and, in some categories of disaster, higher."
According to a report on AirlineRatings.com , the world's airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights in 2014.
"Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5% of today's number," says the website.
"Another twist is that fatal accidents for 2014 were at a record low 21 -- one for every 1.3 million flights. Two of the crashes last year -- MH370 and MH17 -- were unprecedented in modern times and claimed 537 lives."
In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 aboard.
Officials believe that plane is somewhere in the Indian Ocean. But, nearly 10 months later, MH370 hasn't been found.
In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard.
Malaysia Airlines has a five out of seven ranking on AirlineRatings.com.
AirAsia Indonesia -- still reeling from the crash of Flight QZ8501, which went down over the Java Sea on December 28 with 162 people on board -- has a four out of seven star ranking.
Prior to December, AirAsia had a near flawless safety record, with no previous fatal accidents.
World's unsafest airlines
AirlineRatings.com says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically receive a deduction of one star, giving it a lower safety rating.
"A crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star deduction for 10 years from the date of the incident," says the website on a page explaining its ratings system.
Of the 449 airlines surveyed by AirlineRatings.com, nearly 50 have just three stars or less.
Four airlines only achieved one star for safety.
Two are from Nepal -- Tara Air and Nepal Airlines -- joining Kazakhstan's Scat Airlines and Afghanistan's Kam Air.
All four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the European Union .
The United States doesn't blacklist individual airlines, but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards.
