A member of the defence section at the Australian embassy in Thailand who allegedly crashed his motorbike into a Thai man and left him permanently paralysed has offered just $400 in compensation, according to the injured man's family.
In the June 14 accident, an Australian warrant officer riding an unregistered superbike collided with 62-year-old Suchart Rotkaew, according to an official police report into the incident.
The police report, seen by AAP, said the collision occurred in central Bangkok when the superbike struck Mr Suchart's bicycle.
Both parties were injured and unable to make statements. They were taken to hospital, the police report says.
The warrant officer cited the Australian embassy in Bangkok as his address.
Mr Suchart's son, Veerachon Rotkaew, told AAP his father would never be able to work again.
"The doctor said he had a brain haemorrhage," and had surgery to the left side of his brain.
"(His left) body, hands, feet, he can't move at all. He can only move on his right side of the body," Mr Veerachon said.
Mr Suchart worked as a security guard and owned a small garage.
Mr Veerachon said there had been little contact with the warrant officer since the accident.
"Fees for helping, the travelling expenses, they gave us 10,000 baht ($A400) for that," he said.
The family will have to rely on Thai social security to care for Mr Suchart. They had hoped funds would be available from insurance payments, but the Thai police report says the Australian's bike was unregistered, leaving in doubt any insurance claims.
A longstanding restriction on Australian military personnel in Thailand riding motorcycles was recently lifted despite Thailand's high record of motorbike accidents.
A Defence Department spokesperson said in an email Australian Defence Force members working at overseas posts must adhere to the local road rules.
"Defence generally does not place limitations on personnel operating any type of motor vehicle overseas, provided they meet host-nation licensing and other regulatory requirements for the vehicle they are operating," the spokesperson said.

Two men jailed for the murder of an Australian businessman in Bali have responded angrily after getting heavier sentences than the victim's wealthy wife, who planned the hit.
Adolf Malo Rangga and Martin Ngongo Bili have been sentenced to 15 years in jail for their parts in the murder of Robert Ellis, 60, in October last year.
Noor Ellis, his wife of 25 years, was last month jailed for 12 years for arranging five men to ambush her husband in their Sanur villa, and directing two maids to clean up the mess after his throat was slashed on the kitchen floor.
Mr Ellis' family slammed the lenient sentence, which the prosecution will not appeal.
Rangga hit back at the judges in Denpasar District Court on Monday, asking why they were punished more harshly.
Chief Judge Ahmad Peten Sili said he "should be grateful".
"You killed a man. A planned killing should be punished with death," he said.
"It's so easy for you to kill people ... You're dangerous.
"If someone told you to carry a bag of rice, that would be OK.
"But you were told to kill a man, and you were willing?"
Martin, meanwhile, sat alongside Rangga crying.
Their lawyer, Hari Purwanto, said he would consider an appeal.
The men were the last of the five to be arrested for the crime, after a manhunt on the island of Sumba.
Police alleged Martin made arrangements for the hit "starting from the strategy, finance and recruiting the killers".
Rangga's role, said police, was to hold Mr Ellis down while another man slit his throat.
Mr Ellis's body was found wrapped in plastic in a rice field.
His wife eventually confessed to involvement in the crime, telling police her husband had been unfaithful and withheld money from her.
Friends of the late businessman have since tried to straighten the record, saying his Indonesian wife was well provided for, and it was she who was the unfaithful partner.

An Australian who tried to help the family of a missing Bali girl, who was later found murdered, will reportedly help the police investigation into the family who adopted her.
The case of Engeline has gripped Indonesia since she was reported missing from her Sanur home in May.
Three weeks after a social media-led campaign to find her, the eight-year-old's body was found buried under the chicken coop of her home, clutching a doll.
Police first arrested a guard who worked at the house but have since named Engeline's adopted mother, Margaret Christine Megawe, a suspect, and are investigating other family members.
In the latest twist in the case, Margaret's daughter is being investigated for trying to extort an Australian man who responded to the missing girl campaign.
Indonesian media reports say Sydney man Chris Burn contacted Yvonne and was told kidnappers were demanding a Rp 150 million ($15,000) ransom for Engeline.
He became suspicious when the woman continued to ask for money.
Bali police intend to interview him on Wednesday.

A third person has died from injuries suffered in a water park explosion in Taiwan.
The 20-year-old man died shortly after being taken home on Monday morning from Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in New Taipei, the state-run Central News Agency reported.
He had arrived in hospital with burns to over 50 per cent of his body after the flammable powder exploded at the Formosa Water Park in New Taipei on June 27, The Apple Daily reported.
The accident has caused three deaths.
A 20-year-old woman and a 19-year-old man died last week.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare said late on Sunday that 282 people remained in intensive care, with 237 of them in life-threatening condition.
The cause of the explosion remains under investigation, according to New Taipei City Government.
Investigators said last week that the probe had focused on more than 40 cigarettes left at the scene.

Health officials say a 36-year-old foreigner who arrived in the Philippines from the Middle East is under quarantine after testing positive for the MERS virus.
Health Secretary Janette Garin said authorities were trying to trace 200-odd passengers who were on the same flight to Manila as the foreigner.
At least seven people who had close contact with the patient are under home quarantine.
The patient initially arrived in the Philippines from Saudi Arabia, but also stayed in Dubai before flying to Manila.
The patient's home country has not been disclosed.

Malaysia's prime minister is facing the risk of a criminal charge over allegations that millions of dollars were funnelled from an indebted state fund to his personal bank accounts.
The attorney general confirmed late on Saturday he had received documents from an official investigation that made the link between Prime Minister Najib Razak and the investment fund 1MDB.
The existence of the documents was first reported by the Asian Wall Street Journal on Friday, showing about $US700 million ($A916.71 million) were wired from entities linked to the fund into Najib's accounts.
The documents sent to the attorney general pave the way for possible criminal charges.
This is the first time a Malaysian leader faces criminal allegations.

New Zealand police say a mother and her three young children killed when a car was left running in a garage in Ashburton, on South Island, could have been dead a week.
Police believe Cindy George, 31, was checking the house for family and friends who were away, and started the car belonging to the house owner to charge the battery.
The garage door was closed, but the internal door connecting the garage to the modern air-tight house was open.
Relatives found Ms George in the hallway near the garage of the house in Tinwald on Thursday afternoon.
Her three children - Pio Scarlet Jetejura Raukete, five, Teuruaa Junior George, three, and Telyzshaun Gordon Ricardo Nelder Kruz George, two - were found sitting in the lounge with the television they were watching still on.
Police don't know exactly when they died.
"It could be a matter of days, up to possibly a week," Superintendent John Price, the Canterbury district police commander, said on Friday afternoon.
"We believe that what has happened here is simply a terrible accident."
Officers were trying to establish the family's movements and working to establish exactly what happened.
Toxicology samples had been taken, but those results won't be released for a few more weeks, he said.
Their bodies have been taken to Christchurch where post-mortems will take place on Monday.
"At that stage we'll have a better idea of the cause of death," Supt Price said.
The children's father, who was separated from Ms George, lives in Ashburton.
He is being supported by the community, Supt Price said.
The matter will be referred to the coroner.
There was no trauma to any of the deceased and there was no forced entry to the house, Supt Price said.
The car in the garage had run out of petrol and the battery was flat when emergency services arrived.

Researchers say rats that exercise daily just fly through their rat to-do-lists at a much quicker pace.

Some hard-working rats may have proven exercise is just what you need to stay on top of your work, researchers say.
In a new study from Otago University, psychologists have found lab rats that had one 20-minute session of exercise, five days a week, did significantly better in productivity tests than their couch-potato counterparts.
The study's author, psychology lecturer Kristin Hillman, said the exercised rats completed more tasks to earn food and did so more quickly and efficiently.
She said the test was a great way of demonstrating the importance of fitness on mental wellbeing for humans too.
"Links between exercise and occupational or educational achievement are starting to be noted in humans, but these links are largely correlations and can be riddled with confounding psychosocial factor," she said.
"By using an animal model we obviously eliminate such factors, and are able to demonstrate a causal relationship between regular exercise and generalised industriousness."
The study appears in US scientific journal PLOS ONE.

Murder-accused Napier man 'just too big'
A New Zealand man awaiting trial for murder says the whole thing is an "amazing romance" gone wrong.

At more than two metres tall and weighing 180kg, a former Napier councillor charged with murder was just too big to save his drowning wife, he says.
Peter Beckett, a Hastings-born 59-year-old is awaiting trial in Canada, accused of not only killing his wife, but also with trying to arrange the murder of five witnesses, including his wife's parents, a policeman who investigated his case and a lawyer.
Beckett's wife, Canadian school teacher Laura Letts-Beckett, drowned in August 2010 while fishing on Arrow Lake, 200km east of Kamloops, where the trial will be heard.
The man, described as having a booming voice with a thick Kiwi accent and calling himself "the real Mr Big", says it was all an "amazing love story" that ended in tragedy.
The pair met in 1995, while then-35-year-old Ms Letts was travelling New Zealand as a tourist.
Beckett was married with four kids at the time.
Sparks flew between the pair after a chance meeting, he told a local radio station.
"I'd had break-ups before, I'd fallen in love before but this was different than that."
Eight years later Beckett sold everything he owned and moved to Canada, with the pair marrying shortly after.
But the relationship turned rocky and they filed for divorce in 2007 after Mrs Letts-Beckett accused Beckett of abuse, although they reconciled later.
He claims he and his wife were fishing when a gust of wind blew an umbrella off their boat, causing her to fall overboard, and he tried to rescue her but failed because he was too big to stay submerged.
He ran to collect a rock to weigh himself down and later tried to resuscitate her on the shore, he said.
But the Crown says Beckett is a calculating killer who killed Mrs Letts-Beckett by shoving her off the boat.
Beckett has changed lawyers a number of times and alleges abuse of process, bias by police and court officials, and failure of the Crown to disclose documents.
"The [Royal Mounted Canadian Police] are financially given incentive to solve crimes," he told local newspaper Kamloops This Week.
"In this case, they tried to invent a crime that didn't exist. The RCMP want to get their man, even though there was no crime in the first place."
More than four years after Mrs Letts-Beckett's death a jury was picked for the Supreme Court trial from Kamloops, a town of 85,000 people, in January.
He was arrested in August 2011 and has been awaiting trial since.

The country's biggest newspaper, the New Zealand Herald, fell "sadly short" of highest professional standards in a story about the waitress who had her hair pulled by Prime Minister John Key, the media watchdog says.
In a newly released ruling, the Press Council says then-Herald columnist Rachel Glucina failed to properly represent herself to Aucklander Amanda Bailey, who anonymously complained Mr Key had tugged her hair on numerous occasions at her cafe.
Ms Bailey wrote on the left-wing Daily Blog complaining about the incidents in April, prompting an apology from the prime minister and a media uproar.
Shortly after, the Herald ran a story by Glucina revealing Ms Bailey's name and featuring photos and an interview with the waitress.
Ms Bailey complained she had been duped into doing the article, saying her employers, friends of Glucina's, had told her she was a PR consultant who would release a media statement for her.
The council said there was an "element of subterfuge" in what Glucina had done in not making clear to Ms Bailey she was a reporter and there was not enough public interest to justify it.
"The onus was on Ms Glucina as a professional media person to make the position completely clear to all parties, particularly to Ms Bailey, with whom she had had no previous contact, who was in a vulnerable position, and whose interests could well have been in conflict with those of the cafe owner's," it said.
The Press Council was concerned with maintaining the press in accordance with the highest professional standards, it said.
"The NZ Herald has fallen sadly short of those standards in this case."
The multiple complainants did not include Ms Bailey herself.
The Herald has denied the accusations of subterfuge and Glucina has since left the company.
It remains unclear whether Ms Bailey's employers knew the article would be printed in the Herald.

Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi considers Julie Bishop one of the ministers she is closest to, but they don't necessarily communicate through the media, her spokesman says.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir doesn't agree with the previous minister Marty Natalegawa's assessment that communication between the two countries has diminished with recent tensions.
"The Australian foreign minister is one of the closest with our foreign minister," he told reporters in Jakarta on Thursday.
Mr Nasir said the ministers had maintained a good relationship despite recent differences between the neighbours over the executions of two Australians and asylum-seeker boat policy.
"Both of them are women in a very tough global political arena, since the very beginning they have been communicating ... and it's still going on," he said.
At the ministerial level, Australia had sent condolences after Indonesia's military plane crash in Sumatra this week, and remained engaged at lower levels of government, too.
The dialogue wasn't always done in public, Mr Nasir said.
"Is it necessary that every time we have communication, we report it to the media?" he said.
He did not agree with the pessimistic view of Dr Natalegawa, who this week said the nations were at a "critical juncture".
"In a relationship, there's certainly ups and downs, that's a common dynamic," he said.
"We can't say it's at the lowest or not.
"The most important thing is the communication is still going on, it's running well.
"The co-operation in programs is also working.
"The most important thing is that there's good intentions from Australia and Indonesia to keep trying, improving, maintaining relations."
Mr Nasir believed the ministers' next meeting would be the East Asia Summit, due to be held in Malaysia in November.
Ms Bishop, too, disagreed with Dr Natalegawa's criticism, arguing communication was at an "all-time high".
However, Ms Bishop's response to Ms Retno's request for more information on claims a boat crew was paid to return to Indonesia last month did not contain a full explanation, according to Indonesia's ministry.
In March, Jakarta responded tersely when correspondence from Ms Bishop urging a stay of execution for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran went public.
The letter, which began "My dear Retno", offered to pay costs for the men to remain in prison for life.
At the time, Mr Nasir accused Australia of "diplomacy by media".
Indonesia executed the men in April despite the diplomatic efforts.

A bus carrying a group of South Koreans has fallen off a highway bridge in northeastern China, killing 10 people, officials say.
The accident took place on Wednesday after the vehicle left the northeastern Chinese city of Ji'an and was about halfway to its destination of Dandong, which borders North Korea, the official Xinhua News agency said.
The Ji'an government said on its official microblog that 10 people died, all of them South Korean.
Earlier state media reports had said two of the victims were Chinese.
South Korean officials said 26 South Koreans were on the bus as part of a 140-person delegation of mainly South Korean government employees.
They were in China to tour historical sites, including places where Korean independence fighters resisted Japan's colonial rule before the end of World War II, according to officials from the South Korean Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs.
The bus was part of a six-bus caravan, South Korean officials said.
Photos circulating online showed the bus resting on its top in shallow water under the bridge.

The two New Zealand journalists arrested by Israeli commandos off the Gaza Strip have returned home.
Maori Television journalist Ruwani Perera and cameraman Jacob Bryant were aboard the Marianne, which was part of a flotilla trying to break a blockade and deliver supplies to Gaza.
The ship was seized by the Israeli military on Monday as it approached the blockade, following several warnings to turn back.
On Thursday morning, Perera landed safely in Auckland Airport and was greeted by cameras.
A spokeswoman for Maori TV confirmed Bryant had gone to Paris to work on another project.
The pair had been questioned by Israeli authorities after their ship was brought to shore but were released shortly after.
The Israeli military said they did not use force to board the boat, calling it "uneventful".
The ship was part of the third "Freedom Flotilla" that included 19 journalists and activists from around the world.
The pair had been invited to join as media observers.
The three other boats in the flotilla turned back, activist group Canadian Boat to Gaza said in a statement.
Israel's blockade of Gaza is now in its ninth year.

New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully is being urged to take more decisive action over the deteriorating situation in Nauru.
New Zealand legal scholars, including Sir Geoffrey Palmer and former Attorney-General and Speaker Margaret Wilson, have joined a chorus of voices in condemning what's been called a threat to Nauru's democracy.
In an open letter to Mr McCully, the 29 scholars say it's "not tenable" for New Zealand to continue as the principal funder of Nauru's justice sector while democracy and rule of law are in such disarray, and basic human rights are being denied.
Last year, the Nauruan government forced the islands' then-only judge out of office and suspended most of the opposition from parliament indefinitely.
Local media are prohibited from speaking to the opposition and citizens have been stopped from accessing Facebook.
"The dismantling of an effective judicature, together with the silencing of the media, opposition and even ordinary citizens on Facebook means that the government of Nauru is now virtually immune from scrutiny of its actions," the letter says.
In a statement, Mr McCully said New Zealand is watching developments in Nauru closely.
"I plan to try and meet with Nauru government representatives next week," he said.

The death toll from the crash of an Indonesian air force plane packed with military personnel and their families has risen to 142, as witnesses described people fleeing the disaster zone covered in blood and with their clothes alight.
The Hercules C-130 transport plane crashed into a residential area of Medan on Tuesday, shortly after taking off from an air base in the city on Sumatra island.
Buildings were severely damaged, cars reduced to flaming wrecks and the plane itself was almost completely destroyed, with the mangled tail the only part of the 51-year-old aircraft still recognisable after the disaster.
Many of those on board the flight to an island off Sumatra, which was carrying 122 people, were believed to be servicemen and women and their families.
But the air force has repeatedly revised up the number of people on the plane - it initially indicated there were only 12 crew - raising questions about poor management and whether there were paying civilians on board in violation of military rules.
As more bodies were pulled from the rubble and taken to hospital, police put the total death toll at 142, indicating a growing number of fatalities in the neighbourhood where the plane crashed.
New witness accounts emerged of terrifying scenes, with one man describing how the plane flew low and then smashed into a building, producing "flames as high as four storeys".
"Everyone panicked and screamed," Tumpak Naibaho, a 27-year-old tyre repairman, said, adding there were hundreds of people in the area when the crash happened around midday.
"I thought it was a terrorist attack or something.... I saw one man whose clothes were on fire, staggering out of the debris. His face was covered in blood, dust and ash."
"I had never felt so scared in my life, I thought I was going to die," he added.
People in the area said several buildings were thought to have been destroyed in the crash, with officials saying that the plane hit a massage parlour and a hotel.
Rescuers were on Wednesday continuing to clear debris, which spread over a large area, helped by two earthmovers, as hundreds looked on.
One end of a three-storey building had been left in ruins, with the walls blown away, leaving only the soot-blackened interior visible. An overturned, destroyed car could also be seen among the debris.
An army officer involved in the recovery effort said many bodies were found in pieces.
Claims emerged that civilian passengers other than armed forces' families may have been on the plane to Bintan island, close to Singapore, and had paid to travel, with the Jakarta Globe reporting that the military was investigating the allegations.
The armed forces are not supposed to accept payments to transport people who are non-military personnel on their planes, although it is common for civilians to travel on air force jets to remote parts of Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands.
Officials were working to identify the victims so far recovered, with police saying that 62 people, mostly armed forces members, had been identified.
It is not clear what caused the crash but the aircraft asked to turn back just after take-off and the air force has said it may have suffered engine trouble.
