Holiday-makers are being evacuated back to the UK from Tunisia on special flights after a gunman killed 38 people at a beach resort.
Travel firms Thomson and First Choice confirmed that "a number of fatalities" and those injured are their customers and said around 2500 people will be brought back to the UK on Saturday.
At least five Britons have been confirmed dead in the attack in Sousse.
The holiday operators said all its trips to Tunisia for the next week will be cancelled.
"We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the friends and families of those involved in this tragic event," Thomson said in a statement.
"We are actively working with the families and friends affected to provide support in resort and a special assistance team is en route to Tunisia to assist our customers."
Thomas Cook said it has arranged for an additional aircraft to fly to Tunisia, which would be used to support its operations to accommodate customers wanting to return home as soon as possible.
The company is offering customers due to travel to Tunisia the opportunity to cancel or amend their holiday free of charge.
Downing Street said Prime Minister David Cameron will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee on Saturday morning and the government "will do everything we can to help those affected".
Attack killed 39 including foreign tourists
Militant group Islamic State claimed responsbility for the Tunisia tourist hotel attack on Friday that killed 39 people including Britons and Germans, according to a statement on a Twitter account.
"Our brother, the soldier of the Caliphate, Abu Yihya al-Kairouni, reached his target the Imperial hotel despite the security measures," the statement said. It said he had attacked a "bordel" and killed 40 "infidels'.
A gunman disguised as a tourist opened fire at a Tunisian hotel on Friday with a weapon he had hidden in an umbrella, killing 39 people, including British, German and Belgian tourists, as they lounged at the beach and pool in a popular resort town.
Terrified tourists ran for cover after the gunfire and an explosion erupted at the Imperial Marhaba in Sousse resort town, 140 km (90 miles) south of the capital Tunis, before police shot the gunman dead, witnesses and security officials said.
"This was always a safe place but today was horror," said an Irish tourist who gave only his first name, Anthony. "He started on the beach and went to the lobby, killing in cold blood."
The attack took place during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, on a day in which a decapitated body daubed with Arabic writing was found in France, a suicide bomber killed two dozen people at a mosque in Kuwait and at least 145 civilians were reported killed by Islamic State militants in northern Syria.
Islamic State claimed the Kuwait attack and had urged its followers to step up assaults during Ramadan but it was not known whether the Tunisian attacker was inspired by the group.
Rafik Chelli, a senior interior ministry official, said the gunman killed was a student, unknown to authorities and not on any watchlist of potential jihadists.
After pulling out a weapon hidden inside an umbrella, the assailant strolled through the hotel grounds, opening fire at the pool and beach, reloading his weapon several times and tossing an explosive, witnesses said.
A security source said another bomb was found on his body, which lay with a Kalashnikov assault rifle where he was shot.
Local radio said police captured a second gunman, but officials did not immediately confirm the arrest or his role in the attack.
"It was just one attacker," said a hotel worker at the site. "He was a young guy dressed in shorts like he was a tourist himself."

PM Abbott condemns overseas terror attacks
Prime Minister Tony Abbott says it's too early to say whether three overseas terrorist attacks were co-ordinated.
"Run, run run!"
It was the worst attack in Tunisia's modern history and the second major massacre this year following the Islamist militant assault on Tunis Bardo museum when gunmen killed 21 foreign visitors.
A health ministry statement said British, German and Belgian nationals were among the 37 dead. The health minister told French radio 36 others were wounded in the shooting.
Ireland's foreign ministry also confirmed at least one Irish citizen had been killed.
Tunisia, which has been hailed as a model of democratic transition since its 2011 'Arab Spring' uprising, is one of the most secular countries in the Arab world. Its beach resorts and nightclubs on the Mediterranean are popular with foreigners.
No one immediately claimed the attack. But Islamist jihadists have attacked North African tourist sites before, seeing them as legitimate targets because of their open Western lifestyles and tolerance of alcohol.
Irishwoman Elizabeth O'Brien, who was staying at a neighbouring hotel with her two sons, said there was panic on the beach when gunfire erupted.
"I honestly thought it was fireworks and then when I saw people running... I thought, my God, it is shooting," she told Irish radio station RTE. "The waiters and the security on the beach started to say 'Run, run, run!'"
Catastrophe
In Sousse, many tourists were already packing their suitcases into busses and checking out of hotels to leave after the attack.
German tour operator TUI said on Friday it was organising flights for tourists wishing to return from Tunisia and said those who booked Tunisian holidays for this summer could rebook or cancel the trips free of charge.
Sousse, alongside nearby Hammamet and the island of Djerba, is the heartland of Tunisia's most popular beach resorts, drawing visitors from Europe and neighbouring North African countries like Algeria.
Six million tourists, mostly Europeans, visited Tunisia's beaches, desert treks and medina souks last year, providing seven percent of its gross domestic product, most of its foreign currency revenues and more jobs than anything but farming.
"This is a catastrophe for the economy," Tourism Minister Salma Loumi said. "Our losses will be great, but the loss of human life was even greater."
Since its 2011 uprising to oust autocrat Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has been praised for its peaceful democratic transition bringing free elections and a new constitution seen as a model for the region.
But the country has also struggled with the rise of Islamist movements as ultra-conservative preachers took advantage of the upheaval and young democracy to take over mosques and spread their hardline message.
Several thousand Tunisian jihadists have left the country to fight in Syria, Iraq and neighbouring Libya, where some have set up jihadist training camps and promised to return to attack their homeland.
Islamic State made some claim to the Bardo museum attack, but authorities blamed possible splinter fighters from the Okba Ibn Nafaa, a brigade of al Qaeda-affiliated fighters, operating in the Chaambi mountains along the Algerian border.

Ten people have been killed at a market in northeast Nigeria when a girl thought to be aged just 12 detonated explosives she was carrying.
Hussaini Aisami, a relative of one of the injured victims and a health worker, said the blast, in Wagir, in the Gujba district south of the state capital Damaturu, killed 10 and injured more than 30.
"It was a suicide attack by a girl of around 12 years," said Hussaini Aisami.
"She went into the market and headed straight to the grain section. She detonated her explosives in the middle of traders and customers.
"Ten people died from the explosion. We brought 30 people to the hospital."
Tuesday's attack bore all the hallmarks of Boko Haram Islamists, who have used young women and girls in the past as human bombs and regularly attacked "soft" civilian targets such as markets.
On Monday, a girl thought to be aged about 17 killed at least 20 at a bus station near a fish market in the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, when the explosives she was carrying went off.
A girl about the same age was also killed nearby in a suicide blast but there were no other casualties.

Ten people have been killed at a market in northeast Nigeria when a girl thought to be aged just 12 detonated explosives she was carrying.
Hussaini Aisami, a relative of one of the injured victims and a health worker, said the blast, in Wagir, in the Gujba district south of the state capital Damaturu, killed 10 and injured more than 30.
"It was a suicide attack by a girl of around 12 years," said Hussaini Aisami.
"She went into the market and headed straight to the grain section. She detonated her explosives in the middle of traders and customers.
"Ten people died from the explosion. We brought 30 people to the hospital."

At least 15 people have been killed in clashes between Somalia's military and the Islamist terrorist group al-Shabaab.
Heavily armed al-Shabaab fighters attacked army bases overnight in the town of Afgoye in southern Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, 30 kilometres south of Mogadishu.
"We have lost a number of our soldiers, and several others were injured," a senior military commander, Ahmed Yare, said.
The al-Qaeda-linked militants briefly seized Afgoye's police station and a military base, but were soon pushed back by army and peacekeeping reinforcements, Lower Shabelle governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur Sidii told local media.
"Our troops received reinforcements from the African Union and other Somali troops in the area and repelled the militants," Sidii said.
"The people of the town were sleeping when a heavy battle erupted," Afgoye resident Siraaji Yusuf said. "It was fierce fighting, and I saw three Somali military vehicles destroyed near the police station."
Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack on the pro-insurgent website Somalimemo, claiming it killed more than 20 Somali soldiers and police officers.

The governor of the Diffa region in Niger says that an attack by the extremist group Boko Haram based in neighbouring Nigeria has killed 40 people in two villages.
Governor Yakouba Soumana Goah said on Thursday the attackers pillaged stores and burned homes in the early hours of the morning before withdrawing from the villages located near the border with Nigeria.
He added that the army went in pursuit of the attackers.
Boko Haram last attacked Niger in April and killed at least 58 people.
The Islamic group took control of a large swath of northeast Nigeria until a multinational force this year forced them out of towns and villages but it still engages in cross-border hit and run attacks.

The UN children's agency says at least 129 children were killed - with boys castrated and girls raped - during a government offensive last month in South Sudan.
UNICEF said the killings took place over three weeks in May in Unity state as the government battled rebels.
Speaking in New York on Wednesday, UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said survivors reported that boys were castrated and left to bleed out, while girls were gang raped and killed.
South Sudanese military spokesman, Colonel Philip Aguer on Thursday questioned the credibility of the report, saying it is not in South Sudanese culture to commit such atrocities.
He called for full investigations, saying whoever is responsible must face justice.
South Sudan has been fighting rebels led by the former deputy president since December 2013.

Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir flew out of South Africa on Monday in defiance of a Pretoria court that later said he should have been arrested to face genocide charges at the International Criminal Court.
By
Reuters
16 Jun 2015 - 6:37 AM UPDATED16Jun2015-6:37AM
Despite a legal order for him to stay in the country ahead of the ruling on his detention, the government let Bashir leave unhindered, with South Africa's ruling party accusing the ICC of being biased against Africans and "no longer useful".
Bashir has been indicted by the ICC over war crimes and crimes against humanity but South Africa gave him immunity along with all delegates attending an African Union summit in Johannesburg this week.
As an ICC signatory, South Africa was obliged to implement arrest warrants. The decision to let Bashir leave represented an affirmation of shifting diplomatic priorities for the government, with African interests trumping those of the West.
ADVERTISING
It also represented a blow for the Hague-based ICC, which has convicted just two minor African warlords since it started work in 2002 and has struggled to create accountability for those who are too powerful to be tried at home.
The veteran Sudanese leader flew out of the Waterkloof Air Base at around 1000 GMT, headed for Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
Hours later, judge Dunstan Mlambo found in favor of an application by a rights group calling for him to be detained, saying the failure to arrest him contravened the constitution.
"The respondents are forthwith compelled to take all reasonable steps to arrest President Bashir," Mlambo said.
Government lawyer William Mokhari said the home affairs department would be investigating Bashir's departure.
Bashir arrived in Khartoum to throngs of well-wishers and government officials inside the airport.
Wearing traditional white robes, Bashir waved his trademark cane greeting the cheering crowd in an open-topped vehicle. Waving the Sudanese flag, the crowd chanted God is Great and some carried pictures of Bashir with the banner 'Lion of Africa'.
Sudan's foreign minister Ibrahim Ghandour said Africa's enemies were behind the failed bid.
"The participation could have been normal and without a fuss, but Africa's enemies, Sudan's enemies and the enemies of peace-loving countries wanted to try and turn it into a drama, to prevent the president from important participations," Ghandour said.
Ghandour said the South African government had assured Sudan that Bashir's participation at the summit was a source of pride and that President Jacob Zuma had blamed opposition parties trying to embarrass Pretoria.
"This is a case of state sovereignty. Here we have a president elected and supported by his people. I don't have to point to the elections as I can simply point to this scene right here," he said referring to the boisterous crowd.
Bashir was re-elected in April in a vote boycotted by most of the opposition, thereby extending his quarter-century rule.
"LONG GAME"
The ruling provided fresh ammunition for Zuma's critics, who accused him of ignoring his own judiciary. The presidency and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
"It is completely unacceptable. The South African government has been complicit in assuring Mr Bashir is able to flee the country," Democratic Alliance Chief Whip John Steenhuisen told Reuters, calling for "heads to roll".
"Our international reputation lies in tatters," he added.
The ICC issued arrest warrants for Bashir in 2009 and 2010, accusing him of masterminding genocide and other atrocities in his campaign to crush a revolt in the Darfur region - a conflict that killed as many as 300,000 people, the United Nations says.
He has long rejected the court's authority, but the warrants have curtailed his ability to travel freely. Monday's ruling means that he will not be able to come back to South Africa.
ICC deputy prosecutor James Stewart said he was disappointed Bashir had managed to escape, but told Reuters he did not see it as a setback for the court, which was playing "a long game".
"I think that what happened over the past couple of days and in particular today, demonstrates that an ICC warrant of arrest actually means something and clearly the court in South Africa took that view," he said.
The US State Department said it was disappointed South Africa did not prevent Bashir from leaving Johannesburg.
Spokesman Jeff Rathke declined to say South Africa should have arrested Bashir but said "clearly, some action should have been taken".
The ICC and the U.N. criticized Pretoria for rolling out the red carpet for Bashir.
"The International Criminal Courts warrant for the arrest of President al-Bashir on charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes is a matter I take extremely seriously," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters in Geneva.
"The authority of the ICC must be respected and its decision implemented," Ban said.

Zimbabwe's central bank says banknotes from its old currency, which collapsed and was discarded years ago because of runaway inflation, can be exchanged for American dollars.
But 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars will fetch only 40 US cents.
That's a fraction of what collectors have been paying for the notes with numerous zeros for years.
Zimbabwe in 2009 abandoned its currency for a system dominated by the US dollar and the South African rand after inflation hit 230 million per cent.
Back then, even street hawkers refused to accept a $100 trillion dollar note that was issued.
Starting on Monday, stacks of Zimbabwean bills that might still be kept by Zimbabweans can be exchanged for US dollars.
The offer is part of what the central bank says is an overdue plan to phase out the currency entirely.
Some people in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, said they disposed of their Zimbabwean dollars long ago.
"I used it as garden manure," said Isaac Mutezowepasi, a street vendor.
"Why would I have kept that dirt?"
Others said they still have heaps of old dollar notes at home, but won't respond to the government offer.
"I am keeping them for my grandchildren to see. Plus I know I will get more for them in future because these Zimdollars are going to be in demand," said Tendai Nyaundi, a graphic designer.
On eBay on Friday, five banknotes of 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars were being sold for $US159 ($A205).
Another eBay post put five banknotes of $100 trillion at $US173.99.
There have been calls to re-introduce the Zimbabwean dollar by some members of President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party.
They argued that the use of foreign currencies is responsible for the country's current liquidity problems.
Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa has repeatedly said the US dollar "is here to stay."

Up to 30 Australians are thought to have travelled to South Sudan to join the civil war, all men who originally came to Australia as refugees .
South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war, but plunged back into conflict when the government split in 2013, attracting Australians to fight on both sides of the war.

South Sudan the new frontier for Australian foreign fighters
EXCLUSIVE: Up to 30 Australians are thought to have travelled to South Sudan to join the civil war, triggering fears their actions are potentially illegal and risk further dividing the community.
The NSW-based Community of South Sudanese and Other Marginalised Areas has condemned their actions, saying that community members were attending funerals most weeks for relatives killed overseas.
Chairman Emmanuel Kondok said the community could not support anyone taking part in the continuing cycle of violence.
"When it comes to the law they will have to face it individually, he said.
We do not support their actions. We are against what they are doing. We would rather they go and contribute to the development of the country."
His comments follow those by Chairman of the South Sudanese Community Association, Kot Monoah, who told SBS that choosing to participate in a foreign war is an individual choice and not a community choice.
"They must not fight wars overseas and choosing to do so comes with accountabilities," Mr Kot said.
"Choosing to fight a war for, or against, the Government is not acceptable."

Last month, Dejen Asefawwas rescued with hundreds of other migrants in the MediterraneanSea and brought to Sicily. The 24-year-old graduate fromEritrea, who endured forced military service and prison at home,hopes to be granted asylum in Europe.
But instead of applying for refugee status in thecountry where he landed, as European law dictates, Asefaw madehis way to just south of the Austrian border. He hoped tocross into Austria and travel through Germany to Sweden, wherehis brother lives. There, he planned to identify himself toauthorities and request asylum.
Waiting on a train platform a few days ago, the SouthTyrol's snowcapped peaks shining in the distance, Asefaw said itwas easy to avoid being registered in Italy. "No one forces youto give your fingerprints," he said, before explaining how hepaid people smugglers more than $5,000 for his journey toEurope. "Surviving the journey was a miracle."
Asefaw's journey north exposes one of the biggest flaws inEurope's approach to migrants.
A shipwreck that killed some 800 migrants in April promptedEuropean Union countries to triple funding for rescue missionsin the Mediterranean to help Greek and Italian authorities copewith thousands of arrivals each month.
To further ease theburden on southern countries, the 28-nation EU has proposedredistributing tens of thousands of migrants among its memberstates.
But while most of Europe agrees more needs to be done torescue people at sea, the EU is deeply at odds over how to copewith them once they are ashore - a divide that reflects both thedifficulties of European policy making and the rising tide ofanti-immigration sentiment sweeping the continent.
EU asylum rules, known as the Dublin Regulation, were firstdrafted in the early 1990s and require people seeking refuge todo so in the European country where they first set foot.
Northern European countries defend the policy as a way toprevent multiple applications across the continent. Some areupset with what they see as Italy's lax attitude to registeringasylum seekers. Earlier this year, French police stopped about1,000 migrants near the border and returned them to Italy.
Smaller round-ups happen daily in Austria, with migrantsreturned to the Italian side of the Brennero pass.
"Some countries do not work very well in registering asylumseekers and refugees," Stephan Mayer, a conservative Germanlawmaker who is part of Germany's parliamentary committee onmigrant legislation, told Reuters.
But Italy, which receives the bulk of seaborne migrants,says the law is unfair and logistically impossible. It wants amajor rethink.
"These rules are not rules that help us tackle the problem,because they leave Italy isolated," Italian Prime MinisterMatteo Renzi said of the EU asylum regulations on Sunday.
Italian officials say they are stepping up efforts tofingerprint all migrants and potential asylum seekers, butestimate that between a quarter and half of all those who landin Italy dodge the rules.
Part of the problem, says Fulvio Coslovi, a secretary forthe Coisp police union in Bolzano, is that it is not a crime inItaly for migrants to refuse fingerprinting, which is how the EUkeeps track of where someone enters the bloc. Police, therefore,do not typically force people to register. Coslovi said that thefailure to identify migrants helps Italy.
"Italy would like to rescue the migrants, but not take careof them," Coslovi said. "In other words, we want them todisappear."
Detention, force
In 2014, some 625,000 people sought asylum in the EU,according to the Eurostat agency. Just under a third,or 200,000, applied in Germany alone, while Sweden received81,000 applications, the highest number asa proportion of population. Sweden has 9.5 million people,Germany more than 80 million.
Of the more than 170,000 migrants who reached Italy by boatlast year, according to Eurostat, only a third sought asylumthere.
Most migrants give their fingerprints only where they wantasylum. In recent years, Syrians and Eritreans - the most likelyto be recognised as refugees in Europe - have either refused tobe fingerprinted in Italy or even burned their fingertips toavoid identification, according to an Italian policememorandum sent to local offices last year.
To try to address the issue, the European Commissionrecently proposed that the EU set up and help manageidentification centres in countries such as Italy and Greece,where the bulk of migrants arrive.
The EU plan recommendsallowing detention, the use of force, and ultimatelydeportation of those who refuse to be fingerprinted - a sharpcontrast to the open immigration centres that currently shelteralmost 80,000 in Italy. EU states are due to discuss theplan later this month.
Should the EU adopt stricter registration procedures, thenumber of people applying for asylum in southern countries wouldlikely rise, while those applying in northern states shouldfall. To help balance the burden, the commission wants toredistribute 40,000 Eritrean and Syrian asylum seekers in Italyand Greece across the EU over the next two years.
Some EU members oppose the move. Britain says it will notparticipate, while Poland is pushing for a voluntary system.
Italy criticises the redistribution proposal for being toolimited and temporary.
"The quotas must be only a first step, or it will becomeonly a stopgap measure," says Italy's undersecretary forimmigration, Domenico Manzione. "Migrants know the rules, andthe rules are no longer viable."
There appears to be little will among northern countries tochange the rules, though the Commission has promised to"evaluate" them next year.
"Good morning, welcome"
Every morning, dozens, and sometimes even hundreds ofmigrants arrive from Rome and spill out onto the platforms ofthe Bolzano train station, in the Adige River valley nearthe Brennero pass into Austria.
Bleary-eyed and dishevelled, men, women and children aregreeted by volunteers in several languages, including English,Tigrinya and Arabic.
"Good morning. Welcome," said an Italian volunteer as shedirected migrants one recent morning towards an area with water,sandwiches, fruit and basic hygienic products like hand wipesprovided by a local non-profit group.
Later that day, Asefaw and his 19-year-old fiancee NebyatMengstu jumped on a tightly packed train to the pass, where theyplanned to catch an international service bound for Munich.
Migrants filled an entire carriage and talked in hushed voicesas they rattled past the medieval castles that dot the valley.
Asefaw said he had tried to leave Eritrea once before, in2010. When he was caught at the border, he was jailed for sixmonths. He has a university degree in aquatic agriculture,he said, but was ordered to teach at school for about $5 permonth.
"It's not enough to survive," said Asefaw, who wore abaseball cap and carried a small backpack. In Sweden, he hopedto find a job and help his family at home. He also hoped tomarry his fiancee.
On the train, the two held hands. "We have shared a lot ofmiracles," Asefaw said.

A human rights inquiry says the Eritrean Government may have committed crimes against humanity, including torture and enforced labour.
By

A United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea has found systematic, widespread human-rights violations in the country.
It said those violations had been, and continued to be, committed with impunity under the authority of the Eritrean Gvernment.
United Nations Rapporteur for Eritrea Sheila Keetharuth said some of the violations may have constituted crimes against humanity.
She suggested that it wasn't surprising so many Eritreans were trying to flee their homeland and cross the MediterraneanSea.
"We seldom see human-rights violation of this scope and scale," she said.
"It is not surprising to us that, these days, a large proportion of those crossing the Mediterranean are Eritreans. They're fleeing a country ruled not by law, but by fear."
The report said the government enslaved its citizens through so-called national service that often was simply forced labour, arbitrary detention and torture.
National service typically lasted for 18 months, but the commission spoke to one witness who had fled after 17 years of forced service.
Witnesses also reported people being executed for trying to avoid being drafted into service as recently as 2013.
Ms Keetharuth said reports of slavery-like practices were so routine and widespread the commission could only conclude many of those practices were government policy.
"The report states that the main perpetrators are the Eritrean defence forces, the National Security Office, the Eritrean police forces, the Ministry of Information, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice, the Office of the President and the president," she said.
The United Nations established Eritrea as an autonomous region within Ethiopia in 1952 after colonial Italian rule and a decade of British administrative control.
A 1993 referendum led to a vote for independence, and Isaias Afworki had been the country's only president since then.
Since 2001, Eritrea had become a highly militarised society with mandatory conscription into national service - often of indefinite length - a mainstay of the government.
As a result of some of those government policies, Eritreans have been fleeing their country in large numbers.
The UN refugee agency placed the number of Eritreans who had come to their notice living outside of the country at more than 350,000 in mid-2014.
Many had lost their lives on dangerous land and boat journeys to other countries, seeking refuge abroad.
An Eritrean immigrant named Gavriel told Rueters that he had ended up in Israel, where more than 33,000 Eritreans had sought refuge.
"The thing that made me escape is because of the political persecution for the process that we did in the university," he said.
"I was being persecuted. I was in prison. Also, I was being also sent for punishment to the army. I was in the army for three years.
"It was clear slavery - I'm not working for my country or for my people."
Asaf Weitzen is with the Hotline Organisation, which supported refugees and migrants in Israel.
He said the report was a plea to the international community to do more to protect Eritrean migrants around the world.
"In order to run away, you cannot just go to the airport and buy a ticket and leave Eritrea," he said.
"They must leave illegally. And the Eritrean authorities see anyone who left illegally the state as a betrayer, as someone who's in opposition to the regime."
The United Nations is calling on the Eritrean government to stick to the 18-month draft period, urging Eritrea to implement and respect a military code improving conditions and prohibiting child soldiers and sexual harassment.
The commission had asked Eritrea for access and information during its inquiry but said it received no response.
There was no immediate response from the government to the report either.

South African athlete Oscar Pistorius will be released on parole on August 21 after serving 10 months of a five-year sentence for culpable homicide of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, authorities said.

The proposed release date, announced today, provoked an angry reaction from the parents of Reeva Steenkamp who Pistorius shot on Valentine's Day in 2013.
June and Barry Steenkamp say in a statement 10 months in jail isn't enough and doesn't send the right message or serve as a deterrent, but they say the family has forgiven Pistorius and don't seek to avenge their daughter's death.
The Olympic and Paralympic track star is behind bars in the capital, Pretoria, after being convicted in October after a seven-month trial.
The release of Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, had been largely expected under South African sentencing guidelines that say non-dangerous prisoners should spend only one-sixth of a custodial sentence behind bars.
A prison service statement said Pistorius would spend the remainder of his time under "correctional supervision", a form of house arrest.
Steenkamp, a 29-year-old law graduate and model, died on Valentine's Day in 2013 when Pistorius shot her through a locked toilet door at his luxury Pretoria home.
Prosecutors had pushed for a murder conviction, but the athlete maintained he fired in the mistaken belief an intruder was hiding behind the door, a defence that struck home with many in a country with one of the world's highest rates of violent crime.
The state won its bid to appeal the culpable homicide conviction and will seek a murder conviction when the case is heard in November.
Pistorius could face a prison sentence of at least 15 years if convicted of murder.

US actor Jack Black has been moved to tears by the plight of a 12-year-old homeless boy he met in Uganda.

US actor Jack Black has become visibly emotional after spending a day with a 12-year-old Ugandan boy who lives in extreme poverty and dreams of an education.
The actor travelled to Uganda to meet with children living in poverty as part of a Red Nose Day campaign.
There he spent the day with a 12-year-old boy called Felix who lives on the streets and collects plastic bottles to make money.
In a heartbreaking video of the pairs encounter, Felix tells the actor that his mother died and he did not know who his father was.
"Do you have brothers or sisters?" Black asks.
"Yes," Felix says. "But I dont know where they are."
He says his one wish is to go to school and get an education.
Later, Felix takes the actor to show him where he sleeps and Black is shocked by the conditions on the street.
"As you can see there is garbage everywhere, its totally unsanitary," Black says. "He's totally exposed to the elements and strangers, everywhere."
"It's unfathomable. This is not a place for a 12-year-old boy to be sleeping alone."
Felix tells Black that he doesn't want to keep living on the streets and wants to go with him to the US.
After the meeting Black is moved to tears as he speaks about Felix's plight. "I can't imagine my kids going through something like that and [Felix] is every bit as brilliant and sharp as any kid I've met," he says.

Egyptian court cancels Hamas listing as terrorist organisation

An Egyptian appeals court on Saturday canceled a ruling to list the Palestinian group Hamas as a terrorist organization, judicial sources said, signaling a possible easing of pressure on the Gaza Strip's ruling faction.

Hamas welcomed the decision by Egypt, which faces an islamist insurgency it says is fueled by weapons smuggled from Gaza. Hamas said the ruling would help relations with Cairo.
Hamas is an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood which the authorities have declared a terrorist group and have repressed since the army ousted one of its leaders, Mohamed Mursi, from the presidency in 2013.
Cairo has for many years played a central role in engineering ceasefires between neighboring Israel and Hamas, which dominates Gaza, including a truce reached between the sides in August that ended a 50-day war.
Egyptian officials say weapons are smuggled from Gaza into Egypt where they end up with militant groups fighting to topple Cairo's Western-backed government.
Islamist militants based in Egypt's Sinai region, bordering Gaza and Israel, have killed hundreds of police and soldiers since Mursi's political demise following protests against his rule. The insurgency has spread to other parts of Egypt, the most populous Arab country.
CRACKDOWN
The lawyer who first raised the case against Hamas told Reuters he would request that Egypt's Foreign Ministry place Hamas on its list of terrorist organizations, based on previous judicial decisions.
"This ruling does not return us to zero. I have two rulings placing the Brotherhood and the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades on the list of terrorist organizations," Ashraf Farahat said.
Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, was classified as a terrorist organization by Egypt in January.
The Brotherhood was banned in 2013 following Mursi's ouster as part of a crackdown including many liberal and secular activists.
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri welcomed Saturday's decision as "correcting a previous mistake".
"The decision today represents a commitment by Cairo to its strong role toward the Palestinian cause. There is no doubt that (it) will have positive results and impacts on the relation between Hamas and Cairo," he told Reuters.
Hamas had rejected previous judicial rulings, while the Brotherhood maintains it is committed to peaceful activism and rejects links to violence.
Separately, the trial of two Egyptian policemen accused of killing a lawyer in custody began on Saturday.
The case is a rare action against members of the country's security forces. Rights groups accuse the police of abuses, which the government denies.

Ghana petrol station blast, flooding leave 150 dead

An explosion at a petrol station in Ghana's capital and flooding caused by torrential rains killed around 150 people, President John Mahama said on Thursday, marking the worst disaster to strike the West African country in more than a decade.
By

Around 96 people who sought shelter from floods overnight at the state-owned GOIL (GOIL.GH) gas station near a busy downtown intersection were killed, authorities said. Thousands more were made homeless in the citywide flooding, officials said.
The incidents expose the weakness of Accra's infrastructure which has failed to keep pace with population growth after years of rapid economic expansion. It is vulnerable to storms that wreak havoc as poor drainage leads to flooding.
Witnesses said low-wage workers struggling home through the seasonal storm with roads closed and minivan buses not running were victims of the blast, the force of which gave few a chance to escape.
"It was an explosive fire and so the people sheltering at the filling station did not have an opportunity to escape," fire brigade spokesman Prince Billy Anaglate told reporters.
People were burned beyond recognition where they stood under the station's awning, or trapped and incinerated in the wreckage of cars and minivans on the station's forecourt.
A fuel leak at the station caused the accident that also destroyed nearby buildings, Mahama said, announcing three days of national mourning would begin on Monday as well as the creation of a 50 million cedis ($12 million) recovery fund.
It was Ghana's single worst disaster since more than 120 people died in May 2001 in a stampede at the national stadium during a football match, a police spokesman said.
Petrol on fire
One woman said she sought refuge at the station from floods that prevented her returning home from work, but quickly became alarmed by an overpowering smell of gasoline and moved to stand next to an adjacent bank building.
A power cut plunged the area into darkness and when a generator was switched on at the gas station to provide light people at first cheered, said Comfort Arhin, a domestic worker.
"We heard a pop. Then the fire was walking where the petrol was. Everybody was running. You had to fight for yourself. My bag fell inside the water ... All the people in the filling station died," she told Reuters.
Her testimony suggests Ghana's chronic power shortages, which have hurt businesses and angered voters, may also have been one cause of the accident.
Ghana is one of Africa's most stable democracies and for years its exports of gold, cocoa and oil made it one of the continent's fastest-growing economies.
But since 2013, it has wrestled with lower world commodity prices as well as a fiscal crisis, with growth this year projected to fall to below the average for sub-Saharan Africa.
Ghana's emergency services doused the flames and secured the area, pegging back anxious crowds. Rescue workers wearing face masks retrieved bodies and piled them onto a truck.
Mahama said he was heartbroken by the loss of life and blamed the floods partly on people building homes and businesses on the city's waterways, blocking drainage systems.
"This loss of life is catastrophic and almost unprecedented," Mahama said as he visited the scene. "We must sit down and strategise to make sure this doesn't happen again."
Opposition leader Nana Akufo Addo also visited the site and called it a "dark day in the history of the city".
