At least 27peoplehave died in an attack on twotourist hotels near the Tunisian coastal town of Sousse, about 150kmsouth of the capital, Tunis.
An interior ministry official has said that the foreigners are among the dead.
Gunshots were fired in the vicinity of the Marhaba Sousse Hotel, which is popular with Irish holidaymakers.
It isunderstood that one gunman entered the hotel at around noon and opened fire.
A security source at the scene said the body of a gunmanarmed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle lay where police had shot him dead.
Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told Mosaique radio that two hotels were attacked.
Local police moved tourists and locals to a safe area.
The Department of Foreign Affairs is liaising with Irish diplomatic staff in the region.
The Department is aware of an incident in Sousse, Tunisia. If you have any concerns for family members there, please call 01-4082000
Dublin woman caught up in attack
A Dublin woman in the Tunisian resort of Sousse described what she saw when the attack happened.
Speaking to RT's News At One, Elizabeth O'Brien said: "I thought it was fireworks and then I thought 'Oh my God' it sounds like gunfire.
"I ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and, as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started shouting 'Run, run, run'.
"We ran to our room, which is like a little bungalow, so we are actually trapped in our room, because we have no contact the phone here doesn't work to call reception.
"The consul from Madrid who is over Tunisia as well said it is a terrorist attack in the hotel next door.
"She told me to stay put, my travel agent said to go to the reception to speak to the rep, but I'm afraid, so I'm stuck here in the room with my two sons not knowing what's going on.
"The agent said the attack was isolated to the hotel next door. The consul told me it was a terrorist attack.
"I just ran as soon as I heard the noise, I don't know what's happening now I'm sort of cut off from the world."

A head covered in Arabic writing was found at a US gas company in southeast France this morning, after two assailants rammed a car into the premises, exploding gas containers.
Speaking from a European Union summit in Brussels, French President Francois Hollande described it at a terrorist attack and said all measures would be taken to stop any future attacks on a country still reeling from Islamist assaults in January.
One suspect had been arrested and was already known to French intelligence sources, Mr Hollande said.
"Two individuals deliberately rammed a car into the gas containers to trigger an explosion," a police source said.
Suspected accomplices have also been detained.     
It was not known whether the victim, so far the only known fatality in the incident that also injured two people, was decapitated before or after the car smashed into the building, or whether the victim had been on site at the time of the attack, or killed elsewhere.
"The attack was of a terrorist nature since a body was discovered, decapitated and with inscriptions," Mr Hollande told the news conference.
Police sources earlier said the decapitated body was found at the site, along with a flag bearing Islamist inscriptions.
Local newspaper Le Dauphine said the head covered in Arabic writing was found on a fence.
The French public prosecutor said its anti-terrorist section had been deployed to investigate.
France, which has deployed aircraft to the international coalition fighting Islamic State insurgents in Iraq, has long been named on Islamist sites as a primary target for attacks.
In April, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said no fewer than five attacks had been thwarted in the country since the Charlie Hebdo killings in January.
Then, Islamist gunmen killed 17 people in the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly and a Jewish food store.
Noting that hundreds of French nationals are in Syria where they risked being radicalised by Islamist fighters, Mr Valls said "never has the threat been so high".
The site belonged to Air Products, a US industrial gases and chemicals company, according to a spokeswoman for Air Liquide, a French company in the same sector.
It was immediately sealed off by police and emergency services.
The chairman and CEO of Air Products is Seifi Ghasemi, who in 2011 testimony to a US Senate committee described himself as Iranian-born.
Mainly Shia Iran is a sworn enemy of Sunni-dominated Islamic State. 
No group claimed responsibility for the attack and the motive was unknown.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was at the site in the town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, around 30km southeast of the city of Lyon.
French media said the government had ordered security to be stepped up around sensitive sites in the surrounding Rhone-Alpes region.

        <Description>The High Court in Belfast has backed British Prime Minister David Cameron's refusal to hold a public inquiry into the 1989 murder of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane.</Description>

Pat Finucane was shot dead in front of his wife and their three children in their Belfast home in 1989
The High Court in Belfast has backed British Prime Minister David Cameron's refusal to hold a public inquiry into the 1989 murder of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane.
Mr Finucanes death remains a lightning rod for anger over state collusion with pro-British paramilitaries.
The lawyer, who represented leading republicans in court, was shot dead in front of his family at his north Belfast by loyalists believed to have been acting in collusion with British security forces.
This morning, a judicial review rejected an appeal by Mr Finucane's family for a public inquiry into the shooting, saying Mr Cameron's 2011 decision not to hold one was lawful.
Mr Cameron instead commissioned an independent investigation, whose report was published in 2012.
The 2012 report severely criticised members of the British intelligence services and army and the Northern Irish police for colluding in the killing and covering it up.
The solicitor's family has long campaigned for a full independent public inquiry, but Mr Cameron insisted such an exercise would not shed any more light on the events.
He instead commissioned a review of the case papers by QC Desmond de Silva.
Mr de Silva's report detailed shocking levels of state involvement.
It included spreading malicious propaganda that Mr Finucane was sympathetic to the IRA; one or possibly more police officers proposing him as a target to loyalists; and the mishandling of state agents inside the UDA who were involved in the murder.
While Mr de Silva found no evidence of an overarching conspiracy by the authorities to target the 38-year-old lawyer, he said the actions of a number of state employees had "furthered and facilitated" the UDA shooting while there had also been efforts to thwart the subsequent criminal investigation.
As he accepted the report's findings in the House of Commons in December 2012, Mr Cameron reiterated an apology to the Finucane family and also pledged that the government would examine the review in detail to identify potential lessons.
Mr Finucane was shot dead in front of his wife and their three children inside their north Belfast home in February 1989.
The judicial review focused on a commitment made by the UK government at Weston Park in 2001 during peace process negotiations with the Government.
The Weston Park talks resulted in Canadian judge Peter Cory being asked to examine the grounds for public inquiry in a number of controversial Troubles deaths.
The British government said such inquiries would be implemented if the judge recommended that course of action.
Judge Cory subsequently did recommend public inquiries for a number of killings, including Mr Finucane's.
But while the government ordered inquiries into the other deaths, it did not give the green light for one in the Finucane case.
Speaking following the judgment,Minister for Foreign AffairsCharlie Flanagan said:"I note this morning's judgment in the judicial review and will be studying it closely. The Irish Government's position remains unchanged. 
"We continue to believe that an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, in line with the political commitments made by the British and Irish governments at Weston Park in 2001, should be honoured.
"This is a matter which the Government has consistently raised with the British Government. I raised it most recently with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers on 19 May, and the Taoiseach discussed the case with Prime Minister Cameron when they met in London last week.
"My thoughts at this time are with Geraldine Finucane and all the Finucane family, who have campaigned so tirelessly for more than a quarter of a century in pursuit of the full truth in the case of Pat Finucane, including the role of collusion in his murder."

        <title>Greece offered billions in funding to agree deal</title>
        <Link>http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2015/0626/710721-greece-euro-zone/</Link>
        <Description>The leaders of Germany and France have offered to release billions in frozen aid, in a last-minute push to talk Greece into contentious pension reforms in exchange for vital funding for Athens' until November.</Description>
        <MainBody>MORE RELATED CLIPS +
The creditors laid out terms in a document that went to Greece yesterday and was seen by Reuters news agency today.
It said Greece could have 15.5bn in EU and IMF funding in four installments to see it through to the end of November, including 1.8bn by Tuesday as soon as the Athens parliament approved the plan.
The total is slightly more than Greece needs to service its debts over the next six months but contains no new money.
A French source said Ms Merkel and Mr Hollande discussed outstanding differences on reforms Greece needs to accept - centred on pension reform, labour law and increasing VAT - as well as an extension to Athens' bailout programme and financing.
The German and French leaders both said Saturday's emergency meeting of euro zone finance ministers would be decisive to seal a deal before Greece has to make a key IMF repayment for which the government has said it lacks the money.
"Saturday's meeting is crucial because we are on the eve of a date, June 30, when the Greek authorities have to meet a payment obligation," Mr Hollande told a news conference.
"It's also crucial because there are parliaments that have to meet if there's a deal," he added.
The Eurogroup ministers will meet at 4pm Irish time on Saturday and Greece will be asked whether it accepts a revised offer from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, a euro zone official said.
Greece's commitment to euro zone 'absolute' - Varoufakis
Earlier,Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis saidGreece has a moral responsibility to reach agreement not only for his country but for the euro zone also.
Mr Varoufakis was speaking toRT's Morning Irelandas talks between the Greek government and international creditors remain deadlocked.
He said it was not a game of guessing chances and that Greece was obliged to find a viable solution for the benefit of the whole of the euro zone.
He said it is up to the institutions to now "come to the party".
Mr Varoufakissaid Greece are "debtors,representatives of the social economy in recession for the last seven years."
He said the Irish people knew very well about international creditors.
He said it was important for people to understand that the negotiations were being conducted between the member states and the international creditors - not among the member states themselves.
He said the Government had been kept in the dark about what Greece had offered and that if TaoiseachEnda Kennyand Minister for Finance Michael Noonanknew the details of the offer,theywould change theirperspective.
"If your finance minister and I were to sit down and I were to explain my proposals....Michael Noonan would agree that they are very reasonable" he said.
Mr Varoufakis described as "absolute" Greece's commitment to remain in the euro zone, adding that Greece had bent over backwards to accommodate what he described as the "strange demands of creditors".
He also said that he will not accept any debt solution he considers to beunviable.
He said Greece was asking to take debt from the pocket of the ECB and put it in the pocket of ESM in order to "even out a very spiky debt repayment schedule, so as to make it easier for us to make the repayments for the benefit of the creditors."

McDonald's lodged a 41-page objection over Supermac's plans to the office that oversees trademarks and designs in the EU
Fast food chain Supermac's has stepped up its battle with McDonald's to have its company name registered across Europe with Managing Director Pat McDonagh personally handing in a submission in Spain today.
Mr McDonagh travelled to Alicante to deliver a submission to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM), following moves by McDonald's to stop the Supermac's trademark being registered throughout Europe.
Supermac's operates over 100 outlets in Ireland and Mr McDonagh, a former schoolteacher who opened the first premises in Ballinasloe in Co Galway in 1978, said the company has received requests to open in 15 cities across Europe.
However, expansion plans have met with opposition from McDonald's, with the American fast-food giant lodging a 41-page objection to the OHIM, which oversees trademarks and designs.
Mr McDonagh has now responded to that objection by delivering Supermac's submission today.
"I am optimistic that common sense will prevail. Supermac's has traded successfully alongside McDonald's in Ireland and Northern Ireland for over 30 years and I don't believe this could be any different in other countries," said Mr McDonagh, who is in the process of opening eight new outlets in Ireland this year.
He based the name of the new business in 1978 on his nickname from his schholdays in Carmelite College in Moate, when he became known as 'Supermac' in deference to the Newcastle United and England footballer Malcolm MacDonald.
"I am confident that the true facts of Supermac's case have been presented clearly to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market today. Supermac's has long been regarded as a steadily growing business throughout its 37 years in existence.
"We are responding to demands coming from fifteen cities internationally for the opening of Supermac's restaurants," he added.

Accounts charged less than 1% interest were mainly related to distressed loans
New data shows that a total of 166 Irish Bank Resolution Corporation commercial loans accounts were charged an interest rate of less than 1%.
In a written reply to Fianna Fil finance spokesman Michael McGrath, the Finance Minister said IBRC's Special Liquidators confirmed that accounts with a rate of less than 1% were mainly related to distressed loans.
This was where the loan was restructured or where the borrower was in the liquidation or administration and the prospect of any future recovery was "remote".
Today's data from the Finance Minister also shows that 920 accounts at the bank were charged a rate of between 1-1.99% on their loans. These loans amounted to 399m.
The largest number of loans at the former Anglo Irish Bank - 2,729 - were charged interest rates of between 2-2.99% on loans worth a total of 7.232 billion.
920 saw rates of between 1-1.99% on loans worth 8.658 billion, while a further 1,568 were charged at rates between 3-3.99% on loans totalling 4.894 billion.
392 IBRC customers paid interest rates of 4-4.99%, while 271 paid rates of 5-5.99%.
Another 132 customers paid rates of between 6 and 6.99%, 67 paid interest rates of 7-7.99% while a total of 66 paid interest rates of over 8% on their loans.

        <Description>Two couples have cleared the first legal hurdle in their bid to challenge a ban on gay marriage in Northern Ireland.</Description>
        <MainBody>Friday 26 June 2015 12.59

Two same-sex couples seeking to overturn a ban on gay marriage in Northern Ireland have welcomed a judicial decision to let their case proceed.
A judge in Belfast High Court granted them leave to judicially review the refusal to legalise same sex marriage in the region.
Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane are taking the joint action.
They were, respectively, the first and second couples in the UK to enter into a civil partnership after Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to make that option available to same-sex couples in December 2005.
The Northern Ireland Assembly has rejected a proposal calling for the introduction of gay marriage on four occasions since, with unionists opposed to the move using a contentious voting mechanism to effectively veto it.
Neither couple was in court today when Mr Justice Treacy granted leave for a judicial review but their solicitor, Mark O'Connor, spoke on their behalf afterwards.
"On behalf of our clients we are delighted we have been able to get over the first hurdle in relation to the judicial process in that the judge today has granted leave for us to bring this judicial review," he said.
"We are thankful that the judge has made that decision today. We believe that religious policy and religious views should not be affecting public policy before the courts today and thankfully the judge today appears to have accepted there is an arguable case to answer for the (Stormont) departments and hopefully we will have success in the future in relation to this matter," Mr OConnor added.
Following the "Yes" vote in May's referendum on same-sex marriage in the Republic, Northern Ireland is now set to be the only part of the UK or Ireland where civil marriage is denied to gay couples.
Earlier this month, about 20,000 campaigners marched in Belfast city centre demanding a change in the law.
The case has been listed for a mention hearing in September.

Councillors have been told that the ESB would need planning permission to have the chimneys demolished
Efforts to have Dublin's Poolbeg chimneys listed as a protected structure are to be deferred to allow the ESB to carry out preservation work and further tests.
Labour councillor Dermot Lacey, who led the attempt to have the chimneys listed, saidhe will defer a motion that was due to be voted on by Dublin City councillors.
The ESB recently announced a 250,000 ten-year maintenance programme, which included repainting and steel capping to stop further deterioration.
ESB's Communications Manager Bernadine Maloney saidfurther tests will have to be carried out to assess the structural integrity of the chimneys.
A recent report to councillors from the Heritage Council stated that the chimneys are an "iconic" and "integral" part of the Dublin skyline with many references in popular culture.
There has not been any official recommendation on whether they should be added to the Record of Protected Structures.
The report also stated that brickwork had deteriorated because of moisture coming into the chimneys and that some of the outer concrete had become dislodged.
Confirming that a motion to have the chimneys listed will be deferred, Cllr Lacey said he believes the ESB is committed to saving them.
Councillors have been told that the ESB would have to apply for planning permission to have them demolished.

        <MainBody>Friday 26 June 2015 12.32
Last night a voluntary scheme of 60,000 migrants per country was reached
TaoiseachEnda Kennyhas returned to the EU leaders summit today after a fractious overnight session which focused on how to respond to the migrant crisis. 
The scale of the problem has been charted by the UN which says 63,000 migrants arrived in Greece by sea in 2015 so far, with a further62,000 arriving in Italy.
The European Commission had been pushing for a mandatory quota for each member state, but it ended-up being a voluntary plan due to strong opposition from Poland and other Baltic countries.
Last night during a seven hour debate it was agreedmigrants fleeing war and poverty in North Africa and the Middle East would be shared out, based on a voluntary scheme of 60,000.
An exclusion granted for Hungary, which earlier described the plan as absurd, as well as for Bulgaria, one of the EU's poorest countries. 
There are 40,000 Syrian and Eritrean asylum seekers now in Italy and Greece and another20,000 people outside the EU.      
"It was a very intensive debate," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters after the meeting ended.
Shedescribedthe migrant crisis "as the biggest challenge I have seen in European affairs in my time as chancellor".
Expressing his frustration, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described the plan as one of "modest ambition" and said at one point in the meeting he had told EU leaders "I don't give a damn" about objections to the plan's underlying methodology.
"We have to find out if the system works. It doesn't matter if it is voluntary or mandatory, it is whether it can help 60,000 refugees," Mr Juncker told a news conference in the early hours of this morning. 
However, the EU's chief executive had been hoping to set a precedent for Europe-wide action that limited national opt-outs. 
During the summit dinner, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi rebuked his fellow leaders for their reluctance to support a plan that was meant as an emergency response to the tragedy of 2,000 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean year but has been overshadowed by divisions, particularly in eastern Europe.
"If we think Europe is only about budgets, it is not the Europe we thought of in 1957 in Rome," Mr Renzi said, referring to the European Union's founding treaty.
The summit became so tense that a speech by British Prime Minister David Cameron served as an interlude to cool tempers, with the much awaited address to pitch for a new deal for Britain in the European Union reduced to barely ten minutes.
The mood was a long way from the unity showed by EU ministers in April immediately after the deaths of 900 migrants off the Libyan coast in a single weekend.
While the political deal was a breakthrough, implementing the plan still faces hurdles. The criteria to share migrants among member states must be decided by the end of July.
Such factors as the size of a member state's economy and population must be considered.
"There's much, much more argument to come," said one senior EU diplomat. "I don't yet see the full way forward."
The criteria system replaces unpopular proposals for mandatory quotas on each country, which Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and others fought against, arguing their ex-Communist economies still lacked the capacity to cope.
The debate has also strained the EU's commitment to its Schengen agreement on passport-free travel.
This week, Austria threatened to re-impose controls on its border with Hungary and Britain called for more security around the French port of Calais.
Britain and Spain want a bigger focus on returning migrants to their countries of origin.
Analysis: Europe Correspondent Paul Cunningham
The European Commission hasbeen pressing, and pressing very hard, for a mandatory deal  for each member state to be given a quota.
However,the ECwas pressed hard by countries in the Baltics, particularly countries like Poland who wanted a voluntary deal.
There were seven hours of talks, they were described as "fractious", "very heated", and at the end of it, it was decided it would be voluntary  countries would opt in to see what they take.
The deal which was agreed last night has noteven be printed, so still it is very early stages.
After it is printed,it will go to EU Justice Ministers in July who will complete the plan. Then we will have some idea how it works.

        <title>DA denies Irish pressure led to balcony inquiry</title>
        <Link>http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0626/710708-berkeley/</Link>
        <Description>The Office of the District Attorney for Berkeley in California has denied that it was pressurised by the Irish community to launch a formal investigation into the balcony collapse after local authorities said their involvement was over.</Description>
        <MainBody>MORE RELATED CLIPS +
In an interview with RT News, Ms O'Malley also said her office would be looking closely at previous lawsuits that had been taken against the developers and contractors who had built the Library Gardens apartment complex.
In relation to criticism about how the authorities had handled the investigation into the balcony collapse to date, Ms O'Malley said that her office had been monitoring the situation from the outset and decided to commence this investigation once the City of Berkeley local authority and police department had announced their involvement was over.
Her office confirmed there had been a lot of communication with members of the Irish community but there had been "no pressure" to launch an investigation as a result.
It is understood that legal representatives of some of those involved in the balcony collapse had contacted the DA's office in recent days and that there had also been communication on behalf of the Government following the news that the Berkeley authorities would not be pursuing the matter further.
The DA also said they would be closely examining the outcome of other lawsuits against the builders and water-proofing contractors and would investigate what action they had taken in other properties as a result of these lawsuits.
She said her investigation would be "thorough and exhaustive" and she was not setting a time-limit on it, although the statute of limitations for gross criminal negligence was three years from the date of the crime.
She said this was "an unusual case" and it was not something that a municipal police force like the Berkeley PD would normally handle.
The Berkeley city authorities had not carried out forensic or laboratory examinations on the wooden joists that had held the balcony in place, she said, but added that her department would.
She said she did not know what they would find during the investigation, adding there was a chance that there would be no grounds to bring a criminal prosecution.
She said that the investigation would be "going systematically from the very beginning right up until the tragedy happened".
She said they would start with how the construction occurred, pointing out that there were responsibilities not just to file plans with the local government but that inspectors also came to the site to make sure the builders were following the codes and had permits.
Ms O'Malley said they will be examining the practices of the developer and builders.
District Attorney O'Malley said it was interesting that there had been previous lawsuits filed against the developer - Segue Construction - for "similar types of situations" and that there had "certainly" been "some construction issues".
She said they would examine whether the outcome of these lawsuits served to put the developer or the contractors "on notice" that "what they were doing was dangerous", and that "they were creating a dangerous situation that could result in someone's death or serious injury".
Questions have also arisen surrounding the chain of custody of the collapsed balcony and the one itfell onto underneath, which was subsequently removed from the property as it was found to also have significant dry-rot and was considered a "collapse hazard".
At a Berkeley City press conference on Tuesday, officials said that they had already given the balconies and other related material back to the owner.
This would potentially cause an issue now that the DA has launched a full-scale criminal investigation.
However, Ms O'Malley confirmed today that the collapsed balcony remains in the possession of the Berkeley Police Department.
She said that the second balcony had been released by the Berkeley City local authority and made available to the owner, however before it was collected from the building where it was being held, individuals from the District Attorney's office had gone to that location and taken possession of the balcony.
It was now being moved, she said, from that locked facility to another secure location where the DA's Sheriff's Department would guard it.
Ms O'Malley also confirmed that her office had already contacted some of the injured people and the families of those who had been killed to inform them of the investigation and to discuss how her office could help with resources.
She said that she had a special victim-witness division in her office - the first of its kind in the US - and it was focused on working with those directly involved with this tragedy.
She said they would give them as much information as they wanted.
Ms O'Malley said that the hearts of those in her office were grieving with the families, especially as both she and her chief assistant Kevin Dunleavy had "strong ties to Ireland".
Her family members are originally from Mayo and Clare, Mr Dunleavy's are from Clare and Leitrim.
As District Attorney for Alameda County, she said would do everything they could for them and said she would "guarantee" that she would conduct a "thorough and exhaustive" investigation to determine whether not they could make a case and prove it in a court of law and hold those accountable who had caused the deaths and injuries.

Last night it emerged that there are at least two bodies in a grave uncovered in
Kevin McKee disappeared in 1972
Work resumes this morning on the recovery of human remains found in Co Meath yesterday during the search for members of the so-called Disappeared - people abducted, murdered and buried in secret by the IRA.
The remains were discovered during a search for Joe Lynskey, who disappeared over 40 years ago.
However, last night it emerged that there are at least two bodies in the grave.
Coghalstown is about 10km north of Navan.
Forty years ago the area was wild bog land, but it is now mainly farmland.
Since March,the Commission for the Location of Victims Remains has been excavating in the area looking for the remains of Mr Lynskey.
The former Cistercian monk disappeared in 1972 as a result of an internal IRA feud.
Yesterday, human remains were found and initially it was believed they were those of Mr Lynskey.
However, it emerged last night that more than one body is in the uncovered grave.
This means the remains may well be those of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee, who disappeared from Belfast a few weeks after Mr Lynskey, and were murdered and buried in the same area.
Lead Forensic Scientistand Investigator with Commission ,Geoff Knupfer,has said this islikely to be the case.
He said it was a huge relief that the bodies 'remained intact'.
Mr Knupfer said the bodies were found lying on top of each other.
He said he believed they may have originally been buried about a metre underground.
Mr Knupferadded that if it turns out that the remains are not those of Mr Lynskey, the search will continue for him in this location.
It may be several weeks before the bodies can be identitfied as post-mortem examinations and DNA analysis have to be carried out.
Family members of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKeehave arrived at the site.
Commenting on the discovery of the two bodiesMinister for JusticeFrances Fitzgerald said she hoped "the suffering of the families of some of those who were Disappeared over the course of the Troubles in Northern Ireland will now be eased".
In a statement Minister Fitzgerald said the Commission will continue to undertake the "humanitarian task" of working to find the "remains of those who have yet to be found".
Both the Commission and Sinn Fin president Gerry Adams have renewed their calls for those with information about other Disappeared to come forward.

        <title>Call for more inspections of private rentals</title>
        <Link>http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0626/710715-rental-inspections/</Link>
        <Description>Local authority figures obtained by RTÉ show just 6% of private rental property across the country were inspected last year.</Description>
        <MainBody>Friday 26 June 2015 07.32
'Paul' says when it rains he just waits for water to come through his ceiling
Local authority figures obtained by RT show just 6% of private rental property across the country were inspected last year.
There are currently around 303,000 rental properties, with just 17,700 of these inspected in 2014.
More than 50% of the accommodation inspected failed to meet minimum standards set out in the housing regulations.
In one example, Paul has been living for three years in accommodation that is in a state of disrepair and has been deemed a fire hazard by Dublin City Council.
He said: "Dublin City Council has been out to examine the conditions of the house and the environmental health officer said the housing conditions are atrocious. There is damp, mould, the ceiling is ready to fall in," he says.
"There is water coming down over the light so that's very serious. Dublin City Council was out to inspect that they have the report on that.
"Any time it goes to rain the first thing you're looking at is the light, it's just a matter of when that's going to go up on fire."
His landlord was given three months to repair the house but that time expired last week and no work has been carried out.
Paul says that if he is forced to vacate his property he will not be able to afford the soaring cost of rent in Dublin.
"My main concern now is that I feel I'm going to be left homeless after this".
"I've never lived in conditions like this even in my student days so as it stands now a middle-class working person is the new homeless," he says.
Local authority figures show that in Dublin 63% of dwellings inspected failed, in Cork city 26% of properties inspected did not meet the standards required, while in Kerry 32% of rented properties inspected failed.
Some of the county councils contacted by RT said they were not in a position to categorise the figures into minor and serious breaches of the regulations.
Dublin city was among the councils that did provide detailed figures, which showed that out of 3,500 inspections, 930 dwellings did not reach regulatory requirements and of these 65 legal actions were initiated.
In Waterford 90% of failures resulted from lack of proper smoke alarms and/or fire blankets, while in 10% of cases there were damp and mould issues.
Out of a total of 387 cases in Roscommon four of the breaches were categorised as serious while in Galway and Kilkenny most of the failures were due to minor breaches of regulations.
Housing charity Thresholds Chief Executive, Bob Jordan, has raised concerns about the low level of inspections.
"There is huge anomalies within these figures... for instance if we take the example of Cavan carrying out 800 inspections compared with Galway City Council, which really is one of the centres of the private rented sector, and theyre carrying out less than 150.
"So there's a real issue about the number of inspections that are been carried out.
"I think the other issue is around the quality of these inspections. The fact that Donegal carried out just under 600 inspections and found no properties to be substandard, Tipperary - 200 again found nothing.
"Nobody believes there is no sub-standard properties in those counties so there's a real question about what they're actually going out and looking at," he said.
Mr Jordan is calling for a certification scheme to ensure rented accommodation is up to standard: "I think the issue is this approach where local authorities inspected private rented properties was set up at a time when we had a very small private rented sector.
"Now one in five households live in the private rented sector and clearly local authorities in the main are not up to carrying out these inspections. So what we are saying is that the boot should be put on the other foot," he said.
"The responsibility should be on the landlord to prove that their property is up to scratch before a tenant moves in and that it would be the job of the local authorities that landlords have those certs because with the best will in the world local authorities are not going to get around to every single property."
However, the Residential Landlords Association is against a certification scheme - which it says would create another layer of bureaucracy for landlords.
"We're one of the most highly-regulated rented sectors now in western Europe. We're governed by a wide range of legislation and of course the private rented tenancies board is the overarching supervisory body of the rented sector.
"It's expensive for landlords to comply with regulations it is expensive for them to register with the PRTB as well as all of the other tax obligations they have."
He says the standard of rented accommodation in Ireland is high by international standards.
"I served on two international bodies and we routinely carried out comparative analysis of the standards and regulations applying to rented property in other jurisdictions and there is no question but we have been very high here.
"The figures listed by the local authorities don't surprise me but what is worth bearing in mind is that they include a wide range of issues bearing from the very minor to some quite serious."
"Many things that have been listed for improvement would be like dampness in a room or a fire blanket to be supplied but when told by the local authority to comply landlords are given three months to comply and by in large most of them do," Mr McNamara added.

        <Description>US President Barack Obama is expected to deliver the eulogy for the pastor that died in the mass shooting in South Carolina.</Description>

The president will be accompanied by both First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden to the funeral
US President Barack Obama is expected to deliver the eulogy for the pastor that died in the mass shooting in South Carolina.
Reverend Clementa Pinckney was a pastor at the Charlestons Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where the shooting took place.
He was among the nine people who died when a gunman opened fire during Bible study.
The eight other victims were named as Susie Jackson, 87; Reverend Daniel Simmons, 74; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59;Cynthia Hurd, 54; DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Sharonda Coleman Singleton, 45; and Tywanza Sanders, 26.
The first of the victims funerals took place yesterday, when Ethel Lance and Sharonda Coleman-Singleton were laid to rest.
The church is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the southeastern US and was founded by slaves.
The presidentwill be accompanied by both First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden to Reverend Pinckneys funeral in Charleston.
All three knew Reverend Pinckney personally.
During his presidency, President Obama has spoken at six memorial services for victims of mass shootings, in Texas, Arizona, Colorado and Connecticut.
Speaking at the White House last week, he said: "I've had to make statements like this too many times. Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times."
The president repeated his calls for tougher gun laws, a controversial issue in the US where the constitution guarantees the right to own guns.
The mass shootinghas sparked a dialogue across the southern states over the legacy of slavery and its symbols, centering on the Civil War-era battle flag of the Confederacy.
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and other Republicans have called for the Confederate flag to be removed from the State House grounds.
Some major retailers are removing merchandise with Confederate images from stores and websites.
The Department of Justice has opened a hate crime investigation into the shooting.
A 21-year-old white man, Dylann Roof, has been arrested in connection with the shooting. He faces nine murder charges and one gun charge.

Barack Obama told David Attenborough: 'I have been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time'
US President Barack Obama has turned interviewer for the BBC, in a special programme with naturalist David Attenborough.
Mr Obama and Mr Attenborough discuss climate change in the interview, to be aired on Sunday.
Climate change is one of Mr Obama's top issues for his remaining time in office.
"I have been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time," Mr Obama told Mr Attenborough.
It is the latest in a series of unusual media appearances for Mr Obama, who has been keen to tap almost any avenue that reaches as many people as possible to get his message out.
Last week, Mr Obama was interviewed by comedian Marc Maron for a viral podcast known as "WTF".
Earlier this year, he talked to green-lipstick-wearing comedian GloZell Green and other YouTube celebrities with huge followings.
To reach young people he wanted to sign up for Obamacare, his signature health care insurance program, he talked to comedian Zach Galifianakis for the web series "Between Two Ferns".
Mr Attenborough, 89, has been making television documentaries for 60 years.
The BBC has called him "the godfather of natural history TV".
Mr Obama's interview with Attenborough about climate change was taped on 8 May, and will air on BBC, BBC America and 20 other broadcasters around the world, a White House official said.
It comes as Mr Obama's administration is finalising rules to curb carbon emissions from power plants.
Mr Obama has pushed world leaders to agree to new targets at a summit later this year in Paris.
Mr Obama told Mr Attenborough that kids are "much more environmentally aware" than adults, citing his daughters Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, as examples.
"They do not dispute, for example, the science around climate change," Mr Obama said in the clip.
Mr Attenborough agreed that adults lose the fascination with nature that is common among children.
"A five-year-old, turning over a stone and seeing a slug, and says, 'What a treasure!' Kids understand the natural world," Mr Attenborough said.

        <title>Tests on BSE cow confirm it was an isolated case</title>
        <Link>http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0625/710650-bse-cow-results/</Link>
        <Description>The Department of Agriculture has said final tests on the recent suspected case of BSE found in a cow in Co Louth have confirmed that it was an isolated case in a single animal.</Description>
        <MainBody>MORE RELATED CLIPS +
The department also saidthe cow's mother and grandmother had also been tested and they too were found to be clear of the disease.
In addition, the department confirmed the integrity of the commercial feed supply chain to the farm on which the BSE cow was found.
It said between 2009 and 2010 more than 3,800 animal feed inspections and almost 2,500 feed samples were taken, including 52 from suppliers to the farm infected.
In all cases, the tests on the feeds were found to be clear of all signs of processed animal proteins and all tested negative for meat and bone meal.
The department will now inform the EU Commission and the World Animal Health Organisation of the findings of its tests.
It says it expects the health agency will reassign the BSE control risk status to Ireland as a result of this confirmation.
Reacting to the results IFA President Eddie Downey said consumers can be re-assured about the robustness of the food safety controls in place in Ireland.
He said:This and the high quality of Irish food has rightly reassured export markets from all over the world.
Meanwhile, ICSA President Patrick Kent warned that today's confirmation of a BSE case must not be used as an excuse to drive down price.
Farmers have seen a welcome tightening of prices in recent days, and meat processors cannot use this result, an isolated one-off case, as a stick to hammer farmers with," he said.

        <Description>The Alameda County District Attorney has promised the families of those killed and injured in the Berkeley balcony collapse that the case will be "thoroughly and exhaustively" investigated.</Description>
        <MainBody>MORE RELATED CLIPS +
Seven other students were injured in the incident.
Speaking at a press conference at her office,Ms O'Malley said the tragedy had devastated the Greater Bay Area and Ireland.
She said the DA's office would be the lead agency in this criminal investigation.
Ms O'Malley said she would be investigating whether there was cause to bring charges of criminal negligence in relation to the balcony collapseand whether there was enough evidence to prove those charges beyond reasonable doubt in a court of law.
She said she had 66 investigators at her disposal and she would also bring in outside experts.
She said her office would also be working with agencies from the State of California.
She said the City of Berkeley hada limited scope in terms of the investigationit had carried out but she could guarantee the families of those killed and those who were injured that she would carry out a complete investigation.
Ms O'Malley said she was happy that the city authority and the police department would be supporting her investigation.
In terms of evidence she said that the collapsed balcony was in police possession and the balcony from the floor beneath was in a secure location guarded by sheriffs.
She said there was no timeline on the investigation butany charges of criminal negligence needed to be brought within three years of the crime.
Despite having declared their examinations to be finished, the City of Berkeley local authority and the police department are now co-operating with the District Attorney's formal investigation.
The City of Berkeley local authority announced on Tuesday that its investigation into the tragic balcony collapse at the Library Gardens apartment complex had concluded. 
Its inspectors, it said, were satisfied that extensive dry rot was the sole cause of the failure of the wooden joists holding the balcony in place.
Meanwhile, the funeral of Lorcn Miller took place today while the funerals of Niccolai Schuster and Olivia Burke took place yesterday andEoghan Culligan and Eimear Walsh were laid to rest on Tuesday in Dublin.
The funeral mass forAshley Donohoe, a cousin of Olivia Burke, was held in California last weekend.
Two of the seven students injured in the balcony collapse have beendischarged from hospital. Two of the injuredremain in a critical condition in hospital in California.

        <Link>http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0625/710475-greece-talks/</Link>
        <Description>EU leaders spent two hours of unscheduled talks on the Greek debt crisis at their summit in Brussels yesterday, however, there was no breakthrough.</Description>
        <MainBody>MORE RELATED CLIPS +
Despite hours of talks between the Greek Prime Minister and international creditors, another meeting of the eurozone finance ministers, and two hours of talks with EU leaders, Greece is no closer to securing a deal on its debt.
EU officials said Mr Tsipras urged his fellow EU leaders to take responsibility and not leave Greece's fate in the hands of the International Monetary Fund, but they refused to intervene and argued the talks must continue to be conducted by finance ministers.
Later today Greek negotiators will resume contacts with the EU, IMF and ECB in a bid to narrow the points of differences on issues such as pensions, VAT and government spending.
If successful, eurozone finance ministers are prepared to return to Brussels on Saturday.
The head of the eurozone finance ministers group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, tried to strike a note of optimism when he said: "The door is still open for the Greek side to come with new proposals."
Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told reporters: We'll continue until we find a solution."
However, time is rapidly running out for these negotiations, and tempers are fraying.
Greece could default as early as Tuesday if it does not have the money to replay 1.6bn to the IMF.
Speakingon arrival in Brussels for theEU summit, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: "Clearly you are in the closing hours of making decisions here. It's in the red sector."
Asked whether Ireland, in principle, would support the continuing Greek demand for debt relief, the Taoiseach replied simply: "No."
Giving his view on yet another suspension of the eurozone finance ministers meeting this afternoon, Mr Kenny said it appeared there was "a complication about putting credible papers on the table.
"It is very important that the propositions, which are tabled, make economic sense and that they are financially sustainable and that they are fair."
Citing Ireland's example in negotiations with international creditors, the Taoiseach said: ".. we did not increase income tax; we did not increase VAT; and we did not increase PRSI. But we putup alternatives to those measure that were proposed."
Mr Kenny argued this Irish policy was put in place " in order to keep a pro-growth policy, and make our country competitive, and grow our economy, and provide jobs for our people."
Taking issue with the Greek proposals for higher taxes on people and companies, Mr Kenny said: "It's difficult to see the beneficial effect of measures that increase the tax on labour; that increase income tax; and that increase PRSI. These are not in the interest of pro-growth.'
He added: "Obviously that's what the [Finance Minister] discussions are about. But I think there is a frustration among the Minister for Finance that they don't have figures they can work off; and suggest better proposals that might be better in growing the economy of Greece and providing jobs for their people."
An Irish Government official clarified that the Taoiseach "continues to support debt reprofiling for Greece", in anydeal with its international lender.
The official cited Ireland's promissory note deal was an example of debt reprofiling "that can ease the burden of debt on taxpayers and give a small economy the space to grow".
Analysis: Europe CorrespondentPaul Cunningham
The hope is a deal can be concluded before eurozone Finance Ministers meet at lunchtime, but no one has any great confidence this new deadline will be met.
Yesterday, there was a cautious welcome to Greeces proposals but there were difficulties as far as some of the countries did not see it the same way. One person to look to is the German Finance Minister, and when he came to Brussels he said not much progress had been made.
It also appears that the IMF in particularhad major concerns on Greeces tax take measures.
The IMF is concerned that theyve heard previous promises from Greece and Greece before and tax collection has not worked out well.
The IMF does not believe Greece will raise enough in taxes to meet their targets and thats why the IMF is insisting on more cuts. However, for Syriza thats just not going to work  thats why the talks are deadlocked and thats why the Greek government say they remain firm in their positions.
