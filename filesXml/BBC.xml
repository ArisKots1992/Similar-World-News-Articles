        <title>France pushes for Greek bailout deal</title>

        <Description>France says it will do everything it can to help Greece reach a deal over its debt and remain within the eurozone, ahead of an emergency summit.</Description>
        <MainBody>What does Europe make of 'no' vote?
New demands
European finance ministers and officials gathered in Brussels told reporters they wanted to hear new proposals from Greece's new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, ahead of a full summit of eurozone leaders later.
Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said as he arrived: "The pressure is especially on the Greeks, the banks are closed and the situation is difficult. I guess the Greek government has an interest in coming up with serious and credible solutions soon."
European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici added: "On Sunday the Greeks gave their voice but there are also 18 other countries with a voice."
Peter Kazimir, finance minister of Slovakia - one of the countries with the highest exposure to Greek debt - said he was "sceptical" that a deal would be found, adding that debt relief was a "red line for my country".
What are the scenarios for Greece?
Mr Tsipras met Greek political party leaders on Monday to agree demands to reach a "socially fair and economically viable deal". According to Greek media, the demands include:
Securing liquidity for Greece's financial system
Credible reforms with reduced recessionary impacts
Strong programme for growth
Restructuring of Greek debt - that could mean writing some off and rescheduling repayments.
'No taboo'
In his comments on Tuesday, Mr Valls said the eurozone could not "take the risk of Greece leaving" - for economic as well as political reasons.
"There is no taboo subject when it comes to [Greek] debt," he told French radio.
Germany, which takes a tougher line, has warned against any unconditional write-off of Greece's debt, amid fears it would destroy the single currency.
Germany and France - two of Greece's major creditors - differ over how much they should bend to help Greece reach a deal
German economy minister and vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said: "The other 18 member states of the euro can't just go along with an unconditional haircut [debt write-off]."
The differences between the French and German stances on Greece reflect a fissure running through the EU, say correspondents.
Several eurozone countries - including Malta, Slovakia and Estonia - are owed significantly more by Greece as a percentage of GDP than Germany or France.
Analysis: Chris Morris, BBC News, Athens
With pressure growing on the Greek banking system, the eurozone summit will have to give a pretty clear signal that it thinks progress can be made.
But the two most important leaders in the eurozone, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande, appear to be struggling to find a common position on Greece in the wake of Sunday's "No" vote.
Broadly speaking, some countries - led by France - are pushing for a deal that will give Greece some breathing space to stay in the eurozone.
Others - led by Germany - are under greater political pressure at home, and wonder whether such a deal is possible.
It all leaves Greece in the most precarious position it has experienced in five years of wrenching economic crisis. The best that can be said is that it could go either way.
Meanwhile, the ECB said it would keep emergency cash support for Greek banks, which are running out of funds and on the verge of collapse, at the same frozen level - refusing requests for additional support.
It told the banks to lodge more collateral - or assets - with the Bank of Greece, reducing the amount of spare cash the banks have.
Capital controls have been imposed, with people unable to withdraw more than 60 a day from cash machines.
On Tuesday, Western Union said it was reactivating its Direct to Bank service to Greece, allowing funds to be transferred into bank accounts there from 31 countries.
The European Commission - one of the "troika" of creditors along with the IMF and the ECB - wants Athens to raise taxes and slash welfare spending to meet its debt obligations.
Greece's Syriza-led left-wing government, which was elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, said creditors had tried to use fear to put pressure on Greeks.

Tunisian TV ran footage from one hotel close to the attack
At least 27 people have been killed, including foreigners, in an attack on a beach near two tourist hotels in the Tunisian resort town of Sousse, according to the interior ministry.
Officials say one gunman has been shot dead and another is being pursued.
Sousse is a popular tourist destination.
Tunisia has been on high alert since March when militants killed 22 people, mainly foreign tourists, in an attack on a museum in the capital Tunis.
The interior ministry told the BBC "a terrorist attack" was ongoing.
Tunisia attacks: Live updates
A British man on holiday told the BBC that he heard the attack on a neighbouring hotel and saw a man with a pistol from his room, but did not know whether this was an attacker or a member of the security forces.
The holidaymaker said he and other guests had been told to take shelter in the hotel's staff quarters and have been told to wait for the all-clear.
One image circulating on social media appeared to show a man lying face down in the sand with what looks like blood around his head.

        <MainBody>France attack: Man decapitated in attack near Lyon

The site belongs to Air Products, a US-based firm
A man has been decapitated and several others injured at a factory in France in what President Francois Hollande has called a terrorist attack.
Two men drove into the Air Products gas factory near Lyon, officials said, before several explosions were heard.
One of the suspects, who was investigated by police in 2006, has been arrested.
The dead man was found with Arabic inscriptions on him and an Islamist flag was found near the site.
Live updates: France beheading attack
At a press conference from Brussels, Mr Hollande confirmed that two attackers had targeted the chemicals factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, crashing into it in a car.
"We have no doubt that the attack was to blow up the building. It bears the hallmarks of a terrorist attack," he said.
Referring to the terrorist attacks in and around Paris that killed 17 people in January, he said: "We all remember what happened before in our country. There is therefore a lot of emotion."
Mr Hollande said he would leave the EU summit in Brussels this afternoon and return to France.
Speaking from the scene, France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the suspect in custody has been under investigation between 2006 and 2008.
Mr Cazeneuve said the identity of the suspect was yet to be confirmed but that he was thought to be Yacine Sali.
"This person was under investigation for radicalisation but this investigation was not renewed in 2008. He had no police record," Mr Cazeneuve said.
Officials said the suspect in custody has been known to police since 2006
According to France's Dauphine Libere newspaper, a second suspect has been arrested at his home in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier.
He is believed to be the man seen driving back and forth past the factory before the attack occurred at around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), the newspaper said.
A spokesman for Air Products said: "We can confirm that an incident occurred at our facility in L'Isle-d'Abeau, France this morning.
"Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for."
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has ordered that security be stepped up at sensitive sites around Lyon.
Alain Juppe, the mayor of Bordeaux, took to Twitter to condemn the attack.
"The terrorist threat is at a maximum," he said, adding that France "must make every effort to protect its citizens".

        <MainBody>Syria crisis: Islamic State 'kills 120 civilians' in Kobane
26 June 2015
From the section Middle East
Many of the wounded were taken across the border into the Turkish town of Suruc
Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say.
IS "fired at everything that moved" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says.
Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled.
IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS "caliphate", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
'Women and children'
"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers," said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory.
He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey.
He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer.
The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes.
The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings.
Women and children were said to be among the civilians killed in the latest attack
Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms.
In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town.
Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added.
Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.
Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.

The mosque was packed at the time of the attack
At least four people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack on a Shia mosque in the Kuwaiti capital.
Many people were injured, and unconfirmed reports put the death toll much higher.
The blast hit during Friday prayers at the Imam Sadiq Mosque in al-Sawaber, a busy area to the east of Kuwait City.
An Islamic State- (IS) affiliated group said it was behind the attack. IS has carried out similar recent attacks in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
An Islamic State-affiliated group said it was behind the bombing
The governor of Kuwait City, Thabet al-Muhanna, told Reuters four people had died in the suicide attack. However, the AFP news agency said at least 13 people were killed. At least eight people were reportedly wounded.
A Kuwaiti MP, who saw the attack, said the mosque was packed with some 2,000 people when there was a loud explosion, Reuters news agency reported.
Footage posted online said to be from the scene of the attack showed men, some in blood-splattered clothing, walking around a smoke-filled room with rubble on the floor.
Al-Jazeera also reported that the Kuwaiti emir was heading to the scene of the blast.
Sunni-ruled Kuwait has a large Shia minority, which IS considers to be heretics.

        <MainBody>EU leaders agree to relocate 40,000 migrants
26 June 2015
From the section Europe
EU leaders holding late-night talks in Brussels have agreed to relocate tens of thousands of migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece.
Summit chairman Donald Tusk said 40,000 would be relocated to other EU states over the next two years.
However, there will be no mandatory quotas for each country.
The Greek debt crisis was also on the summit's agenda. Greece and its international creditors remain deadlocked after talks on Thursday.
Earlier, Mr Tusk called on EU member states to share the burden of the boat loads of illegal migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean.
'Modest' plan
New figures from the UN refugee agency UNHCR show that 63,000 migrants have arrived in Greece by sea this year and 62,000 in Italy.
"Leaders agreed that 40,000 persons in need will be relocated from Greece and Italy to other states over the next two years," Mr Tusk told reporters. "Interior ministers will finalise the scheme by the end of July."
Leaders also agreed to resettle another 20,000 refugees who are currently outside the EU. French President Francois Hollande said he expected most of them to be Syrians and Iraqis, AP reported.

Details of where the refugees will go has yet to be decided.
The scheme was made voluntary after some nations in eastern Europe refused to accept set quotas. The UK also opted out of the scheme, using one of its exemptions as agreed in the EU Lisbon treaty .
Hungary, which has seen thousands of migrants cross its border by land, and Bulgaria, one of the EU's poorest countries, have also both been granted exemptions.
This angered Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who called the plan "modest".
Italy has sought more help from its EU partners to handle the thousands of migrants arriving by sea, many of whom are fleeing war and poverty in countries such as Syria, Eritrea, Somalia and Nigeria.
More than three million people who fled the Syrian civil war are being housed in neighbouring countries - far more than the EU has taken in.
The migrant crisis has been high on the agenda for the EU summit, which opened on Thursday.
The final day of the summit on Friday is due to focus on security issues, namely the Ukraine crisis and tensions with Russia.
EU summit: Greece and migrants to dominate agenda
The relationship between Alexis Tsipras, Italian PM Matteo Renzi and Germany's Angela Merkel appeared jovial at the EU summit despite the deadlock
Meanwhile, the impasse in the Greek debt talks threatened to overshadow the summit, with two hours of unscheduled talks on Thursday.
Only once agreement on economic reforms is reached between Greece and its creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - will the final 7.2bn tranche of bailout funds be released to Greece.
Counting down to the default deadline
Fri 26 June: Final day of EU summit, although Greece is not expected to be high on the agenda
Sat 27 June: Greece meets Eurogroup creditors in Brussels in effort to reach a deal or face default on a 1.6bn (1.1bn) IMF loan
Sun 28 June: Absolute final deadline for a deal, says Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling
Mon 29 June: Day on which any agreed deal must be approved by Greece's parliament. German legislators also have to sign it off before funds can released for Greece to start repaying its IMF loan
Tue 30 June: Greece's current bailout expires and it should have paid back the IMF loan. This may prompt the ECB to reconsider its support for Greek banks
Wed 1 July: Day on which country would be in arrears with the IMF if it misses Tuesday's deadline. If so, it would be hard for the ECB to continue any support it is still giving to Greek banks
EU President Donald Tusk said European leaders are pushing for a weekend deadline for a deal to be reached, tweeting : "Another Eurosummit is not foreseen. Leaders expect the Eurogroup to conclude this process at their meeting on Saturday."
Cash-strapped Greece must make a 1.6bn (1.1bn) IMF debt repayment by Tuesday or face default and a possible exit from the euro.
On Thursday, a meeting of eurozone finance ministers also broke up without progress on the issue.
It was the fourth time in a week that the Eurogroup had met in an attempt to prevent a Greek debt default. They will meet again on Saturday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that meeting would be "decisive" in finding a solution.
IMF head Christine Lagarde said lenders had been presented with a counter-proposal by the Greek parties "at the last hour" on Thursday and needed more time to assess it, Reuters reported.
Also during Thursday's talks, UK Prime Minister David Cameron outlined his plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
Mr Tusk said EU leaders should consider British concerns but "only in a way that is safe for all of Europe".
Greek debt talks - main sticking points
Greece has refused to accept cuts to pension payments or public sector wages
The IMF is pushing for deeper spending cuts, not just more tax rises
A key point of friction is a special benefit paid to some low-income pensioners, which creditors want scrapped
Creditors also want a wider VAT base; Greece says it will not allow extra VAT on medicines or electricity bills, and has also resisted calls for VAT hikes on hotels and restaurants
Athens wants a concrete commitment to debt relief, something its creditors are not offering

        <MainBody>US spy chief James Clapper says China lead suspect in cyber hack
26 June 2015
From the section China
James Clapper is the highest ranking US official to publicly implicate China
China is the "leading suspect" in the massive hack of a US government agency holding the personnel records of millions of Americans, US intelligence chief James Clapper has said.
He is the highest-ranking US official to publicly implicate Beijing since news of the data breach emerged.
China always dismissed suggestions that it was behind the hacking.
The statement comes after three days of high-level talks in which China and the US agreed to a "code of conduct".
"China remains the leading suspects," said Mr Clapper at a conference in Washington DC, but "the US government continues to investigate" he added, according to his office.
Background to a "massive" hack in five points
On 5 June the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said more than four million employees, retirees, contractors and job applicants may have had their personal data compromised
Some reports have put the number at 14 million or higher - this remains unconfirmed
The OPM first became aware of the breach in April
Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the hackers were believed to be in China
It's not the first attempt: In March 2014 hackers breached OPM networks - an intrusion blamed on China - but the attempt was blocked
China military unit 'behind prolific hacking'
At the Washington talks where cyber security was a top priority, US Secretary of State John Kerry said there was a need to work with China to develop a "code of conduct" on state behaviour in cyberspace - Chinese representatives had agreed with these conclusions.
"It's something that we agreed needs to be addressed and hopefully it can be addressed soon," State Department spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday.
China has said any suggestion that it was behind the hacking is "irresponsible and unscientific".

Many people are still stranded in the worst-affected Amreli district
Authorities in India's Gujarat state say incessant monsoon rains have caused widespread damage to public and private properties.
Air force helicopters have been dropping food in affected areas after more than 70 people were reported to have died in flood-related incidents.
More than 10,000 people have been moved to higher ground, including 1,000 who were airlifted to safety.
India regularly witnesses severe floods during the monsoon season.
Heavy rains have triggered house collapses in the worst-affected Saurashtra region with some reports saying these are the worst floods in 90 years.
The coastal district of Amreli is the worst affected, where more than 600 villages have been affected.
Farmers are among the worst hit with crops over a large area damaged, Gujarat Health Minister Nitin Patel told BBC Hindi's Ankur Jain in Ahmedabad.
Rescue and relief work is on, he added.
Indian air force has been carrying on rescue operations in Amreli district
Rains have caused widespread damage to public and private properties
The defence ministry said on Thursday that air force helicopters carried out 23 sorties to drop food packets to those stranded.
There have been reports of lions coming out of their habitat in the Gir forest in Junagadh - the only home to Asiatic lions - which has also been hit by rains.
Meanwhile, flood warnings have been issued in Indian-administered Kashmir state where floods killed about 300 people last year.
The Jhelum river in the state's main city of Srinagar was flowing above the danger mark, reports said.
In the northern state of Uttarakhand, authorities have halted pilgrimage to Kedarnath and other Hindu holy sites due to heavy rains.
India receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September.

Al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack
At least 30 people have been killed after gunmen attacked an African Union military base in southern Somalia, witnesses say.
A suicide car bomber drove into the main gates of the base in Leego, along the main road connecting the capital, Mogadishu and the city of Baidoa.
The militant Islamist group al-Shabab says its fighters have taken control of the base but this is not confirmed.
Al-Shabab is battling Somalia's government for control of the country.
The base is manned by Burundian soldiers from the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), which has more than 20,000 troops in the country.
Amisom confirmed on its Twitter account that an attack was ongoing, but has not given any details on casualties.
Leego residents have seen militants burning vehicles, carrying off weapons and removing the bodies of their fighters killed in the attack, reports the BBC's Mohamed Moalimu from Mogadishu.

        <MainBody>Chinese shares tumble more than 7% amid Asian losses
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Mainland Chinese shares plunged on Friday as investors began to show concern about another wave of new listings absorbing liquidity in the market.
The Shanghai Composite closed down 7.4% at 4,192.87 points.
However, shares of Guotai Junan Securities - China's third-largest brokerage - jumped 44% on its debut after raising $4.8bn (3bn).
It was the country's biggest initial public offering since 2010.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed down 1.8% at 26,663.87, with investor sentiment hit by the share fall on the mainland.
Sentiment was also hit by a crackdown on margin trading and concerns over whether the government would continue to ease policy in order to boost growth in a slowing economy.
Regulators have been cracking down on illegal margin financing and urging brokerages to tighten rules.
However, Bernard Aw, market strategist at trading firm IG, said the "correction" in the market was healthy in the longer term and was also what the central bank wanted to see.
"It is probably not a bad idea to repeat my view that China's leaders still view a strong capital market as beneficial for the Chinese economy. More importantly, a stable bull market is desired," he said in a note.
Japan data weighs
Shares in Japan ended lower after government data showed a mixed picture of the world's third-largest economy, which seems to be struggling to gain momentum.
Household spending rose 4.8% in May from a year ago to mark the first annual increase in more than a year, a sign that consumers are finally spending again after last year's sales tax rise.
But core consumer prices rose 0.1%, still well below the central bank's target of 2%.
The Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.3% at 20,706.15.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.3% in May from April, in line with expectations.
Marcel Thieliant, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said Friday's data cast doubt on the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) upbeat view on the economy and consumer spending.
"With increasing signs that the economic recovery is faltering, we think the BOJ will have to step up the pace of easing before too long, perhaps as soon as October," he said.
Takeover talk
In Australia, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed down 1.6% at 5,544.60.
Shares of supermarket giant Woolworths rose 3.9% after reports that US private equity firm KKR would bid to take over the struggling retailer.
South Korean shares were bucking the trend, with the Kospi closing up 0.2% to 2,090.26.
The benchmark index ended four straight weeks of losses this week.

26 June 2015
From the section Africa
An Islamic court has sentenced nine people to death for insulting the Prophet Muhammad in the northern Nigerian city of Kano.
The accused, who were all Muslims, had pleaded guilty, the head of Kano's religious police, Aminu Ibrahim Daurawa, told the BBC.
The trial was speedily done in secret after a section of the court was burnt down by angry protesters last month.
It is not known if they will appeal against the sentence.
The alleged offence was committed last month at a religious gathering in honour of Sheikh Ibrahim Niasse, the Senegalese founder of the Tijaniya sect, which has a large following across West Africa.
The nine, eight man and a woman, were reported to have said that "Niasse was bigger than Prophet Muhammad", triggering unrest.
The venue was burnt to the ground by an angry mob and the nine were arrested,
"There has been consensus among Muslims scholars that insulting the prophet carries a death sentence," Mr Daurawa told the BBC Hausa service.
"We quickly put them on trial to avoid bloodshed because people were very angry and trying to take law into their hands," he added.
Kano has a predominately Muslim population and Islamic courts operate alongside secular courts.
BBC Kano reporter Yusuf Yakasai said people celebrated in some parts of the city when news of the judgement emerged.
Tijaniya at a glance
The Sufi sect of Tijaniya was founded in Algeria in 1784 by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tijani.
It spread all over the world, with large following in north and west Africa. It also has followers in South Africa, Indonesia and other parts of the world.
There are other Sufi sects in Islam but Tijaniya is the largest.
They have three main daily practices: Asking the forgiveness of God; sending prayers to the Prophet Muhammad and affirming the Oneness of Allah.
Senegalese-born Sheikh Ibrahim Niasse was credited with reviving the sect in the 20th Century. People travel from across the continent to visit his shrine.
They have several factions including the Haqiqa (Realist) group, whose leaders were convicted accused of blasphemy in Kano.
Several states in predominantly Muslims northern Nigeria have introduced Sharia law after the country returned to civilian rule in 1999.
This is the first time a death sentence has been handed down for blasphemy in northern Nigeria.
The sentence has been delivered for other offences such as adultery but none has been carried out.

        <MainBody>Indonesia seeks to quieten noisy mosques during Ramadan
26 June 2015
Mosques are particularly active now during the holy month of Ramadan
Indonesia has set up a team to investigate complaints that its mosques are too noisy.
Hussein Abdullah, vice president of the country's mosque council, told the BBC the team gathered samples of noise from places of worship in about 10 cities.
They found loudspeaker volumes set too high, the call to prayer broadcast at different times and sermons at hours there shouldn't be any, he said.
There are approximately 800,000 mosques in the country.
They become particularly active during the holy month of Ramadan, which began in mid-June.
Mr Abdullah said part of the problem was that mosques were competing with one another at such loud volumes that "Muslims couldn't focus on what was being broadcast".
He said the authorities would appeal to mosques to ensure they were only heard in their immediate area and not beyond.
"They should agree on the time and duration. Say for the morning there's a prayer for 5 to 7 minutes, then the call to prayer. That's enough. Don't broadcast a prayer loudly from 4 o'clock in the morning," he said.
The new team would complement a previous initiative, which saw around 100 groups of technicians deployed across the country to help fine-tune mosque loudspeakers and give advice on how best to arrange speakers to reduce noise, the AFP news agency reported.
"This is not to limit the freedom to pray. We just want to manage the noise, so the sound that comes out of mosques is more harmonious and soothing and people can pray better," Mr Abdullah said.

Conroy has been out since he was 16
Baseball has welcomed its first openly gay professional player, in a minor-league game in California.
Pitcher Sean Conroy, 23, took the mound for the Sonoma Stompers after agreeing to come out publicly in time for the team stadium's gay pride night.
The team is part of the independent Pacific Association of Baseball Clubs.
Several baseball players have disclosed their sexual orientation while in retirement but Conroy is thought to be the first active player to do so.
New Yorker Conroy joined The Stompers from college in May and had already told his team-mates and coaching staff he was gay, said general manager Theo Fightmaster.
"His goal has always been to be the first openly gay baseball player so he was very much in favour of telling the story, of carrying that torch," he said.
Major League Baseball historian John Thorn said he thought Conroy was the first active professional to come out.
Both Glenn Burke (Oakland Athletics and LA Dodgers) and Billy Bean (Detroit Tigers, LA Dodgers and San Diego Padres) did so after they retired.

Conroy told his family he was gay when he was 16 and he said it was important to be honest with his new team-mates, especially when conversation turns to girlfriends.
"Instead of getting the different looks or questions when I didn't join them, I'd rather tell you the truth and let you know who I am and have real conversations instead of the fake ones," he said.
Some Stompers will wear rainbow-themed socks or symbols to mark the occasion, the club has said.

        <MainBody>Univision dumps Donald Trump over Mexico remarks
25 June 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
Donald Trump with Miss Connecticut Erin Brady in 2013
US television network Univision says it is cutting ties with businessman Donald Trump and ending coverage of the Miss USA beauty pageant, which he co-owns.
The network, one of the largest US Spanish-language broadcasters, said it follows the hotel tycoon's disparaging remarks made about Mexicans.
Mr Trump said Mexicans brought drugs and crime to the US, during his announcement last week to seek the Republican presidential nomination.
He is now threatening a lawsuit.
In his speech last week, Mr Trump said of Mexico: "They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting."
In announcing the breakup, Univision said that his words were "insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants" and said it would not air the Miss USA pageant on 12 July. The company also said it would be severing all business ties with the celebrity businessman.
Mr Trump has said his remarks were a criticism of US lawmakers, not the Mexican people or their government. He has also said that if Univision follows through with its decision it would be in breach of a contract that "has no termination rights".
"We intend to pursue all legal rights and remedies available to Mr Trump pursuant to the terms of the licence agreement as well as a defamation case against Univision," lawyer Michael Cohen said.
Mr Trump also accused the Mexican government of pressuring the network into "laying down".
"They want to silence Donald Trump. And Donald Trump can't be silenced," Mr Trump said in reference to himself.
"Of course I have a signed contract: five years, they have to pay me almost $15m [9.5m]," he said in an interview with the Fox News television network.
Univision has not commented on these remarks.
Singer J Balvin has withdrawn from both broadcasts
Cristian de la Fuente, one of the two co-hosts who pulled out of the programme, said: "It's a shame that such an important institution as Miss USA is now in the hands of a clown."
While English-language television network NBC has the primary broadcast rights to the spectacle, Univision was - for the first time - going to simultaneously air the event in Spanish.
Colombian singer J Balvin was set to give a performance that would air on both broadcasts, but has withdrawn from the event.
NBC plans to air the programme despite Univision pulling out.

        <Description>Louisiana Republican Governor Bobby Jindal's US presidential campaign launch becomes the subject of online mockery.</Description>
        <MainBody>Bobby Jindal presidential bid sparks Twitter mockery
25 June 2015
From the section India
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal announces his candidacy for the 2016 Presidential nomination during a rally at the Pontchartrain Center
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's announcement that he is entering the Republican presidential race has become the subject of online mockery.
Mr Jindal launched his campaign with a call for a uniform US identity, saying he disliked Americans being identified by origin, ethnicity or wealth.
The hashtag #BobbyJindalisSoWhite began trending on Twitter after the launch.
The tweets poked fun at Mr Jindal's speech and alleged attempts to distance himself from his Indian heritage.
"We are not Indian-Americans, African-Americans, Irish-Americans, rich Americans, or poor Americans. We are all Americans," he told supporters.
Also a subject of ridicule was the fact that Mr Jindal railed against allowing "people to immigrate to this country so that they can use our freedoms to undermine our freedoms".
He added it was incumbent on migrants entering the United States to be "ready and willing to embrace our values, learn English, and roll up your sleeves and get to work".
The presidential hopeful had begun his speech with the words: "Forty-four years ago, a young couple who had never been on an airplane before left their home on the other side of the world to come to a place called America."
Indians online were not amused by the remarks.
The original hashtag #bobbyjindalissowhite was started by Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu , with a series of tweets. Following the success of the tag he said it was the most "satisfying thing" he had ever done.
Others chimed in, like Aasif Mandvi from the Daily Show.
The hashtag was also picked up in India, where it was among the country's top trends for much of the day.
Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Louisiana
Gopinath Gopalam, a healthcare professional from Baton Rouge, travelled to New Orleans to watch Bobby Jindal make his presidential announcement on Wednesday. Although Gopalam hails from India, he says the governor's Indian ancestry is of little importance to him. What matters, he says, is what his success says about the US.
"It's an open economy, open community," he says. "Anybody can come here and have the skill and ability they can rise to the top."
The focus on Mr Jindal's ethnicity in recent media coverage has angered many conservatives. In particular, they point to a Washington Post article that featured a quote from a Louisiana University professor who said "there's not much Indian left in Bobby Jindal".
"For years, liberals have attacked Governor Jindal for not being brown or Indian enough for their liking," Mr Jindal's office said in a statement. "Governor Jindal is proud of his heritage. He believes we need to stop fixating on race and hyphenated Americans."
Mr Jindal, who was born Piyush, told CBS news that he changed his name to Bobby after a character in US sitcom The Brady Bunch.
He also converted to Catholicism from Hinduism while he was at school.
A report in the Washington Post said many Indian-Americans who were among his first supporters are now disillusioned with what they see as efforts by Mr Jindal to distance himself from his roots.
"So what if he's Republican? So what if he's Christian? I don't care about those things, But you can't forget about your heritage. You can't forget about your roots," one of his first donors Suresh C. Gupta was quoted as saying.

        <Description>The US Supreme Court has handed President Barack Obama a major victory by upholding a key portion of his landmark healthcare law.</Description>
        <MainBody>Obamacare subsidies preserved in US Supreme Court ruling
25 June 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
The US Supreme Court has upheld a key portion of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, preserving health insurance for millions of Americans.
In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue.
The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy.
Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law.
"We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America," Mr Obama said.
The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court.
Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens.
The decision sparked celebrations outside the court in Washington
The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so.
In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it.
In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law.
"Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion.
Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday.
Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable.
Analysis - Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor
The stakes could not have been higher.
People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake.
Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3.
I bet "No-drama Obama" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is.
Obama defies lame-duck expectations
Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning.
Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted "If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."
"This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country," said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. "The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land".
"Today is a good day for healthcare in America," said activist Benton Strong. "I hope this is the end of the line."
Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence.
Demonstrators added tape that read "still covered" to their signs after the decision was announced
Media staff sprinted with the news from the court to colleagues outside
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others.
"We should start calling this law Scotuscare" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. "Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard of."
Congressional Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undo the law.
House Speaker John Boehner said that they will continue their "efforts to repeal the law and replace it with patient-centred solutions that meet the needs of seniors, small business owners, and middle-class families".
Following the enactment of the ACA in 2010, states were given the option of establishing their own healthcare exchanges - online marketplaces for citizens to buy health coverage.
Citizens in states that refused to establish exchanges could shop for coverage on a federal exchange.
Rep Steve Scalise described the ACA as a "dismal failure" and vowed to continue fighting it
In the court, opponents argued that a phrase included in the law, "established by the state," meant the federal government could only provide subsidies to people in states that set up their own exchanges.
However, most Americans receiving subsidies purchase healthcare through the federal exchange, after many states decided not to set up their own marketplaces. Only 13 states and Washington DC have set up their own exchanges.
The Obama administration argued that was a too-narrow reading of the law, which spans nearly 1,000 pages, and the rest of the legislation makes clear subsidies are intended for those who meet income requirements, regardless of which exchange insurance was purchased from.
Obamacare by the numbers
citizens in 37 states depend on federal subsidies to make healthcare affordable
only 13 states and Washington, DC have established their own exchanges
over 10m people have purchased coverage through one of the new exchanges - federal or state
on average, the federal government provides a $272 (173) monthly subsidy
Source: Reuters
The upholding of the law cements President Obama's biggest legislative victory. Limiting the subsidies could have unravelled Mr Obama's signature healthcare reforms.
Republican Congressional leader Steve Scalise said he was disappointed with the ruling and would work to have the law "repealed and replaced," echoing near-universal Republican sentiment.
"It does not change the fact that Obamacare has been a dismal failure for millions of Americans who have lost the good healthcare that they liked, and are paying more for the plans that they have," Mr Scalise said in statement.
Meet the Supremes

The first of the funerals for victims of the Charleston church shooting have been held in the South Carolina city.
The services for Ethel Lee Lance took place after a viewing at a Baptist church in North Charleston.
Ms Lance, 70, worked for the church for 30 years and was a mother of five.
The funeral for Sharonda-Coleman Singleton, 45 took place at another Baptist church. She was a speech therapist, pastor and high school track coach, as well as a mother of three.
Their funerals were the first two of nine, with five more to take place on Friday and Saturday. The families of two of those who died have not yet released details.
The nine worshippers were shot dead at a bible study group at an African-American church last week.
Ethel Lance worked for the church for 30 years
Reverend Jesse Jackson, Mayor of Charleston Joe Riley and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and US representative Mark Sanford were in attendance at Lance's funeral.
"She can be a symbol for love," said Lance's grandson Brandon Risher. "Hate is powerful but love is more powerful."
Security was high at the funeral, with police standing guard and checking bags as hundreds of people filed in.
Members of Mother Emanuel church stood and said: "Sister Lance, we are here! Mother Emanuel, we are here!"
Reverend Jesse Jackson and Reverend Al Sharpton were present at Ethel Lance's funeral
Funeral attendees released doves at Lance's funeral
At Singleton's funeral, hundreds of mourners filed past the casket at Mt Moriah Missionary Baptist Church. Police officers surrounded the church and surrounding roads.
On Friday, President Barack Obama will give the eulogy at a service for Rev Clementa Pinckney, 41, who was the pastor at the Emanuel AME church. Vice-President Joe Biden will also attend the service.
Both Mr Obama and Mr Biden were friends of Mr Pinckney, who was also a state senator in South Carolina.
His remains were taken to South Carolina's State House in Columbia on Wednesday, where his coffin will lie in state until Friday's service.

        <MainBody>New Brazil delegation travel to Venezuela after 'bus attack'
25 June 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Senator Requiao met Lilian Tintori, the wife of jailed opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez
A group of Brazilian senators has travelled to Venezuela to try to promote dialogue between the country's government and opposition.
More than 40 people have been killed since last year in street protests.
Most of the senators in the delegation are close to Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and support Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
Last week, a delegation of opposition Brazilian senators said their bus came under attack in Caracas.
The group, which included former presidential candidate Aecio Neves, said it had to flee the country after landing in Caracas because their bus was stoned by government supporters.
The Venezuelan authorities have denied involvement in any violence.
The Brazilian government delegation arrived in Caracas on Thursday and said it would talk to all sides.
"Brazil has a duty to identify and promote conditions for dialogue and the reduction of aggression, which has been a feature in Venezuela's democratic process," said Senator Roberto Requiao, who is leading the mission.
'Against the arrest'
The senators later met Lilian Tintori and Mitzy Capriles, the wives of jailed opposition politicians Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma.
They have also met former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles and will hold talk with government officials.
"In Brazil we are in principle against the arrest of anyone taking part in the political process," said Mr Requiao, who is leading the delegation.
But the senators are not planning to visit Mr Lopez or Mr Ledezma, who were arrested last year after being accused of inciting violence during anti-government protests.
The visit comes at a crucial time in Venezuelan politics. Earlier this week, the government announced that parliamentary elections would be held on 6 December.
Delays in setting a date had drawn criticism from the opposition.
The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) of President Nicolas Maduro currently holds a majority of seats.
Venezuela is facing a major economic crisis, which the opposition blames on 16 years of mistaken left-wing policies.
The government accuses the opposition of sabotaging the economy and inciting violence to topple President Maduro.

26 June 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Ms Murillo suffered some injuries and burns but she is recovering well
A young mother and her baby have been found alive five days after their plane crashed in the jungle of western Colombia.
A Colombian Air Force chief described their survival as "a miracle".
Maria Nelly Murillo, 18, and her one-year-old son were found by rescuers near to where their small Cessna plane crashed in Choco province.
Ms Murillo had some injuries and burns while her baby appeared to be in good health.
Contact lost
The twin-engine Cessna, which was carrying fish and coconuts, had been flying from the town of Nuqui on the Pacific coast to Quibdo, the capital of Choco.
Stories of miraculous plane crash survivals
Baby Yudier Moreno was held by a rescuer on the flight back to Quibdo
It disappeared from the radar of the civil aviation authorities 20 minutes into the flight. A search plane eventually found the wreckage in the Alto Baudo region.
The reason for the crash is not known. The pilot of the Cessna was found dead in the cockpit.
Glimmer of hope
There was no trace of Ms Murillo or her baby, Yudier Moreno, which the passenger list said had been on board.
But according to Col Hector Carrascal of the Colombian Air Force, rescuers took hope when they noticed that the cabin door was ajar.
Search and rescue aircraft found the wreck of the plane. The cause of the crash is unclear
"It could have opened on impact, but it could have been opened from the inside," he said.
"We didn't have a clue what had happened to them: they could be lost in the jungle trying to survive or they could have died already."
Part of the search party searched the area on foot, while others flew in a helicopter using a loudspeaker to shout Ms Murillo's name and urge her to return to the crash site.
But for two days their search yielded no results.
'Miracle'
Finally, on Wednesday, they located Ms Murillo about 500m from the site of the crash in a ravine on the banks of a river.
Ms Murillo and her baby were taken by helicopter to a hospital in Quibdo
"It's a miracle," Col Carrascal said. Of the baby, who is unharmed, he said: "His mother's spirit must have given him strength to survive."
The pair were airlifted to a hospital in Quibdo. BBC Mundo's Natalio Cosoy has spoken to Ms Murillo's elder brother, Carlos.
Mr Murillo said she had managed to open the cabin door and run into the jungle as fire was spreading in the cabin.
"It was then she remembered she had a baby and went back from him," said Carlos Murillo. She sustained burns to her face, an arm and a leg.
Afraid the plane might explode, she walked into the jungle along the bank of a small river.
She was able to survive by drinking coconut water from the coconuts the plane had been carrying, her brother said. She used big leaves to collect and drink rain water.
Ms Murillo eventually heard the calls over loudspeaker from the rescue helicopter which prompted her to make her way back to the crash site.

Ghana 'ball boy' receives same fee as players at 2014 World Cup
Consider a world in which the England kit man is paid as big an appearance fee as Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart or Raheem Sterling.
Tough to imagine? Not so if you worked for Ghana's Football Association at the 2014 World Cup where their "equipment officer" earned $100,000 (64,000).
In a 396-page report which investigates the Black Stars' first-round exit in Brazil, payment for a role also defined as "ball boy" is highlighted.
Ismail Hamidu was the lucky recipient of a sum equal to that earned by individual players, doctors, coaches and manager James Kwesi Appiah.
The report also found a fee of $5,263 (3,345) was paid to Ghana's official drummer.
His beat was not enough to help the team beat Portugal in their final group fixture to reach the second round, a match which followed the country's FA flying $3m out to South America to settle a pay dispute with players.
Two sentences in the Dzamefe Report that perhaps sum up the frustrations and difficulties of Ghana's World Cup campaign are:

        <MainBody>South Africa police accused over Marikana mine deaths
25 June 2015
From the section Africa
A South African commission has recommended a criminal investigation into police over the deaths of 34 miners during a strike in 2012.
President Jacob Zuma said the inquiry concluded the police had a "defective plan" to end the strike at the Marikana mine and were wrong to proceed with it.
Police have always claimed self-defence over the shooting of the workers during a protest over wages.
Mr Zuma called it a "horrendous tragedy that has no place in a democracy".
"We should, as a nation, learn from this painful episode. We should use it to build a more united, peaceful and cohesive society," he said.
Criminally liable?
The killings were the worst violence in South Africa since the end of apartheid 20 years ago, and led to intense scrutiny over the roles of the police, mining companies, unions and the government.
The miners had been striking for a number of days, and 10 other people had already died at the site - including non-striking miners, security guards and two police officers - before the events of 16 August.
Reading out the findings of the inquiry, Mr Zuma said that the police had planned to encircle the strikers with barbed wire in the morning and allow them out after disarming them.
But as the number of strikers grew later in the day, they implemented a "tactical option" which the commission said was "defective in a number of respects".
The miners had been protesting over wages and conditions
The commission concluded the police should have appreciated that the situation was such that "it would have been impossible to disarm and disperse the strikers without significant bloodshed".
Police were accused of allowing the situation to get out of control.
In its conclusions, the commission said a full investigation should be launched to determine whether any officers are criminally liable. It also called for an inquiry into whether police chief Riah Phiyega was fit to hold office.
The report also criticised the delay in getting medical attention to the injured, which it said contributed to the death of at least one of the workers.
It recommended that a panel of experts should be set up to revise policing methods and investigate new tactics for crowd control that do not involve "weapons capable of automatic fire".
Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg
Judging by what President Zuma said when he released the report, there will be many disappointed people in South Africa tonight.
It seems that the person who will carry the can of the first massacre by the state since the end of apartheid will be police chief Riah Phiyega.
President Zuma said that his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, who was a shareholder at Lonmin at the time of the killings, has been exonerated.
This will certainly not go down well with opposition parties, who have been a thorn in his side over the controversial security upgrades at the president's home in Nkandla.
Mr Zuma can expect an even noisier national assembly flowing directly from his address to the nation tonight.
Marikana deaths: A case for murder?
Both the mining unions and Lonmin, the mine's owners, were criticised for not doing enough to resolve the original dispute, which was over pay and accommodation.
But the commission did exonerate two government ministers and Cyril Ramaphosa, who was a non-executive director at Lonmin at the time and is now South Africa's deputy president.
It said the accusation that Mr Ramaphosa had put pressure on the police to take action against the strikers was "groundless".
The killings were the worst violence in South Africa since the end of apartheid
Lonmin has called the findings of the commission a "vital step in the healing process".
The commission, headed by retired judge Ian Farlam, has spent nearly three years investigating the shooting and the issues surrounding it.
No-one has been charged or held responsible for the killings. A lawyer, acting for the injured miners, said that they were looking into instituting civil claims.
Some of the lawyers for the dead miners' families have also made accusations of a cover-up, describing the killings as revenge by the police for earlier deaths at the mine.

        <MainBody>Thailand halts Human Rights Watch event on Vietnam
26 June 2015
From the section Asia
Sunai Phasuk (left), HRW senior researcher in Asia, speaks to police at the event
Thailand's military-run government has forced Human Rights Watch (HRW) to cancel an event in Bangkok to launch a report into alleged abuses in Vietnam.
Thai officials said the event, which was halted minutes before it was due to start, could have affected relations between the two countries.
The HRW report focuses on the treatment of a Christian group in Vietnam.
The group said the Thai response showed how freedom of speech had been eroded since the army seized power last year.
Thai police said the event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand could "have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam".
It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month.
The HRW report describes what it says is the persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the Vietnamese government as "evil".
Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher in Asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was "very disappointing".
"Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [Southeast Asia], which adds more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule," he added.
Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in May 2014.

        <MainBody>Pakistan asks UK over claims India funded MQM party
25 June 2015
From the section Asia
The MQM has a loyal support base among the Mohajir community
Pakistan says it will pursue more information from the British government over claims that the MQM party was funded by Indian's government.
MQM officials told UK investigators they had received money from the Indian government, the BBC has learned.
A Pakistani official also told the BBC that India has trained hundreds of MQM militants over the past 10 years.
Indian authorities say the claims made to the BBC are "completely baseless". The MQM also denies them.
Party spokesman Saif Muhammad Ali told BBC Urdu that the MQM had never received any funding or training from India. He said authorities in Pakistan were running a campaign against the party.
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Pakistan's interior minister, said on Thursday he would write to the British government on Friday.
He said they had a duty to "extend as much help as possible" to Pakistan on the investigation.
With 24 members in the National Assembly, the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) has long been a dominant force in the politics of Pakistan's largest city, Karachi.
British authorities investigating the MQM for alleged money laundering held formal recorded interviews with senior MQM officials .
They told investigators the party was receiving Indian funding, the BBC was told. UK authorities also found a list of weapons in an MQM property.
A Pakistani official told the BBC that India has trained hundreds of MQM militants in explosives, weapons and sabotage over the past 10 years in camps in north and north-east India.
Before 2005-2006, the training was given to a small number of mid-ranking members of the MQM, the official said.
More recently, greater numbers of more junior party members have been trained, the BBC was told.
The arrest of Altaf Hussain prompted unrest in Karachi
The claims follow the statement of a senior Karachi police officer in April that two arrested MQM militants said they had been trained in India.
Asked about the claims of Indian funding and training of the MQM, the Indian High Commission in London said: "Shortcomings of governance cannot be rationalised by blaming neighbours."
The UK authorities started investigating the MQM in 2010 when a senior party leader, Imran Farooq, was stabbed to death outside his home in north London.
In the course of those inquiries, the police found around 500,000 ($787,350) in the MQM's London offices and in the home of Mr Hussain.
That prompted a second investigation into possible money laundering.
Who is Altaf Hussain?
Born in Karachi in 1953 to a middle-class family; studied pharmacy at university.
Formed MQM party in 1984 to represent Mohajirs - descendants of Urdu-speaking Muslims who migrated from India to Pakistan.
Requested political asylum in UK in 1992, later gained British citizenship; continues to run MQM from north London.
British investigators then found a list itemising weapons, including mortars, grenades and bomb-making equipment in an MQM property, according to Pakistani media reports that the BBC believes to be credible.
The list included prices for the weapons. Asked about the list, the MQM made no response.
The MQM insists it is a peaceful, secular party representing the interests of the middle classes in Pakistan.

        <Description>Greece and its international creditors remain in deadlock over its debt crisis despite a series of top-level meetings.</Description>
        <MainBody>The relationship between Alexis Tsipras, Italian PM Matteo Renzi and Germany's Angela Merkel appeared jovial at the EU summit despite the deadlock
Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis attended the Eurogroup meeting to put forward Athens' own ideas
After the meeting of finance ministers broke up without agreement, Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem said it was not too late for Greece to accept the proposals of its international lenders.
It was the fourth time that the finance ministers had met in a week in an attempt to prevent a Greek debt default. They will meet again on Saturday.
An EU diplomat told the BBC that the Eurogroup had to make a decision then - yes or no.
The Greek government has criticised the international creditors for rejecting its own ideas, which were initially welcomed.
IMF head Christine Lagarde said the lenders had been presented with a counter-proposal by the Greek parties "at the last hour" on Thursday and needed more time to assess it, according to Reuters.
The IMF has been particularly strong in refusing to accept Greece's proposals put forward earlier this week.
Correspondents say the Greek plan included far more tax rises and far fewer spending cuts than creditors had suggested.
Why the IMF is worried - by Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent
Throughout the Greek crisis, the IMF has been concerned that the programme should add up. That means that specific actions should be able to achieve whatever targets are agreed for the Greek government's borrowing needs.
In the current impasse, one concern is that the Greek proposals include too much emphasis on tax rather than spending.
The IMF worry is that might aggravate the economy's weakness. For the long term the IMF's concern is that Greece should ultimately have a sustainable debt burden and has been telling the eurozone that it should be thinking about debt relief.
Like the other players in this crisis, the IMF has politics to contend with: IMF member countries (Brazil has been a notable example) who have in the past been unhappy about the organisation's financial support for Greece.
Greece's PM Tsipras held talks on Thursday morning with IMF leader Christine Lagarde and European Central Bank head Mario Draghi as well as Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and Eurogroup leader Mr Dijsselbloem.
Technical experts met several hours earlier to continue deliberations. However, no deal was struck.
If an agreement is reached, it will have to be endorsed by Greece's parliament, with some critics at home accusing the prime minister of reneging on his party's campaign pledge to end austerity.
Greek debt talks - main sticking points
Greece has refused to accept cuts to pension payments or public sector wages
The IMF is pushing for deeper spending cuts, not just more tax rises
A key point of friction is a special benefit paid to some low-income pensioners, which creditors want scrapped
Creditors also want a wider VAT base; Greece says it will not allow extra VAT on medicines or electricity bills, and has also resisted calls for VAT hikes on hotels and restaurants
Athens wants a concrete commitment to debt relief, something its creditors are not offering

        <MainBody>France cracks down on Uber service after protests
26 June 2015
From the section Europe
France's interior minister has ordered a ban on the low-cost car-sharing service UberPOP after a day of nationwide protests by taxi drivers.
Bernard Cazeneuve said the service was "illegal" and ordered police and prosecutors to enforce its closure.
His announcement followed a day of sometimes violent protests by French taxi drivers, who say the US-based firm Uber is stealing their livelihoods.
US rock singer Courtney Love Cobain was caught up in the unrest.
She tweeted her frustration, saying her taxi had been ambushed as she left the airport.
The musician shared an image of the window of her car spattered with egg, and thanking two motorcyclists she said rescued her.
Windows smashed
Uber officials have insisted they will continue their activities until France's highest court rules on the service - an attitude Mr Cazeneuve called "cynical and arrogant".
Key highways around Paris were blocked and tyres were burned during the day-long strike. Barriers also appeared around Marseille and Aix-en-Provence in southeast France.
Some cars were overturned and others had their windows smashed with bats.
Riot police responded to protests in Paris after French taxi drivers overturned cars and set fire to tyres in protest against taxi app Uber
Aeroports de Paris, the operator of the French capital's Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly airports, warned passengers to travel by train, saying "access by road is completely blocked".
Some travellers walked along the side of the motorway to reach the airport.
Taxi drivers also blocked access to Marseille and Aix train stations and protested on the main access to Marseilles-Provence airport.
France's taxi drivers - who have to pay thousands of euros for a licence - say they are being unfairly undercut by UberPOP.
"Many taxis drivers are infuriated," Abdelkader Morghad, a representative of the FTI taxi union, told Bloomberg.
He said a law that forbids unlicensed drivers to carry paying passengers should be implemented.
France's licensed drivers have lost between 30% and 40% of their income over two years because of the growth of UberPOP, Mr Morghad said.
UberPOP is a car-sharing service offered by Uber, which brings together customers and private drivers at prices lower than those charged by both traditional taxi firms and even other Uber services.
UberPOP differs because it allows non-professional drivers to register their car and transport other passengers.
It has been illegal in France since January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and the service continues to operate, AFP news agency reports.
Mr Cazeneuve said on Thursday that he had ordered police in Paris to issue a decree banning UberPOP and said any cars defying the order would be seized.
Uber spokesman Thomas Meister said the firm had contested the law under which UberPOP has been ruled illegal, and accused the interior minister of overriding the normal legal process.
"The way things work in a state of law is that it's for the justice to judge whether something is legal or illegal," he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.
The nationwide protests saw violence in Marseille as well as Paris
San Francisco-based Uber says it has a million users in France, including 250,000 for UberPOP. Uber also operates a luxury service which is not banned.
Uber has faced similar teething problems in cities all over the world, with traditional taxi drivers protesting against being undercut by the unlicensed company.
But licensed taxi drivers have been criticised for being slow to adopt the app-based geolocation technology behind Uber's success.

        <MainBody>Iran nuclear talks: Obama warned over concessions
25 June 2015
From the section Middle East
John Kerry and Mohammad Javad Zarif are due to join the negotiations in Vienna on Friday
Former senior advisers to US President Barack Obama have expressed concern at the emerging deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme.
In an open letter , the security and foreign policy experts say it "falls short of meeting the administration's own standard of a 'good' agreement".
They call for fewer concessions on international nuclear inspections and on research and development activities.
The publication of the letter comes as the deadline for a final accord nears.
US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif are to fly to the Austrian capital Vienna on Friday to join the negotiations, which may need to continue beyond 30 June.
The so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - wants to limit Iran's sensitive nuclear activities to ensure that it could not build a nuclear weapon quickly.
Iran, which wants sanctions lifted in exchange, insists its nuclear work is peaceful.
'Tracks with US position'
The open letter published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy on Thursday is signed by a bipartisan group of US diplomats, legislators, policymakers and experts who have met regularly over the past three years to discuss Iran.
They include:
Dennis Ross, who advised President Obama on Iran
Former CIA director David Petraeus
Robert Einhorn, a former member of the US negotiating team with Iran
James Cartwright, a former vice-chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gary Samore, a former Obama adviser on nuclear policy
Stephen Hadley, who was a national security adviser to President George W Bush
Iran insists its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes
"Most of us would have preferred a stronger agreement," the letter says.
"The agreement will not prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapons capability. It will not require the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure," it adds.
"It will however reduce that infrastructure for the next 10 to 15 years. And it will impose a transparency, inspection, and consequences regime with the goal of deterring and dissuading Iran from actually building a nuclear weapon."
The letter calls on Mr Obama to insist that Iran provide information about nuclear weapons research Western powers suspect it has carried out, and allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to military sites.
The president is also urged to establish strict limits on the research and development of centrifuges used to enrich uranium to preclude the "rapid technical upgrade and expansion" of Iran's enrichment capacity at the end of any deal. Enriched uranium can be used to make fuel for both nuclear energy and weapons.
A senior Obama administration official said it had received the letter and that it "in large part tacks with the US negotiating position inside the negotiating room".

A military vehicle escorting a United Arab Emirates' diplomatic convoy was hit by a car bomb in Somalia's capital, killing at least 12 people, police say.
The UAE ambassador survived the suicide attack as he was riding in a bullet-proof land cruiser vehicle, the BBC's Mohamed Moalimu reports from Mogadishu.
The militant Islamist group al-Shabab says it carried out the attack, to target "a foreign enemy".
Al-Shabab is battling Somalia's government for control of the country.
On Sunday morning, a suicide car bomber and gunmen attacked a training centre for the national intelligence agency .
The militants have vowed to intensify attacks during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which began on Wednesday.

        <MainBody>David Cameron 'delighted' EU renegotiation under way
26 June 2015
From the section UK Politics
David Cameron says he is delighted the process of "reform and renegotiation" of the UK's membership of the EU is "properly under way".
The PM was speaking in the early hours after formally setting out his aims to EU counterparts in Brussels.
He addressed EU leaders for 10 minutes at a summit dominated by the migrant crisis and Greek debt , although his exact speech was not reported.
The European Council's Donald Tusk said there was a will to help the UK.
Follow the latest developments on our live page
However Mr Tusk, who is overseeing the membership negotiations, added that basic values, such as freedom of movement to live and work within the EU, "were not for sale".
Detailed discussions would now begin in earnest, he added, with EU leaders next considering the matter in December.
'Safe for all'
Mr Cameron, who wants to reform the UK's membership of the EU before holding an in/out referendum of the British public by the end of 2017, tweeted that "significant progress" had been made in Brussels.
The prime minister, who is under pressure from his Conservative backbenchers to deliver a far-reaching and lasting deal, has not set out in full detail what he wants but his key demands include:
An opt-out on the core EU aim of "ever closer union"
The sovereignty of national parliaments to be boosted, so groups of them can block proposed EU legislation
Safeguard the City of London and other financial centres outside the eurozone
Curb EU immigration by cutting benefits
Make the EU more streamlined and competitive
To get what it wants the UK believes it will need to rewrite treaties agreed by all 28 EU members.
Downing Street has said the prime minister remains committed to "proper, full-on treaty change" but it has acknowledged this is unlikely by the end of 2017 since it would trigger referendums in other EU countries as well.
The government is understood to be seeking "legally-binding" guarantees by the time of the referendum that EU treaties would be changed at some point in the future.
Analysis
By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent
It was during the night's long, acrimonious discussion about Europe's migrant crisis that David Cameron was given time to set out his case. The prime minister's remarks to fellow EU leaders were brief and will not have been a surprise.
He had spoken to each of them in the weeks leading up to this summit - explaining why Britain will have an in/out referendum by the end of 2017 and sketching out his aims.
He has also made it clear Britain could leave the EU if he doesn't get a meaningful deal. For Britain, for Europe, this summit has marked a significant moment - and the start of official renegotiation talks between London and Brussels.
The prime minister of Malta said David Cameron "had worked the crowd well" over recent weeks. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was broadly supportive too, but said EU leaders had some different ideas to those proposed by Mr Cameron.
There remains a big question mark over exactly what the prime minister will be asking for.
Aspirations such as new powers for national parliaments, a British exemption from "ever closer union" and efforts to curb EU migration to Britain through welfare changes will be controversial.
What does David Cameron want?
The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said EU leaders accepted treaty change would be needed further down the line to reflect closer integration within the eurozone.
"The idea is to use that to get in the British changes as well but that cannot happen before 2017," she said.
Estonian prime minister Taavi Roivas told the BBC that treaty change could not be ruled out but a process which required a referendum in every country could pose some "difficulties".
"First of all we have to agree what we want to achieve and then we will talk the legal aspects, whether it is treaty change or secondary legislation," he told Radio 4's Today.
While the principle of freedom of movement could not be circumscribed in any way, he said EU leaders should be willing to listen to all the UK's ideas, including on benefit restrictions.
"I wouldn't draw any red lines just yet. My country men are coming to Britain only to work and to study and are not travelling for benefits so if Britain has this serious concern, we should be open for this discussion."
'Sensible'
UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the prime minister was "accepting the inevitable" that there would be no treaty change.
He said there would be "nothing really fundamental in Britain's renegotiation of its membership".
Former Conservative Home Office minister Damian Green, a pro-European MP, said it was "perfectly sensible for the prime minister to leave his options open" to get the results he wanted.
But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said Mr Cameron was "signalling retreat while pretending that all he ever wanted was a post-dated cheque".
Mr Benn said Mr Cameron had "made a mess" and "should have known what the position of other countries would be".
Tory MP Steve Baker, co-founder of Conservatives for Britain, said he and colleagues were "more concerned" about the "substance" of any new relationship between the UK and the EU "rather than the mechanism" which will deliver it.

        <MainBody>Network Rail 'too big', says Sir Richard Branson
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Network Rail is too big and should be broken up into regional units, Sir Richard Branson has told the BBC.
Many of the delays that passengers on Virgin Rail suffer are down to Network Rail, he said.
"Network Rail is far too big a company," he said. "I think that companies that kind of size should be broken up into small units."
Network Rail said decisions on its future would be taken by the government.
Investment delays
Sir Richard added that "ideally" the train operators should manage the track they use.
"We get enormously frustrated that people say will say that Virgin Rail has delays, but 90% of those delays are down to Network Rail," he told the BBC.
"If we were running the track underneath, because we've got our trains running on that track we'd make absolutely certain that track was fixed and running well, because we value our reputation."
When asked if a break-up of Network Rail was likely, he said: "I don't know; I've thrown that idea out before. Maybe right now it's an option that might be considered."
A spokesman for Network Rail described Sir Richard's figures as "incorrect", adding: "Over the last year (to 30 May), infrastructure faults were responsible for around a third (36%) of delays to Virgin Trains services."
On Thursday, the government said it would delay or cut back a number of modernisation projects planned for Network Rail.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said rising costs and missed targets made an existing 38.5bn investment plan untenable,
Mr McLoughlin said Network Rail should have foreseen the improvements would cost more and take longer.
Network Rail said the plan, which was launched last year as the "largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times", was too ambitious.
Under the changes, the government said electrification work on the Midland main line and on the Trans-Pennine route between Leeds and Manchester would be "paused".

Hong Kong has refused an application by Jetstar to set up local operations there
Hong Kong authorities have rejected an application by Qantas-backed Australian budget carrier Jetstar to set up a local airline, after nearly two years of deliberation.
The regulator said the bid did not comply with the laws of having its principal place of business in the Chinese territory.
The city's other carriers had also objected, it said.
Qantas said it would reconsider basing the low-cost carrier in Hong Kong.
The carrier is a three-way joint venture between Qantas Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Hong Kong investment firm Shun Tak Holdings.
"Jetstar Hong Kong cannot make its decisions independently from that of the two foreign shareholders," said the Air Transport Licensing Authority when handing down its decision.
It also said the city's other carriers, including Cathay Pacific and Dragon Airlines, had objected to Jetstar's application.
'Disappointing' decision
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the decision was disappointing for shareholders as well as "for the travellers that Jetstar Hong Kong planned to serve".
"It's the travelling public who have lost out, because the message from this decision is that Hong Kong appears closed to fresh aviation investment even when it is majority locally-owned and controlled," he said in a statement on Friday.
He added that Hong Kong was going in the opposite direction of other aviation markets in Asia that were "opening up".
"Given the importance of aviation to global commerce, shutting the door to new competition can only serve the vested interests already installed in that market."
The airline, along with its partners, said it had not yet decided on whether to appeal the decision.
The joint venture was valued at $10m Australian dollars ($7.7m; 4.9m), according to Qantas.
Shares of Qantas were down 1.4% in Sydney in reaction to the news.

        <MainBody>Tesco's sales decline in UK slows
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Tesco has reported a slower rate of decline in sales at its UK stores as it tries to stem the flow of customers switching to discount chains.
UK sales fell 1.3% for the three months to the end of May, compared with a 4% decline a year earlier.
The result beat analysts' forecasts of a fall of 1.6%-3%, and was better than the 1.7% fall reported in the fourth quarter of the last financial year.
Tesco chief Dave Lewis said it was a "step in the right direction".
"We are fixing the fundamentals of shopping to win back customers and relying less on short-term couponing," he said.
Shares in Tesco were up 3.4% in morning trade.
Including its international businesses, sales across the Tesco group dropped 1.3% in the quarter compared with a 3.4% dip a year ago.
Mr Lewis, who took the helm in September, is trying to revive the fortunes of Britain's largest supermarket after it reported the worst loss in its history in April.
Tesco reported a full-year pre-tax loss of 6.4bn, one of the largest in UK corporate history. About  4.7bn of the losses were the result of the fall in property value of its UK stores, 43 of which it said would close.
Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor
To understand why Tesco is slowly turning the corner, it is worth looking at the rather mundane world of the humble ham sandwich.
Tesco now offers 30% fewer sandwich lines after it realised that the wide range it was selling meant that customers often could not buy their favourite, simple sandwich, like, say, one with ham in it.
So, it reduced the range and increased the supply of the top sellers. Customers were happier that they could buy what they wanted and the number of transactions increased.

The trading update from Tesco comes ahead of an annual meeting of shareholders later.
Tim Bush of pension advisers Pirc told the BBC's Today programme that investors are likely to question payoffs for Tesco's former chief executive and finance director Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee, who shared 2.2m in severance pay after the supermarket said it was "contractually committed" to make the payments.
The pair, who left the firm last year, were awarded 1,217,000 and 970,880 respectively.
The payments were initially suspended while Tesco investigated last year's 263m accounting scandal.
"Things have stopped getting worse but they haven't yet started getting better," said Mr Bush.
Tesco said data from researcher Kantar Worldpanel had also shown that 180,000 more customers shopped at the supermarket in the 12 weeks to 24 May.

Woolworths is Australia's largest supermarket chain but faces stiff competition from discount rivals
Shares in Australia's biggest supermarket chain Woolworths have risen as much as 5% in Sydney on media reports of a possible takeover.
The Australian newspaper reported fresh rumours that US private equity giant KKR had a bid that could be "almost ready" for consideration.
It would be one of the biggest deal in Australia's corporate history, the newspaper said.
The news comes amid turbulent times for the supermarket chain.
Woolworths' media team made no comment in relation to the takeover rumours, while KKR's media team in Australia was unavailable for comment.

Turbulent times
Earlier this month, Woolworths announced that its chief executive, Grant O'Brien, was stepping down after nearly four years.
The firm also said it had plans to cut about 1,200 jobs. The changes are aimed at cutting millions of dollars in costs and improving sales after Woolworths' first-half profits fell.
The retail giant has been up against rivals such as Coles and Aldi and it has been trying to win more customers with improved stores and competitive pricing.
Woolworths recently cut its profit guidance for the year to June 2015.

        <title>Fifa chief Blatter 'did not resign'</title>

        <MainBody>Sepp Blatter: Fifa president says he did not resign
Sepp Blatter says he has not resigned as Fifa president.
The 79-year-old Swiss was thought to have ended his 17-year reign on 2 June amid claims of corruption in world football's governing body.
But, according to Swiss newspaper Blick, Blatter told a party at a Fifa museum: "I did not resign. I put myself and my office in the hands of the Fifa congress."
Blatter is thought to be considering standing for re-election as president.
Two criminal investigations into alleged Fifa corruption began in the week that Blatter was elected for a fifth term in charge.
Four days after being voted president, Blatter - who is reportedly under investigation in the United States - said: "While I have a mandate from the membership of Fifa, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football.
Blatter resigns as Fifa president
"Therefore, I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective congress. I will continue to exercise my functions as Fifa president until that election."
However Blatter did not use the words 'resign' or 'resignation'.
Meanwhile, Blatter may not attend the final of the Women's World Cup in Canada because of the twin investigations into Fifa by American and Swiss authorities.
He would normally present the trophy to the winning team, but Fifa will not confirm whether Blatter or secretary general Jerome Valcke will attend.
A Fifa spokesperson said: "In terms of the Fifa president and the Fifa secretary general, their future travel plans will be confirmed in due course."

The 2013 champion is in the opposite half to top seed Novak Djokovic, who takes on German Philipp Kohlschreiber - ranked 33rd in the world.
Third seed Murray, 28, could face Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals and Roger Federer in the semi-finals should he progress that far.
British women's number one Heather Watson plays 32nd seed Caroline Garcia.

Wimbledon 2015: An alternative look at the All England Club
The Serb, who has played no competitive grass-court tennis before Wimbledon, is in the same half of the draw as Swiss fourth seed Stan Wawrinka, who beat him in the final of the French Open earlier this month.
Scot Murray, whose first-round match will be on Tuesday, has won his two previous meetings against Kukushkin, both of which were on Australian hard courts in 2012.
The world number three looked in impressive form when he beat Kevin Anderson on Sunday to secure a fourth Queen's Club title.
With Nadal only seeded 10th, Murray could face the two-time winner as early as the quarter-finals, should both men reach that point.
Nadal could face eighth seed and fellow Spaniard David Ferrer, who starts against Britain's 110th-ranked wildcard James Ward, in the fourth round.

        <MainBody>India's Satam Singh Bhamara creates NBA draft history
Satnam Singh Bhamara has made history as the first India-born selection in the NBA draft.
The 19-year-old 7ft 2in centre, who comes from a small Punjab village, was the 52nd overall pick to the Dallas Mavericks.
The draft gives NBA teams the chance to sign up the best college and young international talent.
Fellow teenager Karl-Anthony Towns was chosen by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the first pick.
Towns, 19, averaged 10.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots a game last season for the University of Kentucky.
But New York Knicks fans were unhappy with their team's selection Kristaps Porzingis, booing the announcement of the Latvian's acquisition as fourth choice.
"These people don't know me, might think I'm soft, European, a bust," said the 19-year-old, who is aiming to become the third Latvian to play in the NBA. "I'm different. It's my passion that sets me apart."

        <Description>JK Rowling announces the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will open in London's West End next year.</Description>
        <MainBody>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to open in 2016
26 June 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
JK Rowling is the author of the seven Potter novels and three companion books
JK Rowling has announced her Harry Potter stage play will open in London's West End next year.
Called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it will tell the "untold part" of the boy wizard's story, including the story of the lives of his murdered parents.
However, the author said on Twitter the play was "not a prequel".
It will run at the Palace Theatre in the summer of 2016, with tickets on sale this autumn.
Rowling said she chose to make the announcement on Friday because it was "a very special day" - the 18th anniversary of when her debut book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was first published in the UK.
But she was tight-lipped about the plot of the play, saying she did not "want to say too much more, because I don't want to spoil what I know will be a real treat for fans".
She added: "To answer one inevitable (and reasonable!) question - why isn't Cursed Child a new novel? I am confident that when audiences see the play they will agree that it was the only proper medium for the story."
The play was first announced in December 2013, after the author said she had "received countless approaches" over the years "about turning Harry Potter into a theatrical production".
Although the new story has not been written by Rowling, it is a collaboration between herself and writer Jack Thorne - who previously adapted Let The Right One In for the stage and won a Bafta for his work on Channel 4's This is England '88 - and John Tiffany, who will also direct the play.
It will be produced by Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, and British singer Imogen Heap will provide the music.
Analysis - Tim Masters, entertainment correspondent
The plot details might still be hazy, but there's little doubt Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will have a magical effect at the West End box office.
It will be at the 1,400-seat Palace Theatre, which was home to theatrical blockbuster Les Miserables for a record 19 years.
JK Rowling's success needs no introduction, but the new Harry Potter play reunites the creative dream team behind the stage adaptation of supernatural love story Let The Right One In.
When it comes to West End hits, producer Sonia Friedman has a golden touch.  Her biggest successes include Book of Mormon and Sunny Afternoon, while her musical Bend It Like Beckham kicked off to rave reviews this week.
When it opens in summer 2016 the play is likely to spark the kind of Potter-mania that surrounded the release of the books and films.
And it won't end there. The stage show will be closely followed by the Potter film spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in November 2016.
Eddie Redmayne will star in a movie adaptation of Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
"Jack, John and Sonia Friedman are a dream team," Rowling said.
"It has been a huge pleasure to share with them (and soon, with you!) this untold part of Harry's story."
Producers originally said the play would explore "the previously untold story of Harry's early years as an orphan and outcast".
"Featuring some of our favourite characters from the Harry Potter books, this new work will offer a unique insight into the heart and mind of the now legendary young wizard," they said.
The Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye claimed The Cursed Child would "delve into what happened to Harry's parents before they were killed by Lord Voldemort, forcing an infant Harry to be raised in miserable circumstances by his mother's sister, Petunia, her horrid husband Vernon and their spoiled son Dudley".
Rowling's seven Harry Potter best-sellers were adapted into eight blockbuster films starring Daniel Radcliffe as the boy wizard.
The author is making her screenwriting debut on Potter spin-off film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, starring Eddie Redmayne, due in cinemas next November.

Fairey faces a prison sentence for malicious damage
Street artist Shepard Fairey is wanted by police in Detroit after they say he tagged buildings across the city.
An arrest warrant has been issued for the designer, best known for creating the "Hope" image of President Obama during his 2008 election campaign.
Just because he is a well-known artist does not take away the fact that he is also a vandal
Detroit police sergeant Rebecca McKay
He was commissioned to paint a huge, 18-storey mural in Detroit last month but police say he used his down time to plaster buildings with posters.
The warrant accuses him of two counts of malicious destruction of property.
Each is punishable by a prison sentence and a $10,000 (6,347) fine.
"When you're in Detroit, we welcome your work, Shepard Fairey, your commissioned work, not your Wild West work," Detroit police sergeant Rebecca McKay said.
"Just because he is a well-known artist does not take away the fact that he is also a vandal," she added.
However, Fairey laughed off the charges, calling them "hilarious".
The artist, who has been arrested 17 times in his 20-year career, told the Independent he did not know what the warrant would amount to.
"Sometimes it's a day or two in jail. Normally the charges get downgraded. Most of the arrests aren't for serious stuff," he said.
The Detroit mural took five days to complete
Fairey's commissioned work was the largest mural of his career - a 184ft by 60ft stencil on the side of an office block, which took  more than 300 cans of spray paint to complete.
It featured many of his recurring motifs - lotus leaves, a peace sign, the scales of justice and a stylised image of the late wrestler and Princess Bride star Andre The Giant.
But Fairey had told local newspaper The Detroit Free Press he intended to tag buildings during his visit.
"I still do stuff on the street without permission. I'll be doing stuff on the street when I'm in Detroit," Fairey said.
Fairey's portrait of Barack Obama became a symbol of the 2008 presidential election
The artist's murals can be seen in Philadelphia, New York and Paris (pictured)
Police say that between 16 and 22 May, Fairey pasted nine posters, including some with the face of Andre the Giant on buildings around the city, causing damage totalling $9,105.54 (5,779.20).
Detroit is trying to shed its reputation as a haven for illegal street artists. Last summer, Mayor Mike Duggan formed a quality-of-life task force targeting graffiti and building code violations. The team has since apprehended about a dozen people suspected of vandalism.
"Whether it's appealing to the eye or not, it is a crime," Ms McKay said. "He is well aware of the law, and instead of respecting the city of Detroit he took us two steps back."

26 June 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
Actor Patrick Macnee, star of The Avengers TV series, has died in California at the age of 93.
The Briton, best known for playing John Steed in the 1960s television spy show, died at home with his family at his bedside, his son Rupert said.
Macnee, who served in the Royal Navy during World War Two, also played roles in theatre, appearing on Broadway.
Avengers co-star Dame Diana Rigg paid tribute, saying: "Patrick was a very dear man and I owe him a great deal".
A statement on Mcnee's website read : "Wherever he went, he left behind a trove of memories."
He died peacefully at his home in California's Rancho Mirage on Thursday, Rupert said.
Patrick Macnee reprised his John Steed role for The New Avengers TV series, starring alongside Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt
James Bond ally
Born in London, Macnee grew up in Berkshire and was educated at Summerfields Preparatory School and Eton.
At the age of 11, he acted in Henry V opposite a young Sir Christopher Lee. He first appeared in the West End while still in his teens.
He played a number of minor roles - including one in Laurence Olivier's 1948 film version of Hamlet - before rising to fame in the original Avengers series between 1961 and 1969.
The series developed a cult following around the world, with Macnee portraying the quintessentially English and mysterious super-spy John Steed.
Steed was known for his dress sense, always donning a bowler hat and carrying an umbrella, which was used as a secret weapon. He never used a gun.

His co-stars during the initial run included Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg and Linda Thorson.
Macnee returned when that series was reprised as The New Avengers in the 1970s, appearing alongside Joanna Lumley's Purdey and Gareth Hunt's Mike Gambit.
Later, he starred on Broadway in Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth, touring internationally with that play and several other productions.
He also appeared in the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill, playing an ally of Roger Moore's Bond character, and made a cameo appearance as the head of a record company in This is Spinal Tap.
Sir Roger tweeted: "So very sad to hear Pat Macnee has left us.
"We were mates from 1950s and I have so many happy memories of working with him. A true gent."
Thorson, who played assistant Tara King, remembered Macnee as "a paradox".
"He was the best-dressed man on television and a nudist in real life," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"He was always upbeat. He had great stories and great detail and wonderful energy," she continued. "Patrick [had] a very happy and long life and the most wonderful children who took the greatest of care of him, in the last decade in particular."
Macnee also featured as a guest star in dozens of British, American and Australian TV productions; and made a cameo in Oasis's video for Don't Look Back In Anger.
He scored a top 10 hit of his own in 1990, with Kinky Boots - a novelty song recorded with Avengers co-star Honor Blackman - which was championed by Radio 1's then-breakfast DJ Simon Mayo.
'Ahead of their time'
In a 2014 interview with The Lady magazine, Macnee said he believed The Avengers was a success because it "did something different and did it better."
He told the magazine : "It was beautifully written, the ideas were very good, way ahead of their time and they incorporated fantasies for people who dreamed of doing exciting things."

Macnee had two children, son Rupert and daughter Jennifer, and one grandson.
He was married three times, including to actress Katherine Woodville, with whom he acted in The Avengers.
He had been a US citizen since 1959, according to the AP news agency.

In recent weeks, goods and people have been stuck on either side of the conflict's front line.
And with the war appearing to have reached a stalemate, some politicians in Ukraine are calling for rebel territory to be completely shut off from the rest of the country.

While a lot of attention this week has been paid to Greece's pensioners and super rich, it is also an anxious time for young people.
Unemployment among the under 25s is around 50%, almost double the EU average.
The BBC spent an evening in Thessaloniki, tracking down three diverse voices of Greece's youth and asking them about their hopes and expectations for the talks in Brussels.

        <MainBody>Lebanon pivotal to Iran's reach across Middle East
By Kevin Connolly BBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut
26 June 2015
From the section Middle East
The Baalbek festival takes place against a backdrop of turmoil and war just across the border
On the road to Baalbek, in the hot afternoons of Ramadan, the Bekaa Valley shimmers in the midsummer sun.
The soaring columns of the ruined temples of Baalbek are one of the glories of the ancient world - but there are few tourists around these days to admire them.
Lebanon's own civil war petered out 15 years ago, leaving tensions smouldering below the surface of daily life. Syria's is raging uncontrollably just a few kilometres up the road.
The town is cradled by snow-capped mountains and surrounded by emerald fields under sapphire skies - but the bewitching quality of the landscape isn't enough to attract visitors in the numbers that Baalbek's economy needs.
Tourists are understandably risk-averse, and the proximity to Syria is enough to deter all but the bravest.
So, not for the first time, Baalbek is hoping that its cultural festival will bring the visitors flooding back. It has worked before.
In the dreary years after the Second World War, the Baalbek festival - held against the spectacular backdrop of the ruined temples - was a sign that better and brighter days lay ahead.
Now, after it was suspended in recent years because of the fighting in Syria, the festival is to open again this summer.
Pragmatic course
It is a fact of political life in this part of the Bekaa Valley that a decision of this magnitude requires the consent of Hezbollah - the powerful Lebanese militia founded and funded by Iran.
Its local dominance indeed may also be a factor in keeping visitors away.
Hezbollah, of course, is heavily committed to the fighting in Syria where it is the most disciplined and effective element in the coalition struggling to keep Bashar al-Assad in power.
But even as it is engaged in a vicious civil war with strong sectarian overtones on the Syrian side of the border, it has demonstrated in Lebanon a pragmatic ability to coexist with rival communities in the context of a demographic patchwork which is rather similar to Syria's.
No-one should be under illusions about the nature of that coexistence, of course - most Lebanese assume, for example, that Hezbollah was behind the car bomb that killed the powerful Sunni politician Rafik Hariri in February 2005.
But optimists believe it shows that Hezbollah's sponsor Iran is prepared - to some extent at least - to be flexible and pragmatic about the way it exercises influence in the Middle East.
Hassan Hamad from the Baalbek Municipality told me: "The moderate social policy that Hezbollah follows here helps to keep Lebanon safe from terrorism and from the Syrian war.
"They recognise that Lebanon is Lebanon - it isn't Iran and it isn't Europe."
New 'Cold War'
Now, this all matters because an old order is disintegrating in the Middle East - the order imposed by France and Great Britain on the ruins of the Turkish Empire which collapsed here at the end of the First World War.
The US-led Western Alliance is still a player in the battle for influence now raging but the real struggle is between Shia Islam under Iranian leadership  and a grouping of Sunni powers led by Saudi Arabia.
Shia Iran and regional Sunni powers view each other with deep suspicion
In Yemen, Iraq and Syria, their proxies fight each other - you could draw a modern comparison with the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union or perhaps more accurately with the division of Europe in Catholic and Protestant camps in the 16th and 17th Centuries.
To some extent, Iran's modern leaders are reviving an ancient Persian appetite for influence in the Arab world. In Beirut, political commentator Charmine Narwani told me that West does not work hard enough to understand the changing Middle East from Iran's point of view.
She says there is resentment in Tehran that the country is always portrayed as a destabilising force with dangerous nuclear ambitions, and points out that Iran is in the frontline of a battle with Sunni extremism which is hostile to the West as well as to Shia Islam.
"Iran is probably Ground Zero - a centre for the fightback against Islamic State and al-Qaeda and Sunni extremists in the region," she said.
"The only boots on the ground fighting this fight in earnest are backed, funded and supported by Iran."
That analysis may underplay the role that the Kurds are playing in fighting Islamic State in Iraq but it does help to explain why everyone in the Middle East is talking about Iran.
State-with-a-state
The US-led Western powers are currently seeking a political deal with Iran in which the lifting of crippling economic sanctions could be traded for some sort of verifiable cap on Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But even as those long negotiations approach what will probably prove to be a protracted end-game, the underlying attitude towards Iran remains one of suspicion.
That is partly, of course, because Iran is a revisionist power which feels it has the right to export revolution.
But it is partly because of the way in which Hezbollah - so pragmatic in Lebanon - has emerged as the cutting edge of Iranian power on a wider stage.
In that role, it has been blamed by the West for bomb attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets as far afield as Bulgaria and Argentina.
Hezbollah, which began as a force against Israel, has grown into a major social, political and military movement
And within Lebanon, Hezbollah may offer a glimpse of how Iran sees the future of the Middle East.
What was created as a vehicle to fight Israeli forces of occupation in Lebanon in the 1980s has grown into a powerful state-within-a-state.
Equipped and funded by Iran, it comfortably outguns the Lebanese Army and has perhaps 25,000 fighters under arms.
The movement has social and political responsibilities, too, in its own areas like southern Lebanon but Iran does not seem to aspire to a Hezbollah takeover of the whole country - partly, at least, because it does not need to.
Nothing can happen in Lebanon unless Hezbollah agrees to it and for now it enjoys many of the advantages of being a state - like possession of a powerful army - without the problems that would come from responsibility for Sunni, Christian or Druze regions.
Strategic vision
It is possible that Iran may hope to create other similar non-state Shia entities elsewhere in the Middle East, especially if old multi-confessional nation-states like Syria and Iraq turn out to have reached the limit of their viability.
It does help to explain why Hezbollah is so important to Iran.
I have heard it argued that Iran's involvement is not really about using Hezbollah to maintain President Assad in power - it is more about keeping Mr Assad in office to maintain the land-bridge through which it supplies Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
Iran is heavily involved in supporting Syria's regime in the war, seeing Damascus as a critical gateway to Lebanon
At a turbulent time in the Middle East, when it feels like influence is up for grabs, Iran has a strategic vision and it brings to it a sense of purpose and energy which other regional players appear to struggle to match.
So when Baalbek holds its festival this summer, it may feel as it has felt before, like a sign of better days to come in the Middle East.
But make no mistake - this is a time of profound upheaval based on deep rivalries between regional powers like Iran and the Gulf monarchies.
And the changes that will flow from that upheaval are far from over.

From the section Magazine
Renee Richards made history when she walked out on to the centre court of the Forest Hills stadium to play in the 1977 US Open. She was the first transgender woman to play in a professional tennis tournament.
"I had a very good and full life as Dick but I had this other side of me that kept emerging and that kept pushing back, until finally it just wasn't possible to submerge Renee any more and Renee won out," Richards says.
Born Richard Raskind, tennis was a huge part of her life from an early age. She was captain of the men's tennis team at Yale University and later, while serving in the Navy as a medic, won the All Navy Tennis Championship.
She forged a career as a successful eye surgeon, and at a time when the major tennis tournaments were only open to amateurs - professionals were only allowed to compete from 1968 - she took part in the US Open several times as a man.
"I was just another young doctor, married and with a child, practising medicine and having a great life," Richards says.

Renee Richards spoke to Sporting Witness on the BBC World Service
But she says it always felt like there were two personalities competing inside her.
As a child, she used to dress up in her sister's clothes. "It gave me some relief and I felt good doing that... Recently Bruce Jenner [Caitlyn Jenner], who's a very famous athlete, is beginning a transition and talked about the same thing. I gave myself the name Renee, which actually means 'reborn' - I didn't even know that."
Richards had gender reassignment in 1975 at the age of 40 and moved to California to start a new life. But when she started competing in tennis tournaments her 6ft 2in (1.88m) frame and trademark left-hand serve began to attract attention - and after she won the La Jolla Tennis Tournament in July 1976 a journalist reported that she had previously competed as a man.
"My world kind of blew up on me when people found out who I was," she says.

Her critics said it was unfair for her to play in women's competitions because she would have an unfair advantage in terms of strength.
But it's more complex than that, says Richards. "Of course the men are stronger and they do hit the ball harder but there are other variables too. Serena Williams sometimes gets her serve up greater than 120mph and some of the men don't serve as hard as 120mph."
Controversy raged over whether Richards should be allowed to play. The US Open was just a few weeks away, but for the first time in its 95-year history a chromosome test was made a prerequisite for female entrants.
"I never had any intention of playing in the US Open... but when they said, 'You're not allowed to play,' that changed everything. I said, 'You can't tell me what I can or cannot do - I'm a woman and if I want to play in the US Open as a woman I'm going to do it,'" she says.
Richards was invited by a friend to compete in the South Orange Open in New Jersey, which took place just before the US Open, but more than 20 women players boycotted the event in protest. She reached the semi-final. Then she set about suing the United States Tennis Association for gender discrimination - and found the odds firmly stacked against her.
"The Tennis Association and the people on the other side had top New York lawyers. They brought in witness after witness that said I shouldn't be able to play and it was a big case. Then on my side, my lawyer Mike Rosen, he only had one witness for me," says Richards.

But that witness proved crucial - she was one of the greatest players in the history of the women's game, a former world number one who was still playing on the circuit.
"My lawyer handed over an affidavit from Billie Jean King that said she had met me, that I was a woman, that I was entitled to play, and that I couldn't be denied. And that was it. We won.
"It was very dramatic, and we all went out and got drunk after we got the verdict," says Richards.
The court victory prompted her to turn professional, but she then faced a struggle to get other players to accept her.
"I had death threats, I had people that hated me, I had people that told me I was immoral, and people told me I was awful. There were some players who would walk off the court when I played them or they wouldn't play me at all.
"There was a lot of objection in the beginning and then finally they realised I was OK and I wasn't going to take everybody's money away and gradually a lot of those that had been against me ended up being very good friends of mine.

"I was 43 years old and embarking on a professional career playing against Chrissie Evert, Tracy Austin, and Andrea Jaeger, and they're all 19 and 20 years old. So I had a pretty good disadvantage in terms of age but I said, 'I'm going to do it for a little while and see how I like it,'" says Richards.
In the first round of the women's singles at the 1977 US Open Richards faced that year's Wimbledon champion, Virginia Wade.
"I was on centre court in the stadium at Forest Hills and Virginia Wade had been used to that situation her whole life and I hadn't been. No matter how much good tennis I had played as an amateur there's nothing that compares to playing as a pro in the US Open on centre court.
"I remember she beat me pretty easily in the first set, 6-1. We had a very close second set as I got going and she finally won it 6-4, and that was it.
It was in the women's doubles at the same 1977 Grand Slam that Richards would achieve her best result.
"In the doubles nobody gave my partner Betty Ann Stuart and I much of a chance because nobody had ever heard of us. We won the first round and the second and then all of a sudden we're in the finals of the US Open doubles. We played Martina Navratilova and Betty Stove and we lost to them 7-6 in the second set.
"We stood up there on the podium at Forest Hills on that beautiful Indian summer day, and the band was playing, and they were presenting the prizes. I turned to my partner Betty Ann after we received the silver bowl for being the runners up and I said under my breath, 'Next year we'll be back here for the gold bowl.'"

As it happened, Stuart did not return, and although Richards returned with another partner the following year they were knocked out in the second round.
Richards continued to play in the US and Latin America until retiring in 1981. Despite being banned from tournaments in Europe she briefly reached 20th position in the Women's Tennis Association world rankings.
"I never beat any of the first five women in the world. I didn't beat Martina, I didn't beat Chrissie Evert, but I did have wins over some of the players in the second five. So I was up there but I wasn't at the very top," she says.
After retiring Richards remained in tennis and coached Martina Navratilova to victory in all of the four Grand Slam tournaments. Afterwards she resumed her career as an eye surgeon and now, aged 80, she is planning on retiring later this year.
She is the only player in history to play top-level tennis in both the men's and women's competitions. Initially, Richards says she was overwhelmed by the thousands of people who would try to catch a glimpse of her at tournaments.
"I was not set out for that. I mean I wouldn't say I was reclusive, because I wasn't - I was captain of every team I was on - but I was a quiet person and I lived a private life and now all of a sudden everybody in the world knows who I am.
"I became a public figure, a reluctant pioneer, for all of the disenfranchised groups in the world, no matter whether they were transgender, gay or lesbian."

        <title>Why bankers believe Greece will do a deal with its creditors</title>
        <Link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33283005#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa</Link>
        <Description>Why bankers think Greece and the EU will eventually agree</Description>
        <MainBody>From the section Business
comments
It is going to be 24 hours from hell for Greek bankers (and of course for the Greek people).
Senior bank executives tell me they have more than enough cash in their branches to meet whatever demand for withdrawals there may be today - and in fact they believe that the rate of withdrawals by worried customers will remain at a lower level than at the beginning of the week.
"We're OK" says one.
And what about next week? "There is going to be a deal [between the Greek government and its creditors]. That is certain".
His certainty is not based on the increasingly sceptical and wary tone of statements and comments from ministers and officials in Brussels, crucible of the negotiations.
It stems from financial logic. If there were to be no deal, the consequences for the Greek banking system would be cataclysmic - and the knock-on to the Greek economy would be dire.
Bankers have been warned by the Bank of Greece, the Greek central bank, that no deal means the probable end of emergency liquidity assistance, or the loans they receive both to finance withdrawals by worried investors and to fund vital short-term loans to the Greek government.
if you woke up tomorrow to be told that there was no way of getting money out of your bank, you will understand why this is not a prospect any rational minister or banker would wish to contemplate
So it also means, they've been told (as if they needed telling), that the Greek government would have to impose capital controls - or severe limits on cash withdrawals - were the liquidity tap to be turned off.
However there would be several days of bank holidays, or branch and ATM closures, before customers were permitted to withdraw any money under the circumstances of capital controls - because legislation would need to pass through the parliament to impose such controls.
If you conduct a thought experiment about what it would mean if you woke up tomorrow to be told that there was no way of getting money out of your bank, you will understand why this is not a prospect any rational minister or banker would wish to contemplate.
Apart from the short-term blow to confidence and economic activity, the current drought of lending by banks would turn into a nuclear winter.
Greek businessmen tell me it is hard enough - and ludicrously expensive - for them to finance investment and exports right now. In the circumstances of capital controls, many Greek companies would collapse, because the banks would no longer have the capacity to provide any credit at all - pending the recapitalisation, or resurrection, of the banking system.
The point is that Greek banks not only have a liquidity problem, a chronic problem borrowing and taking in deposits. Their solvency would also be in question - because something like a third of all their loans are classed as "non-performing" (borrowers are struggling to keep up the payments) and because around a half of their capital resources are tax-refund claims (so-called deferred tax assets) on a government seen to be close to defaulting on its obligations.
So in the unlikely event that you have missed the point, today's talks in Brussels are not just about whether Greece can make its 1.5bn-euro payment to the IMF next week. It is about whether the Greek banking system can be maintained as a going concern.
But don't however conclude please that the Greek government has everything to lose and its creditors - eurozone governments, the ECB and the IMF - will be immune from harm if it all goes spectacularly wrong.
The damage to the eurozone, and indeed to the wider European Union, would be potentially devastating.
Here are just a few illustrations.
The hard and painful reality of the Greek banking system in turmoil would lead, inevitably, to capital shifting from banks in economies perceived to be weaker - Portugal, Spain and Italy, inter alia - to the stronger north, especially Germany.
This would increase the cost and decrease the availability of finance in those weaker economies, and stymie their nascent recoveries. It would also widen the damaging economic inequality between the eurozone's flourishing north and its struggling south.
The only beneficiary, arguably, of Greek anomie would be a Russia under President Putin looking for new allies
Second, there would probably be colossal losses for the European Central Bank and therefore for eurozone taxpayers.
Having provided, directly and via the Bank of Greece, something like 120bn euros of loans to Greek banks, the ECB has in effect financed around 100bn euros of capital flight from Greek banks. Of this an estimated 45bn euros is cash under mattresses and buried in gardens, with the rest moved to overseas banks.
All of that cash and exported money represents hard "promises to pay" by the European Central Bank. By contrast the collateral it has received for its loans from the Greek government would be of questionable value.
The reputational damage to the European Central Bank, were it to incur severe losses, could imperil its primary responsibility - namely to maintain confidence in the euro as a store of value.
Without a deal, would the protests in Greece turn to riots?
And finally, if you get back to that thought experiment of what it would mean for an entire banking system to be closed for days and impaired for months, it would be naive to expect anything but fury from Greek people. Recriminations would fly against their own government and - inevitably - against Germany and the rest of the eurozone.
Diplomats working in Athens have told me of their anxiety that there would probably be riots. There is a risk of political extremists seizing this bleak day.
Social breakdown in Greece, the cradle of civilisation, would be more than embarrassing for the European Union. If the EU means anything, it means a collective endeavour to provide peace and stability in Europe.
The only beneficiary, arguably, of Greek anomie would be a Russia under President Putin looking for new allies.
So just maybe Greek bankers are right when they tell me that agreement will imminently be reached between Greece and its creditors - because the alternative is nightmarishly unthinkable.

        <MainBody>South Africa frustration at Marikana deaths inquiry
By Milton Nkosi BBC News, Johannesburg
26 June 2015
From the section Africa
A total of 44 people died during the strike, including 34 in one police operation
President Jacob Zuma's release of the 600-page Marikana report has sparked yet another national conversation about the rule of law in South Africa.
This follows hot on the heels of the Omar al-Bashir controversy , and the trials of Oscar Pistorius and Shrien Dewani .
Was the report a whitewash? Ferial Haffajee, editor of the weekend newspaper City Press, tweeted : "Sticking my neck out: I don't think 'whitewash' sticks."
Many South Africans took to social media to condemn the report, especially its recommendations.
They wanted to see a huge political figure, such as Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, take responsibility for his actions.
At the time, Mr Ramaphosa was a shareholder in Lonmin, the owner of the Marikana mine.
But President Zuma was reading the commission's recommendations. These were not his findings.
Some South Africans wanted to see Cyril Ramaphosa (left, pictured with Jacob Zuma) found guilty
Reports of this nature appear to be simple but they are full of legalese. A lot of the conclusions are left to interpretation or suggest another investigation.
One can sympathise with the people who lost loved ones three years ago and are utterly frustrated by the idea of yet another inquiry.
If an investigation is launched by prosecutors, the trial might drag for a very long time, meaning victims and relatives may never find closure.
While the report apportions some fault to the unions who took part in the wildcat wage strike, much of the blame is aimed squarely at the police .
Police Chief Riah Phiyega seems to be the highest-ranking person likely to take the hit.
Some of her junior staff are vulnerable too, such as the regional police chief of the North West province, Lieutenant-General Zukiswa Mbombo.
President Zuma called the deaths at Marikana "horrendous tragedy"
Just before police opened fire on the miners, Lt Gen Mbombo told the media: "Today is D-Day: we are ending this matter".
Last month, she announced she was retiring.
There does not seem to be any politician who is going to take responsibility for the killings of the 44.
There is no way President Zuma could afford to let his trusted deputy Cyril Ramaphosa shoulder some of the blame because that would jeopardise the current leadership succession plan.
If Mr Ramaphosa had to go to prison for sending emails asking the police minister to intervene at the mine during the violent wage strike, there would be a gaping hole in the post-Zuma ANC leadership line-up.
Once the dust settles, we will see whether the police chief will voluntarily step down or if she leaves the man who appointed her no choice but to fire her.
The sad part of this saga is that there are no talks of reparations for the miners who died and most of them were breadwinners.

        <MainBody>Can game theory explain the Greek debt crisis?
26 June 2015
From the section Magazine
The Greek finance minister is an expert in game theory. Could this help predict how the Eurozone negotiations will turn out, asks Marcus Miller, professor of economics at the University of Warwick.
Game theory is what its name implies. It's the use of games to study behaviour and decision-making.
The most famous game of all is the Prisoner's Dilemma. Imagine two prisoners have to choose between confessing and staying silent. If they both stay silent, they both go to jail for one year. If one confesses and the other stays silent, the first goes free and the second gets 20 years. If both confess, they both get five years.
Neither can communicate with the other. So, rationally, what should each do? Sadly for the prisoners - but not the jailer - the answer is for both to confess.
Now, take the situation facing the Greek government, which needs a deal with its eurozone partners within days to secure to avoid defaulting on its debts. Will it have the same unfortunate outcome as the Prisoners' Dilemma?
Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, spent his academic career (which included teaching posts at the University of Essex and the University of East Anglia) studying game theory.
In February 2015, he denied that he was "busily devising bluffs, stratagems and outside options" using game theory to "improve upon a weak hand".
Nevertheless, game theory should apply in situations like this where the outcomes for each player depend on the actions of both. The world being an uncertain place, random chance may also play a role - game theory takes account of this, too.
The Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is an expert on game theory
So how might Varoufakis have visualised negotiations with the rest of the eurozone panning out?
He may well have drawn a decision-tree like that shown below, with Greece and the eurozone partners as key players. He would also include random outside factors, referred to in game theory jargon as "nature", which may also affect the outcome.
The outcomes, known as payoffs, of each player when the game ends are shown in brackets - so (1, 0) would be a good payoff for Greece and a bad one for the eurozone, whereas (1,1) would be good for both and (0,0) would be bad for everyone.
So what does the decision tree imply?
Imagine Greece moves first to avoid default by putting a plan on the table. This plan involves new taxes on the wealthy and changes to pensions - avoiding spending cuts and and having some of its debts written off in exchange. If this plan is accepted by the rest of the eurozone, then Greece is content. Let's give its payoff a score of 1.
To work out how the rest of the eurozone will respond, one has to see what they stand to gain by accepting Greece's plan, or by rejecting it.
If the eurozone accepted this deal, the monetary union would remain intact, but it would have to ease its strict rules on fiscal policy and take a loss on holdings of Greek debt. Let's give the eurozone payoff a score of . So the overall payoff is (1,  ).
What if the eurozone rejected the deal? Then Greece, unable to pay its creditors on time, would be in what is called "technical default".
What follows next is not at all clear. Let's look at two possibilities.
First there could be "Grexit" - Greece alone leaves the eurozone but the other members live happily ever after.
Second, Greek departure leads to the collapse of the eurozone.
The first scenario is likely to be pretty bad for Greece but not for the eurozone - a payoff of (0,1). The second is bad for everyone - the payoff is (0,0).
The truth, of course, is that no one really knows which of these will transpire - here is where nature throws the dice. If the two prospects are equally likely, the expected payoffs look pretty bad for both players.
So what is the bottom line? Faced with the messy prospect of letting Greece slide into default - and the significant risks of chaos that this entails - it looks better for eurozone partners to avert default and accept the Greek plan - or a watered-down version of it - after all.
This is better for Greece too - so unlike the Prisoner's Dilemma both players avoid the bad stuff.
This may be what has been concluded - if so, there will be a settlement with no technical default at the end of the month. But a lot depends on how well the agreed plan works. If it is a botched job, the drama may be repeated. Such is the game of life.

        <Description>High-end designer goods proving big business in Iran</Description>
        <MainBody>Why a luxury-shopping revolution is coming to Iran
By Amir Paivar &amp; Camelia Sadeghzadeh BBC Persian
26 June 2015
From the section Middle East
From the roadside billboards advertising Rolex and Louis Vuitton, to the glitzy shopping centres that have sprung up across Tehran, it's clear that big brands are becoming big business in Iran.
After decades of austerity following the Islamic Revolution , middle-class Iranians have developed a taste for high-end designer goods, and for Tehran's young rich, shopping has become the new religion.
"Exposure to foreign trends through travelling, the internet and satellite television has created a desire for branded products," says Bahar, a 30-year-old fashion blogger.
"Showing off is a big part of the story. By spending huge amounts of money on big brands, well-off Iranians want to show they've made it."
Living the high life
One group of super-rich young Tehranis have taken showing off to new levels with their own Instagram site - Rich Kids of Tehran , where without any perceptible sense of irony, they post pictures of their designer clothes and designer lifestyles.
When the site first appeared last year it prompted fury and resentment among poorer Iranians and the conservatives who dominate Iran's political and legal institutions.
But the Rich Kids seem undeterred by the controversy.
The Rich Kids of Tehran's Instagram feed features high-end vehicles
Recent postings include pictures of Tehran Fashion Week and a question about where people are going on holiday this year - the responses range from Italy and Istanbul to Japan and Dubai.
Because luxury brands are still the preserve of the rich, they don't yet show up in the Iranian Customs Authority's list of top 100 imports.
But there is an indication of the potential for growth in the most recent figures for cosmetics imports.
In the year to March 2015, cosmetics made up 0.1% of the country's $52bn (32.8bn) total imports - many of them big name brands snapped up by increasingly image-conscious consumers.
Mall envy
Iranians shop at the main old bazaar in Tehran
In big cities all across Iran, traditional bazaars now face fierce competition from American-style urban shopping centres where big name Western brands are on conspicuous display.
But although these luxury shopping centres look exactly the same as retail outlets anywhere in the world, the designer goods on display have actually been brought in by third-party importers via Turkey and the Gulf States.
The outlets that sell them have no connection to the big brand manufacturers.
Big Western fashion brands are not banned from doing business in Iran.
But international banking sanctions in place against Iran over its nuclear programme make it very difficult for them to get their profits out.
To date Spanish clothing retailer Mango, Italian fashion boutique Benetton, and luxury women's designer Escada, are among the very few Western companies to open shops in Iran.
Strict Islamic dress code in Iran also applies to advertising, so companies either have to show women fully covered, or just show the clothes on their own
The backdoor way in which foreign brands are imported into Iran means they are more expensive than they would be abroad, but so far this doesn't seem to be deterring the shoppers.
Mariam, an office worker who earns the equivalent of just $17,000 a year, has just blown more than a month's salary on a new Burberry bag.
She bought it online from an Iranian website that offers clothes and accessories from big brands and Western High Street retailers.
The site takes payments via local credit cards, and offers a free home-delivery service.
In the vanguard: Luxury retailers in Iran
Luciano Benetton
Benetton was the brainchild of Italian Luciano Benetton, who launched the company back in 1963 with his sister and two brothers.
Benetton now has about 5,000 stores, employing more than 10,000 people.
Mango was founded in Barcelona, Spain, launched on the web in 2005, opening its first shop in 2000.
Mango now has 2,731 stores in 105 countries.
Escada was founded in 1978 by Margaretha and Wolfgang Ley in Munich, Germany.
Escada has shops in 80 countries worldwide.
Mariam told BBC Persian she would rather pay more for good-quality brand names than cheaper but inferior, locally made equivalents.
But she concedes that status also plays a big role in how she decides to spend her money.
"There's a lot of pressure on middle-class people to go out wearing designer clothes or an expensive watch," she says. "Personally I feel more confident when I'm wearing brands."
'Untapped market'
Fashion houses like Burberry currently have no control over this so-called "grey market" of their brand names in Iran.
But that is clearly something which could change.
Despite years of sanctions, the International Monetary Fund puts Iran's per capita GDP (gross domestic product) at $16,500.
That means Iranian consumers on average have more money to spend than their counterparts in emerging markets like Brazil, China, India and South Africa.
With the prospect of banking sanctions being lifted if a nuclear deal is finally reached, the big brands are waking up to the potential of a barely tapped market which could offer big dividends in the future.

        <MainBody>Greek debt: ECB 'to maintain funding limit'
28 June 2015
From the section Europe
Greek banks are reliant on emergency support from the ECB
The European Central Bank says it will maintain its emergency funding of Greek banks at the level agreed on Friday.
The ECB said that it stood ready to review the decision on its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) and would work closely with the Bank of Greece.
BBC economics editor Robert Peston says the ECB is not providing any additional aid to Greece, which will lead to huge pressure for capital controls.
Greek banks depend on ELA, and cutting it could push Greece out of the euro.
An ECB spokesman told the BBC: "Greece still has access to the ELA."
The ECB statement quotes Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras as saying: "The Bank of Greece, as a member of the eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances."
The statement comes after eurozone finance minsters on Saturday refused a Greek request to extend Greece's current bailout.
The bailout expires on Tuesday, the same day that Greece has to make a payment of  1.5bn (1.1bn) to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it risks defaulting on.
Greece and its creditors had been locked in negotiations over a new bailout on Friday when the Greek government called a surprise referendum for 5 July over whether to accept the terms it was being offered. It has described the international offer as "not viable".
It then asked for an extension of its current deal until after the vote was completed.

7 July 2015
From the section Africa
Mr Lazarevic was France's last remaining hostage when he was released
French special forces have killed a militant Islamist in Mali who was said to have been freed in exchange for the release of French Serge Lazarevic.
Ali Ag Wadossene, a senior member of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed in northern Kidal city, a French army statement said.
Two other militants were captured in the operation, it added.
France sent troops to Mali in January 2013 to prevent the militants from over-running the capital, Bamako.
Latest African news updates
Mr Lazarevic was abducted by AQIM in 2011 and freed last December.
Mr Wadossene and another militant, Heiba Ag Acherif, were jailed in Mali for allegedly being involved in his abduction.
Mali's government confirmed at the time that Mr Wadossene was one of four militants who had been freed in return for Mr Lazarevic's release.
Mr Lazarevic said he had been abducted in Mali while on a business trip.
Mali is a former French colony, and is a major producer of cotton and gold.

        <Description>US comedian Bill Cosby admitted in 2005 to obtaining sedatives with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with, court documents say.</Description>
        <MainBody>Bill Cosby admitted he gave woman drugs before sex
7 July 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
The comedian is best known as Dr Cliff Huxtable on The Cosby Show in 1984-92
US comedian Bill Cosby admitted he obtained sedatives with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with, court papers from 2005 show.
The unsealed files, obtained by the Associated Press news agency, show Mr Cosby made the admission in a sex abuse civil case brought by a woman.
That case was settled for an undisclosed sum in 2006.
Mr Cosby, now 77, is facing a series of sexual assault accusations dating back decades. He has denied the claims.
Mr Cosby has never been criminally charged.
The documents came to light after the AP went to court to compel the release of the documents.  Mr Cosby's lawyers tried to stop the release of the papers, arguing it would embarrass their client and reveal personal information.
'I gave her Quaaludes. Then we have sex'
In his 2005 testimony, Mr Cosby admitted that he obtained Quaaludes in the 1970s, with the intent of giving it to women he wanted to have sex with.
The case was brought by Andrea Constand, a former employee of Temple University - the Philadelphia college with which Mr Cosby was once closely associated.
Mr Cosby admitted in 2005 that he intended to give drugs to women he wished to sleep with
The comedian said he had given the sedatives to at least one woman and "other people".
Later in the deposition, he said: "I meet Ms T (another woman whose name was redacted to preserve her anonymity) in Las Vegas. She meets me back stage. I give her Quaaludes. We then have sex."
His lawyers said that at least two of those accusing the comedian had knowingly taken the sedative.
In his deposition Mr Cosby said he had sex with "Ms T" after giving her Quaaludes
Mr Cosby also admitted to offering money to Ms Constand, and other women who had made allegations, in the form of educational trusts.
Testifying later in the case, Mr Cosby said that he had given Ms Constand one and a half pills of the over-the-counter antihistamine drug Benadryl.
Mr Cosby has yet to comment on his released testimony.
Timeline of allegations against Bill Cosby
2002: Lachele Covington, a 20-year-old actress, reportedly files a police report saying she had been inappropriately touched. No further action was taken.
2005: Andrea Constand sues Mr Cosby for sexual assault. The case is eventually settled out of court in 2006.
2014: Over the year, dozens of women make public accusations that Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them. Live shows are cancelled across the country amid protests
November 2014: TV network NBC scraps plans for a new show with the comedian following allegations by TV presenter Janice Dickinson that he had assaulted her in 1982. Repeats of the Cosby Show are also pulled from cable TV
December 2014: Judy Huth sues Mr Cosby for molesting her in 1974 when she was 15 years old. Mr Cosby counter-sues, claiming she is trying to extort money from him
May 2015: Mr Cosby speaks publicly about the allegations for the first time. "I can't speak; I just don't want to argue; I don't talk about it," he told ABC News.
Best known as Dr Cliff Huxtable on The Cosby Show in 1984-92, the comedian is facing a number of allegations dating back to the 1960s.
Most of the claims of sexual assault are barred by statutes of limitations. They restrict the length of time in which legal actions can be taken after an alleged crime has been committed.
The accusations, which Mr Cosby has described as "fantastical" and "uncorroborated", have led to some of his stand-up shows being called off and the cancellation of some TV projects.

        <MainBody>Migrant dies on Channel Tunnel train trying to reach UK
7 July 2015
From the section England
Cross-Channel passengers and freight services are facing delays following the incident at 05:00 BST
A migrant who is believed to have jumped onto a freight train heading for Britain has died, Eurotunnel has said.
The Channel Tunnel operator tweeted that the shuttle had been stopped following the incident on the French side at about 05:00 BST.
The death comes days after about 150 migrants tried to storm the Channel Tunnel terminal in France.
Passengers and freight services are facing delays with Eurotunnel advising some customers to rearrange travel.
'Jump injuries'
John Keef from Eurotunnel said: "Migrants were seen onboard a truck shuttle approaching the tunnel at about half-past-five this morning.
"We brought the shuttle to a controlled stop [and] cut the electrical power overhead.
"Police conducted a search at the end of which they found a migrant dead from injuries sustained probably from trying to jump on to the shuttle."
It is the second migrant fatality in as many weeks following the reported death of an Eritrean while trying to get on a train at Coquelles last month.
Operation Stack, where lorries are parked on the M20 and non-freight traffic diverted off the motorway, was re-introduced from 13:00 BST according to Kent Police.
Signs warn about the risk of death on rail tracks ahead of the Channel Tunnel in France
A Eurotunnel spokesman said: "Services are partly suspended, and the disruption is principally affecting freight services.
"Passenger services are running with slight delays."
He added: "We are working very hard to restore full services as soon as possible."
According to reports, there is already congestion on the approach road to the UK terminal in Folkestone and at the Port of Dover.
Highways England tweeted : "#M20 eastbound, delays approaching J11a @LeShuttle terminal. Delays on #A20 btwn Roundhill tunnel and @Port_of_Dover. Caused by hvy traffic."

        <MainBody>Nigeria's Boko Haram crisis: Zaria bomb 'kills 25'
7 July 2015
From the section Africa
Nigeria's soldiers have been fighting the insurgents since 2009
A bomb attack has killed at least 25 people and wounded 32 others in northern Nigeria's Zaria city, the state governor has said.
A suspected suicide bomber targeted civil servants at a government building in the city, witnesses said.
Emergency workers have rushed to the scene to help evacuate the wounded.
Militant Islamist group Boko Haram, which often targets northern Nigeria, has stepped up attacks since President Muhammudu Buhari took office in May.
The group has not yet commented on the latest attack.
It came a day after police chief Solomon Arase announced new measures to curb the rise in bombings. They include:
banning street trading and hawking in the capital, Abuja
strengthening security at all mosques and churches countrywide.
Latest African news updates
Witnesses in Zaria said people including primary school teachers had been queuing up seeking employment under Mr Buhari's administration when the bomb detonated in Zaria's Sabon Gari district.
"We call on our citizens to be vigilant and avoid crowded places like markets, mosques, churches and motor parks in the next few weeks," Kaduna state governor Nasir El-Rufa'i said on his Twitter account .
Mr El-Rufa'i said the government was working with the security agencies to end the wave of militant attacks in the country.
Buhari blamed
More than 200 people were killed in attacks blamed on Boko Haram last week.
On Sunday two bombings in Jos, Plateau state, left at least 44 people dead.
Men held on suspicion of being affiliated to Boko Haram line up to be released by the Nigerian military in Maiduguri
On Monday, a young girl believed to be just 13 was killed when explosives strapped to her body detonated near a mosque in Kano city, the biggest in northern Nigeria.
Some analysts link the upsurge in bombings to Mr Buhari's decision to remove military checkpoints countrywide on the grounds that internal security was the responsibility of police, reports the BBC's Bashir Sa'ad  Abdullahi from Abuja.
Plateau state governor Simon Lalong has called on Mr Buhari to reverse his decision, saying checkpoints made it more difficult for militants to move around.
Meanwhile, military spokesman Colonel Sani Usman told the BBC that 100 men, 24 women and dozens of children accused of links to Boko Haram had been freed.
Some has spent months in custody but investigations revealed that they were innocent, Col Usman added.
Regional forces have been battling Boko Haram in north-eastern Nigeria, and have recaptured all major cities and towns from the group.
Boko Haram at a glance
Founded in 2002, initially focused on opposing Western-style education - Boko Haram means "Western education is forbidden" in the Hausa language
Launched military operations in 2009
Pledged allegiance to Islamic State, calling itself West African Province
Thousands killed, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria, hundreds abducted, including at least 200 schoolgirls
Seized vast area in north-east, where it declared caliphate in 2014
Regional force retaken most territory

        <MainBody>Spanish dictator Franco names to go from Madrid streets
7 July 2015
From the section Europe
Gen Franco's dictatorship came to an end in 1975
The new left-wing council in the Spanish capital Madrid has said it plans to remove all names relating to Gen Francisco Franco's dictatorship in streets and squares.
Many streets were renamed under a 2007 "historical memory" law on replacing symbols of Franco's 1939-75 rule.
But some 167 streets are still named after regime figures.
Spain's new left-wing mayor, Manuela Carmena, was an anti-Franco lawyer in the later years of the dictatorship.
She took over in Madrid after years of centre-right Popular Party rule. Her predecessor, Ana Botella, was among 38 mayors accused by a human rights lawyer earlier this year of dragging their feet removing symbols of Franco's rule.
Franco had the Arco de la Victoria erected as a tribute to his Nationalist army's victory over Republicans
Although the Madrid council spokeswoman admitted there was "no concrete plan" to start changing street names, she said it would be carried out in co-ordination with local districts and civil society groups.
Among the streets highlighted by Spanish media are the street of the Fallen of the Blue Division, a unit that served with the Nazis during World War Two, and Arriba Espana square, which refers to Spain's old fascist Falange party.
Several vestiges of Franco's dictatorship remain on historic buildings in Madrid, including a victory arch at one of the entrances to the city, several defence buildings and the El Pardo and Santa Cruz palaces.

        <MainBody>WHO 'unfit for health emergencies'
By Michelle Roberts Health editor, BBC News online
7 July 2015
From the section Health
The Ebola crisis proves the World Health Organization (WHO) lacks the "capacity and culture" to deal with global health emergencies, says a damning independent report, commissioned by the WHO itself.
The review panel says WHO was too slow to act to get on top of the deadly virus which has now killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.
And it calls for an urgent overhaul of the organisation.
WHO says it has plans for reform.
It has already admitted that it waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern.
Inaction
The disease began spreading in December 2013, but it took until August 2014 for WHO to sound the alarm. By that point, more than 1,000 people had died of the virus.
The death toll now stands at more than 11,000.
According to the report, WHO lacked a culture of rapid decision-making.
In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent about the seriousness of the situation but these "either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance".
"There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action," the report says.
WHO was also criticised for failing to keep governments and the public up to speed about the extent and severity of the outbreak.
But the review praised WHO for playing a critical role in pushing forward work to find new treatments and cures for Ebola.
And it said WHO should be given the job of leading future health emergency responses - be that for Ebola or an outbreak of pandemic flu, for example.
It suggests an immediate contribution from all member countries towards a $100 million special outbreak response fund, and says WHO should establish a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response.
The panel's head, Dame Barbara Stocking, former chief executive of the charity Oxfam, said the WHO must now be made fit for the task.
"To me, coming from somewhere like Oxfam which is an emergency culture, you are very much, if you like, on the front foot. You are always trying to prevent a situation coming through or grab it when it starts and really get it under control very fast and those are some of the internal changes that have to be made at WHO."
The WHO said it was "already moving forward on some of the panel's recommendations including the development of the global health emergency workforce and the contingency fund to ensure the necessary resources are available to mount an initial response".
Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said: "The recommendations outlined by the independent panel should give WHO the mandate it needs to lead the global response to future health crises. The proposal to establish a WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response is encouraging.
"It's essential that this new body is accountable and can show leadership in the face of emerging health threats, with the authority and independence to act quickly when needed. The support of the global community is also crucial if we are to avert another catastrophe on the scale of Ebola."

From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
USA are the first nation to win three Women's World Cups
The Women's World Cup final has become the most-watched football game ever in the United States.
Sunday's match, in which the US beat Japan 5-2, was seen by a record 25.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings data.
It shatters the previous record, set during the 2014 Brazil World Cup, when 18.2 million tuned in to see the USA play Portugal.
The audience peaked at 30.9 million between 01:30 and 01:45 BST.
Viewers saw Carli Lloyd score an incredible 13-minute hat-trick, as the United States trounced Japan to win their third Women's World Cup title, following victories in 1991 and 1999.
The latter was seen by 18 million viewers, the previous highest audience for a women's match.
Sunday's game, which was held in Vancouver, beat big-brand shows like Big Brother on CBS and Celebrity Family Feud on ABC; while broadcaster Fox Sports saw 14.6 million people stick around for its post-match analysis.
In the UK, conversely, the culmination of the tournament saw a steep drop in audience figures. Just 500,000 viewers - or 13% of the total television audience - stayed up to watch the final.
Four days earlier, England's quarter-final match was seen by an average audience of 1.7 million, with a 32% share of the audience.

According to his publicist, he died of heart failure on Monday at his home in Santa Barbara, California.
Weintraub started his career in the music industry, promoting tours for Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra, before moving into film production.
Ocean's Eleven star Clooney and former US President George HW Bush are among those who have paid tribute.
"In the coming days there will be tributes," said Clooney in a statement. "We'll laugh at his great stories, and applaud his accomplishments.
"And in the years to come, the stories and accomplishments will get better with age, just as Jerry would have wanted it. But not today. Today our friend died."
The producer made three Ocean's films with (l to r) Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon
"Jerry was an American original, who earned his success by the sheer force of his instinct, drive, and larger-than-life personality," said Bush.
"He had a passion for life. And throughout the ups and downs of his prolific career it was clear just how much he loved show business."
"So sad at loss of Jerry Weintraub, you were 1 of a kind, my friend," tweeted Ralph Macchio , who starred in the first three Karate Kid films.
The actor, now 53, described the producer as being the "last of a breed," adding: "So glad I got to be 'that kid.'''
Others to tweet tributes include actress Goldie Hawn , who described Weintraub as "a friend [and] a powerhouse of light that graced our lives with spirit and joy."
"So sad and shocked that a creative spirit like Jerry Weintraub's could EVER be silenced," tweeted Rob Lowe, who worked with the producer on Emmy and Golden Globe-winning TV movie Behind the Candelabra.
The producer's most recent credits include HBO comedy series The Brink and a new version of the Tarzan story, due out next year.
The New York-born producer worked in artist management and concert promotion before turning to movies
Jerome Charles Weintraub, a native New Yorker, was born in Brooklyn in 1937 and raised in the Bronx. As a teenager he served in the Air Force as a radio operator.
He went on to work in the mailroom at MCA Records and rose through the ranks before leaving to form his own management company.
Moving into films, he quickly enjoyed success as the executive producer of Robert Altman's 1975 film Nashville.
Yet not all his films were hits, Weintraub suffering a notable flop in 1998 with the film version of TV show The Avengers.
"The secret to my success is the people that I associate myself with and work with,'' Weintraub said in 2010. ''I work with the greatest artists and I respect them."
He is survived by his four children and his longtime partner, Susan Ekins.

        <MainBody>Kenya: Al-Shabab kills quarry workers in Mandera gun attack
7 July 2015
From the section Africa
Kenya Red Cross are flying some of the casualties to the capital
At least 14 people have been killed and several others wounded in a gun attack near a military camp at the Kenyan border with Somalia.
It is believed the victims were workers from a local quarry in Mandera county in the north-east of the country.
Residents told the BBC they had heard two explosions, followed by heavy gunfire in the middle of a night.
Militia group al-Shabab, which operates out of Somalia, has confirmed to the BBC it carried out the attack.
Mandera County Commissioner Alex Ole Nkoyo told AFP that people were sleeping when the gunmen struck.
"They just came and hurled explosives in the houses," he said.
Kenya Red Cross said it was sending an aircraft to the scene to fly the injured to hospitals in Nairobi.
Constant threat
In December 2014 al-Shabab killed 36 quarry workers in Mandera town.
On that occasion they attacked while the workers were sleeping and shot the non-Muslims dead after separating them from Muslims.
Their deadliest assault to date happened at a university in the Kenyan town of Garissa in April, when four gunmen killed 148 people.
In 2013, at least 67 people died in a gun attack on the Westgate mall in the capital Nairobi.
Analysis: Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa Security correspondent
People from other parts of Kenya working in the north-east have threatened to leave the area following frequent al-Shabab attacks.
The Islamist group has carried out numerous attacks near the long porous border with Somalia.
This latest incident is likely to put the spotlight on the Kenyan authorities again over their handling of the security situation.
Just two weeks ago the government lifted a night-time curfew in the area after Muslim clerics said it impeded prayers during the month of Ramadan.

        <Description>Kenya's single bank boss intrigues the press when he turns down a free house to live in a religious community.</Description>
        <MainBody>Patrick Njoroge: Kenyan bank boss who doesn't want luxury house
7 July 2015
From the section Africa
Kenya's new central bank governor rejected the grand house that comes with his prestigious job. The BBC's Abdinoor Maalim writes this is a rare move which has created a lot of interest in the single 54-year-old, who is a member of the Catholic group Opus Dei.
Kenyans are enthralled by the new central bank governor. And it is not because they are wondering what he is going to do about the Kenyan shilling weakening against other currencies.
Patrick Njoroge seems to be from a different planet altogether.
His "refusal to take his turn to eat is surprising" says business columnist Otieno Otieno in the Daily Nation . While Victor Nyakachunga writes in the Standard "many were challenged" by him opting for the simple life.
Kenyans are used to senior government officials leading lavish lifestyles.
It is an issue which has provoked protest, not least when parliamentarians awarded themselves a pay rise of 319,000 shillings ($3,200; 2,100) a month, less than two months after being sworn in in 2013.
Mr Njoroge's predecessors in the central bank lived in the luxurious Muthaiga Estate in Nairobi.
They drove Range Rovers or Mercedes Benz accompanied by security cars.
The house is famous for its beautiful gardens which are used to host parties.
It is near the residences of the US and UK foreign envoys and Kenya's former President Mwai Kibaki.
The Central bank governor's abode is in the same neighbourhood as former President Mwai Kibaki
Mr Njoroge has dismissed these perks, preferring to live in a communal house in Nairobi's Loresho estate.
He went to live with his fellow members of an organisation of the Roman Catholic church called Opus Dei.
The organisation, which means "work of God" in Latin, teaches that ordinary life is a path to sanctity.
It is widely credited with developing his humble stance.
The Opus Dei website says members aim at "humility, justice, integrity, and solidarity" and to work "hard and well, honestly and fairly".
"In God's eyes, what matters is the love people put into their work, not its success in terms of money or fame," it adds.
What is Opus Dei?
A branch of the Catholic Church founded in 1928
Has a reputation for secrecy
Featured in the Dan Brown bestseller The Da Vinci Code where a member whips himself until he bleeds
Self-flagellation is an expression of remorse for sins
The Opus Dei website says members do perform penance and sacrifice but "not like the distorted and exaggerated depiction in The Da Vinci Code"
Offered a wife
When he was being vetted by MPs for the governor position, he surprised the committee by revealing he didn't own any property in Kenya.
That is despite commanding a presumably large salary in his previous job as an advisor to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Deputy Managing Director.
"I don't have a single asset here in Kenya," he said.
"It doesn't mean that this how it will be forever. I subscribe to being very deliberate about that. This is my economic model and maybe years after retirement, I would want to invest in other things," he said.
But it is not the only element of the banker's private life which has caused a stir.
He is also single.
MPs were so intrigued by Mr Njoroge's marital status that he was asked about it during the vetting process - a move BBC Trending reports was mocked online.
The MPs gave him a rare offer. When they found out he was single they requested to get him a wife.
"I am single by choice - it's not because there's a problem or shortage," he replied.
Kenya's CTV asked focused on Mr Njoroge marital status
His character has attracted offers of marriage and admiration on Twitter.
"And then, that new #CBKGovernor just made me re evaluate my life goals..man is so humble and content." tweeted an inspired Anthony Mbugua .
His colleagues are equally taken by him.
"Totally devoid of ego and instinctively averse to self-advertisement," is how a senior treasury official and long-serving central banker described him.
Kenyans hope his austere nature means he will keep their luxury-loving politicians in check and safeguard their economic future.

        <title>Fraser a 'blatant racist' - Kyrgios</title>
        <Link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/33421964</Link>
        <Description>Nick Kyrgios calls Australian Olympic swimming great Dawn Fraser a "blatant racist" after comments on his Wimbledon exit.</Description>
        <MainBody>Wimbledon 2015: Nick Kyrgios calls Dawn Fraser a 'blatant racist'
Wimbledon 2015
Dates: Until Sunday 12 July
Play: Centre Court and Court One 13:00 BST
BBC coverage: TV, radio and online with up to 15 live streams. Read More: TV and radio schedules.
Nick Kyrgios says Australian Olympic swimming great Dawn Fraser is a "blatant racist" after she said players should "go back to where their parents came from" if they cannot behave.
Australian Kyrgios, who has a Greek father and Malaysian mother, appeared to stop trying during his defeat by Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon.
The 20-year-old was also given a code violation for bad language.
Fraser later "unreservedly" apologised for her comments.
In her initial interview on Australian television, Fraser, who won the 100m freestyle at three successive Olympic Games from 1956 to 1964, said: "It's absolutely disgusting.
"I am so shocked to think that he went out there to play and he tanked, he did all that tanking, that's terrible."
Kyrgios was involved in a running battle with the umpire in his defeat by Gasquet
The 77-year-old was also discussing fellow Australian Bernard Tomic, who was born in Germany and has a Croatian father and Bosnian mother, during her interview.
Tomic, 22, accused Tennis Australia of abandoning him after he had hip surgery last year and will not be chosen for his country's Davis Cup tie against Kazakhstan in Darwin later this month.
Fraser added: "They should be setting a better example for the younger generation of this country, a great country of ours.
"If they don't like it, go back to where their fathers or their parents came from. We don't need them here in this country if they act like that."
Kyrgios was beaten 7-5 6-1 6-7 (7-9) 7-6 (8-6) by Gasquet and was booed when he appeared to stop trying in the second set after being given a code violation for bad language.
He repeatedly clashed with British umpire James Keothavong, including an altercation over how long the 26th seed was taking to change his socks between games.
Kyrgios linked to Fraser's interview on his Facebook page and responded: "Throwing a racket, brat. Debating the rules, disrespectful. Frustrated when competing, spoilt. Showing emotion, arrogant. Blatant racist, Australian legend."
Fraser apologises unreservedly
Fraser denied her comments were racist before later issuing an apology.
"Australians have a rich sporting heritage made up of individuals from a variety of different countries of origin," she said.
"My intended message, which was not delivered as articulately as it could have been, was on a purely sporting level rather than meant as an attack on Nick's ethnicity.
"Nick's representing Australia and I want to see him representing Australian tennis in the best possible light. "
McEnroe on Kyrgios: "He should have admitted he tapped out and lost it for that period of time"
'I'll give you the racquet'
In his post-match news conference, Kyrgios clashed with journalists and denied that he stopped trying in the second set.
"Do you want to try and return Richard Gasquet's serve?" he said.
"I'll give you the racquet and we'll see how many times you can return his serve also. He served too good."
He added: "Of course I tried. He hits a serve past me as an ace, that's too good. I did move."
'He's going to wish he didn't do it'
BBC Sport pundit John McEnroe was famed for his temper during his playing career but believes the 'tanking' incident was "completely unprofessional".
5 of the best from Gasquet v Kyrgios
"The pressure got to him," McEnroe told Wimbledon 2Day. "A lot of this is overblown, but you can't condone what he did.
"I'm a big defender of Nick Kyrgios, I think he's going to be a great player and he's going to learn. He should have admitted he tapped out and lost it for that period of time.
"He's going to wish he didn't do it and realise he made an ass out of himself."
He added: "I believe he should be himself, he's the kind of fresh face we need plus he can play."
'He's different off court'
British number one and 2013 Wimbledon winner Andy Murray had some sympathy for the pressure Kyrgios is under.
"I don't think people always appreciate how difficult it is to grow up under the spotlight, how difficult it is to have loads of people expecting you to be perfect from a young age," said Murray.
"I like Nick. I've spoken to him away from the court. He's quite different to how he is on it."

        <MainBody>Zambian writer Namwali Serpell to share Caine prize money
7 July 2015
From the section Africa
Namwali Serpell has promised to split her winnings with the four other runners up
US-based Zambian writer Namwali Serpell has promised to share her winnings in the Caine Prize for African Writing with the runners up.
She received the 10,000 ($15,600) prize for her short story The Sack.
The judges described it as "innovative, stylistically stunning, haunting and enigmatic".
Ms Serpell was among five writers short-listed for the prize, regarded as Africa's leading literary award.
Two South Africans and two Nigerians were also shortlisted for the prize - Masande Ntshanga for Space, FT Kola for A Party for the Colonel, Elnathan John for Flying and Segun Afolabi for The Folded Leaf.
Ms Serpell told BBC Newsday that the promise to share the winnings was "an act of mutiny".
"I wanted to change the structure of the prize.
"It is very awkward to be placed into this position of competition with other writers that you respect immensely and you feel yourself put into a sort of American idol or race-horse situation when actually, you all want to support each other."
The chair of judges, Zoe Wicomb, awarded the prize at a dinner held at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University in the UK.
The short story "yields fresh meaning with every reading," she said.
In The Sack, two men who live together their whole lives love one woman but don't know which one of them she loves.
"One of the men has a series of backwards moving dreams about his own death and he becomes very paranoid about the other man," Ms Serpell said.

        <MainBody>Miss Universe defends keeping crown despite Trump row
7 July 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Paulina Vega, 22, won the 2014 Miss Universe pageant last January in Miami
The reigning Miss Universe says she will not give up her crown, despite her home country Colombia withdrawing its bid to host the competition.
Paulina Vega had come under pressure to quit after her country's condemnation of the pageant owner, Donald Trump.
Mr Trump caused a furore last month after he said Mexican immigrants who came to the US brought drugs and crime.
Ms Vega called Mr Trump's comments "unjust and hurtful", but said she would continue as Miss Universe.
"The fact that I am not giving up my crown doesn't mean I am changing my stance about everything I said," Ms Vega told local radio on Monday, adding that the Miss Universe organisation did meaningful social work.
"I have kept doing my job as Miss Universe all these days. The work continues as always despite all this craziness going on," she added.
Boycott
Mr Trump had attacked Ms Vega for keeping her crown, saying: "Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, criticised me for telling the truth about illegal immigration, but then said she would keep the crown - hypocrite."
While announcing his candidacy for the US presidency last month, Mr Trump had accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to the United States.
He also pledged to build a "great wall" on the US border with Mexico and insisted it would be paid for by Mexicans.
He later insisted he was criticising US lawmakers, not Mexican people.
Following Mr Trump's remarks, several TV networks across the Americas said they would no longer air Miss Universe, including the Spanish language network, Univision and NBC.
Mexico also announced that it would not send a contestant to the pageant.

        <MainBody>Chicago boy, 7, among victims as gun violence sweeps city
6 July 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
Amari Brown, 7, was shot and killed in the Humboldt Park section of the city
Gun violence in Chicago at the weekend left 10 people dead, including a 7-year-old boy, and more than 50 wounded.
Amari Brown was shot in the chest by a gunman who was targeting his father, a known gang member, according to police.
Police chief Garry McCarthy said the boy's father should not have been on the streets, telling reporters: "If [he] is in custody, his son is alive".
Despite the multiple shootings since Thursday, the number of incidents was lower than in the same period in 2014.
Last year, 16 people were shot dead and more than 80 others were injured, according to the Chicago Tribune.
The worst period at the weekend came between 21:00 on Saturday and 05:00 on Sunday, when 30 people were shot as residents celebrated Independence Day.
Among the other incidents, a 17-year-old was shot dead as he played basketball and a 19-year-old was injured as rival gangs fought near Navy Pier after the fireworks display there.
Chicago's police chief said the city needed to do more to punish those behind the violence
The shootings happened despite a 30% increase in the number of police officers on patrol in the city over the weekend, Mr McCarthy said.
He said police in the city recovered one illegal gun per hour across the city. "We must stem the flow of guns into the city," he said.
The police force is doing "everything we can to fight this" but the city needs to "repair a broken system", Mr McCarthy said, adding: "Criminals don't feel the repercussions of the justice system."
Chicago has struggled to turn the tide of gun violence for several years and is one of the most deadly in the US.
In 2014, there were 406 homicides across the city - although this was a 3% decrease from 2013, when there were 419 gun-related deaths.

        <MainBody>Canadian charged over bombs sent to Winnipeg law firms
6 July 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
Police said Guido Amsel was targeting lawyers that have represented his ex-wife
Police in Canada have charged a man for sending explosive devices to several businesses in the city of Winnipeg and warned that more could be discovered.
Guido Amsel, 49, targeted law firms that represented him or his ex-wife in a lengthy legal battle, police said .
One bomb exploded at an office last Friday, severely injuring a woman.
Two more explosive devices were found at law firms over the weekend in the city, but they were detonated by police, and no one was injured.
Mr Amsel has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and a number of offences related to possessing explosives.
Maria Mitousis, the 38-year-old injured by the first bomb, represented Mr Amsel's ex-wife during their divorce and a later case.
She is reported to be in a stable condition at a local hospital but suffered several serious injuries to her upper body.
Friends and family of the lawyer set up a fundraising page to help pay for her medical expenses and have so far raised more than $25,000 (16,000).
They said Ms Mitousis faced "a long road to recovery".
Police said more packages may be delivered to other lawyers or justice officials linked to Mr Amsel and urged "extreme caution" over unusual packages.
Winnipeg city hall was evacuated on Monday after reports of a suspicious package but it was given the all clear after police investigated. There was also a similar false alarm at a Canada Post building.

        <MainBody>Pope Francis draws millions in tour of Ecuador
6 July 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the Ecuadorean port city of Guayaquil on Monday to greet Pope Francis.
The Pope waved to the crowds from his custom car ahead of an open-air mass in the city's Samanes Park.
He arrived in Ecuador on Sunday for the first leg of his three-country trip to Latin America, which will also take him to Bolivia and Paraguay.
It is his second visit to the region since becoming pontiff in 2013.
City officials said a million visitors had travelled to Guayaquil to see the Pope.
Up to a million people reportedly gathered in Guayaquil to see Pope Francis
People from all sections of society greeted Pope Francis upon his arrival in the capital Quito
Many gathered in front of the Vatican Embassy in Quito on Monday
Looking relaxed, Pope Francis smiled as the crowds in Guayaquil cheered him and snapped selfies.
Before his procession he visited the city's Divine Mercy shrine, where he reacted with good humour to nearly being poked in the eye by a young boy.
He spent a minute praying at the shrine and told the crowd he would pray for them.
A Vatican official estimated that half a million people had lined the streets of the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, on Sunday, to see the Pope.
Many also gathered in front of the Vatican Embassy in Quito, where he stayed the night.
He joined them for a prayer and, according to some of those present, said: "I am going to give you a blessing so that you go home and rest and let the neighbours get some sleep."
After landing in Quito, the Pope thanked God "for having allowed me to return to Latin America".
Peripheries
His 2013 visit to Brazil drew huge crowds of young Catholics attending the Catholic Youth Conference. A Mass on Copacabana beach was estimated to have been attended by three million people.
The papal mass was rapturously received in the city of Guayaquil
Pope Francis was making his second visit to Latin America since becoming Pontiff in 2013
But this time the Pope chose some of the smaller and poorer countries of the region for his visit, a move which the Vatican said reflected his interest in the "peripheries".
Pope Francis is the first leader of the Roman Catholic Church to come from South America, but on this occasion he will not be visiting his home country of Argentina.
The Vatican said that he would focus on the issue of poverty and inequality.
"Progress and development must ensure a better future for all," he said in a speech on the Quito airport runway after he was welcomed by Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa.
In 2007, before becoming Pope, he told a gathering of Latin American bishops that they were living in the most unequal part of the world.
Coca leaves
On Wednesday Pope Francis will travel to Bolivia.
He has requested to chew coca leaves while in Bolivia, according to Culture Minister Marko Machicao.
Children in Bolivia are already excited over the Pope's impending visit
Coca, the raw ingredient for cocaine, has been used in the Andes for thousands of years to combat altitude sickness and as a mild stimulant.
In September the Pope will travel to Cuba ahead of a trip to the US.
The pontiff is credited with helping to bring about last December's diplomatic thaw between the two countries.

        <Description>New rules aimed at reducing Brazil's high number of caesarean births come into force.</Description>
        <MainBody>Brazil introduces new caesarean birth rules
7 July 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
The caesarean rate in Brazil is more than 50%
New rules have come into force in Brazil aimed at reducing the country's high number of caesarean births.
Eighty-five per cent of all births in Brazilian private hospitals are caesareans and in public hospitals the figure is 45%.
The new rules oblige doctors to inform women about the risks and ask them to sign a consent form before performing a caesarean.
Doctors will also have to justify why a caesarean was necessary.
They will have to fill in a complete record of how the labour and birth developed and explain their actions.
Each pregnant woman will now be assigned medical notes which record the history of her pregnancy, which she can take with her if she changes doctors.
The new rules are designed to reduce unnecessary surgical procedures, and ensure pregnant women are aware of the risks associated with caesareans.
However, experts say that a scarcity of maternity beds and wards equipped to deal with natural births means that for many women in Brazil, caesarean birth is seen as the best option.
"The best way to guarantee yourself a bed in a good hospital is to book a caesarean," Pedro Octavio de Britto Pereira, an obstetrician and professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said in an interview with BBC Brasil last year.
'Uncivilised and primitive'
Women who want to give birth naturally in a private hospital have reported finding all the beds are reserved for scheduled deliveries.
There have been numerous reports of women going into labour without a caesarean scheduled and being forced to travel from hospital to hospital in search of a bed.
Researchers say many women also see caesareans as more civilised and modern, and natural birth as primitive, ugly and inconvenient.
In Brazil's body-conscious culture, where there is little information given about childbirth, there is also huge concern that  natural birth can make women sexually unattractive.
Many doctors prefer caesareans too, as they can plan the time of a birth, and feel more protected from litigation.
Gynaecologist Renato Sa told BBC Brasil: "Doctors are responsible for what happens and in a situation of risk they chose a caesarean, because if there is a death or complication they will be asked why they didn't do this. Doctors are afraid of natural childbirth."

Dozens of people were injured in the Jos bombings
Two bomb attacks on the central Nigerian city of Jos have left at least 44 people dead, the authorities say.
A restaurant and a mosque were targeted on Sunday night.
No group has said it carried out the attack, but militant group Boko Haram has attacked Jos before, even though it is not in north-east Nigeria where the Islamists normally operate.
The blasts are the latest in a series of deadly attacks in recent days which have seen more than 200 people killed.
The attacks came shortly after the Ramadan fast was broken, with both sites full of people.
Of the 44 dead, 23 were killed at the restaurant and 21 at the mosque, Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) says.
The bomb at the Shagalinku restaurant came as people were breaking the Ramadan fast
There are also 47 people being treated for injuries, but emergency officials are still gathering information, so the figures may rise.
The blast at the restaurant was caused by a bomb that had been planted, whereas the mosque was attacked by a suicide bomber and that explosion was preceded by gunfire, the BBC's Ishaq Khalid reports.
Eyewitness Akaria Ahammed said: "When they started shooting people, people started running helter-skelter for their lives.
"Unfortunately those that stood up were shot."
Hospital staff attended to injured people in Jos throughout Monday
Our correspondent says that many believe that the mosque's imam, who was preaching at the time, may have been the target.
Sheikh Muhammad Sani Yahya Jingir, who survived the attack, is known for preaching against Boko Haram and has written a book which criticises the group called Boko Halal (Western education is permitted - Boko Haram means Western education is forbidden).
He has survived a previous assassination attempt at his home and is seen as one of the most influential clerics in Nigeria.
Speaking on Monday, Sheikh Jingir said the bombing was "not an attack on an individual, it is an attack on all of us".
Meanwhile the Nigerian military told the BBC it had freed more than 180 people who had been detained on suspicion of being Boko Haram members.
The former suspects had been freed after being screened by the military to ensure their innocence, officials said.
Correspondents say Nigeria's treatment of Boko Haram suspects has been an extremely contentious issue.
Amnesty International says that thousands have died in detention in the past four years - something the military denies.
However, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to investigate the rights group's claims.
Why the upsurge in attacks? Will Ross, BBC News, Nigeria
It is not unusual for there to be a heightened risk of jihadist attacks during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
Boko Haram may be trying to deepen its ties with the jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria who had called for "a month of disasters for the infidels".
Many of the recent attacks have been by suicide bombers - often young women.
Where the bombs are being made and where the bombers are being brainwashed is unclear but the Nigerian intelligence and security services need to do far more to stop the bloodshed.
Once again the range of targets is alarming and on this latest bloody Sunday a church and a mosque were bombed within hours of each other.

People protested outside the court ahead of the court case
Two women have gone on trial in Morocco on charges of "gross indecency" for wearing skirts.
The two were arrested in Inezgane last month, after a market trader drew attention to what they were wearing and a crowd gathered round, reports say.
An internet petition calling the arrest an attack on personal freedom has attracted thousands of signatures.
There was controversy in May when a Jennifer Lopez performance in Morocco was considered "sexually suggestive".
There have been a number of demonstrations over the case in Morocco, with protesters saying that women should be free to wear what they want.
Activists also gathered at the court house on Monday to support the detainees.
The two women, 23 and 29, are being tried under an article in the penal code which says that anyone found guilty of committing an act of "public obscenity" can be jailed for up to two years.
The judge will give a verdict on 13 July.

A Nato land cruiser was hit in the first suicide attack in the Shah Shahid area of Kabul
A Nato convoy and an Afghan intelligence agency office have been targeted in two suicide attacks hours apart in the Afghan capital Kabul.
In the first attack a car bomb hit a land cruiser carrying foreign forces. Nato said there were no fatalities.
In the second attack, two people tried to storm an intelligence office in the Eighth Precinct after a third man blew himself up on a bomb-laden motorbike.
A guard was killed and another person injured. Two gunmen were also killed.
The Taliban and another militant group, Hezb-e-Islami, have said they carried out the first attack, in the Shah Shahid area of the city.
Taliban and other insurgents have stepped up attacks on Afghan and foreign forces this year
The violence comes as diplomatic sources confirmed the presence of Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Hikmat Karzai, in the Pakistani capital Islamabad at the same time as a Taliban delegation from Qatar.
If a meeting takes place, it would be a pre-talk discussion similar to those already held in Beijing, Urumqi and Oslo , says BBC Kabul bureau chief Waheed Massoud.
The Taliban has stepped up its campaign of violence in recent months, taking advantage of the warmer weather of spring and summer. It has been making military gains, especially in northern Afghanistan.
Last week, a suicide bomber struck a convoy of Nato troops close to the US embassy, killing one civilian and injuring 22.

From the section India
Senior police official Abdul Hameed (right) said they had begun an investigation
A woman in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has died after alleging that she was set on fire by two policemen inside a police station after she refused to pay a bribe.
Neetu Dwivedi, 40, told a magistrate before her death that the policemen asked her for 100,000 rupees ($1,578).
She had gone to the police station to free her husband, who had been detained for questioning in a crime.
The accused policemen deny the charge and say she tried to immolate herself.
The policemen have been suspended and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has ordered an inquiry into the case.
The incident took place on Monday in Barabanki town, senior police official Abdul Hameed told BBC Hindi.
Mrs Dwivedi, who sustained 80% burns, was admitted to hospital in the state capital, Lucknow, where she died on Tuesday morning.
In her dying declaration before a magistrate and reporters, she alleged that she was abused and humiliated by her attackers when she refused to pay the bribe.
Mrs Dwivedi's son, who is a journalist with a Hindi newspaper, has said he wants justice as his "mother will only rest in peace when the guilty are punished".
The incident comes barely a month after journalist Jagendra Singh was set on fire allegedly by some policemen in the state's Shahjahanpur district.

        <MainBody>15 changes to anti-terror planning since 2005
Silences were held across the London transport network and flowers were laid at the sites of the four explosions.
The prime minister said the day of the attacks was "one of those days where everybody remembers exactly where they were when they heard the news".
Carmen Macovie and her friend Sarah were among those caught in the blast at Tavistock Square.
They met afterwards in one of the assistance centres set up to help those affected - and found they "finished each other's sentences" about the way they felt about what they experienced.
Ms Macovie said: "I can still remember every moment of that day, except where I was sitting on the bus. I remember standing there after it happened thinking, 'What happened to my bus?' It still feels like yesterday.
"The next day the picture of me standing on the bus was on the front of every paper.
"The most amazing things was the way Londoners reacted after it happened - with tolerance and togetherness. It's an amazing city."
Thirteen people were killed in the Tavistock Square bus blast
'Walk together'
Commuters were urged to "walk together" by finishing their morning bus or Underground commute one stop early and travelling the last few minutes by foot.
Adrian Luscombe, one of those taking part, tweeted : "A commuter today as I was 10 years ago. It could have been me. As fresh in memory as if it was yesterday."
Later, the Duke of Cambridge will join victims' families, survivors and ambulance and fire brigade employees who were working 10 years ago, for a service at the Hyde Park memorial, where there will be songs, recitals and a reading.
A unique grief
By Peter Hunt, BBC correspondent at Hyde Park
This was a simple, short almost stark ceremony.
There were no readings, no music.
In silence, wreaths - more than a dozen of them - were placed on the memorial stone at the time when, 10 years ago, three of the four homemade rucksack bombs exploded underground with such devastating consequences.
The 7 July Memorial, which consists of 52 stainless steel pillars, was designed to symbolise the random nature of the loss of life.
Tessa Jowell, a minister at the time of the attacks, has spoken of how each column represents a unique person, a unique grief.
The memorial events are very much about that grief; about the enduring sense of loss suffered by the bereaved; and about the unfulfilled futures of the 52 who were murdered.

The bombers began their journey to London from Luton
The bombings were carried out by Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Germaine Lindsay, 19. The group had links to al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, said the rise of Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq meant the UK was now facing a "very different" threat.
"We've seen another step change in terrorism in the way it works and connects across the world in the last couple of years," he said.
The UK's terror threat level was raised from "substantial" to "severe" in August 2014 in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.

        <MainBody>Hungary MPs approve border fence and anti-migrant law
7 July 2015
From the section Europe
There has been a sharp rise in the number of migrants trying to enter Hungary
Hungary's parliament has passed new legislation tightening asylum rules, and backed plans to erect a border fence to keep out migrants.
The new law allows the detention of migrants in temporary camps, the speeding up of asylum assessments and limiting the possibility for appeal.
The move was criticised by the UN and human rights groups.
Hungary has seen a rise in the number of migrants and asylum seekers in 2015, most of them entering from Serbia.
The government says about 72,000 migrants have entered the country so far this year, compared with 43,000 people in 2014.
The hope is that only "several dozen, or at most a few hundred" asylum seekers will be accepted in future, a senior government source told the BBC's Nick Thorpe.
'Devastating implications'
The new legislation was passed easily in a 151-41 vote on Monday, with the backing of the governing Fidesz party and the far-right Jobbik party.
"Hungary is confronted with the biggest surge of migrants in its history, its capacities are overloaded by 130%," said Interior Minister Sandor Pinter.
Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told the BBC that from now on the Hungarian authorities would regard Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Greece as "safe" countries.
In practice this means that almost all asylum seekers who reach Hungary - a landlocked country - overland will be rejected, Nick Thorpe reports from Budapest.
He adds that most will not even get a chance to apply, because they would be stopped by the border fence, construction of which is expected to begin immediately.
According to Mr Kovacs, Hungary will handle each asylum application on its own merits, albeit in a fast-track procedure, and will comply with the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.
The fence is to run the length of the 175km (109-mile) border with Serbia.
The UN and human rights groups have criticised Hungary's immigration proposals.
The regional representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees warned that the legislation would have devastating implications for thousands of people seeking safety in Hungary.
Refugees from the wars in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Democratic Republic of Congo could see their applications rejected automatically, our correspondent says.
"Eighty per cent of these people are fleeing war and conflict," said the UNHCR's Babar Baloch. "This is a refugee crisis, but it's being wrongly described as a migrant crisis by the politicians here."

        <MainBody>Iran nuclear talks: Deal 'within reach' as deadline nears
7 July 2015
From the section Middle East
Representatives from both sides said a comprehensive deal was closer than ever before
World powers and Iran will continue to work towards a comprehensive nuclear deal even though they are likely to miss Tuesday's deadline, officials say.
Negotiations took place late into the night in the Austrian capital, Vienna, with foreign ministers grappling to resolve outstanding differences.
However, US officials said the midnight (22:00 GMT) deadline might slip and that an agreement was not yet assured.
The talks have intensified since the previous deadline was missed last week.
The so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - want Iran to scale back its sensitive nuclear activities to ensure that it cannot build a nuclear weapon.
Iran, which wants crippling international sanctions lifted, has always insisted that its nuclear work is peaceful.
'Within reach'
Representatives from both sides said a deal was closer than ever before as they arrived at Vienna's Palais Coburg hotel on Monday. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters: "The comprehensive agreement is within reach."
Progress has been made - one Iranian newspaper reported that there was agreement on the main body of the accord and four of the five annexes. But several sticking points remain, including limits on nuclear research and development and guidelines for inspections.
Tehran is also demanding that the UN ban on the import and export of conventional arms and ballistic missiles be lifted as part of any deal, a senior Iranian official said on Monday.
The text of a new UN Security Council resolution is being drafted, but the US and its European allies oppose lifting the arms embargo because Iran has been accused of fomenting unrest in the Middle East. Russia and China have expressed support.
US Secretary of State John Kerry wants an agreement finalised by Wednesday at the latest so that it can be submitted to the US Congress for approval by Thursday. If a deal is presented later, the review period will double from 30 days to 60.
Journalists are gathered outside the Palais Coburg hotel, awaiting a breakthrough
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was "certainly possible" that Tuesday's deadline might slip, while state department spokesman John Kirby insisted that Tuesday was merely "an extension of basically seven days of the parameters" of the framework accord agreed in Lausanne in April.
But he added: "Everybody is still, I think, rowing on the oars here to try to get a deal done. But it's got to be the right deal."
An Iranian official told reporters: "If we pass 9 July, this may not be the end of the world."
Officials from the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meanwhile held "intense discussions" with officials in Tehran about the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear programme.
The IAEA has said Iran has failed to give a satisfactory explanation of its research at a military site into detonators that could be used to trigger a nuclear weapon or explained studies that could help calculate the explosive yield of one.

7 July 2015
From the section Middle East
US fighter jets have been leading air strikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq
The US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is "intensifying" its campaign in northern Syria, President Barack Obama says.
Speaking at the Pentagon, Mr Obama said the US would not send additional troops to Syria but would increase support for the country's moderate opposition.
He added that "an effective partner on the ground" was needed to defeat IS.
It comes as IS militants were reported to have regained control of the town Ain Issa from Kurdish-led forces.
Mr Obama's remarks followed some of the heaviest bombing of IS since coalition strikes began in September last year.
The bombing targeted Raqqa, IS's de facto capital in Syria.
"We're intensifying our efforts against Isil's base in Syria," said Mr Obama, using another name for the militant group.
"Our air strikes will continue to target the oil and gas facilities that fund so much of their operations.
"When we have an effective partner on the ground, Isil can be pushed back," he added.
However, he warned that the campaign against the group would "not be quick".
The Popular Protection Units (YPG) celebrated seizing Ain Issa just two weeks ago
Earlier on Monday, IS militants reportedly regained control of a town near their northern Syrian stronghold of Raqqa from Kurdish-led forces.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said jihadists overran Ain Issa - 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa - and nearby villages.
But a spokesman for the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG), which seized the town from IS two weeks ago, said it was still resisting the IS assault.
YPG fighters and allied Syrian rebels had only seized Ain Issa from IS two weeks ago.
The jihadist group had suffered a series of defeats in areas along the Turkish border, since being forced to withdraw from the town of Kobane in January.
However, in recent weeks, IS has launched several deadly counter-attacks against the Kurds.

        <MainBody>Budget to propose longer Sunday trading hours
7 July 2015
From the section UK Politics
comments
Shops in England and Wales could be allowed to open for longer on Sundays, under plans to be unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne.
The proposal expected in Wednesday's Budget could give elected mayors and councils powers to relax laws locally if it might boost economic activity.
Current laws allows smaller shops to open all day, but restrict those over 280 sq m (3,000 sq ft) to six hours.
The Association of Convenience Stores said some small shops could struggle.
The Treasury pointed to research by the New West End Company - which represents more than 600 businesses in London - that suggested two extra hours of Sunday trading could create nearly 3,000 jobs in the capital.
It said such a move would also generate more than 200m a year in additional sales in London.
Olympic Games trial
The proposal comes after larger stores and supermarkets were allowed to open for longer on Sundays during the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Mr Osborne said decisions on similar relaxations of the law should be taken at a local level - if officials think longer opening hours would boost economies.
The chancellor said there was a "growing appetite" for shopping on a Sunday.
"There is some evidence that transactions for Sunday shopping are actually growing faster than those for Saturday.
"The rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend.
"But this won't be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities," he added.
Analysis by Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent
Ms Soubry said the only thing to look forward to on Sundays used to be 'Sing Something Simple' on the radio
Anna Soubry is on a mission to cheer up Sundays and her solution is shopping.
The small business minister has been out promoting the case for extending opening hours and sharing her recollection of what the seventh day used to be like 'Chez Soubry'.
It was the most "miserable" day of the week and as far as she is concerned it was a myth that families came together on the day of rest.
Yes, she knows some people like to go to church and switch off but she thinks more flexible retail options will brighten up Sundays.
There are also the new jobs and flexibility it will bring too for people who work funny hours, like her, she says.
It is not the answer to everything, though.
She told me food shopping in a supermarket can be "depressing", and that seemed to apply to any day of the week.
Small Business Minister Anna Soubry told the BBC the government would consult on the proposal first.
But she said she thought it was a good idea, telling Radio 4's Today programme it was "about giving local authorities the ability to determine what they do in their local area".
She said: "I want to listen to what the unions have to say and obviously I'm concerned if they say it will put pressure on workers.
"But I don't think they are right, actually. This is all about devolving power down to local authorities who are more than capable of being able to make a decision that suits their area."
Ms Soubry also warned against "harking back to a world that probably didn't exist... we are of that generation where Sunday, truthfully, was the most miserable day of the week".
"The only thing to look forward to was Sing Something Simple on the radio. Goodness me, if that didn't sum up a miserable Sunday."
Sunday shopping law across the UK
In England and Wales, the Sunday trading law applies to shops over 280 sq m. They can open on Sundays but only for six consecutive hours between 10:00 and 18:00, and must close on Easter Sunday and on Christmas Day.
In Northern Ireland a 1997 law "removed the restrictions on the goods which may be sold in shops on Sunday", allowed small shops (under 280 sq m) to trade any time on Sunday and allowed big shops to trade for a maximum of five hours between 13:00 and 18:00.
In Scotland there are no restrictions and shops often open for long hours on Sundays.
Trading hours for retailers
High Street shops have been coming under growing pressure from online retailers, which now account for 11% of retail sales overall - rising to 17% in the month before Christmas of last year.
A review of the 1994 Sunday Trading Act by the then Labour government in 2006 resulted in no change to the law.
The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Alan Smith - who speaks for the Church of England on the economy in the House of Lords - criticised the proposals.
He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme it was important to "balance the rights of those who want to go shopping with those who find themselves having to work on Sunday when they don't want to".
"We have to make some quite big decisions.. about what sort of society we have," he added.
Bishop Smith said giving local authorities the power to set hours for their areas was "a recipe for disaster", because people visiting different parts of the country "won't know where they stand".
But Conservative MP Philip Davies. the vice chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on retail, said Sunday was the most convenient day of the week for some people to go shopping.
He said the current law was "absurd" because smaller branches of Tesco and Sainsbury's were able to open later but larger stores' hours were restricted.
George Osborne will unveil the government's new Budget on Wednesday
Welcoming the chancellor's proposal, Adrian Pepper, from the Open Sundays campaign group, said restricting Sunday opening hours "makes no sense".
"The current Sunday trading laws do not preserve any valuable cultural aspects of our way of life. They just make life more inconvenient," he said.
However, Association of Convenience Stores chief executive James Lowman said giving local authorities responsibility for setting Sunday trading hours could lead to "inconsistency and confusion" for businesses and shoppers.
Mr Lowman said the same amount of trade would be spread over more hours and would shift from small shops to larger stores.
"The short period of time that small stores are open while large stores are shut is a crucial advantage for convenience stores, most of which are owned by small businesses.
"Liberalising Sunday trading hours would make some small stores unviable," he added.
John Hannett, secretary general of shopworkers' union USDAW, said the announcement was disappointing, and the union would campaign against the move.
He told the Today programme it would not bring further economic benefits to the country, but would put more pressure on employees.
'Definitively rejected'
Meanwhile, campaign group Keep Sundays Special accused the government of a U-turn over Sunday trading hours.
Its spokesman, Michael Trend, said it received a letter on behalf of David Cameron in April which stated that there were "no plans" to relax the current laws.
He said Sundays should be a time for family, friends and community, arguing that the plans should be "definitively rejected".
Labour leader contender Andy Burnham said he would oppose any relaxation in the current laws.
He said in a tweet that Sundays were the only day shop workers could spend time with family.
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett also signalled her opposition to the move, tweeting that the move would be bad for small businesses, people and communities.

        <MainBody>HSBC sacks staff over mock Islamic State video
7 July 2015
From the section UK
HSBC has sacked employees who made an "abhorrent" video in which they pretended to be Islamic State militants carrying out a beheading.
The video was posted online and shows a man dressed in an orange jumpsuit, while five other men in black stand around him - one holding a fake knife.
The Sun said the employees were members of the bank's legal division in Birmingham on a team building exercise.
The bank said it did not tolerate "inappropriate behaviour".
"As soon as the Sun brought this video to our attention we took the decision to sack the individuals involved," the bank said.
"This is an abhorrent video and HSBC would like to apologise for any offence caused."
The bank did not specify how many people had been sacked.
'Shocking behaviour'
The newspaper has posted an eight-second clip of the video on its website in which one man shouts "Allahu Akbar" - Arabic for "God is great" - while others laugh.
It said the employees created the video while on a visit to Teamworks Karting in Birmingham.
Teamworks Karting has released a statement which described their actions as "shocking behaviour".
It said: "The abhorrent video was filmed without our knowledge, during a private party booked by one of our corporate clients and we would not wish this to reflect negatively on Teamworks.
"We have lodged a complaint with HSBC and understand that the individuals involved have since been sacked."

Tom Hayes denied that what he was doing was "clandestine"
A trader accused of manipulating the Libor rate has told a court that senior managers knew what he was doing.
Tom Hayes is the first trader to be tried by a jury for his part in the manipulation of the key interest rate.
"I acted with complete transparency...  My managers knew, my manager's manager knew. In some cases the CEO [chief executive] was aware of it," he said.
The former UBS and Citigroup trader denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud over the period 2006-2010.
'Hunger'
Mr Hayes denied that what he was doing was "clandestine" and said that he made no attempts to "cover his tracks".
The 35-year-old said that he did not believe that at the time that what he was doing as a Libor trader was "wrong".
He said he was motivated by his determination to make as much money as possible for his bank.
"Greed was the wrong word, hunger is a better word.
"I was hungry to do the best job I could do - because of the performance metric, because that is how you are judged," he told the jury at Southwark Crown Court.
$300m
Mr Hayes also said that others bankers at UBS seemed to be fixing the Libor rate for commercial gain before he arrived at the bank.
He said that a group of senior managers at UBS discussed manipulating the Libor rate and that "nobody batted an eye lid".
Mr Hayes told the court that he was frustrated by the pay he was getting at UBS
He said he had calculated that he had  made $300m for UBS over three years and that the bank had not paid him what he felt he was owed for his success.
He said that very little of his profit for the bank actually came from Libor trading.
'Frozen with fear'
During his time at Citi Bank in August 2010, Mr Hayes was called into meeting with lawyers who were looking into the Libor market.
Mr Hayes said that he could not work out what he rules he might have broken.
'I could not work out what I had or had not done wrong. They could not tell me what rule I had broken.'
Mr Hayes also told the court that he gave interviews to the Serious Fraud Office in 2013 cataloguing his actions as a Libor trader in order to prevent him being extradited to the US where he was being charged by the Department of Justice.
He said that he was "frozen with fear" and  "petrified" when he learned that he was to be charged by the US Authorities.
Mr Hayes is the first person in the global investigation to stand trial for allegedly rigging the rate.
Mr Hayes's trading activities were based around movements in the Libor rate - an interest rate used by banks around the world to set the price of financial products worth trillions of pounds.
The trial continues.

        <MainBody>Watchdog probe into RSA's Irish unit
7 July 2015
From the section Business
The UK accounting watchdog is to investigate the conduct of individuals working for the Irish unit of RSA Insurance in the run-up to its bailout by its UK parent company.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the probe was related to "financial irregularities" at the insurer.
It did not identify individuals or say if they still worked at the business.
RSA Insurance was forced to inject 200m into its Irish unit in 2013.
The company subsequently tapped shareholders for cash through a rights issue to help bolster its finances.
Compensation
RSA's Irish unit was bailed out weeks after the resignation of its chief executive Philip Smith and after the insurer informed the market about the accounting irregularities.
Mr Smith was initially suspended after an investigation was launched into issues in the Irish unit's claims and finance functions identified during a internal routine audit.
Last month, he won a 1.25m compensation payment for a constructive dismissal.
RSA is appealing against the award.
RSA Group's chief executive, Simon Lee, also resigned in the wake of the crisis at the Irish unit. He was eventually replaced by former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester
The FRC said the investigation would cover 2012 "and relevant prior periods as a result of the identification of issues within the claims and accounting functions announced by RSA Insurance Group at the end of 2013".
RSA said the FRC's investigation was not into the company itself but into individuals who were members of accounting, auditing or actuarial professional bodies.
It said in a statement: "We understand that the investigation will therefore cover members of these professions who were employed by RSA at the  time. RSA Group will of course assist with these inquiries if requested to do so."
The FRC said it would co-operate with the Irish authorities as necessary.

        <MainBody>Oil and gas output boosts UK industrial production
7 July 2015
From the section Business
A rise in oil and gas output boosted UK industrial production in May, official figures show, but manufacturing output continued to fall.
Industrial production rose 0.4% in May, helped by a 7.3% rise in oil and gas output and higher mining output.
However, manufacturing continued to lag behind, falling by 0.6% last month after a fall of 0.4% in April.
Manufacturers have struggled against the strength of the pound and weak demand in European markets.
The numbers suggested "a persistent weakness" developing in manufacturing, said UBS economist David Tinsley.
"The last few months' readings of manufacturing output have been soft, and surveys such as the PMI are also suggesting slower growth," he added.
Compared with a year earlier, industrial output rose by 2.1%, the strongest annual growth since April of last year, and manufacturing was up 1.0%.
George Osborne is expected to announce more help for manufacturers in his Budget announcement on Wednesday.

Floyd Mayweather stripped of WBO title won from Pacquiao
Five-weight world champion Floyd Mayweather has been stripped of the WBO welterweight belt won from Manny Pacquiao in May.
The 38-year-old failed to pay the WBO a $200,000 (128,000) fee to administer the fight by the 3 July deadline.
Mayweather had been expected to relinquish the title by now, saying he planned to do so following his points victory over Pacquiao.
Fellow American Timothy Bradley will now become the full belt holder.
After Mayweather defeated Pacquiao, he had declared he would vacate all his titles in order to give younger fighters the chance to win belts.
"The WBO World Championship Committee is allowed no other alternative but to cease to recognize Mr Floyd Mayweather Jr as the WBO welterweight champion of the world and vacate his title." said a statement on wboboxing.com.
Mayweather, who still holds the WBA and WBC belts at welterweight, has until 20 July to appeal against the decision.
He is expected to stage one more fight in Las Vegas on 12 September, although he has yet to name the opponent.
The WBO created a vacant interim welterweight belt for the 27 June fight between Bradley and Jessie Vargas.

Bavalan Pathmanathan dies after being struck in chest by ball
A cricketer has died after being struck on the chest by a ball during a local league match in Surrey.
Bavalan Pathmanathan, 24, was batting for Manipay Parish Sports Club in the British Tamil League on Sunday at Long Ditton recreation grounds.
An air ambulance was called but he later died of his injuries.
In November, Australia batsman Phillip Hughes died two days after being struck on the top of the neck by a ball during a domestic match in Sydney.
Pathmanathan's team-mate Rukshan, who was also batting at the time, told the Colombo Mirror: "When he received the hit I asked from the other end if he is alright. He gave a thumb-up and nodded to indicate he was alright, while pressing his chest.
"He took a couple of steps behind the stumps and collapsed.
"He was such a talented and composed cricketer and a darling friend of all of us. Every one of us is going through terrible pain as a result of this terrible loss."
A statement on Manipay Parish Sports Club's Facebook page said they were "totally shocked by his death at this young age".
Surrey chief executive Richard Gould added: "Everyone at the club has been deeply saddened to learn of Bavalan's death and would like to extend their sympathies to his family, friends and everyone who knew him from within the community of cricket."
A report by the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (Fica) found last month that cricketers are as much at risk from lightning strikes, mental illness and terrorism as they are of being seriously injured by the ball.

Klein is a regular presenter of Radio 3's daily afternoon music show In Tune
Critics of an upcoming BBC Prom that will celebrate the dance sounds of Ibiza have been branded "snobs and scaremongers" by a Radio 3 presenter.
Writing in the Radio Times , Suzy Klein said suggestions the BBC was "teetering worryingly at the top of a slippery slope" were "a load of old cobblers".
"Electronic dance music is dazzling in its primal energy," the presenter of Radio 3's In Tune programme continued.
"Great music festivals must embrace great music, in its many guises."
The late-night Prom on 29 July will see Radio 1 presenter Pete Tong celebrate 20 years of the Ibiza dance scene in a concert with Jules Buckley and the Heritage Orchestra.
This year's Proms season also includes a BBC Radio 1Extra Prom on 12 August featuring leading hip-hop and grime artists from Britain's urban music scene.
Klein promised that the latter concert would be "mind-blowing" and could hardly be seen as "the tip of the iceberg for Proms armageddon".
"I love dancing to an addictive club anthem as much as I adore listening... to a Brahms symphony," the broadcaster wrote. "Who says you're not allowed to enjoy all of it?"
The 2015 BBC Proms season runs from 17 July to 12 September and will comprise 92 concerts in total, mainly at London's Royal Albert Hall.
Klein is a regular presenter of Radio 3's daily afternoon music show and will be one of the presenters of the BBC's Proms coverage.

From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
Naughtie will take on a new role as BBC News Book Editor
Presenter James Naughtie is to leave Radio 4's Today programme and take on a new role as a special correspondent from early next year.
The veteran journalist has presented Radio 4's flagship breakfast news programme for more than 21 years.
He is also being appointed BBC News Books Editor and will present a book review on Radio 4 on Saturday mornings.
BBC director general Tony Hall called Naughtie "the emotional heart of Today for a generation".
Naughtie joined Today in 1994 following the death of Brian Redhead, having spent six years as presenter of The World at One.
He has anchored every election results programme for BBC Radio since 1997 and has worked on every US presidential election since 1988.
Last year, he become a chief reporter in the BBC's coverage of the independence referendum in Scotland.
Naughtie has presented Radio 4's Bookclub since 1998
In recent years, he has written and presented radio documentaries including a 60-part story of classical music, The Making of Music.
His new role as Books Editor comes as a result of presenting Radio 4's monthly Bookclub since it began in 1998.
The 63-year-old said: "It was exciting to discover that the BBC and I had the same idea about what I should do next. I'm thrilled to be moving from one dream job to another, and working with the programmes across Radio 4 - including Today - that I love and have known for so long.
He added: "After 21 years, I can turn off that 3am alarm at last".

        <MainBody>BBC director general defends licence fee deal
7 July 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
Lord Hall said he was first approached about taking on the cost of free licence fees last week
The BBC's director general has defended the corporation's decision to take on the cost of free TV licences for people over the age of 75.
"It gives us financial stability and the ability to plan for the future," Tony Hall told BBC Radio 4's Today.
He rejected comments by former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw that the deal effectively made the BBC "a branch of the department of work and pensions".
But he acknowledged misgivings over the process that led to the arrangement.
"There are issues to do with the independence of the BBC which will be examined at the charter review," said Lord Hall.
There has been criticism from the chair of the BBC Trust, Rona Fairhead, and former director general Lord Birt, that the deal was struck behind closed doors.
"We are disappointed that [the public] have not been given any say in the major decisions about the BBC's future funding," said Fairhead in an open letter to chancellor George Osborne.
Lord Birt said the government had set "a very dangerous precedent" by failing to consult the public, and suggested the BBC's independence had been compromised.
"I think the process should be looked at," Lord Hall told Today presenter John Humphrys , "This is the second time this has happened. It is the government's decision to come at it this way."
The new deal was unexpectedly announced in the House of Commons by culture secretary John Whittingdale on Monday, in response to an urgent question tabled by Labour MP Chris Bryant, following newspaper reports of the settlement.
In return for the BBC's agreement to shoulder the 650m cost of free TV licences, the government promised to allow the 145.50 fee to increase in line with inflation and close a loophole that made it possible to watch on-demand television without a licence.
Ministers said the move would be phased in from 2018-19. At the same time, the BBC's commitment to fund rural broadband will be decreased.
Lord Hall said "the government's decision has been more than matched by the deal coming back to the BBC."
But Mr Bryant, the shadow culture secretary, described the agreement as a "shabby little deal" and said Labour would oppose the government's plans if they amounted to a "smash and grab raid" on the BBC.

President Barack Obama says there has been progress in the campaign against Islamic State militants, but has emphasised ''it will not be quick''.
Speaking at a Pentagon briefing, the US president said that the task was largely up to local forces on the ground - but that losses in Syria and Iraq proved that the militants could be defeated.
''Our coalition has now hit Isil [Islamic State] with more than 5,000 airstrikes, we've taken out thousands of fighting positions, tanks, vehicles, bomb factories and training camps,'' he said.

A wasteland of rubble still bears testament to last summer's conflict between Israel and Gaza. But there are deeper scars - damage that can't be seen and may never heal.
A week after the fighting began, Syed's life was shattered on the day the 12-year-old, his 11-year-old brother Mohamed, and their six cousins went to Gaza's beach to play football.
It was the natural playground for young boys from a family of fishermen which has lived off the sea for generations.
"We didn't know that beach was dangerous," says Syed - his eyes still, round, sad pools, as he remembers 16 July, one of the most harrowing days of the war.
By the end of that day, Mohamed and three of his cousins were dead. An Israeli investigation said its air force mistook the children for Hamas fighters when a pilot fired twice at a "compound" next to the beach.
Syed and the three other boys who survived still show small scars on their legs and disturbing signs of being severely traumatised.
"For the son I lost, my tears will never dry," says his mother. But she fears she lost two sons last summer. "Those left behind are lost like those who died," she laments, as she looks across their small one-bedroom home at Syed, who stares blankly into the distance.
Syed finds it hard to sleep, and too tough to go to school because it reminds him of his brother. Even the sea, which had been a constant reference point in his life, no longer feels safe. "I never used to get scared, but now I do," he tells me as we ride in a speed boat close to the shore and he fiddles nervously with the cords on his life jacket.
Abdulrahman lost his father and 17 other family members in the conflict
His cousins struggle with even darker emotions. One tried to jump from a window after an angry altercation with his father. Another almost pushed a girl under a bus. They all live with nightmares, and battle just to get through each day.

Children of the Gaza War will be broadcast on BBC Two on Wednesday 8 July at 21:00.
You can catch up later via BBC iPlayer.
By the end of the 51-day conflict, 551 Gazan children had lost their lives. Many more lost loved ones. The UN estimates that nearly 400,000 children need counselling. Syed has had some sessions at Gaza's community mental health programme - they help, but it's not enough. Therapy doesn't stand much chance as long as children are acutely aware that the conflict isn't over. They've already lived through three wars in six years.
Aid agencies say none of the nearly 20,000 homes destroyed in the fighting have been rebuilt, and more than 100,000 people remain displaced.
On the Israeli side of the border, children also live with distressing reminders of last summer's fighting, which also killed a young Israeli boy in the kibbutz of Nahal Oz.
"It's so not fair," protests 10-year-old Michal whose home in Nahal Oz lies only about a mile from Gaza. "We can't just keep running away, because it's our home and we need to live here.
"It's not because of us, it's not because of Gaza kids," she says, her eyes narrowing behind bright pink sunglasses.
A few miles away, the southern Israeli town of Sderot, sometimes referred to as the "bomb shelter capital of the world", has been the target of rockets fired from Gaza for 14 years.
Eilon was born the year missiles started landing, and speaks of a childhood "where I didn't grow up as a normal child". He's lived through two rocket attacks in his own neighbourhood in recent years.
His nightmares after last year's war led him to see a trauma counsellor. Months after a ceasefire was agreed, he still kept sleeping in the bomb-proof bedroom that's built in every Israeli home.
The first time he and his 10-year-old sister Agam summon up enough courage to climb the highest ridge in Sderot, they look at neighbouring Gaza through binoculars.
"Wow, look at the destruction there. It saddens me because there are innocent people there who were killed, but on the other hand there are people there that didn't care about us," remarks Eilon.
"They are the homes of people who want to kill us," adds Agam.
Israel says its 2014 campaign, Operation Protective Edge, was launched to stop rocket attacks from Gaza and destroy a vast network of tunnels, some of which extended into Israeli communities. Hamas, which controls most of Gaza, said it was fighting against Israeli air strikes and incursions, and trying to ease severe restrictions on its crossings with both Israel and Egypt.
But civilians, including children, paid a heavy price. A recent UN investigation said both Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups violated international humanitarian law. Their actions, it said, may have amounted to war crimes.
A report released this week by Save the Children, A Living Nightmare , says the vast majority of children in the hardest-hit area still experience nightmares and bed wetting.
Twelve-year-old Samar's home in a block of flats is one of many places that lie in ruins just next to the border. "I never imagined it would be this bad," she gasps, as she and her siblings wander through the hollowed rooms of their devastated apartment for the first time since it was destroyed in the fighting.
"We had dreams of growing up here with our father," she says as she tries to find her balance on a mound of dust and concrete.  Then she collapses in tears.
Samar and her family took shelter in a UN school, but her father died, and her mother was seriously injured when Israeli missiles struck the building.
Israel says its forces only targeted infrastructure used by Hamas to attack Israel. But it has been accused of insufficient regard for civilian lives, while Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups are blamed for firing missiles from residential areas.
Twelve-year-old Abdulrahman, the son of a Hamas fighter, lost 17 members of his family. Fifteen homes in his neighbourhood were destroyed. "If they besiege us, we will hit them with more rockets," he declares with a manly defiance, but a child's sadness to see his small world reduced to piles of rubble.
Every child I meet in Gaza and southern Israel finds a different way to cope with memories of a summer they struggle to forget.
But every child said, ever so matter-of-factly, that another war was coming. And every child still hoped that, somehow, it wouldn't.
"Is it right that children around the world live and play in comfort and safety while we live with death and destruction?" pleads Abdulrahman.
Children of the Gaza War is on BBC Two on Wednesday 8 July at 21:00 BST. It is on BBC World News on 11 July at  09:10 and 21:10 GMT and on 12 July at 02:10 and 15:10 GMT. You can catch up later via BBC iPlayer .

        <Description>Is the UK better than France for migrants?</Description>
        <MainBody>Would Calais migrants really be better off in the UK?
By Justin Parkinson BBC News Magazine
7 July 2015
From the section Magazine
Around 3,000 migrants are camped around Calais in northern France. Many of them think life will be better in the UK than France - or many other EU countries - but are they right?
Scenes of immigrants trying to storm the Channel Tunnel, or climbing aboard lorries, show how desperate those who have fled to Europe are to get to the UK from France. On Tuesday a migrant died on a freight shuttle through the tunnel.
Many want to claim asylum in the UK. Others want to enter the country incognito to remain as illegal workers. But what do migrants say is drawing them to the UK - and is the risk of prolonging their journey really worth it?
Benefits
"I heard good news about England. They give you a house and some money to spend and live. And then they give them the opportunity to study, to have a good life."
Hamzei, from Afghanistan
Both France and the UK offer cost-of-living benefits, for food, clothing, toiletries and so on, for those awaiting an asylum decision.
In the UK the system is known as Section 95 support, and is given to those unable to feed themselves. Its entitlements are 72.52 a week for a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership. Lone parents over 18 get 43.94 and single people of this age 36.95. Those aged 16 to 18 get 39.80 and under-16s get 52.96.
The French system is more simple. As of January this year, the allowance for adults was 11.45 euros (8.13) a day. This equates to 80.15 euros (56.82) a week.
This is higher than any adult rate in the UK. However, the French state provides no money for children. So, those with children would be better off in the UK.
People can look for work in the UK if their asylum claims have taken more than a year to process. This can only happen in areas of work where there's a shortage of personnel. They can also work in France after a year waiting and are subject to a labour market test along similar lines to that in the UK.
Housing
"In England I can get a house very quickly. England is a very good place to have a good life."
Fadi, from Syria
In the UK, asylum seekers will be given accommodation , either in a flat, house, hostel or bed and breakfast. "You can't choose where you live," is the government's advice. "It's unlikely you'll get to live in London or south-east England."
In France, asylum seekers awaiting decisions are also entitled to accommodation. But, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the authorities "claim there are not enough places and priority should be given to families with small children".
For those given refugee status and renting properties afterwards, costs can be substantially higher in the UK than France. According to the comparison website Expatistan , accommodation is 25% cheaper in Paris than London.
Average rents for central London were 2,561 per month in the first quarter of this year, according to the estate agent Countrywide. In south-east England they were 1,097, expensive for someone not on a medium-to-high income.
Healthcare and education
"I speak the language and I respect the education system in England. It's a civilised country."
Alaa, from Syria
In the UK, asylum seekers can get free National Health Service healthcare, enabling them to see a doctor or access hospital treatment. They also receive free prescriptions, dental care, eyesight tests and help paying for glasses.
Asylum seekers in France have access to healthcare thanks to the universal healthcare insurance system, as long as their incomes are proved to be low.
Illegal migrants in the UK, including failed asylum seekers liable to removal, illegal entrants and people who have overstayed their visas, will be chargeable for NHS hospital care, with exemptions for some groups, such as victims of violence. Treatment in accident and emergency departments and at GP surgeries remains free for all.
Children aged five to 17 of asylum-seekers in the UK must attend school. This is free, while children may be eligible for free school meals.
Similarly in France, children aged six to 16 are subject to compulsory education .
Illegal work
"Britain says, 'We don't want immigrants,' but does nothing to prevent the black economy."
Philippe Mignonet, Deputy Mayor of Calais
The main aim of those entering the country but not seeking asylum is presumed to be economic - they want to find work.
A 2009 study carried out for London Mayor Boris Johnson estimated that the UK had 618,000 "irregular" residents, with London accounting for about 70% of this. The campaign group Migration Watch says a figure of 1.1 million is "more plausible".
The size of black economies is hard to gauge, making the demand for unregistered, untaxed workers difficult to know. But it's thought those of France and the UK are very similar. In 2013, the management consultancy firm AT Kearney estimated that the black economy was the equivalent of 10% of GDP in both countries.
But the OECD, in 2012, put the UK's "non-observed economy" at 2.3% of GDP . That of France was 6.7%, arguably implying more opportunity for illegal workers there.
Despite this, the OECD estimated in 2011 that the use of illegal immigrants represented 1% of total employment in the UK - higher than the 0.75% in France.
It would be hard for a migrant to make an informed judgement of work prospects in the two countries based on these figures.
Existing communities
"I want to go to England because I have relatives and my father in England."
Abdul, from Pakistan
The European Union states that, among the factors drawing people to specific countries are "historical ties between countries of origin and destination (former colonies for instance), a certain knowledge of the language used in the host country, the presence of established ethnic communities".
The popularity of the UK among asylum-seekers from Pakistan, a member of the Commonwealth, could be explained in this way. The number of people in the UK identifying as Pakistani increased by about 0.4 million between 2001 and 2011, when they accounted for 2% of the population, according to censuses.
The Democratic Republic of Congo, contributing the largest number of asylum seekers in France last year, is a former Belgian colony. As a result, the official language is French.
A 2012 study found that the "likely higher proficiency" in English among migrants made them more likely to choose an English-speaking country. For instance, English is widely understood in Eritrea , one of the main countries producing asylum seekers at the moment.
The economy
What about the situation that awaits those who are eventually granted refugee status?
According to the EU's own figures, the unemployment rate in France in May was 10.3%.
In the UK it was 5.5% for the period from February to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The figures are not directly comparable, but it is clear that there is a better likelihood of getting work in the UK once settled. However, recent figures show the French economy growing faster than the UK's.
Likelihood of gaining refugee status
"EU member states have a shared responsibility to welcome asylum seekers in a dignified manner, ensuring they are treated fairly and that their case is examined to uniform standards so that, no matter where an applicant applies, the outcome will be similar."
European Union
Those choosing to claim asylum once they reach the UK have a better chance of this being granted than in France.
Last year, 38.8% of UK decisions ended in a grant of asylum or an alternative form of protection. For France the rate was 21.7%.
But, while the rate of approval differed between France and the UK, the overall number of people allowed to stay was 10,050 in the UK, for France it was 14,905, because France had more than twice as many applicants.
The top five countries of origin for UK asylum seekers in 2014 were Pakistan, Eritrea, Iran, Syria and Albania. For France, they were the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russia, Bangladesh, Albania and Syria.
In 2013, Matthieu Tardis, of France Terre D'Asile,  which provides legal and social services to asylum-seekers and refugees, said the country's government did not consider many of the applications to come from those from "'good' countries, for example countries ravaged by war like Syria or Afghanistan". This, he added, helped to explain the lower rate of approval.
There was a wide variance between acceptance rates for asylum-seekers within the UK. Last year, of Eritrean applicants 87% were granted asylum , but just 20% of Pakistanis.
Detection
"There are no ID cards. They can easily find work outside the formal economy, which is not really controlled."
Natacha Bouchart, Mayor of Calais
It is reported that some illegal migrants want to come to the UK because there is no national system of identity cards and police cannot stop people in the street to ask for their papers. This would make it easier to go about their business, as detection is difficult.
In 2008, the Labour government started to introduce biometric compulsory identity cards for foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition of 2010 to 2015 did not scrap this .
UK Immigration Enforcement officers arrested 139 suspected immigration offenders at locations including London, Durham, Manchester, Wales and Somerset in a single day in 2013 following raids.
The 2014 Immigration Act introduced a requirement for private landlords to check whether new tenants have the right to rent in the UK, or face a fine of up to 3,000. A pilot scheme in the West Midlands is due to be extended across England in the autumn.

On the right: the famous bust of Nefertiti in the Neues museum in Berlin. On the left: the replica that sparked an outcry in Egypt. Facebook user Wael Saad commented: 'This is how Egyptian art has evolved over the years'
The unveiling of an ugly copy of a famously beautiful bust of Queen Nefertiti caused Egyptians to mock the authorities as well as the current state of art in the country.
Queen Nefertiti ruled Egypt alongside her husband in the 14th century BCE, and her beauty is legendary - her name in fact translates as "a beautiful woman has arrived." Our modern picture of the ancient queen has been largely shaped by a bust unearthed in 1912 which currently sits in a museum in Berlin - its ownership is the subject of frequent debate between Egypt and Germany .
To Egyptians, Nefertiti remains a proud symbol of their country's impressive history and beauty. So when the authorities wanted to commission a statue at the entrance of the city of Samalut, they thought of the ancient queen.
Unfortunately, the replica that resulted bore so little resemblance to the legendary beauty that many began to despair for the state of Egyptian art. In simple terms, it was just plain ugly.
"This is an insult to Nefertiti and to every Egyptian," tweeted one Egyptian woman. Another wrote: "It should be named 'ugly tasteless artless statue'... not Nefertiti."
Many Egyptians feeling offended by the failed attempt to replicate the iconic bust directed their anger at the sculptors: "If you don't know how to make statues don't go and do something so unfair to the beautiful Nefertiti," tweeted one man. "Not only are you distorting the present but also the past... I ask that the original bust not be returned from Germany, at least there she's got her dignity," another wrote .
Thousands of other Egyptians are using the hashtag "Nefertiti" in Arabic, comparing the replica to the original bust, often using sarcastic captions:
Translation: "Nefertiti before and after marriage"
A number of people even compared the statue to Frankenstein's monster:
Translation: Spot the difference
The massive bust has now been removed following the public outcry and will be replaced with a statue of a peace dove, according to local media reports .

        <Description>Is there a place for religion in the workplace?</Description>
        <MainBody>Firm faith: The company bosses who pray
By Katie Hope Business reporter, BBC News
6 July 2015
From the section Business
Saying prayers with colleagues would feel a bit uncomfortable, too intimate an activity in the workplace for many people.
Yet at Chinese real estate giant Tiantai Group, known as Tentimes Group in English, that is exactly what they do in the boardroom before making important decisions.
Three-quarters of the firm's eight-strong senior management team are Christians and founder and chairman Wang Ruoxiong, who himself became a Christian seven years ago, says that when the company has to make difficult decisions, it turns to the Bible for guidance.
In fact, he goes as far to say that it's not him but God running the firm.
"He controls everything. I am merely a housekeeper of Jesus, assisting him in taking care of the company," he says.
Wang Ruoxiong believes that Christian values have helped his firm to succeed
'Universal values'
Mr Wang admits that Christian beliefs alone have not driven the firm's success, acknowledging that employees' technical skills such as marketing and sales capability have also played a big part.
But he believes that following Christian values have helped to make the firm more effective.
He says that employees feel cared for, helping them to perform better, and that treating the company's suppliers more fairly has created stronger relationships with them, for example.
He also believes his approach is unique, which he says will help the company to survive despite increasing competition.
"When the senior managers at the top are willing to use the values in their own work and life, the values are passed down. Eventually they become the shared values of the common employees of the entire company.
"At that time, the company becomes truly irreplaceable," he says.
Gavin Oldham says he is careful not to "flash the brand" at work
Nonetheless meeting a company boss who is so open about his religion at work is rare. While organisations themselves must make allowances for their staff to be able to practise their religious faith, providing prayer rooms for example, those at the top normally keep their beliefs private. Typically they're wary of being seen as promoting their own faith to those below them.
Gavin Oldham, executive chairman of retail stockbroker The Share Centre, is an elective lay member of the General Synod - the highest governing body of the Church of England - a fact he states openly on his firm's website biography and his Twitter account.
But while he never hides the fact that he is a Christian, he says he is careful not to "flash the brand" at work.
"It can't be overt. There's such a huge range of backgrounds. It may be that people have no faith. You have to respect others," he tells the BBC.
But he says his faith does guide his business life as well as his personal life - particularly, he says, his belief in God's unconditional love, which he tries to apply in his own life.
He says the belief of "love your neighbour as yourself" provides a structure for when he's making difficult business decisions and ensures a consistency which he believes ultimately has helped him to make better judgements at work.
"It's not even necessary to chart them down as Christian values, they are universal values," he says.
'All you need is love'
It's a view shared by Whole Foods Market co chief executive Walter Robb, who says that while "spirituality" is often a charged word for people, it could just as easily be replaced with "love".
While for many, "love" at work may seem equally inappropriate, Mr Robb believes that a softer approach from those at the top, emphasising that the firm is part of a larger world with wider responsibilities, can be very powerful.
He recalls recently holding his granddaughter for the first time, reminding him of holding his own children when they were young, as an explanation for the feeling.
"That depth of feeling in your heart, your capacity to bring that to your work as a leader, your capacity to develop that capability in the organisation and to celebrate it, to reward it, to acknowledge it, to model it.
"Those sorts of things are part of creating a wider vessel and not a narrower vessel. And to the extent that that's spiritual, then I think that's a good thing."
Chen Feng, chairman of Chinese conglomerate HNA, whose empire spreads from aviation to real estate and financial services, draws on Buddhist teachings to help underpin his company's culture, but emphasises that religion alone isn't enough to create a successful company.
"Incentives and profits must also be given so that people are guided to the right way of life for themselves and the right way of development for the company.
"Buddhism is my thing. People have to solve their problems on their own. We cannot simply use one culture for all. We need to use all good cultures, and integrate them with modern management methods," he says.
This feature is based on interviews by leadership expert Steve Tappin for the BBC's CEO Guru series, produced by Neil Koenig.

        <Description>Why the Indian PM's new app includes a videogame</Description>
        <MainBody>Narendra Modi app is 'like Tinder for good governance'
7 July 2015
From the section India
Technology writer Krish Raghav reviews the Narendra Modi mobile app, unveiled by the Indian prime minister in June.
There is a lot of swiping in the new app, also called Narendra Modi (Google Play Store, free).
You swipe up to reveal new instructions. Swipe down to refresh the app's feed. Swipe left to approve of his government's new schemes, and swipe right to find new schemes to approve by swiping left.
It is like Tinder (the international dating app) for good governance, except all you can do is approve, and share your approval.
Often, you're not even sure what you're approving. The first question in the app's "Poll" section just asks: "Which of the following government initiatives do you think has had the most." The most what?
It does not matter.
All that matters is that you approve of the question, and tell your 900 Facebook friends, like I did, that you strongly believe that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India campaign) has "had the most".
The app has a quiet desperation to it, a weakly repetitive insistence that you share, share, share. You cannot even read your daily Modi news without logging in via Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or your Narendra Modi account (presumably the app's target demographic), and the little green "Share" button is the only consistent element in the app's otherwise confused design ethos.
Gaming approval
When I first loaded up the Narendra Modi App, I was expecting this:
A simple Modi-centric aggregator, built to amplify the well-oiled social media machine his campaign pioneered. Grafted to that, a one-stop shop for Modi news and updates, culled from his many productive online channels.  You can listen to old episodes of the PM's weekly radio show, or read all the (positive) media coverage he is receiving. I was expecting all that.
What I was not expecting was a videogame.
"Earn points and win badges" is one of the first things the app tells you about itself. "Badges come with recognition and increased responsibility."
Okay.
"Earn them all and establish yourself as a true changemaker."
This is where things get both clever and insidious. The app "gamifies" your approval of the government's policies - giving you the incremental opiate buzz of points ticking upwards and badges awarded. As a gamer, this opened some kind of ancient competitive gristle in my mind. I had 10 points, the app told me. Get 80, and I'd be awarded the "Pro Active" badge.
Challenge accepted, Mr Modi.
There are two ways to earn "points" - approve of the government's policies (by "Liking" posts) and share them (by posting articles from the app on your own feeds). I got right into it. I answered the aforementioned poll question for five points. I Liked a post about Mr Modi attending a World Yoga Day rally for two points. I shared his lecture at the Dhaka University earlier in June for two points.
Episodes from Mr Modi's life are written with breathless reverence
And that was it. Nothing left to approve. "Stay tuned!" the app said cheerfully. "Contribute by [showing] support towards various policies." I was stuck at 19 points, 61 short of that "Pro Active" badge. Desperate for policies to approve.
I consoled myself by reading some of the app's other content - episodes from Mr Modi's life, written with breathless reverence. I learnt that he was a "Man of Organisation", who had "mastered the Art of Governance".
I pored over Charts and Infographics (literally, because you can't zoom into them) flanking articles about the government policies, written like press releases. The app has a decent reading interface with a thoughtful layout that lets you filter for photos, charts or embedded videos.
With nothing else to do, and no apparent way to earn my badge, I stumbled upon the "Give Feedback" section of the app. I remembered its insistence that I "contribute" in whatever way I could, and I considered writing a thoughtful critique of the videogame component, and how its points economy was fundamentally broken.
But I couldn't be bothered. After all, I couldn't even get my "Pro Active" badge.
So how much would I give this app? Two stars.

        <title>7/7 anniversary: Is the UK safer now?</title>
        <Link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33415475#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa</Link>
        <Description>A decade on from the 7/7 attacks, are Londoners safer?</Description>
        <MainBody>The Syria factor
Islamic State extremists are believed to be encouraging British jihadists to commit attacks on their return
Almost the entire UK government apparatus underestimated both the appeal and the threat now emanating from the Syria-based terror group that calls itself Islamic State (IS).
Latest estimates put the number of foreign fighters flocking to join the group, or live under its control, in excess of 20,000. That is more than the number who went to Afghanistan to train in al-Qaeda camps when the Taliban were in charge for five years.
Official estimates put the number of Britons who have gone to Syria to join IS at 700, with around half that number returning to the UK. Real figures are probably higher.
Not all those who return need to be watched. Some come back disillusioned, some come back traumatised and need counselling.
But counter-terrorism officials believe there are concerted efforts by IS leaders in Syria to persuade Britons to carry out attacks in the UK, in some cases urging followers who have not even travelled to the Middle East.
The sheer numbers getting drawn to IS, for a whole range of reasons, means that the 'Syria factor' places an enormous workload on those trying to head off the next plot.
"Since 7/7 lots of different places have started to emerge as a source of a potential threat," says Aimen Deen, a former member of al-Qaeda who now works for a Middle East-based consultancy.
"Be this in Yemen, be this in North Africa, be this in Somalia or more recently in Syria and Iraq, where we can see that there are different groups and networks that are trying to launch attacks."
Multiplication of ways of attack
So-called "lone wolf" attacks such as that seen in Tunisia are among those most feared by the authorities
Al-Qaeda's primary modus operandi was big, co-ordinated, centrally planned attacks using synchronised suicide bombings. 9/11, 7/7, the Madrid and Bali bombings were all examples of this.
So too would have been the 2006 liquid bomb airline plot, if it had not been intercepted in time. That threat has not gone away.
There are still jihadist planners in Yemen, Syria and Pakistan who would like to execute just such a big, signature attack on a list of Western countries, of which Britain, the US, France and Denmark are at the top.
One of the most serious threats the UK has been rehearsing for, ever since the Mumbai siege of 2008, is a "marauding attack" by heavily-armed gunmen targeting defenceless citizens in a crowded city centre.
Plots are harder to detect right now because they moved from being centralised plots, organised by cells overseas into plots that are basically carried out by lone wolves, who are recruited in isolation and who are not in touch with other cells
Aimen Deen, Former jihadist
Powerful, automatic weapons are much harder to obtain in Britain than they are on the continent but that may not always be the case.
Most of today's would-be jihadist attackers are interested in a much simpler, cruder approach, one with minimal communications that can be intercepted, with as small as possible a circle of people in the know.
MI5 are believed to have between 2,000-3,000 people "on their radar", meaning people who are known to have extremist views or be in contact with extremists, but who have not necessarily committed a criminal offence.
Trying to second guess when someone's extremist views are going to translate into action, like the killers of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, is an ongoing challenge for the police and spooks.
They point out that "being on the radar" is not the same as "being under the microscope" and that to watch all those people all the time would require a network of informants akin to the Stasi in the former East Germany.
"Plots are harder to detect right now because they moved from being centralised plots, organised by cells overseas into plots that are basically carried out by lone wolves, who are recruited in isolation and who are not in touch with other cells," says Aimen Deen.
"Therefore when they decide to take action it is difficult to detect them in advance so it became harder and harder for security agencies."
Encryption
Deciphering encrypted messages can be a laborious process
Back in 2005 international terrorists communicated mainly by email or mobile phone.
Today the choice of methods at their disposal has ballooned, from easily encrypted messages to those hidden in online games. GCHQ has enormous and controversial powers to tap into communications but its operatives have to know what they are looking for.
Often, says one expert, it is not so much a case of looking for a needle in a haystack as looking for a certain type of needle in a haystack made up of needles.
Decrypting terrorist communications, once they are zeroed in on, is labour intensive as they can pass through dozens of stages of encryption using multiple nodes around the world.
Sometimes it can prove a false alert and sometimes the trail can reach a dead end, as plotters switch seamlessly to a different means of communication.
Threat level
Britain is currently at a national terror threat state of "severe", the second highest in a ranking of five.
Officially this means a terrorist attack of some sort is thought "highly likely", ranging from a single jihadist with a machete on the High Street to a 7/7-style attack.
This assessment is based on the intelligence being fed into a unit called JTAC, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, but it is far from complete.
MI5 and the police have stopped a very large number of plots since the 7/7 bombings but they also missed the 21/7 plot two weeks later - it failed because the bombs did not work - and the Woolwich attack of 2013.
Although today Britain has an almost negligible military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan (one of the main reasons given by jihadists for their targeting a decade ago), the threat has still multiplied and morphed.
How long will it last?
"Well it started a generation ago," says former jihadist Aimen Deen. "There is no reason to believe that it won't last another generation or possibly even two".

        <MainBody>DJ Rita Ray's African tracks: From howling blues to twisted love
28 June 2015
From the section Africa
Howling desert blues from Mali, Afro-Cuban salsa with Angolan roots, a love story with a twist from the Democratic Republic of Congo and exhortations for unity from a Ghanaian pan-Africanist make up the first of a regular focus on new African music releases by DJ Rita Ray:
Artist: Samba Toure
Album: Gandadiko (Glitter Beat Records)
A guitar master from northern Mali, Samba Toure returns with his singular brand of Songhai blues.
Toure earned his stripes with the kora genius Toumani Diabate and the late Ali Farka Toure.
His new album Gandadiko, meaning Land of Drought or Burning Land, has a smouldering epic feel, featuring howling guitar riffs, the spiky ngoni (traditional West African lute) and emotive keening of the bowed one-string djerka.
The over revved, loping camel-gait rhythms evoke his arid homeland.
His lyrics, powerful and revealing, go behind the headlines and tell of the devastating reality of the social and political aftermath of Mali's recent traumas and the Islamist militant takeover of the north.
The hopeful sounds cushion the cautionary tales and astute observations of his songs, such as Touri Idje Bibi (Black Fruits) where he sings: "Oh earth, forgiveness, oh river forgiveness,
"Every day we offend you."
Artist: Ricardo Lemvo &amp; Makina Loca
Album: La Rumba Soy Yo (Cumbancha)
One of the few Africans to stamp his mark on the global salsa market, Ricardo Lemvo and his Makina Loca band offer a lush tropical offering with their new album.
La Rumba Soy Yo was a three-year recording adventure, a labour of love taking place across three continents and four countries - the US, Canada, France and Angola.
The Salsa star, raised in DR Congo, looks to his Angolan roots for inspiration - seamlessly mixing in kizomba and semba rhythms with the soukous guitars that augment his trademark upbeat Congolese-Cuban rumba.
The infectious dance of the track E Moyo exemplifies the steamy street party feel of the album.
Lemvo and Makina Loca have played around the globe over the years, hopefully this release will help them fulfil their long-held dream of touring Africa and Cuba.
Artist: Laurette La Perle
Single: Twist (Brown Touch Entertainment)
Laurette La Perle is an up and coming singer-songwriter from DR Congo, who also harbours dreams of touring far and wide with her forthcoming album.
Young and ambitious, she is already a multi-award winner, scooping up gongs including the Okapi Awards Best Song of the Year and Best Central African Female at The All Africa Music Awards in 2014.
La Perle was surrounded by music as a child, and received vocal training at a local Kinshasa church choir - her launch-pad into the world of musical competitions.
Now she infuses her distinctive brand of urban rumba-laced soukous with R&amp;B.
La Perle's lyrics fearlessly probe where others might fear to tread.
Twist, the single from her next album, is a tangled tale of love - a soap opera involving two women and a man.
It is not the age-old story, the twist is that the two women are also having an affair - with each other.
Artist: Rocky Dawuni
Album: Branches from the Same Tree (Cumbancha)
Ghanaian reggae singer Rocky Dawuni remains faithful to his mission to spread the message of love and unity.
The songs on his sixth album, Branches of the Same Tree, are an appealing blend of the sounds and rhythms of the black diaspora, which he calls Afro-soul.
Dawuni's music grows from the steady roots of reggae, then delves into the treasure trove found in music of black origin, including New Orleans funk, Brazilian samba and Afrobeat.
He is a passionate humanitarian activist from northern Ghana, whose world vision is expressed in his uplifting, thought-provoking songs.
Dawuni's pan-African vision finds him building bridges and making fans around the continent.
The track Nairobi features Kenyan dub poet Oneko Arika and was written when he visited the Kibera slum just before the 2013 elections.
It was a gesture of solidarity during a time of ethnic and political tension.
"I wrote it as a love song for a city, country and people," he said.
