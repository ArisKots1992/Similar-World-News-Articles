        <MainBody>Greek debt: ECB 'to maintain funding limit'
28 June 2015
From the section Europe
Greek banks are reliant on emergency support from the ECB
The European Central Bank says it will maintain its emergency funding of Greek banks at the level agreed on Friday.
The ECB said that it stood ready to review the decision on its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) and would work closely with the Bank of Greece.
BBC economics editor Robert Peston says the ECB is not providing any additional aid to Greece, which will lead to huge pressure for capital controls.
Greek banks depend on ELA, and cutting it could push Greece out of the euro.
An ECB spokesman told the BBC: "Greece still has access to the ELA."
The ECB statement quotes Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras as saying: "The Bank of Greece, as a member of the eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances."
The statement comes after eurozone finance minsters on Saturday refused a Greek request to extend Greece's current bailout.
The bailout expires on Tuesday, the same day that Greece has to make a payment of  1.5bn (1.1bn) to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it risks defaulting on.
Greece and its creditors had been locked in negotiations over a new bailout on Friday when the Greek government called a surprise referendum for 5 July over whether to accept the terms it was being offered. It has described the international offer as "not viable".
It then asked for an extension of its current deal until after the vote was completed.

        <MainBody>Organisers questioned over Taiwan water park inferno
28 June 2015
From the section Asia
Organisers of a party at an amusement park in Taiwan have been detained for questioning after a fire tore through crowds at a party.
More than 500 people were injured in the incident, when a coloured powder apparently ignited after being discharged from the stage onto the audience.
Footage showed people panicking and screaming, and inflatable water toys used as stretchers.
Some 182 injured are in intensive care.
Figures are not yet available, but officials said many of the victims appear to in their 20s or younger.
Some of them breathed in the powder, causing respiratory problems.
The water park outside the capital Taipei has been closed, and so-called colour parties have been banned while the investigation into what caused the inferno proceeds.
Skin 'gone'
Event manager Lu Chung-chi and several staff members were detained by police and are being questioned by prosecutors.
Mr Lu was pictured in the Taiwan News with handcuffs on and his hands in a prayer position. The news site said he had apologised for what had happened and pledged to take responsibility for it.
Investigators were collecting evidence from the concert arena on Sunday morning
The blaze began so quickly that many partygoers had no time to escape
Many of those injured were initially tended by fellow partygoers
A trolley was used to rush one young man with leg burns to an ambulance
Footage of the incident shows a party in full swing when fire suddenly erupts.
It was "hell", a male student who sustained minor injuries said, according to AFP news agency.
"There was blood everywhere, including in the pool where lots of the injured were soaking themselves for relief from the pain."
His girlfriend added: "I saw lots of people whose skin was gone."
The fire was quickly brought under control.
The fire department said the powder ,used to create a party atmosphere, may have ignited due to the heat of the lights on the stage, or from sparks from machinery.
The substance is also used in other countries. It is made of dried corn and can be highly flammable, says the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei.
The 519 victims were sent to 41 hospitals, and 413 are still in hospital, say municipal authorities.
Soaring temperatures
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou has been visiting some of the victims in hospital
The incident occurred about 20:30 (12:30 GMT) on Saturday.  More than 1,000 people were near the stage at the time.
Many people flocked to water parks on Saturday as temperatures reached 36.6C (98F) in Taipei and as high as 38C in other parts of Taiwan.
Taiwan has suffered a series of deadly fires in the past couple of years due partly to poor enforcement of building and fire safety codes and illegal construction, our correspondent says.
A fire earlier this year killed six firefighters, prompting orders to rectify illegally constructed buildings and upgrade firefighters' equipment and training.

        <MainBody>Iran nuclear talks 'to go beyond 30 June deadline' - US
28 June 2015
From the section Middle East
Iranian nuclear talks are set to go on beyond Tuesday's formal deadline for a deal, a senior US official says.
The admission came as Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif prepared to fly back to Tehran from Vienna, Austria, where talks are taking place.
Observers said Mr Zarif probably needed to seek guidance over a stumbling block in negotiations - how much access Tehran will grant to nuclear monitors.
Seven countries are taking part in the talks.
The negotiations aim to see limits placed on Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for international sanctions on Iran.
The so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - want to limit Iran's sensitive nuclear activities to ensure that it could not build a nuclear weapon quickly.
The negotiators were a few days late agreeing a framework agreement, which was reached in early April, and it now appears likely that Tuesday's deadline for a comprehensive deal may also not be respected.
But the US official - who spoke on condition of anonymity - insisted there would be no long-term extension, tweeted the BBC's state department correspondent Barbara Plett .
As well as the details of the proposed UN monitoring regime on Tehran's activities, disagreements are also reported to exist over the timing of sanctions relief.
US negotiators are being closely watched by critics both at home and in Israel - including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country is understood to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal.
On Sunday he decried "this bad agreement, which is becoming worse by the day".

        <MainBody>One Belgian and one German have so far been identified among the dead, the Tunisian health ministry said. One citizen of the Irish Republic is also confirmed dead. There were also thought to be Tunisians  killed in the attack.
At least 36 people were injured, some seriously.

Many of the tourists in hotels targeted in the attack have left the country or are waiting for specially arranged flights, but correspondents noted a few were back by the hotel pool on Saturday, vowing they would continue their holidays as scheduled.
Tunisia's economy relies on tourism, and there are fears that the recent attacks will deal a major blow to the industry.
Security officials said the attacker, who posed as a swimmer but was carrying a rifle under a parasol, started shooting on the beach before entering the Hotel Imperial Marhaba, continuing to shoot.
Officials later identified the gunman as 23-year-old student Seifeddine Rezgui. They said they had no inkling of what he had been planning.
The country has recently seen militant Islamists gain strength since the overthrow of long-serving ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in in 2011.

        <MainBody>Kuwait Shia mosque attack: Bomber 'was Saudi'
28 June 2015
From the section Middle East
Kuwait state media released an image of the alleged bomber, who authorities said had been identified as Saudi citizen Fahd Suleiman Abdulmohsen al-Qaba'a
Kuwait says the attacker who carried out Friday's suicide bombing at a Shia mosque was a Saudi citizen.
The interior ministry named the bomber as Fahd Suleiman Abdulmohsen al-Qaba'a, according to state media.
The ministry said he flew into Kuwait on Friday just hours before he detonated explosives at the mosque, killing at least 27 people.
The Islamic State group - which regards Shia Muslims as heretics - says it was behind the attack.
Last month, an IS branch in Saudi Arabia carried out bombings on consecutive Fridays on Shia mosques there.
These attacks have brought home the growing threat posed by the jihadists to the Gulf, says the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher.
Arrests
More than 200 people were injured in Friday's bombing at Imam Sadiq Mosque in Kuwait City - the bloodiest ever attack on Shia Muslims in the country's recent history.
Kuwaiti officials said the Saudi suspect was in Kuwait illegally.
Several people have been arrested in connection with the attack - including both the owner and driver of the car in which the bomber arrived at the mosque.
They have also arrested the owner of a house which the bomber is said to have visited - the interior ministry saying initial investigations showed he was a supporter of "extremist and deviant ideology".
Security has been stepped in Kuwait since Friday's bloodshed
Often at odds, Gulf states have united in confronting IS, our correspondent says.
All have joined the US-led coalition against the group in Syria and Iraq, although they have kept their participation low key.
IS is clearly hoping to stoke further tension between Sunnis and Shias in the Gulf, our correspondent adds.
Kuwait has one of the biggest Shia communities in the region, but any sectarian friction has so far been less visible than in Saudi Arabia or Bahrain.

        <MainBody>Confederate flag at South Carolina State House pulled down
27 June 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
A black woman has climbed the flagpole in the grounds of the South Carolina State House and removed its controversial Confederate flag.
Bree Newsome climbed the 30ft (9m) steel pole just after dawn on Saturday despite police telling her to come down, Associated Press reported.
Ms Newsome and a man were later arrested and the flag returned.
There have been calls for it to be removed since nine people were killed in a racist attack in Charleston.
Shooting suspect Dylann Roof had been pictured with the Civil War era saltire - seen by some as a symbol of slavery and racism - on a number of occasions.
There has been a social media campaign to remove the flag
Since the pictures emerged there has been pressure to remove the flag from the memorial in front of the South Carolina State House in Columbia.
It was first flown in 1962 in protest at the growing civil rights movement and has been a source of rancour and controversy in the state ever since.
The hashtag #TakeItDown has been trending on Twitter in the US.
Bree Newsome was taken into custody and the flag reinstated
White House spokesman Eric Schultz has said President Obama believes the Confederate flag "belongs in a museum".
Ms Newsome describes herself on Twitter as a filmmaker, singer, songwriter and freedom fighter.
A rally by flag supporters was scheduled for later on Saturday.
An impromptu Ride for Pride event took place in Brandon in Florida on Friday.
There have been rallies to support the use of the flag

        <MainBody>France beheading attack: Suspect sent selfie with head
27 June 2015
From the section Europe
A photo of beheading victim Herve Cornara was released by friends
The man suspected of an attack on a factory in France sent a selfie where he posed with the severed head of his boss, security sources say.
Yassin Salhi, 35, reportedly sent the photo to a Canadian mobile phone number via the WhatsApp messaging service after Friday's attack near Lyon.
His boss Herve Cornara's head was found alongside Islamic flags.
The suspect is accused of ramming a vehicle into an area containing flammable liquids, causing a blast.
Police have so far not found any motive or possible foreign connection, prosecutors say.
In response to the attack, President Francois Hollande held a security meeting with ministers on Saturday.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls cut short a visit to Latin America to return to France which is on its highest state of alert after the attack in the small town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier some 40km (25 miles) from Lyon.
Yassin Salhi had been investigated in the past about his alleged links with Islamist militants.
Officials and residents of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier gathered outside the town hall on Saturday morning to observe a minute's silence.
'Suspect speaking'
Investigators are still trying to establish the identity of the recipient of the selfie.
A general view of the Air Products factory
They were unable to immediately confirm media reports that it was an unspecified person now in Syria, AP news agency reports.
The agency quoted the Paris prosecutor's office as saying the suspect had begun speaking to investigators after initially keeping silent.
Mr Salhi was arrested at the Air Products factory on Friday morning.
Anti-terror police searched the apartment of the father-of-three in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, taking his wife and sister into custody.
It is alleged he was waved through the gates of the factory because he was a regular delivery driver.
The severed head of Mr Cornara was found placed on factory railings. It is unclear when he died.
'Heated arguments'
President Hollande said: "We have no doubt that the attack was to blow up the building. It bears the hallmarks of a terrorist attack."
US-owned Air Products makes gases and chemicals and has employees in 50 countries around the world.
Chief Executive Seifi Ghasemi said: "I believe I speak for all of our Air Products family around the world in expressing our deepest sympathies to the family of the victim of this unspeakable act."
The home of the suspect, who was known to police, has been searched
There has been a heavy police presence outside the factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier
According to a report in the French newspaper Le Figaro (in French) , a friend of Herve Cornara witnessed heated arguments between the delivery firm boss and his employee "several times".
Mr Cornara, 54, is said to have been a well-known figure in the town of Fontaines-sur-Saone. He led a tenants' association and campaigned for better amenities in the area.
"He fought with local authorities when the heating wasn't working," another friend recalled, speaking to AFP news agency. "He got involved in the campaign to save the post office."

        <MainBody>Armenia protests: Electricity price hike suspended
27 June 2015
From the section Europe
The president of Armenia has suspended an increase in electricity prices that led to more than a week of protests.
Serzh Sargsyan said that the government would temporarily cover the cost of the electricity price rise pending a review.
Protesters have been blocking the main avenue in the capital, Yerevan.
They remained on the streets on Saturday, saying the president's concession fell short of their demand for the price hike to be reversed.
The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Yerevan that the protest area has been surrounded by the police, and buses and water canons have been brought close to where the demonstration is being held.
Protests began a few days after a 17 June decision by the state utilities commission to increase electricity tariffs from the beginning of August by more than 16%.
In the early hours of Tuesday, the situation escalated when police used water cannon to disperse the crowd. There have been round-the-clock demonstrations , referred to on social media under the hashtag #ElectricYerevan.
Analysts say the protests are partly fuelled by anger over years of alleged corruption and unaccountability within the Armenian government, and big business monopolised by Russian oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.
Armenia still has close links with Russia. The former Soviet nation hosts a Russian military base and a Russian company runs its power distribution network.
The electricity network is wholly owned by Inter-RAO, a large Russian energy company whose chairman Igor Sechin is a close friend of President Vladimir Putin.
Mr Sargsyan's announcement of the price hike suspension followed a meeting with Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov.
Russia agreed to loan Armenia $200m (127m) to help modernise its military, and to allow a Russian soldier accused of killing seven members of an Armenian family to be tried locally.

        <MainBody>Argentina judge orders asset seizure of Falklands oil firms
27 June 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Rhetoric on the islands is likely to step up during the campaign for October's presidential elections
A federal judge in Argentina has ordered the seizure of assets of five companies drilling for oil in the Falkland Islands.
Tierra del Fuego judge Lilian Herraez ordered the authorities to seize boats and other assets worth $156m.
Argentina claims sovereignty of the islands, which it calls the Malvinas.
The oil companies named in the case are not based in Argentina and it is not clear how the measure will be implemented.
Drilling for oil in the territorial waters around the Falklands began in 2010 despite opposition from Buenos Aires.
'Bordering on stupidity'
Judge Herraez says the new ruling will take steps to try to seize the companies' assets abroad.
The five companies mentioned are: Premier Oil Plc, Rockhopper Exploration Plc, Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd, Noble Energy Inc and Edison International Spa.
Three of the companies are British-based, one is American, based in Texas, and one is French-owned, based in Italy.
Britain and Argentina went to war over the Falklands in 1982.
Argentina occupied the South Atlantic archipelago for 74 days, before British forces regained control.
During the conflict, 255 British and about 650 Argentine servicemen were killed, along with three Falklands civilians.
Argentina accuses Britain of colonialism, saying the islands lie some 700km (450 miles) off its coast.
Britain has held the Falklands for 180 years and says the wishes of its 3,000 residents should be respected.
The vast majority of them want the islands to remain a British overseas territory.
"They want to remain British and that view should be respected by everybody, including by Argentina," said David Cameron after a 2013 referendum in which the islanders gave almost unanimous support for the status quo.
Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said at the time that Britain was "arrogant" and "bordering on stupidity" for refusing to negotiate on the future of the islands.

        <MainBody>US Supreme Court rules gay marriage is legal nationwide
27 June 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
The US Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is a legal right across the United States.
It means the 14 states with bans on same-sex marriage will no longer be able to enforce them.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the plaintiffs asked "for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."
The ruling brings to an end more than a decade of bitter legal battles.
Same-sex couples in several affected states including Georgia, Michigan, Ohio and Texas rushed to wed on Friday.
However officials in other states, including Mississippi and Louisiana, said marriages had to wait until procedural issues were addressed.
President Barack Obama said the ruling was a "victory for America".
"When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free " he said.
However, Christian conservatives condemned the decision.
Former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee called it "an out-of-control act of unconstitutional, judicial tyranny".
And Kellie Fiedorek, a lawyer for an anti-gay marriage advocacy group, said the decision "ignored the voices of thousands of Americans".
Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, a state where marriages licences will now be issued to same-sex couples, said the justices "have imposed on the entire country their personal views on an issue that the Constitution and the Court's previous decisions reserve to the people of the states".
At the scene - Paul Blake, BBC News
Loud cheers erupted outside the court after the ruling was announced, and there were tears, hugs, and cheers of "USA USA USA!".
A sea of rainbow flags overwhelmed the few anti-gay marriage activists who reacted in disbelief, and the demonstration seemed to turn into a street party.
A tour bus drove past honking as hundreds cheered the decision.
One of the demonstrators, Jordan Monaghan, called his mother from his mobile phone amid the celebrations.
"Hey mom, I'm at the Supreme Court. Your son can have a husband now," Mr Monaghan said.
Jordan Monaghan told his mum: "Your son can have a husband now."
Minutes after the ruling, couples in one of the states that had a ban, Georgia, lined up in hope of being wed.
In Texas, Yasmin Menchaca and her partner Catherine Andrews told the BBC that they are "trying to round up our parents" in order to get married on Friday.
The two have been together for six years, and had attempted to marry in Washington state - but decided to wait because of the financial burden of flying their parents across the country.
On social media, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton merely tweeted the word "proud" and the White House changed its Twitter avatar into the rainbow colours.
The case considered by the court concerned Jim Obergefell, an Ohio resident who was not recognised as the legal widower of his late husband, John Arthur.
"It's my hope that gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past, and from this day forward it will simply be 'marriage,'" an emotional Mr Obergefell said outside the court.
Couples in some parts of Texas were able to get married
States affected:
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, most of Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.
The first state to allow same-sex marriage was Massachusetts, which granted the right in 2004.
In recent years, a wave of legal rulings and a dramatic shift in public opinion have expanded gay marriage in the US.
In 2012, the high court struck down a federal anti same-sex marriage law.

Women's World Cup 2015 highlights: England 2-1 Canada
28 June 2015 Last updated at 02:45
By Alistair Magowan BBC Sport in Vancouver
England face Japan (coverage from 23:40 BST, 1 July)
Two early goals put Lionesses through
England reached a World Cup semi-final for the first time in their history as victory over hosts Canada set up a tie with reigning champions Japan.
Women's World Cup Catch-Up: Lionesses make history in Canada
The Lionesses made a dream start with two goals in three minutes as Jodie Taylor, making her first World Cup start nine weeks after knee surgery, capitalised on Lauren Sesselmann's blunder.
Lucy Bronze then headed in Fara Williams' free-kick to double the advantage.
Taylor tearful after 'amazing' England win
England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley continued her mixed World Cup when she gifted Christine Sinclair a goal three minutes before the break.
But in a second half in which Mark Sampson's side became disjointed, England held on for a famous win that sparked joyous celebrations at the final whistle.
England had already broken new ground by winning their first World Cup knockout game in the last 16, when they beat Norway.
Women's World Cup 2015: Jodie Taylor capitalises to give England lead
But the result means Welshman Sampson has guided a senior England side, men's or women's, to a World Cup semi-final for the first time since 1990.
As in their final group game win over Colombia, England started fast and then dug deep to keep Canada out as they matched the victory they inflicted over John Herdman's side in this year's Cyprus Cup.
Although they did not reach the heights of their second-round win over Norway, they will now travel to Edmonton to face a team they beat in the group stages of the last World Cup before Japan went on to lift the trophy.
Women's World Cup 2015: Lucy Bronze heads England 2-0 up
England's preparations were disrupted shortly before the game when vice-captain Jordan Nobbs posted an update on social media to say her World Cup was over because of a hamstring injury - although the Football Association denied the story was true.
But it had little effect on England, as 29-year-old Taylor showed signs of her growing status  just 10 months after making her debut by robbing Sesselmann and drilling low past hosts' goalkeeper Erin McLeod for her first World Cup goal.
The nightmare continued for Canada when England won a free-kick deep in Canadian territory.
Williams picked out Bronze at the back post, and the right-back managed to loop her header over McLeod and in off the crossbar.
Women's World Cup 2015: Karen Bardsley error gives Canada lifeline
England's goals came against the run of play - Melissa Tancredi guilty of being wasteful for Canada - and Katie Chapman almost added to England's tally when her header clipped the top of the crossbar.
Sinclair was then presented with a chance to get Canada back in the match when Bardsley, who was also at fault when she conceded late on against Mexico, could not gather Ashley Lawrence's centre and Canada's record goalscorer converted from close range.
Bardsley's game came to a premature end when she departed five minutes into the second half with what looked like a swollen eye and was replaced by Siobhan Chamberlain.
Women's World Cup 2015: Canada's John Herdman apologies to nation
But it did not disrupt England.
Taylor was denied a second when McLeod brilliantly tipped her curling effort wide.
With the game becoming scrappy, it felt like another England mistake might lead to a Canada equaliser.
But after Sophie Schmidt fired over seven minutes from the end, the Lionesses remained resolute and roared wildly as the hosts were eliminated in front of 54,027 fans.

        <MainBody>Brazil: Foie gras banned in Sao Paulo restaurants
27 June 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Most of the foie gras produced in the world comes from France
Legislators in Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, have banned the production and sale of foie gras, a delicacy made from the fatty liver of force-fed ducks and geese.
City councillors said animals go through a great deal of suffering for the production of the pate.
Animal rights campaigners have hailed the move, but some of Sao Paulo's best-known chefs have voiced concern.
Foie gras, originally a French delicacy, is produced worldwide.
Several countries, including Britain, Germany, Italy and Argentina, have banned its production. But the sale of the pate is still allowed in most of them.
The Sao Paulo city council has set a fine of 5,000 reais (1,000) for restaurants and bars that break the new law - which will take effect in 45 days.
"Foie gras is an appetiser for the wealthy," said the law's author, city councillor Laercio Benko.
"It does not benefit human health and to make it, the birds are submitted to a lot of suffering,'' said Mr Benko.
However Sao Paulo-based chef Alex Atala told the UOL news portal: "How can a city regulate what a person eats? Where will it all end?''

        <MainBody>Mother and baby survive Colombia jungle plane crash
26 June 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Ms Murillo suffered some injuries and burns but she is recovering well
A young mother and her baby have been found alive five days after their plane crashed in the jungle of western Colombia.
A Colombian Air Force chief described their survival as "a miracle".
Maria Nelly Murillo, 18, and her one-year-old son were found by rescuers near to where their small Cessna plane crashed in Choco province.
Ms Murillo had some injuries and burns while her baby appeared to be in good health.
Contact lost
The twin-engine Cessna, which was carrying fish and coconuts, had been flying from the town of Nuqui on the Pacific coast to Quibdo, the capital of Choco.
Stories of miraculous plane crash survivals
Baby Yudier Moreno was held by a rescuer on the flight back to Quibdo
It disappeared from the radar of the civil aviation authorities 20 minutes into the flight. A search plane eventually found the wreckage in the Alto Baudo region.
The reason for the crash is not known. The pilot of the Cessna was found dead in the cockpit.
Glimmer of hope
There was no trace of Ms Murillo or her baby, Yudier Moreno, which the passenger list said had been on board.
But according to Col Hector Carrascal of the Colombian Air Force, rescuers took hope when they noticed that the cabin door was ajar.
Search and rescue aircraft found the wreck of the plane. The cause of the crash is unclear
"It could have opened on impact, but it could have been opened from the inside," he said.
"We didn't have a clue what had happened to them: they could be lost in the jungle trying to survive or they could have died already."
Part of the search party searched the area on foot, while others flew in a helicopter using a loudspeaker to shout Ms Murillo's name and urge her to return to the crash site.
But for two days their search yielded no results.
'Miracle'
Finally, on Wednesday, they located Ms Murillo about 500m from the site of the crash in a ravine on the banks of a river.
Ms Murillo and her baby were taken by helicopter to a hospital in Quibdo
"It's a miracle," Col Carrascal said. Of the baby, who is unharmed, he said: "His mother's spirit must have given him strength to survive."
The pair were airlifted to a hospital in Quibdo. BBC Mundo's Natalio Cosoy has spoken to Ms Murillo's elder brother, Carlos.
Mr Murillo said she had managed to open the cabin door and run into the jungle as fire was spreading in the cabin.
"It was then she remembered she had a baby and went back from him," said Carlos Murillo. She sustained burns to her face, an arm and a leg.
Afraid the plane might explode, she walked into the jungle along the bank of a small river.
She was able to survive by drinking coconut water from the coconuts the plane had been carrying, her brother said. She used big leaves to collect and drink rain water.
Ms Murillo eventually heard the calls over loudspeaker from the rescue helicopter which prompted her to make her way back to the crash site.

        <MainBody>Somalia attack: Al-Shabab 'kills 30' at AU military base
26 June 2015
From the section Africa
Al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack
At least 30 people have been killed after gunmen attacked an African Union military base in southern Somalia, witnesses say.
A suicide car bomber drove into the main gates of the base in Leego, along the main road connecting the capital, Mogadishu and the city of Baidoa.
The militant Islamist group al-Shabab says its fighters have taken control of the base but this is not confirmed.
Al-Shabab is battling Somalia's government for control of the country.
The base is manned by Burundian soldiers from the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), which has more than 20,000 troops in the country.
Amisom confirmed on its Twitter account that an attack was ongoing, but has not given any details on casualties.
Leego residents have seen militants burning vehicles, carrying off weapons and removing the bodies of their fighters killed in the attack, reports the BBC's Mohamed Moalimu from Mogadishu.

        <MainBody>Nigeria court in Kano sentences nine people to death for blasphemy
26 June 2015
From the section Africa
An Islamic court has sentenced nine people to death for insulting the Prophet Muhammad in the northern Nigerian city of Kano.
The accused, who were all Muslims, had pleaded guilty, the head of Kano's religious police, Aminu Ibrahim Daurawa, told the BBC.
The trial was speedily done in secret after a section of the court was burnt down by angry protesters last month.
It is not known if they will appeal against the sentence.
The alleged offence was committed last month at a religious gathering in honour of Sheikh Ibrahim Niasse, the Senegalese founder of the Tijaniya sect, which has a large following across West Africa.
The nine, eight man and a woman, were reported to have said that "Niasse was bigger than Prophet Muhammad", triggering unrest.
The venue was burnt to the ground by an angry mob and the nine were arrested,
"There has been consensus among Muslims scholars that insulting the prophet carries a death sentence," Mr Daurawa told the BBC Hausa service.
"We quickly put them on trial to avoid bloodshed because people were very angry and trying to take law into their hands," he added.
Kano has a predominately Muslim population and Islamic courts operate alongside secular courts.
BBC Kano reporter Yusuf Yakasai said people celebrated in some parts of the city when news of the judgement emerged.
Tijaniya at a glance
The Sufi sect of Tijaniya was founded in Algeria in 1784 by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tijani.
It spread all over the world, with large following in north and west Africa. It also has followers in South Africa, Indonesia and other parts of the world.
There are other Sufi sects in Islam but Tijaniya is the largest.
They have three main daily practices: Asking the forgiveness of God; sending prayers to the Prophet Muhammad and affirming the Oneness of Allah.
Senegalese-born Sheikh Ibrahim Niasse was credited with reviving the sect in the 20th Century. People travel from across the continent to visit his shrine.
They have several factions including the Haqiqa (Realist) group, whose leaders were convicted accused of blasphemy in Kano.
Several states in predominantly Muslims northern Nigeria have introduced Sharia law after the country returned to civilian rule in 1999.
This is the first time a death sentence has been handed down for blasphemy in northern Nigeria.
The sentence has been delivered for other offences such as adultery but none has been carried out.

        <MainBody>Taiwan Formosa Water Park explosion injures hundreds
28 June 2015
From the section Asia
More than 500 people were injured when fire ripped through crowds at a party at an amusement park outside Taiwan's capital Taipei.
Saturday's incident at the Formosa Water Park is believed to have happened when a coloured powder ignited after being discharged onto the crowd.
Footage showed people panicking and screaming. Inflatable water toys were shown being used as stretchers.
Some 190 people are seriously hurt - 182 are in intensive care.
Some of them breathed in the powder, causing respiratory problems.
Local media said organisers of the Color Play Asia event had been taken in for questioning by prosecutors.
Skin 'gone'
Footage of the incident shows a party in full swing when suddenly fire erupts.
It was "hell", a male student who sustained minor injuries said, according to AFP news agency.
"There was blood everywhere, including in the pool where lots of the injured were soaking themselves for relief from the pain."
His girlfriend added: "I saw lots of people whose skin was gone."
The incident occurred during a concert
A trolley was used to rush one young man with leg burns to an ambulance
The fire was quickly brought under control, but the cause of the incident is still under investigation.
The authorities believe something that caught fire caused the coloured powder spray or dust - used to create a party atmosphere - to explode.
The substance is also used in other countries. It is made of dried corn and can be highly flammable, our correspondent says.
The 519 victims were sent to 41 hospitals, and 413 are still in hospital, say municipal authorities.
The incident occurred about 20:30 (12:30 GMT).  More than 1,000 people were near the stage at the time.
The fire department said: "Our initial understanding is this explosion and fire... was caused by the powder spray. It could have been due to the heat of the lights on the stage".
Soaring temperatures
Many people flocked to water parks on Saturday as temperatures reached 36.6C (98F) in Taipei and as high as 38C in other parts of Taiwan, says the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei.
New Taipei City's mayor, Eric Chu, ordered an immediate shutdown of the water park pending an investigation.
Taiwan has suffered a series of deadly fires in the past couple of years due partly to poor enforcement of building and fire safety codes and illegal construction, our correspondent adds.
A fire earlier this year killed six firefighters, prompting orders to rectify illegally constructed buildings and upgrade firefighters' equipment and training.

        <MainBody>Sri Lanka's president dissolves parliament
26 June 2015
From the section Asia
Maithripala Sirisena dissolved parliament with effect from midnight
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has dissolved parliament, paving the way for an early general election.
"The president signed a gazette notification dissolving parliament with effect from midnight today," government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said.
The general election was not scheduled for another 10 months.
Mr Sirisena defeated incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa in presidential elections held in January.
The president's decision to dissolve parliament came shortly after a spokesman for the United National Party (UNP) said it had formally requested him to do so.
The UNP was the main party behind Mr Sirisena's presidential bid and its leader, Ranil Wickremesingha, is the country's prime minister.
Sri Lankan law dictates that elections be held between 52 and 66 days after the dissolution.
Government sources told the BBC that the election will be held on 17 August.
Sri Lankan election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya is scheduled to hold a news conference on Saturday where he will announce the dates.
The dissolution of parliament ends the term of the coalition government that was appointed for a 100-day period after the presidential election result. However, it exceeded that time limit as it sought to implement key constitutional reforms.
Former President Rajapaksa is expected to use the elections to stage a political comeback.  He has previously announced that he intends to be the new prime minister.

        <MainBody>NI driver killed in Belgium school trip bus crash
28 June 2015
From the section Northern Ireland
A bus driver from Northern Ireland has been killed in a coach crash in Belgium.
He was on a bus carrying 34 school children from an Essex school in the UK.
Another driver, also from Northern Ireland, has been seriously injured.
A pupil from Brentwood School who was on the bus suffered a head injury and is in intensive care. It is understood that three pupils and two teachers are in hospital.
The bus company, Richmond Coaches, is from Lisburn, County Antrim.
The bus overturned on the A18 (E40) at Middelkerke, West Flanders at 09:45 local time (08:45 BST).
Eyewitnesses said it crashed into a motorway bridge pillar.
West Flanders traffic police confirmed that one person is dead and one is injured.
A rescue worker carries students' backpacks from the bus
Thirty-one children and three teachers walked away from the crash.
The children from Brentwood School were all aged from 11 to 13 years old.
Ian Davies, the school's head teacher said: "There are three children in hospital. We don't know the full extent of their injuries.
"I know that one boy has a head injury which is being monitored very carefully.
"I have spoken to the lead teacher on the trip. He is in hospital, I think he broke his collar bone, but seemed in as good a shape as could be expected."
A spokesman from Richmond Coaches of Ballinderry Road, Lisburn, confirmed that one of its vehicles had been involved in the crash.
He said what had happened was "a tragedy" and the company was co-operating with the authorities.
He said the company's thoughts were with everyone involved and they were cooperating fully with the authorities.
Janna Rommel-Opstaele, the mayor of the nearby coastal town of Middelkerke, told press agency Reuters that the bus driver had been killed and another seriously injured.
"Some of the children with light injuries have been taken to hospital and local medical centres," she said.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were aware of the crash and were working with  the Belgian authorities to establish details.

        <MainBody>Syria Islamic State: Kurds 'claim control over Kobane'
27 June 2015
From the section Middle East
Smoke could still be seen over Kobane on Saturday, from Turkish territory
Islamic State (IS) militants have been driven out of the town of Kobane, on the Turkish border, Kurdish forces and activists say.
IS launched a surprise assault on the long-contested town on Thursday, reportedly massacring civilians, including women and children.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 206 bodies were found, most with bullet wounds.
Kurdish forces broke an IS siege of Kobane only in January.
Meanwhile, fighting is reportedly continuing in the Syrian city of Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) further east, which was also attacked by IS on Thursday.
Troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and their allies are tackling the militants after fighting which, according to UN figures, saw some 60,000 people flee.
Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others - nearly half the population - have been forced from their homes.
'Last stand'
Smoke could still be seen rising over Kobane on Saturday.
Redur Xelil, spokesman for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, told Reuters news agency that around eight IS members had escaped north towards the Turkish border.
"There are still search operations in neighbourhoods where they might be hiding," he added. "The town is quiet now."
An activist in Kobane, Mustafa Bali, told AP news agency by telephone that Kobane had been "completely cleared".
"Kurdish forces are now combing the town looking for fighters who may have gone into hiding," he added.
As the civilian death toll rose during searches on Saturday, local journalist Rudi Mohammad Amin told AFP news agency more people were still unaccounted for.
The militants, he said, had made their last stand in an apparently unoccupied boys' secondary school.
"The YPG detonated explosives outside of the school, then stormed it," he said. "This military operation was carried out after ensuring that there were no civilians left in the school."
Unconfirmed reports say Kurdish civilians began returning to the town from across the border in Turkey on Saturday.
Civilians could be seen heading back towards Kobane
Erdogan warning
IS launched its two-pronged offensive after the YPG cut off one of its major supply routes near the city of Raqqa.
The city is the de facto capital of the IS "caliphate", declared a year ago after the group captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pledged never to allow Kurds to establish their own state in northern Syria.
"I say to the international community that whatever price must be paid, we will never allow the establishment of a new state on our southern frontier in the north of Syria," he said at a dinner on Friday night.
The Turkish leader also rejected accusations that Turkey had colluded with IS in its attack on Kobane this week. "It is a big lie to accuse Turkey of having link with a terrorist organisation," he said.

        <MainBody>Iran nuclear talks: Obama warned over concessions
25 June 2015
From the section Middle East
John Kerry and Mohammad Javad Zarif are due to join the negotiations in Vienna on Friday
Former senior advisers to US President Barack Obama have expressed concern at the emerging deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme.
In an open letter , the security and foreign policy experts say it "falls short of meeting the administration's own standard of a 'good' agreement".
They call for fewer concessions on international nuclear inspections and on research and development activities.
The publication of the letter comes as the deadline for a final accord nears.
US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif are to fly to the Austrian capital Vienna on Friday to join the negotiations, which may need to continue beyond 30 June.
The so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - wants to limit Iran's sensitive nuclear activities to ensure that it could not build a nuclear weapon quickly.
Iran, which wants sanctions lifted in exchange, insists its nuclear work is peaceful.
'Tracks with US position'
The open letter published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy on Thursday is signed by a bipartisan group of US diplomats, legislators, policymakers and experts who have met regularly over the past three years to discuss Iran.
They include:
Dennis Ross, who advised President Obama on Iran
Former CIA director David Petraeus
Robert Einhorn, a former member of the US negotiating team with Iran
James Cartwright, a former vice-chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gary Samore, a former Obama adviser on nuclear policy
Stephen Hadley, who was a national security adviser to President George W Bush
Iran insists its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes
"Most of us would have preferred a stronger agreement," the letter says.
"The agreement will not prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapons capability. It will not require the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure," it adds.
"It will however reduce that infrastructure for the next 10 to 15 years. And it will impose a transparency, inspection, and consequences regime with the goal of deterring and dissuading Iran from actually building a nuclear weapon."
The letter calls on Mr Obama to insist that Iran provide information about nuclear weapons research Western powers suspect it has carried out, and allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to military sites.
The president is also urged to establish strict limits on the research and development of centrifuges used to enrich uranium to preclude the "rapid technical upgrade and expansion" of Iran's enrichment capacity at the end of any deal. Enriched uranium can be used to make fuel for both nuclear energy and weapons.
A senior Obama administration official said it had received the letter and that it "in large part tacks with the US negotiating position inside the negotiating room".

The UAE ambassador survived as he was in a bulletproof vehicle
A military vehicle escorting a United Arab Emirates' diplomatic convoy was hit by a car bomb in Somalia's capital, killing at least 12 people, police say.
The UAE ambassador survived the suicide attack as he was riding in a bullet-proof land cruiser vehicle, the BBC's Mohamed Moalimu reports from Mogadishu.
The militant Islamist group al-Shabab says it carried out the attack, to target "a foreign enemy".
Al-Shabab is battling Somalia's government for control of the country.
On Sunday morning, a suicide car bomber and gunmen attacked a training centre for the national intelligence agency .
The militants have vowed to intensify attacks during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which began on Wednesday.

        <MainBody>Tunisia attack: No 10 flags to be flown at half-mast
28 June 2015
From the section UK
The beach area where the attack happened reopened on Sunday
Downing Street's flags will be flown at half-mast in memory of the British victims of the Tunisian beach attack.
Officials fear the UK death toll from Friday's gun attack is likely to be in the mid to high 20s, out of a total of 38 victims.
Relatives of others still missing are anxiously awaiting any news of their loved ones.
Daniel Welch, who has not heard from his grandfather John since the attack, said "we can only expect the worst".
Simon Boon is another Briton desperately seeking information.
He says he saw his sister Allison Heathcote on news channels being stretchered off the beach on a sunbed, but had very little information from the Foreign Office, and had to rely on news websites and phoning hospitals in Sousse to find out what happened.
She had received two gunshot wounds, had undergone surgery and was now critical, he said.
"My brother-in-law - we still have no information. Originally the Foreign Office said he was with his wife but no hospitals have any records," he said.
"Nearly 48 hours on, we're none the wiser."
The Foreign Office flag was lowered to half-mast in memory of the victims of Friday's gun attack
A total of 38 people were killed in the attack at a beach resort in Sousse on Friday, and an unspecified number have been injured.
Other countries affected by the shooting carried out by 23-year-old Seifeddine Rezgui, who had links with Islamic State, include Belgium, Germany and Ukraine. Three people from Ireland were also killed.
The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn that further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible, and urged people to be vigilant.
'Won't have had phones'
Speaking after she chaired a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee, Home Secretary Theresa May said Foreign Office staff were working round the clock in Tunisia and a 24-hour crisis centre was up and running in the UK.
She added that she had seen no evidence to indicate the beach was targeted because of the high number of British holidaymakers.
Armed police are now patrolling the beach where the gun attack took place
The home secretary suggested officials were having difficulty identifying the British victims as many were not carrying identification.
Ms May said many would not have had passports with them on the beach and some victims were being moved between hospitals in the country.
"What's important is that the information is absolutely 100% correct when it is given to a family," she told  BBC One's Andrew Marr Show.
"If you can imagine, because of the circumstances of the attack, people won't have had documents with them, they won't necessarily have had phones."
No British victims have been officially identified but the names of some have been confirmed by friends and family :
Carly Lovett, 24, a beauty blogger and photographer from Gainsborough in Lincolnshire who was first to be named
Sue Davey and her partner Scott Chalkley, both in their 40s, whose deaths were confirmed by their respective sons
Adrian Evans, his father, 78-year-old Patrick Evans and nephew Joel Richards, 19, from Wednesbury.
Bruce Wilkinson, 72, from Goole in Yorkshire
Lisa Burbidge, in her 60s, from Whickham, Gateshead
Claire Windass, 54, from Hull, was on the beach with her husband, who survived.

Mr Welch, from Swindon in Wiltshire, says he is at a "bit of a loss" about his grandfather John Welch, 74, and his partner Eileen Swannack, 70.
He said the hardest thing was "not knowing".

The family of Denis and Elaine Thwaites, from Blackpool, Lancashire, are appealing for information about their whereabouts.
The retired couple, aged 70 and 69, arrived in Sousse on Wednesday and had been staying at the Marhaba.
Their son-in-law Danny Clifford said news the family had received telling them Mr and Mrs Thwaites were in hospital was proved to be misinformation. "We are absolutely frantic," he added.

The beach area at Sousse where the attack took place has now reopened.
Rezgui, a Tunisian student who was not previously known to the authorities, began his attack on tourists at noon on Friday. He had been posing as a swimmer but carrying a rifle under a parasol.
Rezgui shot at people on the beach near the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue hotels. He then entered one of the hotel lobbies, where explosives were also detonated.
He then walked through the streets of Sousse where he was reportedly chased by local Tunisians, firing shots at them.
It has also been reported that local builders threw rubble down at him from rooftops as he passed by in the street. The attack eventually ended when he was shot dead by police.
His parents, sister and close friends have been detained by the Tunisian authorities.

        <MainBody>Hong Kong rejects Jetstar bid to start local airline
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Hong Kong has refused an application by Jetstar to set up local operations there
Hong Kong authorities have rejected an application by Qantas-backed Australian budget carrier Jetstar to set up a local airline, after nearly two years of deliberation.
The regulator said the bid did not comply with the laws of having its principal place of business in the Chinese territory.
The city's other carriers had also objected, it said.
Qantas said it would reconsider basing the low-cost carrier in Hong Kong.
The carrier is a three-way joint venture between Qantas Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Hong Kong investment firm Shun Tak Holdings.
"Jetstar Hong Kong cannot make its decisions independently from that of the two foreign shareholders," said the Air Transport Licensing Authority when handing down its decision.
It also said the city's other carriers, including Cathay Pacific and Dragon Airlines, had objected to Jetstar's application.
'Disappointing' decision
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the decision was disappointing for shareholders as well as "for the travellers that Jetstar Hong Kong planned to serve".
"It's the travelling public who have lost out, because the message from this decision is that Hong Kong appears closed to fresh aviation investment even when it is majority locally-owned and controlled," he said in a statement on Friday.
He added that Hong Kong was going in the opposite direction of other aviation markets in Asia that were "opening up".
"Given the importance of aviation to global commerce, shutting the door to new competition can only serve the vested interests already installed in that market."
The airline, along with its partners, said it had not yet decided on whether to appeal the decision.
The joint venture was valued at $10m Australian dollars ($7.7m; 4.9m), according to Qantas.
Shares of Qantas were down 1.4% in Sydney in reaction to the news.

        <MainBody>Tesco's sales decline in UK slows
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Tesco has reported a slower rate of decline in sales at its UK stores as it tries to stem the flow of customers switching to discount chains.
UK sales fell 1.3% for the three months to the end of May, compared with a 4% decline a year earlier.
The result beat analysts' forecasts of a fall of 1.6%-3%, and was better than the 1.7% fall reported in the fourth quarter of the last financial year.
Tesco chief Dave Lewis said it was a "step in the right direction".
"We are fixing the fundamentals of shopping to win back customers and relying less on short-term couponing," he said.
Shares in Tesco , the UK's largest supermarket chain, closed up 2.7% at 223.65p.
Including its international businesses, sales across the Tesco group dropped 1.3% in the quarter compared with a 3.4% dip a year ago.
Mr Lewis, who took the helm in September, is trying to revive the fortunes of Britain's largest supermarket after it reported the worst loss in its history in April.
Tesco reported a full-year pre-tax loss of 6.4bn, one of the largest in UK corporate history. About  4.7bn of the losses were the result of the fall in property value of its UK stores, 43 of which it said would close.
Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor
To understand why Tesco is slowly turning the corner, it is worth looking at the rather mundane world of the humble ham sandwich.
Tesco now offers 30% fewer sandwich lines after it realised that the wide range it was selling meant that customers often could not buy their favourite, simple sandwich, like, say, one with ham in it.
So, it reduced the range and increased the supply of the top sellers. Customers were happier that they could buy what they wanted and the number of transactions increased.

The trading update from Tesco comes ahead of an annual meeting of shareholders later.
Tim Bush of pension advisers Pirc told the BBC's Today programme that investors are likely to question payoffs for Tesco's former chief executive and finance director Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee, who shared 2.2m in severance pay after the supermarket said it was "contractually committed" to make the payments.
The pair, who left the firm last year, were awarded 1,217,000 and 970,880 respectively.
The payments were initially suspended while Tesco investigated last year's 263m accounting scandal.
"Things have stopped getting worse but they haven't yet started getting better," said Mr Bush.
Tesco said data from researcher Kantar Worldpanel had also shown that 180,000 more customers shopped at the supermarket in the 12 weeks to 24 May.

Woolworths is Australia's largest supermarket chain but faces stiff competition from discount rivals
Shares in Australia's biggest supermarket chain Woolworths have risen as much as 5% in Sydney on media reports of a possible takeover.
The Australian newspaper reported fresh rumours that US private equity giant KKR had a bid that could be "almost ready" for consideration.
It would be one of the biggest deal in Australia's corporate history, the newspaper said.
The news comes amid turbulent times for the supermarket chain.
Woolworths' media team made no comment in relation to the takeover rumours, while KKR's media team in Australia was unavailable for comment.

Turbulent times
Earlier this month, Woolworths announced that its chief executive, Grant O'Brien, was stepping down after nearly four years.
The firm also said it had plans to cut about 1,200 jobs. The changes are aimed at cutting millions of dollars in costs and improving sales after Woolworths' first-half profits fell.
The retail giant has been up against rivals such as Coles and Aldi and it has been trying to win more customers with improved stores and competitive pricing.
Woolworths recently cut its profit guidance for the year to June 2015.

        <MainBody>England join 1966 &amp; 1990 club by reaching semis - Sampson
Women's World Cup semi-final
Date: Thursday, 2 July. Kick-off: 00:00 BST. Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Sport website from 23:40 BST on 1 July
England's women have matched their male counterparts from 1966 and 1990 by reaching the semi-finals of the Women's World Cup, says manager Mark Sampson.
Women's World Cup Catch-Up: Lionesses make history in Canada
Sampson's side beat hosts Canada 2-1 to progress to the last four of the tournament for the first time.
The men's team of 1966 won the World Cup, while the 1990 side were beaten at the semi-final stage.
"They are history-makers again, the third ever England team to get to a semi-final," said Sampson.
"We now join the 1966 and the 1990 club, and I'm very proud of the whole group."
'We have reached new levels'
Sampson described the atmosphere as like a "cauldron" against host nation Canada at the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver.
His side took the lead through a Jodie Taylor shot and Lucy Bronze header as they scored two goals in three minutes.
England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley's fumble allowed Christine Sinclair to pull one back for Canada but they failed to engineer an equaliser as a resolute England stood firm.
"What a show of resilience and character from the team," added Sampson.
"They have shown a desire I've never seen from an England team before to hang on in there and get us through to the next round.
"We didn't play much football and Canada were outstanding. But this team just won't give in. We had to get to levels we have never been to before."
'Bring them on'
Taylor tearful after 'amazing' England win
England will now play holders Japan in the semi-final in a game that will be live on BBC One from 23:40 BST on Wednesday, 1 July.
"We got ourselves through and I could not be prouder," said Sampson. "Every player ran through brick walls for this team. I don't know where this team found their energy.
"It was a do-or-die game. Canada gave everything, England gave everything and we came out on top."
Japan are the reigning champions, beating the USA in the final in 2011, although England did beat them in a group game in that tournament in Germany.
"Bring them on," said Sampson.
England had 37.3% possession against Canada but still came out on top
'History-making game'
England captain Steph Houghton hopes the win will help the women's game in England.
"It was 55,000 people inside the stadium against 23 players and staff," she said. "We fought for the shirt to the very end.
"It is a massive thing for English football. The women's game is changing and we knew this was a history-making game.
"We want to inspire a nation, inspire young girls to go and play football. We hope they were allowed to stay up and watch us!"
'Can't believe it ended like this'
Canada manager John Herdman is English and was tipped to take the England job before Mark Sampson was appointed 18 months ago.
Women's World Cup 2015: Canada's John Herdman apologies to nation
"We've given you our best but it just wasn't good enough," he told Canadians in an emotional on-pitch interview. "We wanted to go all the way.
"We are absolutely gutted. We made mistakes, they caught us on a set-play and an error. I don't think anyone hid from the responsibility.
"I want to thank everyone who supported us. I can't believe it ended like this."
Reaction to England's win
William, Duke of Cambridge and president of the Football Association: I'm thrilled. This team is making history and I can't wait to see them in action against Japan. The Lionesses are doing their country proud."
England men's captain Wayne Rooney: "England women doing the country proud. Huge congratulations on reaching the semi-finals."
The last England team to reach a World Cup semi-final was Sir Bobby Robson's squad of 1990
Actor Danny Dyer: "Desire....... gentleman.... it's called Belief &amp; Desire. Love it."
Former England forward Sue Smith: "We call Mark Sampson the tinkerman and all of his tactics have been spot on. England need to keep believing.
"There is no reason why they can't go on and beat Japan. Yes, they are a fantastic team and play unbelievable football but so can England now."
Former England captain Faye White: "Who said that England were the weakest team left in the competition at the quarter-final stage???? Err I think not!"
Karen Carney tweeted a picture from the England dressing room after the win over Canada

Sepp Blatter urged to stand by Fifa resignation decision
Sepp Blatter has been urged to stick by his decision to quit as president of world football's governing body, Fifa.
Blatter announced on 2 June that he would step down at an extraordinary congress between December and March.
However, on Thursday the 79-year-old said he had not resigned and was thought to be considering re-election.
"The times of flirting with the power are definitely gone," said Domenico Scala, the independent chairman of Fifa's audit and compliance committee.
"I call on all concerned - including Mr Blatter - to endorse in the interest of the reforms unequivocally the announced changing of the guard at the top of Fifa."
Two criminal investigations into alleged Fifa corruption began in the week that Blatter was elected for a fifth term, with seven Fifa officials arrested on charges of receiving bribes.
Four days after his re-election, Blatter - who is reportedly under investigation in the United States - said: "While I have a mandate from the membership of Fifa, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football.
"Therefore, I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective congress. I will continue to exercise my functions as Fifa president until that election."
However, Blatter did not use the words 'resign' or 'resignation'. He did add, however, that the election would be for his "successor" and said: "I shall not be a candidate."

World number seven Ferrer, 33, reached the quarter-finals at SW19 in 2013.

From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
The Dalai Lama has made an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival, praising it as "a festival of people, not governments or politicians".
The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader gave a talk in the Peace Garden, where the crowd sang happy birthday in advance of his 80th birthday on 6 July.
He arrived using a Glastonbury t-shirt to cover his head as rain soaked the festival site.
"I see old and young, everybody full of joy," he said.
The Dalai Lama used a festival t-shirt to shelter from the rain
"While you are here, enjoy the joyfulness here. But you should remember on this same planet are human beings being killed by human beings."
He mentioned conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Nigeria as he delivered a message of peace and respect.
He is also expected to appear on the festival's Pyramid stage later.
If he does, he will join a Sunday line-up that also features The Who, Alt-J and Patti Smith.
Irish singer Hozier kicked off proceedings, drawing a huge crowd hoping to hear his signature hit, Take Me To Church.
Other artists due to play on Sunday include The Chemical Brothers, Ryan Adams and Charli XCX; while Lionel Richie takes the mid-afternoon "legends" slot on the main stage - following in the footsteps of the likes of Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton.
The main stage was headlined by US rapper Kanye West on Saturday, to a mixed response .
He appeared alone under a vast, mobile lighting rig consisting of hundreds of bright white lights; playing hits including Stronger, Power, Gold Digger and, appropriately, All Of The Lights.
At the end of the set, he declared himself "the greatest living rock star on the planet," prompting much derision on social media.
"I really do think he's a rock star," pop star Charli XCX told the BBC. "I liked his minimal approach and when you watch that set, it's hit after hit after hit."
One person who missed West's performance was festival founder Michael Eavis.
"I'm not a fan of that kind of music," he said. "Although I chose Jay-Z originally of course."
Jay-Z was the festival's first hip-hop headliner in 2008. But since then, Eavis has handed over responsibility for the line-up to his daughter Emily.

Mitchell is known for songs like Big Yellow Taxi and Case of You
Joni Mitchell is still unable to speak after being found unconscious in her home in March, according to her friend David Crosby.
Crosby said the singer-songwriter had suffered a brain aneurysm and faced a long struggle.
"She is home, she is in care, she is recovering," he told Huffington Post . "How much she's going to come back, and when, I don't know."
We're all holding our breath and thinking of goodbye
David Crosby, Singer-songwriter
There has been no official confirmation of Mitchell's condition.
The 71-year-old was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home on 31 March and taken to hospital.
A statement released on her website several days later said the singer was "resting comfortably" and continued to "improve and get stronger each day".
Her representatives later denied Mitchell was in a coma , saying "she's alert, and she has her full senses".
Crosby produced Mitchell's debut album, Song to a Seagull
"She took a terrible hit," said Crosby on Saturday. "She had an aneurysm, and nobody found her for a while. And she's going to have to struggle back from it the way you struggle back from a traumatic brain injury.
"To my knowledge, she is not speaking yet."
Crosby and Mitchell dated in 1967, when he was still a member of the Byrds. They have remained close friends ever since.
"She's a tough girl and very smart," he said. "I love her. She's probably the best of us  probably the greatest living singer-songwriter.
"[But] I think we're all holding our breath and thinking of goodbye, you know? And hoping it's gonna turn out ok."

The star's 18-song set lasted almost two hours
Taylor Swift signed off the UK leg of her world tour in style with an open-air show featuring one of Britain's top models.
Cara Delevigne waved a Union Jack flag as she joined the singer on stage before a 65,000-strong crowd at London's Hyde Park.
Tennis champion Serena Williams and model Kendall Jenner also appeared in a catwalk-themed section of Swift's set.
The pop star said she would "remember this night for the rest of [her] life".
"I remember seven years ago when I played my first UK show," she said. "King's College [in London] had sold out and there were a few hundred people.
"I was surprised that a few hundred people would come to see me perform and now I'm looking at 65,000 people in Hyde Park.
"This is one of those nights where I'm aware I'm going to be taking mental snapshots so I can remember this night for the rest of my life," the singer continued.
The speech was one of several extended confessionals from a performer whose closeness to her fans became literal during a section where a giant rotating bridge suspended her above the heads of her adoring acolytes.

Swift's fans - nicknamed "Swifties" - were caught on the hop on Saturday when their idol began her gig 15 minutes earlier than scheduled.
Wearing a green sequinned jacket and purple skirt, she opened her set with Welcome to New York, a trademark anthem of emphatic self-assertion.
Supported by 12 male dancers, four female backing singers and a five-man band, the concert featured 17 more songs and seven additional costume changes in the two-hour set.
Sartorial highlights included a figure-hugging black leather catsuit, a summery pink frock lit by LED lights and a silver gown encrusted with crystals.
Props, meanwhile, included an ornate silver piano, a golf club - wielded menacingly as she sang Blank Space, a self-parodying paean to her media portrayal as a serial dater - and illuminated umbrellas used in a Singin' In The Rain-style "brolly ballet".
The set-list was largely drawn from Swift's current smash hit album 1989
Swift's decision to distance herself from her country past was illustrated by a setlist dominated by songs from her latest release, the pop-leaning 1989.
Yet she found time to reinvent some of her older material, refashioning Love Story as a 1980s-style synth track and turning We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together into a noisy rock stomp with one booted foot in Glastonbury.
Filmed inserts showed Lena Dunham, Delevigne and others extolling the singer's virtues and Swift herself cradling her two cats, the quirkily named Dr Meredith Grey and Detective Olivia Benson.
The evening ended with Shake It Off, a defiantly upbeat tune which saw "Tay Tay" back on her bridge in a purple crop top and miniskirt.
It was a triumphant climax to an eventful week that began with Swift exhorting tech giant Apple to rethink the artist payment policy of its new music streaming service.
The 25-year-old plays two concerts in Dublin next week before returning to North America to continue her 1989 tour, named after her latest album as well as the year of her birth.
Ellie Goulding and John Newman also performed in Hyde Park on Saturday as part of the British Summer Time series of day-long mini-festivals.

Tangled up in blue: A sticky end to sleeping sickness
28 June 2015 Last updated at 00:05 BST
The lure of a bright blue target is tempting a killer insect towards its own demise - thanks to scientists working in Uganda.
Up to 60 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of catching sleeping sickness which is caused by a parasite passed on by biting tsetse flies.
The symptoms include fatigue and swollen joints. Left untreated it is usually fatal.
But as Maryam Abdalla reports from Arua in northern Uganda, British researchers are hoping that their blue targets could spell the end of this deadly disease.

Dogs for sale at the Yulin at the dog-meat festival
This week about 10,000 dogs and a number of cats were killed at an annual dog-meat festival in south-western China, to celebrate the longest day of the year. For the BBC's Juliana Liu it was a reminder of one of the most traumatic days of her childhood, in the Chinese city of Changsha.
When I was three years old, after months of begging, my parents finally gave in to my pleas for a puppy.
The day that my uncle, a lorry driver, brought me a fuzzy yellow mongrel from my grandmother's mountainous, faraway home was the happiest of my young life.
I named him "Doggie", and we immediately became inseparable.
As an only child born in 1979 at the beginning of China's one-child policy, I had always been alone, and Doggie became my best friend. He loved running around outside our one-room flat, gobbling up left-over rice and snuggling near the coal fire.
But these halcyon days did not last. After just one winter, my parents told me Doggie had to go.
In Chinese cities in the early 1980s owning a pet was considered highly undesirable, bourgeois behaviour. None of my neighbours had one. It was also not entirely legal. There was no access to animal vaccines or vets, so pets could pose a public health risk.
One day, my mother announced we were going shopping - and when we returned a few hours later Doggie was no more. He had been strung up by the legs in our communal yard, and was soon turned into a stew, complete with herbs and hard-boiled eggs.
No-one paid any attention to my tears. I heard the neighbours say I would soon forget the whole thing.
They, on the other hand, were in a celebratory mood. In the years before China's economic boom, when some food was still rationed, it was rare to have the chance to feast on a whole animal.
I refused to eat the stew - and I have never eaten dog in my life.

In China, the tradition of dog-eating goes back far beyond written history.
Along with pigs, oxen, goats, horses and fowl, dogs are one of the six animals domesticated during the Stone Age.
On the other hand, it is not the kind of thing that is eaten every day. It is a speciality meat, commonly believed to confer strength, vigour and virility on the eater.
How dog is eaten
Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop writes:
Judging by the sporadic waves of outrage about dog-eating in China, you might think it was one of the pillars of the Chinese diet. Actually, however, the consumption of dog meat is extremely marginal: it's seldom seen in markets and on restaurant menus, and most Chinese people eat it rarely, if at all.
Dogs, like pigs, have been reared for their meat in China since the Neolithic age, but in modern times their flesh is regarded as a delicacy in just a few areas, such as Hunan and Guizhou. Even in these places, it tends to be eaten only occasionally, and in certain seasons. According to traditional Chinese medicine, dog is a "heating" meat which can offer a useful energy boost in midwinter, but is best avoided after the lunar new year.
In culinary terms, dog meat is normally blanched or soaked before cooking to dispel the earthier, heavier aspects of its flavour. It is then, typically, made into slow-cooked soups and stews seasoned with ginger, spring onion, rice wine and spices, although it may also be roasted, or served cold as an appetiser. The tender meat of puppies is favoured over that of older dogs.
In the course of many years of studying Chinese cuisine, I've only eaten dog meat on a handful of occasions. The first time, it reminded me of pork; the second, in a fiendishly spicy Hunanese stew, it recalled the taste of lamb.
About 716 million pigs are slaughtered in the country every year, and 48 million cattle. The number of dogs slaughtered is far lower - one animal rights group puts the figure at about 10 million.
But where do these dogs come from? According to some researchers, many are pets - like Doggie, except they have been stolen from their owners.
As dogs were arriving for the dog-meat festival at Yulin in Guangxi province this week, Peter Li of Humane Society International saw no animals with  quarantine inspection certificates to indicate they had been farmed.
"All of them can be suspected to be stolen urban pets, rural guard dogs and stray dogs and cats," he says.

A four-year inquiry into the dog-meat industry by Animals Asia also concluded that most dogs eaten in China are stolen.
"During the entire investigation, we found no evidence of any large-scale breeding facilities, where 100-plus dogs were bred and raised," says the report published earlier this month.
"The difficulty of large-scale breeding of dogs for food and the greed for profit give rise to stealing, snatching from the streets and even poisoning of dogs."
But Li says there is mounting pressure on Chinese authorities to take action against the eating of pets - and that society is turning against the idea of eating dog altogether.
There were far fewer stalls selling dog and cat meat at the Yulin festival this year than in 2014, he says.
"The overall attitude is against dog eating. China has 130 million dogs, of which 27 million are urban pets. That's a big number of pet owners.
"The younger generation, born in the 1990s, is not tolerant of animal cruelty."

In 2014, animal rights activists intercepted 18 lorries carrying dogs intended for eating, resulting in the rescue of some 8,000 animals, he says.
The Chinese media often carries stories of such rescues, in which activists force vehicles to stop and pool money to purchase the animals.
He dates the rise of animal protection activism in China to 2011, the same year when, for the first time ever, more people lived in cities than the countryside.
City dwellers, he says, view dogs and cats more as pets, rather than as working animals - guard dogs, for example - or sources of meat.
In May, on a visit to Shanghai, I saw a sight that delighted me.
While strolling on the Bund, I stopped a young tourist named Yang Yang who was carrying her tiny, fox-like dog in a sling on her chest, the way I normally carry my human baby.
"Oh, this way I can take him into restaurants and on airplanes," she explained.  "Otherwise, he wouldn't be allowed in with me. Where I go, he goes."
All three of us posed for a photo in front of Shanghai's iconic skyline.
How I wish more people had taken this attitude three decades ago.
My parents, now utterly embarrassed about having allowed my pet to be cooked, generally avoid the topic entirely.
But when I was five years old, my father left China to study abroad and the very first gift he sent me was a fuzzy, yellowish stuffed puppy.
I named him Doggie.

        <Description>The gadget that left a nine-year-old boy speechless</Description>
        <MainBody>28 June 2015
From the section Magazine
For the past 10 years I have been visiting White Horse Village in south-west China, reporting on its transformation from a farming community into a modern city - it's a microcosm of China's epic-scale urbanisation. Xiao Zhang's family has embraced the change, and as my last visit came ended, I took her children shopping in one of the new superstores.
The tiny nine-year-old and I have been staring at stuffed toys and superheroes for a very long time. "Peipei," I say. "You've got 300 yuan. You can get whatever you want. Now what is it you want?" He just keeps smiling up at me helplessly, hopping from one sparrow leg to the other.
It's already been a long day, which started at 5am when the BBC's White Horse Village crew stumbled from our hotel beds and straggled across the new city square to get ready for a live interview on Newsnight. The time difference between the UK and China is no friend to us.
We're not the earliest people on the square though. The pavement on the main road is thickening with farmers from the surrounding hill villages, laying out their vegetables for keen inspection by the city people who were farmers themselves only five minutes ago. The sky is turning pewter grey behind soaring black mountain ridges.
In the old days, and the old days here are only 10 years old there was only farming in this valley. The young people of White Horse Village all turned their backs on it to join the human tide surging to the coast in search of paid work in factories and construction sites. They left behind a rustling green patchwork of rice and maize, a landscape dotted with their parents and grandparents in straw hats bent under heavy wooden carrying poles.
More from White Horse Village
Xiao Zhang spent her childhood working in the fields, feeding the family's pigs. The destruction of rural China became, for her, a liberation - and an opportunity. This is the story of how her life changed as much as her country.
The village and the girl
Those generations are still up on the hill but now the grandson is in a subterranean superstore, on plastic floor tiles under neon lights, dazzled by indecision when his fairy godmother from a faraway land rolls into town and hands him more money than he has ever seen in his life.

I don't want you to think this is a lot of money. It's the equivalent of 30 (almost $50), an amount many of China's so called little emperors would shrug at. But Peipei is not the pampered child of a rich coastal city. Sailing down the escalator into the store his mother has just reminded me that she has never bought toys for him or his sister. She regards toys as a waste of money and a distraction from the serious business of study.
A rice and pig farmer for most of her own life, Xiao Zhang was pulled out of school at the age of 11 to help in the family fields and she is determined that her children will have a different destiny in the new China, one which includes university and white-collar jobs. But she is proud of her own job in the new city. She is chief cleaner at the courthouse.
I don't want to be talking about school and jobs right now though, so I send Xiao Zhang away, saying the children and I can manage our shopping perfectly well without her. No offence is meant and none is taken. After 10 years spent filming and recording the story of the epic transformation from village to city, everyone here is used to my eccentricities.
Yangyang at school
With her mother out of the way, 11-year-old Yangyang becomes immediately purposeful. She chooses a badminton set, a table tennis set and two studious books. She carefully counts the money left over and spends the last of it on pens and notebooks. Her shopping takes perhaps five minutes.
But Peipei still can't choose. We trail from store to store, I make suggestions, the shop assistants make suggestions but after an hour we have nothing in the trolley. I feel disappointed but I'm conscious of time. We're all due at a celebration dinner in a couple of hours. And I promised to have Peipei and Yangyang back at the courthouse in time to do their homework beforehand.
I suppose you can save the money and spend it when you see something you do like, I suggest. But he shakes his head fiercely and Yangyang says, "No, mum will just take it away."
Eventually it dawns on me what the problem is. Peipei keeps drifting along the shelves but drifting back to one spot to stand wordlessly in front of a remote-controlled helicopter. If I hadn't been up at 5am I might have noticed it sooner. I've known this boy his entire life and it's now perfectly clear to me that he wants that helicopter but can't say so because he knows his parents will disapprove.
Peipei with his mother and father
"Look Peipei," I say, "we don't know when I'm going to be here again. So let's just do this. We'll say I insisted on the helicopter." The grin that meets this suggestion is all the answer I need. He clutches the big helicopter box to his chest.
We glide back up an escalator into the daylight, and Xiao Zhang whisks the children off on the new family scooter to do their homework before the goodbye dinner. That dinner is another story in its own right and there's no time to tell it here.
Suffice it to say that the stars of our White Horse Village 10-year epic are there including the disgraced village Communist Party secretary with his wife, children and grandchildren, Mr Jin who is still wondering where he's going to be buried in the new city, and of course Xiao Zhang and her parents and children.
There are emotional toasts, a few tears, a lot of laughter and the maiden flight of Peipei's helicopter. And as we stand under the pillars of the Grand Emperor Hotel waving off the White Horse Village cast to their city apartments, I reflect that every word I'd just said in my toast was true. Over a decade, these people have been unfailingly kind and patient, not to mention courageous in ignoring government pressure and trusting us with their story. I will miss each and every one of them.

        <MainBody>Will Iran nuclear deal be Hassan Rouhani's legacy?
By Dr Massoumeh Torfeh Research Associate, LSE &amp; Soas
28 June 2015
From the section Middle East
President Hassan Rouhani promised Iranians he would get sanctions lifted
As international talks over Iran's nuclear programme come down to the wire, the success or failure to strike a deal could be make or break for President Hassan Rouhani.
After his election in 2013, the new president - seen as a moderate abroad - promised to work to lift years of sanctions which have crippled the economy and made life ever-harder for average Iranians.
Iranian hardliners have opposed concessions and compromise over Iran's "national right" to nuclear energy, but the balance so far appears to be heavily in favour of President Rouhani and his team of negotiators.
In the end, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has the final say.
He has publicly backed the negotiating team and in recent days provided them with more flexibility over some aspects of the negotiation while at the same time hardening his stance towards the West.
All UN and US "economic, financial and banking" sanctions must be lifted "immediately" a deal is signed - and the remaining  sanctions lifted "within reasonable time intervals", Ayatollah Khamenei said in a speech on Tuesday. He made no mention of EU sanctions.
The hardliners have been at pains for more than a year-and-a-half to refrain from any public criticism of the government while the nuclear talks were in progress.
The instructions to desist came from the Supreme Leader himself, who has called on all officials to ensure a united front was conveyed until the 30 June deadline.
Double-edged remarks from Ayatollah Khamenei, such as "I am neither for nor against the deal", have kept both the pro- and anti-camp in Iran satisfied.
The Supreme Leader has juxtaposed his position in several speeches, not only to survive a possible negative outcome but also to ensure he does not antagonise the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC).
The IRGC has never been too convinced by the talks, except for the obvious benefits of lifting sanctions which have affected its multi-billion dollar business empire, though it has given the negotiators its cautious backing.
Parliamentary intrigue
Over the past few months there have been intensive debates inside the conservative-dominated parliament between the two camps.
Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps has given cautious backing to the talks
Most of the heated discussions have been behind closed doors, but some of it has slipped out on social media and the wider press.
"The closer we get to the signing of the deal," said reformist Sharq newspaper on Monday, "the bigger becomes the wave of attacks, and insults on the government of Hassan Rouhani."
Another article blamed former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's camp for "scheming for months" to ruin the prospects of success in the deal for Iran.
The main voice of opposition in parliament is the faction that supports Mr Ahmadinejad, Mr Rouhani's predecessor.
In moves not dissimilar to the Republicans in the US Senate, the faction known as Paidary (persistence) Front, has tabled several motions to try to give parliament the power to challenge a final deal.
None has been successful, and its latest bill was amended in such a way as to take away the power of veto from parliament and put it in the hands of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), the top decision-making body in Iran and loyal to the Supreme Leader.
It is chaired by President Rouhani and includes parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani and his brother Sadeq Larijani, who heads the judiciary.
Its members are mainly hand-picked by Ayatollah Khamenei and also include the chiefs of the army and the IRGC, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and a handful of other ministers.
That is why despite the verbal battles over the past few months, once the deal is sealed by the Supreme Leader there is little anyone can do to oppose it.
Risk of failure
The room for Iran's nuclear team to manoeuvre is limited. The oversight by SNSC would ensure that all requirements laid down by the Supreme Leader and the IRGC are met.
Ayatollah Khamenei has made it clear he will not accept any inspection of military sites (a key demand of the so-called P5+1 interlocutors), backing the requirement laid out by the IRGC.
Ayatollah Khamenei will have the final say over whether to accept or reject a nuclear deal
Despite the red lines, President Rouhani and his negotiators are protected by the Supreme Leader's endorsement.
The danger, however, would be if the deal failed or faced serious obstacles after the 30 June deadline.
In that case, although Ayatollah Khamenei may continue to call for calm, the IRGC, and the conservatives, angered at the failure to lift sanctions, would push the Supreme Leader to take a harder line, switching their substantive majority in parliament against the president, making it difficult for him to increase the reformist share of seats in the next parliamentary election due in February.
The president may continue to wield support from the public at large, but the machinations of those dominant groups are likely to make his position untenable for the next presidential elections due in June 2017.
It is with a view of those elections that not only the president but also all parliamentary factions are leaving themselves room for jockeying.

        <title>Does the future of wildlife lie in captivity?</title>

        <Description>Will wild animals only be safe in captivity?</Description>
        <MainBody>From the section Science &amp; Environment
Look ahead towards the middle of the century and much-loved animals such as lemurs, rhinos and tigers will only survive in some form of captivity.
And extinction will be even more of a threat than it is now.
An overly bleak and pessimistic view? Maybe.
But after reporting on the state of wildlife in Madagascar this past week , I cannot see how many of the most iconic creatures will be able to roam in their natural habitats for much longer.
I don't mean a future necessarily confined to zoos, but one in which lives are led in special zones guarded by fences and patrols and CCTV. Free, but only up to a point.
The reasons are obvious: growing populations and the thirst for resources and the black market for animals all mean that humans and animals are increasingly competing for territory and survival. And the animals usually lose.
As we picked our way through the remaining pockets of forest in Madagascar, I heard that less than 10% of the original cover is left.
And those remaining stretches of jungle - the sole habitats for the country's famous lemurs - are under constant attack as local people seek to create farmland or hunt for fresh meat.
VIP protection
I was reminded of filming in a tiger reserve in Thailand a few years ago .
To try to keep about 60 tigers relatively safe from poachers, a small army of 200 rangers was on constant patrol.
Remote cameras, satellite monitoring and intelligence gathering were essential weapons against raiders with AK47s and poisoned bait encouraged by high prices for tiger parts in China.
And, earlier this year, I saw the pitiful sight of one of the last five of a particular species of rhino, the northern white - brought to the verge of extinction by the brutal market for rhino horn.  The final survivors need VIP protection.
Question of attitudes
In Madagascar's case, political instability that followed a coup adds to the scourge of corruption and well-organised gangs of animal traffickers - and it's not hard to predict that the last pockets of forest will keep shrinking and the numbers of lemurs will keep falling.
Even more challenging is a question of attitudes. For many in the rich West, it's a no-brainer that precious wildlife should be given a priority. Some of the most popular charities were set up to help animals. And wildlife wins royal support too.
But what about views in a destitute village on the edge of one of Madagascar's forests where families earn less than the equivalent of $2 (1.27) a day?
No surprise, but conservationists are not always welcome.
In the Maromizaha protected area, which is home to several different species of lemurs, we heard of occasional hostility towards people working to save the animals.
In an election, a village chief actively campaigned on a promise that more farmland could be claimed from the forest. And local conservation workers have received threatening phone calls and even death threats.
Financial temptation
In the Baly Bay National Park, which lies in a remote corner of the north-west of the country, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust has endured several highly suspicious incidents while working to save the critically endangered ploughshare tortoise.
Once, a dead ploughshare tortoise was dumped on the charity's doorstep, a Godfather-like threat not to intervene in the highly lucrative black market for tortoises.
The ploughshare tortoise is only found in Madagascar
And last December, just as staff were busy with a day-long celebration of progress, a column of smoke was spotted rising from the core area of the park.
The project's entire operation was nearly engulfed in flames. Forest fires do happen naturally but this one may well have been deliberate. Conservation can create enemies.
For some local people, the financial prize of stealing tortoises is too large to be resisted. Others look forward to the development and jobs that may come with plans by a Chinese firm for a huge new iron ore mine nearby - and the conservationists may be seen as an obstacle.
So, in conservation circles, the latest thinking is that the only plausible way forward is to engage local people and to show them that the wildlife can be worth more alive than dead.
In Baly Bay and Maromizaha, villagers are hired to work as guides, keeping watch on the animals and being on hand to escort visitors.
Tourism can be a big earner. But it requires a lot of infrastructure such as hotels and transport links which are not always possible in a country as poor as Madagascar. And while those facilities take years to develop, hungry families are eyeing the forests right next door to them.
So what of the future?
Some initiatives are bound to succeed, if they are well-funded and well-integrated with local communities.  Much of the policing of the national parks and protected areas may well do its job and keep out incursions.  Quite a few local initiatives will flourish.
The habitats lemurs depend upon exist only in Madagascar
After our coverage this past week, a lot of people have got in touch to describe their conservation efforts in Madagascar or to enthuse about visits there.
But overall? A few weeks ago I heard something revealing on the conservation grapevine: that younger scientists, planning careers in fieldwork, are wondering if they should avoid Madagascar on the grounds that the forests might not survive long enough for them to complete studies over the next 20 years.
And that brings me back to my opening point: that maybe it's more realistic to start picturing a world in which the animals we care about most will only be safe in areas that are properly guarded.
The last major report on Madagascar's lemurs by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature signalled that captive breeding may have to be the answer.
That will work for some species. But the largest of the lemurs, the Indri, depends on a complex diet of leaves eaten at different times and no-one has yet worked it out.
So, for the moment, Indris kept in captivity do not reproduce and may not survive and extinction remains a constant danger.

        <MainBody>The trouble with 'acceptable' language
By John McManus BBC News
28 June 2015
From the section World
Is it justified to ever use an offensive racist term - even if you're trying to have a conversation about racism, as President Obama was when he used the "N-word" on a US radio programme? And who decides what is offensive?
The president's choice of word immediately made headline news, reopening a familiar argument about whether it was fine for black people to reclaim and use the term but white people shouldn't, because it is nearly always a term of abuse - and of course, still is to many, as confirmed by a quick glance at Twitter after Mr Obama spoke.
The point the president was trying to make was that, in his opinion, racism still exists in many aspects of US life and confronting it must go way beyond a philosophical discussion on whether certain words can or can't be uttered in polite company.
Of course, reclaiming formerly offensive words isn't confined to racial minorities.
Across western Europe, some gay men for example, have taken an offensive slur, "queer", and turned it into a badge of identity.
Similarly, campaigners for women's rights in North America have been trying to reclaim the term "slut" , transforming it into a mark of female sexual freedom. "SlutWalks" have now also taken place in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
Yet there are problems.
Reclaiming a word isn't necessarily the same thing as rehabilitating it.
A "SlutWalk" demonstration in London
Take that word "queer" for example. It's used by a minority of gay men to describe their partial rejection of conventional society - for example, many self-defined "queers" reject marriage as an oppressive institution.
They would be less happy about heterosexuals using that same word. And many heterosexuals in turn would be wary as well. That's partly from confusion - because "queer" is still deployed as a term of abuse.
But there's also an issue of authenticity.
Simply put, can those who live outside a minority group ever truly know what it's like to be a member of that community, especially if it's being oppressed, or has been in the past?
Maybe not - so perhaps there should be caution about using language that implies that anybody can experience life - warts and all - on the same terms that minorities do.
Some gay men have embraced the term "queer"
It's why Jewish comedians can get plenty of laughs as they poke fun at those much-maligned Jewish mothers - but why those same jokes might be construed as anti-Semitic if told by a non-Jew.
More seriously, it also explains the derision that fans of rap music used to direct at white hip hop artists - because hip hop music grew out of, and spoke about, the unique experiences of young, black urban Americans.
And rap in particular highlights some of the difficulties behind this whole issue.
Many rap lyrics are liberally sprinkled with words which others find highly offensive - including the one which Mr Obama used.
But many rappers feel their language is a realistic expression of how many young, black urban Americans live. They've walked the walk so have permission, they feel, to talk the talk.
However it's the kind of talk that just can't appear in a piece of this kind - a perfect illustration of how hard it is to navigate a clear path around such sensitive issues.
The authenticity factor also lies behind the criticism directed at Rachel Dolezal , the American civil rights activist who said she spoke from the personal perspective of being an African-American, but in fact was described by her parents as a white woman, with a trace of Native American ancestry.
The debate about Barack Obama's choice of words reveals just how important context and authenticity are.
And if you don't believe me, just try to envisage a white US president - perhaps Bill Clinton or one of the two Bushes - trying to sympathetically use the same racial term Mr Obama used. Or, Mr Obama cracking a joke about interfering Jewish mothers.
I think you may feel a little bit uncomfortable.

        <MainBody>DJ Rita Ray's African tracks: From howling blues to twisted love
28 June 2015
From the section Africa
Howling desert blues from Mali, Afro-Cuban salsa with Angolan roots, a love story with a twist from the Democratic Republic of Congo and exhortations for unity from a Ghanaian pan-Africanist make up the first of a regular focus on new African music releases by DJ Rita Ray:
Artist: Samba Toure
Album: Gandadiko (Glitter Beat Records)
A guitar master from northern Mali, Samba Toure returns with his singular brand of Songhai blues.
Toure earned his stripes with the kora genius Toumani Diabate and the late Ali Farka Toure.
His new album Gandadiko, meaning Land of Drought or Burning Land, has a smouldering epic feel, featuring howling guitar riffs, the spiky ngoni (traditional West African lute) and emotive keening of the bowed one-string djerka.
The over revved, loping camel-gait rhythms evoke his arid homeland.
His lyrics, powerful and revealing, go behind the headlines and tell of the devastating reality of the social and political aftermath of Mali's recent traumas and the Islamist militant takeover of the north.
The hopeful sounds cushion the cautionary tales and astute observations of his songs, such as Touri Idje Bibi (Black Fruits) where he sings: "Oh earth, forgiveness, oh river forgiveness,
"Every day we offend you."
Artist: Ricardo Lemvo &amp; Makina Loca
Album: La Rumba Soy Yo (Cumbancha)
One of the few Africans to stamp his mark on the global salsa market, Ricardo Lemvo and his Makina Loca band offer a lush tropical offering with their new album.
La Rumba Soy Yo was a three-year recording adventure, a labour of love taking place across three continents and four countries - the US, Canada, France and Angola.
The Salsa star, raised in DR Congo, looks to his Angolan roots for inspiration - seamlessly mixing in kizomba and semba rhythms with the soukous guitars that augment his trademark upbeat Congolese-Cuban rumba.
The infectious dance of the track E Moyo exemplifies the steamy street party feel of the album.
Lemvo and Makina Loca have played around the globe over the years, hopefully this release will help them fulfil their long-held dream of touring Africa and Cuba.
Artist: Laurette La Perle
Single: Twist (Brown Touch Entertainment)
Laurette La Perle is an up and coming singer-songwriter from DR Congo, who also harbours dreams of touring far and wide with her forthcoming album.
Young and ambitious, she is already a multi-award winner, scooping up gongs including the Okapi Awards Best Song of the Year and Best Central African Female at The All Africa Music Awards in 2014.
La Perle was surrounded by music as a child, and received vocal training at a local Kinshasa church choir - her launch-pad into the world of musical competitions.
Now she infuses her distinctive brand of urban rumba-laced soukous with R&amp;B.
La Perle's lyrics fearlessly probe where others might fear to tread.
Twist, the single from her next album, is a tangled tale of love - a soap opera involving two women and a man.
It is not the age-old story, the twist is that the two women are also having an affair - with each other.
Artist: Rocky Dawuni
Album: Branches from the Same Tree (Cumbancha)
Ghanaian reggae singer Rocky Dawuni remains faithful to his mission to spread the message of love and unity.
The songs on his sixth album, Branches of the Same Tree, are an appealing blend of the sounds and rhythms of the black diaspora, which he calls Afro-soul.
Dawuni's music grows from the steady roots of reggae, then delves into the treasure trove found in music of black origin, including New Orleans funk, Brazilian samba and Afrobeat.
He is a passionate humanitarian activist from northern Ghana, whose world vision is expressed in his uplifting, thought-provoking songs.
Dawuni's pan-African vision finds him building bridges and making fans around the continent.
The track Nairobi features Kenyan dub poet Oneko Arika and was written when he visited the Kibera slum just before the 2013 elections.
It was a gesture of solidarity during a time of ethnic and political tension.
"I wrote it as a love song for a city, country and people," he said.
