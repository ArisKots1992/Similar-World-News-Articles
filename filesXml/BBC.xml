        <MainBody>Libor trial: 'Ringmaster' was 'greedy', court hears
26 May 2015
From the section Business
The first criminal trial linked to the manipulation of a key interest rate, known as Libor, has begun in London.
Former City trader Tom Hayes, 35, of Fleet in Hampshire, has been accused of acting in a "thoroughly dishonest and manipulative manner" in his alleged attempts to rig the Libor rates, the court heard.
The former UBS and Citigroup trader denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud over the period 2006-2010.
Mr Hayes was arrested in June 2013.
Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate - is an interest rate used by banks around the world to set the price of financial products worth billions of pounds.
Mukul Chawla QC, acting for the prosecution, said: "This case is about the dishonest rigging of bank rates for profit.
"The motive was a simple one: it was greed," said Mr Chawla, who described Mr Hayes as "the ringmaster at the very centre, telling others around him what to do and in a number of cases rewarding them for their dishonest assistance".
'You are greedy'
Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard that Mr Hayes told investigators: "The point is, you are greedy, you want every little bit of money you can possibly get... that's how you are judged, that's your performance metric."
It was this greed that led to "dishonesty on an enormous scale", said Mr Chawla.
The prosecution accused Mr Hayes of enlisting "the help of a large number of people across a large number of different financial organisations to help him", Mr Chawla added.
"He tried to rig, and in many cases succeeded in rigging, the rates at other banks," Mr Chawla said.
He achieved this by approaching people at other banks directly or through brokers acting as middlemen, he said.
Mr Chawla said Mr Hayes had "admitted his guilt, setting out precisely what he had done with whom" and offering to give evidence about a "large number of other people".
The court was played a clip where Mr Hayes said he was part of a system in which influencing Libor was "commonplace", although he admitted he was a "serial offender".
'Dishonest activity'
The court also heard that Mr Hayes had been diagnosed with mild Asperger's syndrome.
It was also told there had "undoubtedly been some manipulation of Libor at UBS before Mr Hayes's own dishonest activity".
After Mr Hayes felt that "UBS were not paying him enough", he joined Citi in 2009. He was sacked after his methods were formally reported to senior managers and he returned to the UK.
Mr Hayes is accused of lying about the rates that his bank was borrowing money at, thus affecting the calculation of the Libor rate.
The trial is set to last between 10 and 12 weeks.
The way Libor is calculated has now been changed in the wake of the rate-rigging scandal.

A British father-of-three who feared he would be paralysed by an inoperable tumour has died at the Dignitas centre in Switzerland.
Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness.
He was surrounded by friends and family at a meal shortly before his death at the clinic, which aids accompanied suicide.
His wife Elaine and three daughters said they respected his decision.
'Overwhelming desire'
The family said in a statement: "Whilst we are now in a state of all-consuming grief and miss Jeffrey very much, we also recognise that he is now at peace and away from the fear which surrounded him in the last few weeks of his life.
"Jeffrey ended his life with dignity and control which was his overwhelming desire."
In an interview with the Blackpool Gazette last week, Mr Spector said: "If I am paralysed and can't speak, send me to the spirit world."
He reportedly said the condition was affecting his nervous system.
Friend Linda Earle, who had known him for 20 years, said: "He's fought it every step of the way. I've never known a man try so hard.
"I don't blame him for a minute....it's no one else's decision but his own."
Journalist David Graham told BBC Radio Lancashire he had spoken to Mr Spector at his hotel near the clinic in Zurich.
Jeffrey Spector was married with three daughters
Mr Graham said Mr Spector, a director of an advertising agency, had had a series of consultations with leading surgeons across the UK.
"He had one operation which failed and I think that spurred him on the Dignitas route," said Mr Graham.
'Completely wrong'
In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt.
Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said he would attempt to reintroduce a bill that would allow assisted dying in the UK.
He said it was "completely wrong" that terminally ill people did not have the option to end their life.
"Whatever your take on the subject, it should be debated," Lord Falconer told the BBC.
Last year the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, clarified assisted suicide guidelines , making the prosecution of health professionals less likely.
However, in April, disability rights campaigners who said assisted suicide policy was too "liberal" won permission to bring a legal challenge to her policy.
Rob George, president of the Association for Palliative Medicine, said he was concerned about any possible law change.
He said: "This is a dangerous distraction from providing decent health care, and actually it's the dying that we need to look after.
"Our job is to look after people as they die... not in order that they die."
However, the daughter of a woman who died at Dignitas last year said she wanted the law to change so that terminally ill people could end their life at home.
Jayne Bramwell's daughter Lindsay said that it would help to "ease the path for everyone involved and make what is a horrendous time a bit easier".
She said it was "enormously distressing" for her mother to have to travel to Switzerland in a wheelchair.
"She just wanted to be at home and have all her family with her..." she said.
In 2008, a paralysed rugby player from Worcester died at Dignitas .
Daniel James, 23, had a collapsed spine following an accident during training with Nuneaton Rugby Club. The Director of Public Prosecutions said prosecutions in the case would not be in the public interest.
Dignitas , which said it aided "accompanied suicide", often described as assisted suicide, has not commented specifically on the Jeffrey Spector case.
The charity, founded in 1998, said: "The main work of Dignitas is not assistance in dying but in fact suicide preventive work, above all suicide-attempt-prevention work in a broad sense."

        <MainBody>Northern Ireland welfare reform bill fails to pass
26 May 2015
From the section Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland's controversial Welfare Reform Bill has failed to pass at Stormont.
The nationalist Sinn Fin and SDLP made a petition of concern, a blocking mechanism that meant it did not get the required cross-community support.
Alliance Party leader David Ford said it meant the Stormont institutions were "in a very dangerous position".
The DUP now wants the government to take back welfare powers, but Sinn Fin said such a move would be unacceptable.
A majority of 58 assembly members voted in favour and 39 voted against the bill to make changes to benefits that have been introduced in the rest of the UK.
There were several mitigation schemes in the bill that would have lessened its impact.
But Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fin said: "This is a time when the (Stormont) executive parties need to stand together to defend our public services, particularly in terms of health, education and welfare."
Green Party leader Steven Agnew also signed the petition.
During the assembly debate, Finance Minister Arlene Foster warned that if the bill failed to pass, "604m of cuts would have to be made to vital, frontline public services, the services that the most vulnerable in our community need and rely upon".
The debate went ahead despite Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson's admission to hospital with a suspected heart attack on Monday.
DUP sources say the 66-year-old party leader is making good progress and has been given a full briefing on Tuesday's events at Stormont.
Last week, Mr Robinson said the assembly could not survive the scenario that would unfold if the welfare reform bill was not approved.
However, Sinn Fin accused the DUP of scaremongering with its budget forecasts.
The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform measures in the Stormont House Agreement last December.
However, Sinn Fin withdrew its support in March.
What is a petition of concern?
The measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly.
If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support.
In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting.
Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions.

        <MainBody>EU referendum: Staying in 'will be Yes campaign'
27 May 2015
From the section UK Politics
Voters in the UK's EU referendum will be asked to choose Yes if they want to remain in the union or No to leave, the BBC understands.
Prime Minister David Cameron has said the in/out referendum will take place by 2017.
A bill paving the way for the referendum is expected in Wednesday's Queen's Speech.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the precise wording of the question had not been confirmed.
But it is expected to allow those who want Britain to remain in the EU to style themselves as the Yes campaign, with the question expected to be along the lines of: "Should the UK remain a member of the EU?"
'Yes to remain'
Our correspondent said: "What we won't get [in the Queen's Speech], I'm told, is the absolute, finalised official version of that question. There's likely to be more discussion about it, but I'm led to believe that what we are heading towards is a question along the lines of whether the UK should remain in the EU.
"That is significant because it would allow those who want the status quo to continue once there has been a renegotiation, who want the UK to remain a member of the EU, to style themselves as the Yes campaign. Yes to stay in, Yes to remain.
"So it could be that there is some discussion of that over the coming days."
Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate the UK's membership before the referendum takes place.

        <MainBody>Cold sore virus 'treats skin cancer'
By Michelle Roberts Health editor, BBC News online
26 May 2015
From the section Health
A genetically-engineered version of a virus that normally causes cold sores shows real promise for treating skin cancer, say researchers.
The modified herpes virus is harmless to normal cells but when injected into tumours it replicates and releases substances to help fight the cancer.
Trial results published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology show the therapy could lengthen survival by years - but only for some melanoma patients.
The treatment is not yet licensed.
There is increasing excitement over the use of viral treatments like T-Vec for cancer
Prof Harrington, UK trial leader
Similar "immunotherapy" treatments for melanoma are already available in the US and in Europe, but researchers believe T-Vec would be a welcome addition to these.
It would also be the first melanoma treatment that uses a virus.
The latest study is the largest ever randomised trial of an anti-cancer virus and involved 436 patients from 64 centres in the US, the UK, Canada and South Africa who had inoperable malignant melanoma.
UK trial leader Prof Kevin Harrington, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: "There is increasing excitement over the use of viral treatments like T-Vec for cancer, because they can launch a two-pronged attack on tumours - both killing cancer cells directly and marshalling the immune system against them.
"And because viral treatment can target cancer cells specifically, it tends to have fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy or some of the other new immunotherapies."
More research
Dr Hayley Frend, science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: "Previous studies have shown T-Vec could benefit some people with advanced skin cancer, but this is the first study to prove an increase in survival.
"The next step will be to understand why only some patients respond to T-Vec, in order to help better identify which patients might benefit from it."
Analysis
Although it has not yet been licensed, doctors are excited about the very real prospect of a brand new type of treatment for advanced melanoma - and, in the future, possibly other cancers too.
The idea of using viruses to enter and kill cancerous cells has been gathering scientific pace and kudos.
This latest study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology is the largest ever randomised trial of an anti-cancer virus and provides tantalising evidence that the treatment concept could soon be moved into the clinic, after decades of work in the lab.
Researchers now want to do more studies to identify which patients might benefit from the treatment and whether it should be used alongside other melanoma drugs that are already approved.
Drug regulators will be watching closely and will soon make a final decision about T-Vec.
Earlier this year an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab , became the first treatment "fast-tracked" for NHS patients in England with advanced melanoma, under a new government scheme.
Drugs approved through the Early Access to Medicines scheme, launched in England in April 2014, have been scrutinised by regulators weighing up the risks and benefits.
Melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the UK and kills more than 2,000 people in Britain each year.
Damage to the skin by the sun's harmful UV rays increases your risk of developing this cancer.

        <MainBody>Crowds 'can be counted' with phone and Twitter data
By Jonathan Webb Science reporter, BBC News
27 May 2015
From the section Science &amp; Environment
Could mobile phone data help authorities get a quick fix on crowd numbers?
It may be possible to estimate the size of a large crowd based on geographical data from mobile phones and Twitter, according to a new study.
Warwick University researchers studied geo-tagged tweets and mobile phone use over a two-month period in Milan.
In two locations with known visitor numbers - a football stadium and an airport - these activities rose and fell in close step with flow of people.
The team said it could enable measurement of events such as protests.
Other researchers emphasised that there were limitations and biases within this type of data - for example, only a subset of the population uses smartphones and Twitter and not all areas are well served by mobile phone towers.
But the study's authors said the results were "a very good starting point" for making more of these estimates - with greater accuracy - in the future.
"These are the numbers - the calibration examples - that we can draw on," said co-author Dr Tobias Preis. "Obviously it would be even better if there were training examples in other countries, other environments, other time periods. Human behaviour is not constant around the globe.
"But it's a very, very good base to build on, to provide initial estimates."
The work, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science , is part of a big and growing research field exploring what online activity can reveal about human behaviour and other real-world phenomena.
Twitter activity (plotted on the right) was concentrated in the centre of Milan
Federico Botta, the PhD student who led the analysis, said the mobile phone-based approach had advantages over other methods for estimating crowd sizes.
"This is very quick," Mr Botta told BBC News. "It does not rely on human judgement, it only relies on having the data related to mobile phones, or Twitter activity."
Margin of error
Within two months of mobile data provided by Telecom Italia as part of its Big Data Challenge, Mr Botta and his colleagues concentrated on Linate Airport and the San Siro football stadium, home to both AC Milan and Inter Milan.
They compared the number of people known to be in those two places, based on flight schedules and football ticket sales, with three measures of mobile phone activity: the number of phonecalls and text messages, the amount of internet use, and volume of tweets.
"What we saw was that indeed these activities had a strikingly similar behaviour to the number of people," Mr Botta said.
This may not seem surprising - but particularly within the football stadium, the team saw such a reliable pattern that they could make predictions.
There were 10 football matches during the analysis period. Based on data from any nine of those games, the researchers could predict how many were at the tenth game based purely on mobile internet data.
But how accurate were they?
"Our mean absolute percentage error is about 13%," Mr Botta said. "That means that our estimate and the actual number of people differ in absolute value by roughly 13%."
This is pretty good, the team said, compared with traditional techniques that rely on images, grids and human judgement. They pointed to the famous example of the 1995 "Million Man March" in Washington DC, where even the most careful analysis could only produce an estimate to within 20% - after initial statements varied wildly from 400,000 to 2 million.
Co-author Dr Suzy Moat said the football stadium results were even better than the team had hoped.
"This is the kind of thing you really hope you'll find, and you're not normally lucky enough to see," she told the BBC. "It's really striking that we're seeing quite such a close correspondence between the telecommunications data and the crowd size estimates."
How many people can you see?
Dr Ed Manley is a lecturer at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. He said this technique had a lot of potential and that people should be "optimistic but cautious" about using phone data in this way.
"We've got these massive data sets and there's a lot to be done with them... But we need to remain cautious about how far we push the data," Dr Manley said.
He explained that it would be important to remember that data from smartphones would not measure the population evenly.
"There are potentially biases there. Who are we measuring in these data sets?" Twitter, he noted as an example, has a relatively young and affluent user base.
Dr Manley also said it would be important to choose the measurement carefully because people use mobiles for different things in different places - perhaps more for phonecalls at the airport and for tweets at the football, for example.
And crucially, the whole analysis hinges on mobile phone signal - which is notoriously variable from place to place, and prone to dropping out.
"If we're relying on these data sets to tell us where people are, what happens when we have a problem with the way that data is collected?" Dr Manley said.

        <MainBody>Ireland to sell Aer Lingus stake to IAG
26 May 2015
From the section Business
The Irish government has agreed to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus to IAG, the owner of British Airways.
The board of the Irish airline is also recommending IAG's 1.36bn (961m) takeover offer for Aer Lingus.
While the Irish government is now supporting the takeover offer, the other big shareholder in Aer Lingus, Ryanair, is yet to make a decision.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary recently said his company would consider any offer from IAG.
A spokesperson for Ryanair, which owns a 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, said on Tuesday: "The board of Ryanair has yet to receive any offer, and will consider any offer on its merits, if and when an offer is made."
Legally binding
Last year Aer Lingus rejected two takeover offers from IAG saying they undervalued the business.
There was also opposition to the IAG offer from Irish MPs who were concerned that services between Irish airports and London's Heathrow might be cut.
However under Tuesday's deal, IAG has agreed to a legally binding commitment to maintain current services between Heathrow and Dublin, Cork and Shannon for at least seven years.
In a statement, Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington said: "This is a compelling transaction for Aer Lingus, its shareholders, its employees, its customers and for Ireland.
"The company will reap the commercial and strategic benefits of being part of the much larger and globally diverse IAG Group."
'Cast-iron guarantee'
Under the deal Aer Lingus will operate its international passenger services under the Aer Lingus brand.
The company will also keep Aer Lingus as its registered name and its head office will remain in the Republic of Ireland.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG said that under the deal "Aer Lingus would maintain control of its brand and operation while gaining strength as part of a profitable and sustainable airline group in an industry that's consolidating".
"Ireland's vital air links to Europe and North America would be enhanced, creating new jobs, with cast-iron guarantees on ownership of Aer Lingus' Heathrow slots," he added.
The deal will require approval by the Irish parliament.

        <MainBody>Muslims 'dehumanised' warns Qatar's Sheikha Moza

A senior member of the Qatar royal family has warned that Muslims are being "dehumanised" by the coverage of violent extremism in the Middle East.
"Why do Muslim lives seem to matter less than the lives of others?" asked Sheikha Moza bint Nasser in a speech at Oxford University on Tuesday.
The division between east and west was creating a "fear and suspicion of all things Islamic", she said.
Sheikha Moza also warned against "violent repression" in the Arab world.
Widely seen as one of the most influential women in the Middle East, Sheikha Moza warned an audience at Oxford University of the dangers of negative stereotypes in the West.
And the failure of progressive politics in the Middle East was fuelling "distorted and perverted" interpretations of Islam, she added.
'Muslim-phobia'
Speaking at the opening of the Middle East Centre at St Antony's College, Sheikha Moza warned that while there was an "intellectual curiosity" in the West about Islamic culture, individual "real, living Muslims" faced growing distrust.
She described this as being "Muslim-phobia", as distinct from claims of "Islamophobia".
And she questioned whether globalisation was really achieving more "pluralistic" societies.
"Intellectual curiosity" for Islamic art, not much respect for Muslims, says the Qatari royal
"A Muslim is first and foremost identified as a Muslim, rather than simply a human being.
"Whether they are Pakistani, Malaysian, Senegalese, or even British born, their multiple identities are levelled under a constructed monolith of Islam," she said.
This collective identity was seen as something "fearful and unknowable", said Sheikha Moza, mother of the current Emir of Qatar and wife of the previous ruler.
The consequence was "double standards" in the reaction to the casualties of conflict, said Sheikha Moza, a senior political figure in the oil and gas-rich Gulf state.
"Only silence follows when innocent Yemeni and Pakistani children and civilians," are killed by drones, she said.
She challenged the increasing use of the word "medieval" to describe the actions of radicals in the Middle East.
"Global media, both western and Arab, often claim that Islam does not believe in freedom of expression and is stuck in medieval times," said Sheikha Moza.
'Isis is as modern as Guantanamo'
But she said it was a failure of "our collective responsibility" not to admit that the violence of groups such as the so-called Islamic State were the result of our own modern era.
"Isis is as modern as Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. They are all products of our age."
Sheikha Moza at the opening of the Middle East Centre at St Antony's College
But she also challenged the political culture in Muslim countries that had produced radical militants whose version of Islam is "nothing more than a violent political slogan".
The wave of upheavals of the Arab Spring had "planted the seeds of freedom", but she said these ideals had been "crushed underfoot" and such "dreams might find another, more aggressive channel of expression".
"This is the price we are paying today for our lack of courage when it mattered. Every act has a consequence but so does every inaction.
"Activism can quickly change to militancy when there is no recourse to democratic change."
She argued that such a failure to dismantle violent autocracies in the Middle East could be a reason why Muslims have "lost confidence" in being able to apply positive, peaceful Islamic traditions.
The Gulf state has itself faced criticism over the working and living conditions of migrant workers on construction projects for the 2022 World Cup.
Sheikha Moza told her audience that young Muslims needed to be able find a "new modernity" showing their religion as a "rich, living moral tradition".

        <MainBody>Greening: UK will not accept migrant relocation quotas
26 May 2015
From the section UK
Thousands of migrants have arrived in Italy and Greece, but the UK will not accept quotas to resettle them
The UK will not be part of any EU plan to relocate thousands of African migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece, the international development secretary has told the BBC.
Justine Greening said the government will not accept mandatory quotas.
The European Commission is expected to announce details of its plan to deal with the migrants on Wednesday.
Reports suggest it will call for a quota system for member states to relocate some 40,000 asylum seekers.
The UK has an opt-out which it has previously said it would use.
Many of the migrants arrived in southern Europe by boat in recent months.
'Work together'
The plan to use quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy among several EU countries, including France and Spain.
Ms Greening told the BBC: "We don't accept having mandatory quotas or mandatory resettlement programmes.
"Our concern is that approach simply ends up acting as a pull for more migrants to make, what for many of them is a life and death decision to get on a boat that may not be sea worthy and over the past year 5,000 migrants have died at sea."
She said looking at why people were making the journeys was key.
"If you look at what is driving people to start these journeys in the first place, it's the hope of a better life," she said.
"And that's why the only real answer in the long term is to work together, as the international community, to tackle what is an international problem and to work together to deliver development and to level up the world so that we don't leave anyone behind, or leave anyone living in poverty in the future, as is happened in the past."
The issue was catapulted to the top of the EU agenda after hundreds of people were believed to have drowned when a boat carrying up to 700 migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea in April.
The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa this year.
More than 1,800 migrants have died - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014.
The UK has deployed a warship - HMS Bulwark - and search and rescue helicopters to the waters between Libya and Italy.

        <MainBody>India heatwave toll passes 1,000
26 May 2015
From the section India
The death toll in the heatwave sweeping India has passed 1,000, with temperatures nearing 50C (122F) in some areas.
Most deaths have taken place in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where at least 1,118 people have died since last week.
Reports say at least 24 people have died from the heat in West Bengal and Orissa.
Temperatures are likely to drop in some parts over the coming days.
Hospitals are on alert to treat heatstroke patients and authorities have advised people to stay indoors.
More than 800 people have died in the worst-hit state of Andhra Pradesh
There have been calls for the establishment of drinking water camps
Heatwave conditions have been prevailing in the two worst-affected southern Indian states since mid-April, but most of the deaths have happened in the past week.
In the worst-hit state of Andhra Pradesh, where temperatures climbed to 47C on Monday, 852 people have died.
"The state government has taken up education programmes through television and other media to tell people not to venture into the outside without a cap, to drink water and other measures," news agency AFP quoted P Tulsi Rani, special commissioner for disaster management in the state, as saying.
"We have also requested NGOs and government organisations to open up drinking water camps so that water will be readily available for all the people in the towns," he added.
In neighbouring Telangana state, 266 people have died in the last week as temperatures hit 48C (118F) over the weekend.
Alfred Innes lives in its capital Hyderabad and says members of the public have received little help so far.
"I have personally witnessed the death of a three-year-old very close to where I stay and that was because of severe heat. It's very sad.
"The government isn't doing much, but as individuals we are trying our best," he added.
Temperatures fell slightly in Telangana on Tuesday, and are expected to start dropping in Andhra Pradesh by the end of the week.
The weather is likely to cool further when the summer monsoon begins at the end of the month.
What is a heatwave?
Heatwaves are defined as periods of abnormally high temperatures and usually occur between March and June in India
May is the country's hottest month, with thermometers reaching a maximum of 41C (104F) in New Delhi
Longer, more severe heatwaves are becomingly increasingly frequent globally
Intense heat can cause cramps, exhaustion and heat stroke
Thousands of people died across India during heatwaves in 2002 and 2003
In 2010 around 300 people were killed by intense temperatures, according to media reports from the time
Sources: National Disaster Management Authority of India and BBC
The Indian capital, Delhi, is enduring a week of sweltering heat as the maximum temperature in the city hit a two-year high of 45.5C (113.9F) on Monday.
The Hindustan Times newspaper carried a front-page photo of a zebra pedestrian crossing in the city melting in the heat.
"It's baking hot out here - our outing has turned into a nightmare," said Meena Sheshadri, a tourist from the western city of Pune, who was visiting a Delhi monument with her children.
"My throat is parched, even though I've been constantly sipping water."

People have been bathing in rivers in an attempt to cool down
The meteorological department has issued a warning for Orissa, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh states saying that maximum temperatures there would remain above 45C (113F).
Meteorological officials said the heatwave was due to a lack of rain.
There are fears that some of the worst-affected states could be hit by drought before the monsoon rains arrive.
The monsoon is expected to hit the southern state of Kerala towards the end of this month before sweeping across the country.

        <MainBody>NI legal aid: Barristers quit criminal cases in protest
26 May 2015
From the section Northern Ireland
The new legal aid rules came into effect earlier this month
Barristers in Northern Ireland have withdrawn from all new criminal cases requiring legal aid in protest against new rules reducing the level of payments.
The Criminal Bar Association said it was taking the move "with deep regret".
Barristers will continue with cases that began before the rules came into effect earlier this month.
Stormont Justice Minister David Ford says his new legal aid rules are essential and fair.
The barristers' move follows the withdrawal last week by the largest criminal law firm in Northern Ireland from all major cases.
Kevin Winters &amp; Company last year carried out more legal aid work than any other law firm in Northern Ireland and received payments of just over 2m.
'Substantial and unjustified'
In a statement on Tuesday, the Criminal Bar Association, which represents independent barristers, said it was "committed to providing the highest standard of representation to those members of society who face the most serious and complex criminal cases in the Crown Court".
It said those standards "cannot be achieved under these amended rules".
It described the cuts as "substantial and unjustified".
"Whilst the Criminal Bar Association recognises the financial restriction occasioned by pressure on public spending, these latest proposals represent cuts of almost 50% from levels previously set by the Department of Justice in 2005," its chairman Gavan Duffy said.
"These rules will inevitably dilute the quality of representation available to some of the most vulnerable members of society and to the victims of crime."
Last week, it emerged that the Law Society and bar council were joining forces in legal action, taking the justice minister to court in an attempt to have his new rules overturned.

        <MainBody>Iraq starts operation to drive Islamic State from Anbar
26 May 2015
From the section Middle East
Iraqi soldiers vastly outnumbered the IS militants in Ramadi, but still withdrew
Pro-government forces in Iraq have formally launched an operation to drive Islamic State out of Anbar province.
The announcement was made by a spokesman for the Popular Mobilisation (al-Hashid al-Shaabi), a force comprising dozens of Shia militias.
He said the operation would see government troops and militiamen move southwards from Salahuddin province and seek to cut off IS militants in Ramadi.
The provincial capital fell to IS this month after Iraq's army withdrew.
Since then government forces have been massing for a counter-attack in the western province, and they say they have regained some ground east of Ramadi in the past few days.
On Tuesday, fighting was reported south and west of Ramadi, as the Iraqi forces tried to cut off supply routes to the city.
The offensive has been welcomed by the Americans, with Vice-President Joe Biden pledging full US support, the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus says.
But he adds that Washington remains uneasy about the prominent role of Shia fighters, many of whom are backed by Iran.
Separately, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius criticised the Iraqi government, saying Paris had joined a US-led coalition last year in carrying out air strikes against IS on the basis that Baghdad represented the interests of all groups in the country.
"There is no military solution without a political solution. In September, we linked the coalition's support to political commitments by the new Iraqi government, what we call an inclusive policy," Mr Fabius was quoted as saying by Reuters.
"This contract is what justified our military engagement and I say clearly here that it must be better respected," he added.
'New weapons'
The Popular Mobilisation's spokesman, Ahmed al-Assadi, told a televised news conference that the operation to regain control of Anbar would be called "Labayk ya Hussein" ("At your service, O Hussein") - a reference to a revered Shia imam.
He said the operation would "not last for a long time" and that new weapons would be used in the battle that would "surprise the enemy".
Mr Assadi separately told the AFP news agency that a mix of security forces and paramilitaries would move into desert areas north-east of Ramadi, before encircling the city and preparing to retake it.
Analysis: John Simpson, BBC world affairs editor, Baghdad
Islamic State is extremely good at public relations. It generates admiration and fear with each of the videos it issues - 360 within the last year, just about one a day.
The terror it generates through its gruesome execution videos does a great deal of its work for it. And people around the world believe that it is indeed carrying all before it.
Islamic State's propaganda has helped it win several battles
By contrast, the Iraqi government has not been particularly effective at public relations. It has often been slow at telling people of its achievements, and foreign journalists in Baghdad sometimes have problems trying to find out what the forces are doing and how they are succeeding.
The result is that there has been real scepticism internationally about the Iraqi government's claims to be pushing IS back on almost all fronts.
Islamic State PR gloss masks Iraqi forces' gains
In an interview with the BBC on Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Ramadi might be recaptured "within days".
Mr Abadi also defended the decision of the 1,500 soldiers who had reportedly been stationed in the city to flee in the face of an assault by as few as 150 militants.
He explained that the soldiers had been fazed by Islamic State's shock tactics and did not lack the will to fight, as alleged by US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter.
"I am sure he [Mr Carter] was fed with the wrong information".
"They have the will to fight but when they are faced with an onslaught by [IS] from nowhere... with armoured trucks packed with explosives, the effect of them [being blown up] is like a small nuclear bomb - it gives a very, very bad effect on our forces," he added.
Fall of Ramadi a "defeat for American strategy"
Sunni heartland
IS seized parts of Ramadi, which is only 100km (60 miles) west of the capital Baghdad, along with the nearby city of Falluja and much of Anbar in January 2014.
The Iraqi government had until now resisted sending Shia militiamen to Anbar province
The province - which is predominantly Sunni - covers a vast stretch of the country west from Baghdad to the Syrian border, and contains key roads that link Iraq to both Syria and Jordan.
The US had urged the government not to send Shia militias in Anbar in case they drove more of Anbar's Sunnis into supporting the jihadists.
But after IS took complete control of Ramadi, the Popular Mobilisation was deployed. On Saturday, it retook the town of Husayba, east of Ramadi.
Mr Abadi also told the BBC that the US-led coalition needed to help Iraq tighten control of its borders, as many IS fighters were slipping into the country from Syria.
In a separate development, Britain revealed on Tuesday that its Reaper drones had carried out successful air strikes on IS targets in Anbar between 22 May and 24 May.

        <MainBody>Nepal's Kathmandu valley treasures: Before and after
27 April 2015
From the section Asia
A view of the collapsed Vatsala Durga temple in Bhaktapur
As well as the devastating loss of human life in Saturday's earthquake, Nepalis, and the world, have lost parts of the country's unique cultural heritage.
Irina Bokova, the Director-General of the UN's cultural organisation, Unesco, said there had been "extensive and irreversible damage" at the world heritage site in the Kathmandu valley.
Seven monument zones in the valley make up the world heritage site.
The three urban zones at the site are Durbar squares - meaning "noble courts" - in the settlements of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.
Ms Bokova describes these three complexes as "almost fully destroyed".
The four other zones are religious sites: Buddhist stupas [monuments] at Swayambhunath and Boudhanath and Hindu temple complexes at Pashupatinath and Changu Narayan.
Unesco said in a statement that it would be sending international experts to assess the damage to the sites in the Kathmandu valley.
Kathmandu's Durbar Square

The Durbar Square in Kathmandu's Old City is a mesh of palaces, courtyards and temples.
Unesco calls it "the social, religious and urban focal point" of the Nepalese capital.

The main temple in Bhaktapur's square lost its roof, while the 16th Century Vatsala Durga temple, famous for its sandstone walls and gold-topped pagodas, was demolished by the quake.
Patan's Durbar Square

Looking back in the other direction along the square after the earthquake, several of the tiered temples appear to have collapsed
Patan, or Lalitpur, is across the Bagmati river to the east of Kathmandu.
The city was founded in the 3rd Century.

The Buddhist temple complex at Swayambhunath, founded in the 5th Century, has also been damaged.
Video footage showed the toppled facade of one of the buildings, with the prayer flags surrounding it still fluttering in the wind.
But the iconic central stupa, with its gazing eyes of the Buddha, still stands.
Boudhanath temple complex

There are reports that the Boudhanath stupa has sustained some damage, though details are not yet clear.
It is the largest stupa in Nepal.
Pashupatinath Hindu religious complex
Bodies of earthquake victims are cremated at Pashupatinath on the banks of the Bagmati river
The shrine at the Pashupatinath Hindu religious complex has not been damaged in the disaster, a devotee at the temple told the Indian Express .
Cremations are being held on the site continuously, the paper reports.
Dharahara tower

Saturday's disaster reduced the tower to rubble
This landmark has been reduced to a stump by Saturday's quake.
Built by Nepal's first prime minister in 1832, the site, also known as the Bhimsen Tower, was popular among tourists who would climb up more than 200 steps to view Kathmandu from the top.
It is unclear whether all of these ancient monuments can, or will, be rebuilt.
Historian Prushottam Lochan Shrestha told the ekantipur.com website: "We have lost most of the monuments that had been designated as World Heritage Sites in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur [Patan].
"They cannot be restored to their original states."
And yet many buildings that were destroyed in Nepal's 1934 earthquake were reconstructed, including the Dharahara tower.

        <title>Papers look forward to Queen's Speech</title>

        <Description>Wednesday's newspapers look forward to what will be in the Queen's Speech, and there is annoyance in some quarters that the Human Rights Act repeal is not expected to feature.</Description>
        <MainBody>Linkedin
The government outlines its legislative programme later in the Queen's Speech and most papers reflect on what is in - and out - of the laws David Cameron hopes Parliament will pass. The Daily Telegraph focuses on the Conservative pledge to freeze income tax, VAT and national insurance and increase the personal allowance in line with the minimum wage. It says this will deliver "tax cuts" for 30 million people.
Introducing a British Bill of Rights, which will replace the 1998 Human Rights Act, and limiting the way UK courts implement the European Convention on Human Rights were manifesto pledges for Mr Cameron. The Times says he has "blinked first" in the face of opposition and will not introduce the legislation in this Parliament.
The Daily Mail has argued for the Human Rights Act's repeal and it says a campaign by "luvvies" including Benedict Cumberbatch and Vanessa Redgrave to keep it is folly. The paper argues that the "reviled law" is being used to prevent the deportation of dangerous foreign offenders.
The stark front of the Sun makes the same point pictorially. It says the rights of foreign criminals are being put above that of British victims and it is "bitterly disappointed" that the British Bill of Rights will not be included in the Queen's Speech.
The Guardian highlights the opposite opinion. It says former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is to warn of the "civil liberties" implications of tinkering with Britain's European human rights commitment. The paper says Mr Cameron faces a difficult fight to get any new legislation on the subject through both houses of Parliament.
The Financial Times says the prime minister will use the Queen's Speech to "fast-track" the bill that will allow a referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU. The paper says the act - which could be debated in the next few weeks - will leave open the question of whether the poll will be held next year, or in 2017.
The Daily Express - which supported UKIP during the general election - says Germany and France have made a "grubby deal" to standardise corporation tax rates across the 28-member community. The paper says critics think this could impose "soaring costs" on British businesses.
Away from politics, the Daily Mirror's front page continues the story of father-of-three Jeffrey Spector who took his own life at the Swiss Dignitas clinic rather than risk paralysis from an inoperable tumour. His family tells the paper it is "prouder than ever" of Mr Spector and overwhelmed by the support of members of the public.
The i's front page carries news of a potential breakthrough in cancer treatment. The paper says scientists have been experimenting at perfecting a way of genetically modifying a virus to attack tumour cells.
The story is expanded on in the Independent. The paper says experts at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research have used a modified herpes virus to improve the survival prospects of patients suffering from skin cancer. In patients with inoperable tumours the technique gave some an extra 20 months of life, it adds.
Metro leads on the record 75m fine handed down to a company boss who mislead tens of thousands of small investors when he was selling bonds. Stewart Ford's actions at his firm Keydata cost his customers 470m between them, while Ford made 72m in fees from the transactions, the paper adds.

        <MainBody>Islamic State PR gloss masks Iraqi forces' gains
By John Simpson World Affairs Editor, Baghdad
26 May 2015
From the section Middle East
An assault by only 150 IS militants prompted Iraqi government forces to flee Ramadi
After a week of disturbing headlines, is Islamic State winning?
It depends where.
In Syria, where Islamic State (IS) captured Palmyra and is said to have murdered large numbers of people in its usual bloodthirsty fashion, it looks as though the regime of Bashar al-Assad is getting into serious trouble.  Its army is no longer so effective at fighting his battles.
IS has taken full advantage of the reluctance of Western countries to come to Mr Assad's aid. It has spread, and has successfully wrong-footed the more moderate opposition groups.
In Iraq, though, the picture is different - even if it doesn't at first look like it. The loss of Ramadi revealed a disturbing weakness in the upper ranks of the Iraqi army.
In the days that followed, newspapers in a number of countries ran stories suggesting that IS was threatening to break out from Ramadi and head down the road to Baghdad, only 100km (60 miles) away.
There wasn't the slightest truth in it. For a start, the most humiliating aspect of Ramadi's capture from the Iraqi government's point of view was that it was done by only 150 Islamic State fighters, who put 1,500 soldiers to flight.
Those 150, even though they were soon reinforced by a few hundred other fighters, were in no position to defend Ramadi and attack Baghdad as well.
Furthermore, it soon became clear that Ramadi fell because the judgement and willpower of one man, the brigadier in command of the city, had been weakened by exhaustion, and perhaps fear.
He had stayed at his post in Ramadi for months, under siege from Islamic State, and was eventually tricked into believing that IS was on the point of using immensely destructive explosive devices in the city centre. He ordered his men to get out as fast as they could.
The US defence secretary said the fall of Ramadi showed Iraqi troops lacked the will to fight
It was clever of IS, and hugely effective; but it was scarcely a major military victory.
Islamic State is extremely good at public relations. It generates admiration and fear with each of the videos it issues - 360 within the last year, just about one a day.
The terror it generates through its gruesome execution videos does a great deal of its work for it. And people around the world believe that it is indeed carrying all before it.
By contrast, the Iraqi government has not been particularly effective at public relations. It has often been slow at telling people of its achievements, and foreign journalists in Baghdad sometimes have problems trying to find out what the forces are doing and how they are succeeding.
Tens of thousands of Ramadi residents fled the city after Islamic State's offensive
The result is that there has been real scepticism internationally about the Iraqi government's claims to be pushing IS back on almost all fronts.
When the Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, told the BBC that his forces would recapture Ramadi within days, there was widespread disbelief; even though Western diplomats in Baghdad have been forecasting very much the same thing.
Perhaps it would have been better if he had been a little more vague; but the effort to recapture Ramadi began very quickly after its fall, and is showing reasonably good results.
When government forces fought their way into the strategically important oil town of Baiji, north of Baghdad, last week, the news got remarkably little attention internationally - even though Baiji is a vitally important staging-post between Ramadi and Islamic State's chief centre in Iraq, Mosul.
None of this is definitive proof that the Iraqi government is indeed winning its war against Islamic State. There could be other Ramadis to come, and perhaps even something as devastating as last year's fall of Mosul.
But it's difficult to believe that. More difficult, indeed, than believing Mr Abadi when he says he will drive IS out of Iraq by the end of this year.
The government knows it can't rely too heavily on the Iraqi army, and it has concentrated instead on building up the volunteer forces which Westerners call militias (a word which has a strongly negative connotation in Arabic, particularly as spoken in Iraq).
The fact that Shia Muslims have volunteered for these militias in far greater numbers than Sunnis has created serious anxieties about a Shia army waging sectarian war against the Sunni inhabitants of cities like Ramadi and Mosul.
The Iraqi government has deployed Shia militias to Anbar province to support the army
The government is doing what it can to reduce the risk, but the anxieties are still there.
Nevertheless, the militias have given the government a weapon which can counter the ferocity of IS. They are pushing forward around Ramadi and Falluja, and (together with the Kurdish Peshmerga) will play a part in the effort to regain Mosul, later this year.
The war is still far from being won, and disasters could very well lie ahead. But the fact remains that, when it comes to fighting IS, Iraq is in a far better position than Syria.

        <MainBody>Should animals have the same rights as humans?
By Owen Bennett-Jones BBC News
26 May 2015
From the section World
A New York court will resume hearing a case this week about the possible illegal detention of two chimps at a university lab.
Lawyers acting for the chimps, Leo and Hercules, want them to be moved to an animal sanctuary. Researchers at Stony Brook University are using the chimps for research on physical movement.
In a potentially significant ruling Judge Barbara Jaffe at one stage suggested the chimps had the right of habeas corpus - the ancient legal principle under which the state has an obligation to produce missing individuals before a court.
But having initially used the words "habeas corpus", the judge subsequently struck them out , suggesting the court does not consider the animals to be legal persons.
Hercules and Leo's lawyers say they are not too dispirited as the court is still asking the university to justify why they are holding the chimps.
The case follows another ruling in New York last year, where a judge said a chimp was not entitled to the same rights as people .
'Speciesism'
The idea that animals could be considered legal persons with rights is relatively new.
But in centuries past animals were quite frequently involved in court cases in which they were put on trial. Most were found guilty of offences such as murder and assault. Punishments included the hanging of animals found guilty.
Opponents of the concept of animal rights argue that since animals have neither a sense of morality nor an understanding of their duties towards others, they can't have rights. Others, in turn, dismiss such views as "speciesist".
Attempts to understand the nature of animal behaviour have sometimes taken the form of highly unusual experiments. In one case a chimp called Nim was brought up with a New York family.
Project Nim, a documentary following the life of Nim the chimp, was released in 2011
The chimp's full name, Nim Chimpsky, was a play on words. The philosopher Noam Chomsky had argued that animals do not have an innate understanding of grammar and that humans are uniquely hardwired to comprehend language.
The family raising Nim hoped to prove that the chimp in their midst would be capable of grammatically structured sign language. The experiment also focused on Nim's sense of morality.
New Yorker Jenny Lee was 13 years old when Nim, then an infant chimp, was introduced to her family and became her "brother". She believes that even if Nim could not be persuaded to stop biting people, he did display some behaviours that seemed quite human.
"He quickly understood how to say sorry and when sorry was appropriate," Ms Lee told Newshour Extra . "He would very delicately kiss the tears off my cheek."
Animal cases through time
1266: In the earliest extant record of an animal trial - a pig was executed in Fontenay-aux-Roses
1654: English Civil War leader Oliver Cromwell bans cockfighting, dog fighting, bull baiting and bull running. The law was later overturned
1981: The first US conviction for animal abuse against an experimental laboratory is achieved , after an undercover investigation by animal rights activists
1992: Switzerland amends its constitution to recognise animals as beings and not things
1993: Release of The Hour of the Pig. The film, set in 15th Century France, depicts the life of lawyer Bartholomew Chassenee who represented animals accused of crimes
1999: New Zealand grants basic rights to five great ape species, banning their use in research, testing or teaching. This is considered the greatest legal success in the history of animal rights
2002: Germany amends its constitution to guarantee rights for animals , becoming the first EU country to do so
2015: A New York court considers whether chimps are legal persons
Human moral code
But animal rights sceptics believe that even if Nim had some humanlike characteristics and some basic communications skills that does not justify blurring the lines between humans and other animals.
"We have to put into different categories, ourselves - humanity that is - and the rest of the living world," says the leading British neurobiologist, Prof Sir Colin Blakemore.
Prof Carl Cohen of the University of Michigan, Anne Arbor shares that view. Animals, he argues, do not know anything about morality: "Animals do not commit crimes, animals are not attacked for their moral views. Rights are a concept special to the human moral code," he says.
While humans have an obligation not to cause animals needless suffering, he argues, that does not mean animals have rights, as the concept is alien to them.
Utilitarian argument
Not all of those seeking to protect animals rely on rights arguments.
Others argue on the basis of utilitarian calculations of maximising happiness and reducing misery. Factors to consider would include the degree of an animal's autonomy, sensitivity to pain, level of sentience, self-awareness and ability to hold preferences.
Undermining a chimp's autonomy, for example, could be taken as increasing its misery. The greater an animal's capacities, the more misery it would experience.
In terms of intelligence and emotional complexity chimps, the argument goes, have more in common with humans than they do with snails. It is a line of reasoning that offers relatively little protection to animals with fewer capacities.
Some argue that predation should be stopped, to prevent zebras being eaten by lions, for instance
Weakening the distinctions and blurring the lines between humans and animals could have grave implications for humans.
If a healthy chimp, for example, has greater autonomy than a human with dementia then might there be an obligation to look after the chimp ahead of the human?
Advocates of animal liberation have also argued that differing sensitivities to pain might be another relevant consideration in establishing what interests animals have.
Some have even suggested that there may be a case for stopping predation. In other words it might be morally necessary to prevent a zebra living in the wild from being torn to shreds by a lion.

        <MainBody>Strike changes: what do they mean?
By John Moylan Industry correspondent, BBC News
27 May 2015
From the section Business
Among the many proposals to be detailed in the Queen's Speech are plans to toughen up trade union strike laws.
The Queen's Speech is used by the government to set out the laws it hopes to get approved by Parliament in the year ahead.
Business Secretary Sajid Javid has said that reforming strike laws is a government priority.
The BBC's John Moylan looks at what we know about the planned changes so far.
What is being proposed?
According to the Department for Business the changes to the strike ballot rules are likely to include:
A 50% turnout threshold for ballots on industrial action. Currently balloting rules do not require any specific level of participation by union members.
40% of those eligible to vote must back action for strikes in core public services (Health, Education, Transport &amp; Fire Services). Ballots currently require a simple majority to back action.
Removal of restrictions on using temporary workers to cover for striking staff. A ban has been in place since 1973.
Tightening rules on ballot mandates. This would prevent unions undertaking action based on historic strike ballots
Tackling the intimidation of non-striking workers
The TUC says the new laws mean Oliver Twist had more power when he asked for more gruel
How much harder does it make a strike?
The TUC says that the new thresholds will make legal strikes close to impossible.
"Union negotiators will be left with no more power than Oliver Twist when he asked for more," a spokesperson said.
It will be a particular problem in the public sector where postal ballots of large workforces rarely achieve high turnouts.
Even if unions achieve the 50% turnout, they then need 40% of those eligible to vote to back the action. That amounts to an 80% vote in favour of strikes.
The major public sector strikes on pay and pension reform during the last parliament would not have been possible based on the new thresholds.
The PCS Union, which frequently calls strikes amongst its members in the civil service, has never achieved a 50% turnout on a national ballot.
The government says that working people need to know that they can rely upon essential services.
A spokesperson said: "Strikes should always be the result of a clear, positive decision by those balloted. That is why we will legislate to stop undemocratic industrial action and ensure that the interests of working people are protected."
German train drivers recently held a week-long strike in a protest over pay
How does it compare to other countries?
Trade unions say the UK already has some of the toughest strike laws in the world.
But making comparisons with other countries is not straightforward.
In countries such as France and Germany unions are more involved in decisions. The use of work councils, where both unions and employers are represented, means workers tend to have more of a say in negotiating pay. This means that the industrial relations climate tends to be less confrontational. But major strikes - like the current dispute by German train drivers - are not uncommon.
Some European countries don't require unions to hold a strike ballot to call industrial action. Of those that do, few specify a turnout threshold. Most require a simple majority to back strike action.
What do the trade unions say?
Unions regard the UK government's move as an attack on the fundamental human right of workers to withdraw their labour.
They say that the thresholds do not apply to any other elections, like those for Police Commissioners and the Mayor of London. And they think that if the government were serious about increasing participation in voting it would allow electronic balloting or secret balloting in the workplace.
The TUC warns that turnout thresholds can make an abstention a better way of objecting to a strike than a no vote. They say that it cannot be right to encourage people not to participate in a ballot.

        <MainBody>How will the extension of Right to Buy actually work?
By Brian Milligan Personal Finance reporter
27 May 2015
From the section Business
The Right to Buy scheme will only be extended in England
The extension to Mrs Thatcher's Right to Buy scheme - controversial at the time - promises to be one of the first big controversies of the new Conservative government.
Up to now it was only council tenants who had the right to buy the homes they had previously rented. But when the Housing Bill becomes law - as outlined in the Queen's speech - housing association tenants will acquire that same right.
As a scheme already rejected by the Scottish and Welsh governments, who wish to preserve publicly-owned housing stock, it is also emblematic of the different directions being taken by different parts of the United Kingdom.
Who is eligible?
Potential buyers must have been tenants for at least three years, the same as with council tenants. The government says that means up to 1.3m housing association tenants will be eligible in England. Around 500,000 housing association tenants are already eligible for some discounts. So the new scheme will extend rights to a further 800,000 tenants, and increase the discounts available. In Wales the government is planning to abolish Right to Buy entirely, and in Scotland it will be phased out by August 2016. A separate scheme exists in Northern Ireland.
How much of a discount will be offered?
For those eligible, discounts start at 35% on a house and 50% on a flat. The maximum is 70%, but that is currently capped at 77,900 outside London, and 103,900 in the capital. For example, someone who has been a public sector tenant for ten years could buy a 100,000 flat for just 40,000 - using a 60% discount.
How will it be funded?
Under the government's new Housing Bill, Local Authorities will be required to sell off their most valuable council houses, whenever they become vacant. The government estimates this would raise 4.5bn. The councils will then have to build replacement homes with the money raised, and the surplus will be used to fund Right to Buy. The government will make up any difference.
More flats will now be sold off, but questions are being asked about what the policy will cost
How much will it cost?
The government hasn't yet said what this policy will cost the taxpayer, but it has promised to refund the discount to the housing association involved. The National Housing Federation (NHF) which represents all the UK's housing associations, has calculated that in total Right to Buy for housing association tenants might cost 11.2bn, if all those tenants who could afford to buy did so. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said it would potentially cost "billions of pounds" over the next parliament, and it "would worsen the UK's underlying public finance position". The IFS said it would also represent a "substantial giveaway" to housing association tenants.
Will it mean fewer homes for social rents?
The government argues that by selling off housing association homes, but by requiring a replacement to be built, the scheme will, in effect, double the number of homes available. It will also raise the proportion of home-owners in England, which has fallen over the last few years. But the NHF argues that since 2012, only 46% of homes sold off have been replaced by new ones, despite a requirement for local authorities to do so. One problem is that councils - particularly those in urban areas - cannot find enough land to build on.
How many people have bought their homes since the start?
Around 2.5m council tenants across the UK have bought their homes since Right to Buy started under Mrs Thatcher's government in October 1980. The numbers buying peaked at 167,000 in England in 1982/83, but fell to 3,179 in 2009/10. After the discounts were increased, sales went back up to more than 15,000 in 2013/14. The government hopes the number will now rise further.
How many tenants will be able to afford to buy their homes?
Around 15 to 35% of housing tenants eligible for the new scheme will be able to afford to pay a mortgage, according to the NHF. . That means around 221,000 households might be keen to take up the offer - but potentially fewer than that if mortgage rates begin to rise, as expected, over the next couple of years.

        <MainBody>Mr Potato Head statue to return to Belper
26 May 2015
From the section Derby
A 7ft statue of Mr Potato Head was given to the Derbyshire town by its American twin town
A "hideous" statue of Mr Potato Head which was banished from a town in the early 2000s is set to return.
It was given to Belper in Derbyshire by its American twin town of Pawtucket, Rhode Island - the character's birthplace - in 2001 as a gift.
Although some residents liked it, others were not keen and, after it was vandalised, it was taken to the nearby American Adventure theme park.
The 7ft (2.1m) fibreglass statue is now being refurbished by a youth group.
Belper, which is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its links to the Industrial Revolution, was divided when the statue, worth 6,000, was positioned in the town.
One resident told BBC Radio 4 at the time it was "hideous" and later the same year it was damaged and taken to the theme park, which closed in 2008.
Mr Potato Head was the first toy to be advertised on TV
He has been "missing" since then, according to Andrea Fox, who runs the Drop Inn youth centre, until he turned up at the club's door earlier this month in a poor state of repair.
"We took him in and had a look at him, he was very poorly - looking very shabby," said Ms Fox.
"We're looking after him, giving him some TLC and some nice new clothes.
The fibreglass statue was looking a bit "poorly" when it turned up in Belper earlier this month
"We've had to peel him, we've stripped him down and sandpapered him, then we're going to undercoat him, seal him and do a few minor repairs to him."
John Nelson, leader of the town council, said he was glad to see Mr Potato Head back and it would be an interesting talking point, but it has not been decided where it will be displayed.
Invented in 1952, Mr Potato Head became the first toy to be advertised on television and is still made in Pawtucket by Hasbro. It later featured in Disney's Toy Story films.

        <MainBody>Daniel Barenboim designs 'radical' new piano
26 May 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
Pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim has unveiled a new type of piano, which he says is "radically different" to the standard concert grand.
It is built with straight, parallel strings, promising a superior sound to a regular piano, in which the strings are installed diagonally.
Barenboim launched the instrument at London's Royal Festival Hall, in advance of his Schubert recital series.
He intends to perform the entire series on the new piano.
Barenboim demonstrated the piano at the launch in London's Royal Festival Hall
Modern pianos have become highly standardized, with few changes to their fundamental design over the last 100 years.
They are largely cross-strung, with the bass strings crossing over the middle and treble strings in an "x" pattern, allowing the sound to be concentrated on the centre of the soundboard.
Barenboim was inspired to experiment with the design after playing Franz Liszt's restored grand piano during a trip to Siena, Italy in September 2011.
"The warmth and tonal characteristics of the traditional straight-strung instruments is so different from the homogenous tone produced by the modern piano across its entire range," he said.
"The clearly distinguishable voices and colour across its registers of Liszt's piano inspired me to explore the possibility of combining these qualities with the power, looks, evenness of touch, stability of tuning and other technical advantages of the modern piano."
He developed his idea with Belgian instrument maker Chris Maene, with support from Steinway &amp; Sons.
The Barenboim-Maene piano is a "dream come true", says instrument maker Chris Maene
As well as the straight strings, the Barenboim-Maene piano features a double bridge and horizontal soundboard veins.
According to a press release, the piano "combines the touch, stability, and power of a modern piano with the transparent sound quality and distinguishable colour registers of more historic instruments".
Pianist Gwendolyn Mok, who plays an 1875 straight-strung Erard piano, has said that such instruments possess superior clarity.
"If you look inside your own piano, you will notice that the strings are all crossing each other," she told the San Francisco Examiner in 2013.
"With the straight strung piano you get distinct registral differences - almost like listening to a choir where you have the bass, tenor, alto, and soprano voices.
"It is very clear and there is no blending or homogenizing of the sound. It therefore gives you huge opportunities in experimenting with colour."

        <MainBody>Eddie Howe: Bournemouth boss is LMA manager of the year
Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe has been named the League Managers' Association manager of the year.
Howe, 37, was honoured after leading the Cherries into the top flight for the first time in their history.
He also claimed the Championship award, with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho given the Premier League accolade.
Bristol City's Steve Cotterill and Gareth Ainsworth of Wycombe took the League One and League Two honours respectively.
Howe is only the second manager from outside the top flight to win the award since 1992, emulating then-Reading boss Steve Coppell in 2006.
He said: "I can't believe it, I'm so surprised."
A former Bournemouth player, in two spells he has guided the club from Football League survival after a 17-point deduction in 2008-09 to the Premier League.
First appointed in 2008, he returned to the club in 2012 after nearly two years at Burnley.
Howe spent more than a decade playing for Bournemouth, also in two different spells
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, who presented the award, said: "He's done a fine job, a remarkable job, and done it with style and humility."
Mourinho received the Premier League award after winning the title with Chelsea for the third time in two spells at the club.
Cotterill, meanwhile, guided Bristol City to the League One title, while Ainsworth's Wycombe finished fourth in League Two, losing to Southend in the play-off final on penalties.
Last season, the Chairboys only avoided relegation out of the Football League with a final-day victory over Torquay.
Several other managers were also recognised on the night.
The FA Cup manager of the year award went to Phil Parkinson for Bradford City's win at Chelsea while Danny Wilson was honoured for reaching 1,000 matches as a manager.
Eddie Howe's progress so far
2014-15
Bournemouth are promoted to the Premier League as Championship winners
2013-14
Bournemouth's first season in the Championship sees them finish 10th and six points off the play-offs

Trevor Bayliss: All you need to know about England's new coach
Trevor Bayliss has created his own piece of sporting history by becoming the first Australian to coach England's cricket team.
The 52-year-old comes highly recommended by those who have worked with him, but is hardly a household name in this country.
So what can England expect from Bayliss, and what has the reaction been to the appointment of a man who had a modest playing career and a link to James Bond?
Here is BBC Sport's guide to the Aussie who will lead England's attempt to wrest the Ashes back from his compatriots this summer.
So, is he any good?
Michael Vaughan certainly thinks so. The former England captain isn't surprised Bayliss was the man chosen by new England and Wales Cricket Board cricket director Andrew Strauss and chief executive Tom Harrison.
He told BBC Radio 5 live: "He has a wealth of experience in coaching, and he has got a real know-how from the white ball in terms of Twenty20 and 50-over cricket.
"In the Test format we have always been pretty good but the one-day format has been a shemozzle for a while and he is the man to try and bring a new energy and a new direction for the team.
"I haven't heard anybody say anything bad about Trevor. I don't think he is going to be in your face - he's going to be right at the back moving a few things. I believe he is a typical Aussie.
Trevor Bayliss: Paul Farbrace on England's 'excellent' new coach
"If the players want to use the stats they can, but he's not one for using that kind of information.
"I think he is a good appointment. I'm disappointed for Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie, I'm a good pal of his. But I do think they have made a good call by getting Bayliss.
"England came knocking for him about a year ago and they might not have come knocking again. That's probably one of the big things he thought - 'this is my time - I've got to take it'."
Australia coach Darren Lehmann is another who holds Bayliss in high regard.
He told Cricket Australia: "Trevor has been a great servant of the game in Australia and has had great success with New South Wales in both long and short format, as well as with the Sydney Sixers and Kolkata Knight Riders in T20s.
"He did a great job for us when he took the reins in the international T20s against South Africa last year, winning the series 2-1. A trademark of Trevor's teams is that they are well prepared and this just serves as another reminder to us that this Ashes will be a tough contest."
What's he like to work with?
The perfect coach, according to many who have. Mahela Jayawardene played under Bayliss during the Australian's spell as Sri Lanka coach from 2007-2011. He told BBC Radio Sussex: "He's a great guy.
"He's a very, very good coach, though when we took him he didn't have much international experience. He knew exactly how the team worked and he's a beautiful old-school guy in the sense that he stays behind the limelight and gets the job done.
"He's fantastic with the guys, especially with the younger guys - he gives them a lot of confidence.
"He'll give a lot of tactical information and other stuff to the team, but he'll allow the team to play and that's the most important thing.
"He's not too bothered about what the media are saying, the important thing for him is the team and the results.
"He'll allow them to grow - that's what he did with our group in 2009, 2010 and 2011 when we got into the World Cup finals.
Bayliss, seen here with batsman Kumar Sangakkara, led Sri Lanka to the 2011 World Cup final
"He created a great atmosphere for youngsters to strive in that team and he gave them more responsibility as leaders in the team."
England batsman Michael Lumb played under Bayliss for T20 side Sydney Sixers. He told BBC Radio 5 live: "I think he's the right man for the job. He's a great man, he's had a lot of success in white-ball cricket and he's someone that can take England forward in the future.
"He brings a big calmness to the group and he'll let them express themselves and play with no fear, almost like the Australian way. He'll get all the guys to enjoy the game and play positive cricket.
"Trevor Bayliss knows a lot of the New South Wales players in the Australia squad, so he'll come with a lot of homework on them as well."
What's his secret?
He's laid back, and likes a post-match pint. But don't let that fool you into thinking he's just one of the lads. He's a deep thinker on the game who allows his players to flourish under his guidance.
Trevor Bayliss - at a glance
Born: December 21, 1962, Goulburn, Australia
Big Bash coach for the Sydney Sixers
Led Kolkata Knight Riders to IPL success in 2012 and 2014
Led Sri Lanka to the World Cup final in 2011
Coached Kent in 2003
Scored 3,060 runs in 58 first-class games for New South Wales
"He's a bit old-school," said Vaughan. "He doesn't mind the odd beer at the end of the day's play and to just talk about the game."
And his man-management seems to be good. Jayawardene, now playing for Sussex, said: "He won't put boundaries or guidelines on the players, he'll allow them to play their cricket but will make sure it's done accordingly to the team plan.
"He's not very authoritative in the sense that he'll just sit back and enjoy what the team is doing, he'll allow the captain to take all the decisions and try and help him out any way he can."
So did he have had a prolific playing career?
Not really. Modest, at best. Like sacked predecessor Peter Moores, Bayliss has no experience of playing at international level, featuring only for New South Wales in a 12-year career during which he played just 58 first-class games.
He averaged 35.58 in first-class cricket in Australia, scoring more than 3,000 runs with five centuries and a highest score of 163 before retiring in 1993.
He also took eight wickets as a part-time off-spinner.
The Ashes, 2015
First Test: Cardiff, July 8-12
Second Test: Lord's, July 16-20
Third Test: Edgbaston, July 29-August 2
Fourth Test: Trent Bridge, August 6-10
Fifth Test: The Oval, August 20-24
Australia beat England 5-0 in the 2013-14 Ashes
The Aussies won't like it, will they?
Maybe England should be a little worried, because most of them seem to welcome it.
Former Australia batsman Marcus North told BBC Radio 5 live: "It's a great appointment for English cricket.
"In an ideal world it would be nice to appoint an English coach for the England side, but in sport in general that's not the case now. The world is quite small and you want the right people for the job and Trevor is someone that English cricket will enjoy having. They're very lucky to get him.
"The fact that he's Australian is going to add a little bit more extra focus on it but he's already coached abroad, he coached Sri Lanka for a number of years, and also in the IPL, so he's used to doing jobs away from Australia. Knowing Trevor he'll probably enjoy the Ashes being his first series.
"He will bring England cricket a great calmness; we all know there's a lot of scrutiny and pressure that comes with playing for England."
England lost 5-0 in the Ashes down under in 2014
Geoff Lawson tries to make it sound as though Bayliss played hard to get.
The former Australia bowler, now New South Wales bowling coach, said: "I was with Trevor in Mumbai a week ago and he certainly wasn't rushing at the job. Having worked with assistant coach Paul Farbrace before, that's a big attraction for him."
Keeping cricket in perspective
Bayliss was touring Pakistan with Sri Lanka in 2009 when their bus was attacked by gunmen in Lahore.
Six Pakistani policemen and a van driver were killed, while several players and a local umpire were injured.
Bayliss emerged unscathed, while Farbrace sustained minor injuries.
So what does Bayliss say?
That it's "an honour", even though the appointment could see him shunned back home if England regain the Ashes.
He said: "What particularly excites me about the role is the chance to work with a very talented group of players. I firmly believe the team has a bright future and I'll be doing everything I can to help them realise their potential and achieve success on a consistent basis.
"There's a great opportunity to help Test captain Alastair Cook and one-day captain Eoin Morgan shape the direction and development of their respective teams. I am also looking forward to working alongside Paul Farbrace once again as we have a similar outlook on the game, get on well after two years working together and have kept in touch."
Has anyone else had their say?
Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen thinks Bayliss is a lucky man.
Australia legend Shane Warne believes the good fortune is all England's.
What's the official line from the ECB?
Strauss said: "He has proved himself in both domestic and international cricket, has a strong reputation for man-management and has shown how to build winning teams in all three formats.
"His expertise in the shorter forms of the game will be vital as we build towards three major ICC events over the next four years: the ICC World T20 tournament in India in 2016 and the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup, which will be staged in England and Wales in 2017 and 2019 respectively."
Any more info?
Bayliss has two teenage children, Adam and Emma, who live in Australia.
What's that link with 007? Will he leave the Aussies shaken or stirred?
Bayliss was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, also the birthplace of former Bond actor George Lazenby.

        <MainBody>print
Mike Ashley's actions will speak louder than words - Alan Shearer
Former Newcastle United captain and BBC pundit Alan Shearer on what the future holds for the Magpies after they avoided relegation at the very end of a season to forget.
Like everybody else, I was surprised to hear from Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley ahead of the club's final game of the season against West Ham on Sunday.
Ashley has hardly spoken to the media or the fans since he bought the Magpies in 2007, so the question I immediately asked myself was: 'Why is he talking now?'
Maybe he thought that, after what has happened in the last few months, gates would drop at St James' Park next season unless he came out and said that things will change.
If so, he is right to have that fear. There is a lot of talk of fans not turning up.
Ashley bought Newcastle for around 133m in 2007
Until Ashley vowed to stay until the club won a trophy, disgruntled Newcastle supporters were hoping for a change of ownership.
Now they will want the change in mentality the owner has promised and something positive to shout about. Whether they get it, or not, remains to be seen.
As I said on Match of the Day, his actions will speak louder than his words in the next few months.
I know the club and I know the city, but, despite his promises, I have not got a clue what Ashley is going to do next.
'Newcastle are miles away from the Champions League'
Ashley says his intention is to "win something", or qualify for the Champions League.
Well, firstly Newcastle are miles away from the Champions League. I don't think anyone at the club should be thinking or talking about that because they will not get there for a long time.
They won't get near it unless they get some significant investment in the team and stop selling their best players.
Managing director Lee Charnley sat next to Ashley on Sunday - he helps to decide the club's transfer policy
As for winning trophies, forget the Premier League for the same reason.
The only competitions they can win are the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup - and one of the hugely disappointing things about the last few seasons is that they have not taken either seriously.
That was confirmed club policy, not my opinion based on their team selections or because they have always gone out early. This season was the first under Ashley that they reached the quarter-final of either cup.
Newcastle's recent stance is that remaining in the Premier League is the priority, rather than winning a trophy for the first time since 1969. They saw the cups as a distraction and that definitely has to change - the manager needs to be able to play his strongest team in those competitions.
'The fans need a little bit of hope'
If Ashley had made these comments years ago - and backed them up - then he might have a very different relationship with supporters.
The people running the club might not have been bothered about trophies, but the fans always were.
Ask supporters of any team and they will give you the same answer. Aston Villa, for example, finished 17th this season but they are in an FA Cup final.
That run lifted them when they were fighting relegation, which is what the cup competitions can do. They can keep your season going, whatever your circumstances, and they should do the same for a club like Newcastle.
Newcastle fans have protested against Ashley's ownership all season
The banner by Magpies fans that says 'we don't demand a team that wins, we demand a club that tries!' sums up exactly what they want, which is a little bit of hope.
If, at best, they are going to get mid-table mediocrity and not even going to have a go in the cups, then I can understand them wondering what is the point of being a Newcastle fan?
This season has ended on a high for them, because the club stayed up on the final day, but there is no cause for celebration.
Since January it has been a long, hard slog for Magpies supporters. The only emotion is relief - that the season has ended and that Newcastle are still in the Premier League.
'The playing squad needs a massive overhaul'
Carver celebrates with Jonas Gutierrez after his final-day goal against West Ham
Ashley is staying but clearly a lot needs to be sorted out to make sure they are never in the same situation on the last day again.
The first thing that needs clearing up is the managerial situation. John Carver was appointed until the end of the season and wants to keep the job but I would be surprised if he stayed on.
I know how much he loves the club, how hard he has worked and how much he has been hurting during their recent run. I see him staying on in some capacity but it will be very difficult for him to stay on as manager.
Whoever is in charge, the playing squad needs a massive overhaul. As we have seen, the team is lacking a lot at the moment. Goals, creativity, defensive leadership, a bit of everything really.
Funds need to be made available and, if they are, then the right players have to be brought in who care about the club.
The sooner that happens the better. Until it does, it is hard for me to get that excited about what Ashley has said.
Until things start moving, I don't think many other people will either.

        <MainBody>Rafael Nadal &amp; Novak Djokovic win French Open first-round ties
By Piers Newbery BBC Sport at Roland Garros
French Open
Venue: Roland Garros, Paris Dates: 24 May - 7 June
Coverage: Live text and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra commentaries on every Andy Murray match and other key matches.
Rafael Nadal began his quest for a 10th French Open title with a straight-sets victory over teenager Quentin Halys.
Frenchman Halys, an 18-year-old wildcard, had the Roland Garros crowd on his side but was not consistent enough to trouble the champion.
And sixth seed Nadal, 28, won 6-3 6-3 6-4 in one hour and 50 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.
The Spaniard is in the same half of the draw as top seed Novak Djokovic, who beat Jarkko Nieminen 6-2 7-5 6-2.
Djokovic has now won 23 matches in a row as he attempts to claim his first title at Roland Garros and become the eighth man to complete the career Grand Slam of Wimbledon and the Australian, French and US Opens.
He was given a useful workout by Finland's Nieminen, the 33-year-old taking a surprise 5-2 lead in the second set.
World number one Djokovic is due to meet Nadal in the last eight
That merely served to bring the best out of Djokovic, who won the next nine games in a row to effectively seal victory.
"I always feel a lot of emotion when I get back on this court," said Djokovic, who won the Australian Open at the beginning of February and was runner-up to Nadal in Paris last year and in 2012.
"This year I'm playing very well and I hope I will get the confidence I have had since the beginning of the year."

Usain Bolt wins 200m at Golden Spike meet in Ostrava
Usain Bolt was an easy winner in his first race of the year in Europe, but failed to break 20 seconds in the 200m at the Golden Spike meet in Ostrava.
In wet conditions, Jamaica's six-time Olympic gold medallist clocked 20.13 seconds - well outside his 19.19 world record - to beat American Isiah Young.
"You can't be satisfied if I don't break 20 seconds," said Bolt, 28, who is building up to the World Championships in Beijing in August.
Asafa Powell took the 100m in 10.04.
The 32-year-old former world record holder was also well off his best pace in the Czech Republic, having clocked 9.84 seconds at the Jamaica International Invitational in Kingston this month.
His compatriot Bolt improved on his season's best of 20.20 for the 200m, set in April in Jamaica, but conceded he was well off where he will need to be by summer.
"I just need to try to get myself into running shape," said Bolt, who won 100m, 200m and sprint relay gold at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow.
"I really wanted to [break 20 seconds] but the conditions didn't allow. And I'm coming back from injuries, so it's going to take time."
Britain's Richard Kilty was third in the 100m in 10.31, while James Ellington finished sixth in 10.45, before doubling up in the 200m, coming home fourth in 20.81

        <MainBody>SpaceX cleared for US military launches
27 May 2015
From the section Business
The US Air Force has certified the private company SpaceX to launch military and spy satellites.
A joint venture between Lockheed Martin and and Boeing has had a monopoly on those launches since 2006.
Founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk, SpaceX has already won contracts with NASA to ferry cargo and crews to the International Space Station.
The approval from the US military followed two years of intensive reviews by the US Air Force.
"SpaceX's emergence as a viable commercial launch provider provides the opportunity to compete launch services for the first time in almost a decade," Air Force Secretary Deborah James said in a statement.
Mr Musk said the decision was "an important step toward bringing competition to national security space launch."
In June, the Air Force expects to open bidding for the contract to launch GPS satellites built by Lockheed and it will be SpaceX's first opportunity to compete for military work.
Russian engines
The US military has been relying on the Atlas 5 rocket, which uses Russian built engines, to power payloads into space.
But the military only has until 2019 to use that system, as US lawmakers have banned the use of Russian engines for launches that concern national security.
The certification of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will give the military an alternative rocket ahead of the ban.

        <MainBody>Amazon's sales reporting change could raise tax bill
26 May 2015
From the section Business
Amazon has attracted criticism for adopting complex corporate structures to reduce its tax bill
Amazon, the global online retailer, is changing the way it records sales in a move that could see it paying more tax.
Transactions carried out in European markets were previously recorded in Luxembourg, with which Amazon had a low-tax agreement.
Now sales made through subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy will be registered in those countries, the retailer has said.
Amazon had received heavy criticism for its tax avoidance policies.
"More than two years ago, we began the process of establishing local country branches of Amazon EU Sarl, our primary retail operating company in Europe," the company said in a statement.
"As of 1 May, Amazon EU Sarl is recording retail sales made to customers through these branches in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy.
"Previously, these retail sales were recorded in Luxembourg."
Amazon added that it was "working on opening a branch for France".
In recent years, the European Union has intensified its investigations into the tax deals negotiated by global companies with countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
It suspects that such deals amount to illegal state aid and distort competition.
Last year, the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - launched a formal investigation into Amazon's tax arrangements with Luxembourg.
And the EU is also looking into tech giant Apple's tax dealings in Ireland, coffee-shop chain Starbucks' dealings in the Netherlands, and Italian carmaker Fiat's agreement with Luxembourg.

        <MainBody>Nicola Sturgeon attacks Westminster spending cuts
26 May 2015
From the section Scotland politics
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has used a speech in Edinburgh to attack the "scale and speed" of spending cuts planned by the UK government.
Speaking ahead of the Queen's Speech, the SNP leader also reiterated her party's support for Britain's continued membership of the European Union.
She made the speech on a visit to Heart of Midlothian FC's Tynecastle Stadium.
She was joined by the Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney.
The pair also unveiled the Scottish Business Pledge which aims to promote "fairness, equality and sustainable economic growth".
'Slow recovery'
An "alternative to austerity" was the centrepiece of the Scottish National Party's successful general election campaign.
In her first major economic speech since the election, Ms Sturgeon argued that the prime minister cannot ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people.
During the run up to the referendum, the Scottish government will of course make a strong and positive case for staying in the EU
Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister
She said: "The result of the general election provides an opportunity and a challenge for the Scottish government. There is clearly an opportunity to ensure that Scotland's priorities are better understood.
"But there is also a significant challenge in working with a majority government at Westminster - many of whose policies we disagree with.
"We will continue to oppose spending reductions of the scale and speed that the UK government has suggested. These would slow economic recovery and make deficit reduction more difficult - something shown by the impact of the cuts imposed after 2010."
Ms Sturgeon said David Cameron must either change his approach or find ways to lessen the impact on Scotland.
She also said that business, employees and government needed to work more closely together to build a prosperous and cohesive society.
The SNP leader again insisted that the UK should only withdraw from the EU if there was a majority in favour of exit in all four nations of the UK.
She said: "Since a referendum is now inevitable we will work to protect Scotland's interests in that referendum. We'll propose a double majority meaning that exit from the European Union would only be possible if all four nations agreed to that, something that would ensure that Scotland couldn't be forced out of the European Union against our will.
"And during the run up to the referendum, the Scottish government will of course make a strong and positive case for staying in the EU."
Ann Budge (right) joined John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon at Tynecastle Stadium.
The first minister also called on businesses to commit to paying the living wage and promoting fair practices as she launched a new industry code.
Companies wanting to sign up to the Scottish Business Pledge must agree to pay the living wage to all direct employees over 18.
They must also be delivering on at least two of the pledge's nine components, as well as committing to achieving the rest "over time".
'Perfect match'
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Scottish Finance Secretary Mr Swinney, said: "This has been described by the first minister as a shared national endeavour and I think that's exactly how we should look at this - government and business coming together.
"My priority is to get people into employment and then to make sure that as much of that employment as possible is high quality, productive employment, making a high-value contribution to our society."
Hearts, who recently won promotion back to the Scottish Premiership, are one of the first companies to sign up to the pledge.
The club's chief executive Ann Budge said: "By introducing the living wage across our business, by investing in youth education and staff education, by engaging fully with the community and by working closely with the Foundation of Hearts to introduce fan ownership, we are the perfect match for this initiative."
'More efficient'
Businessman Brendan Burns, who operates a forestry company and is a former UK policy chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, told Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme that the Scottish government needed to address more than just the implementation of the living wage.
He said: "I pay more than the living wage, but that is not the point. To be able to pay the living wage, you have to get more efficiency into Scottish businesses.
Scratch beneath the surface and it would be realistic to say that many small to medium-sized business cannot afford to pay staff the living wage
Murdo Fraser MSP, Scottish Conservatives
"At this moment, that is what we don't have. Every businessman I meet will always say 'I would like to pay the living wage', but you can't pay out of a business if the profit isn't there. The profit is there when the business is more efficient."
Scottish Conservative enterprise spokesman Murdo Fraser MSP said many firms could not afford to pay the living wage and more incentives should be offered to businesses.
"In principle, the Scottish Business Pledge sounds like a decent strategy," he said.
"However, scratch beneath the surface and it would be realistic to say that many small to medium-sized business cannot afford to pay staff the living wage. This is particularly the case in sectors like care where income levels are set by the state.
"The Scottish government should be helping these businesses where they can. That's why we're calling for a living wage business bonus for small businesses which pay the living wage, in the form of a reduction in their business rates."
The Scottish Greens welcomed the new pledge but urged the first minister to go further and address environmental standards and tax avoidance.
MSP Patrick Harvie MSP said: "Given the clear opportunity Scotland has to develop a low-carbon economy that respects our finite resources, and the urgent need to meet our failed climate targets, it's disappointing that the environmental impact of business is barely mentioned in this pledge scheme."
"Ministers are also missing the chance to make a strong statement that tax dodgers won't be tolerated. "

        <MainBody>Bruce defends Alistair Carmichael: Politicians tell lies
26 May 2015
From the section UK Politics
Mr Carmichael has said he will not quit as an MP despite admitting not telling the truth
Politicians tell "brazen lies", senior Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce has claimed as he defended the actions of ex-Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.
Mr Carmichael is facing calls to resign after admitting he backed the leaking of a memo during the election campaign incorrectly suggesting Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron as prime minister.
The MP for Orkney and Shetland said previously he had not been aware of it.
Sir Malcolm said the MP had been wrong but lying was common in public life.
The SNP have called on Mr Carmichael - the only remaining Lib Dem MP in Scotland - to consider his position after an official Cabinet Office inquiry found he approved the leak of an official memo by his special adviser to a newspaper during the campaign.
The document, written by a civil servant in the Scotland Office, claimed the Scottish First Minister told the French Ambassador to the UK that she would prefer Mr Cameron as prime minister rather than Ed Miliband - comments Ms Sturgeon has always insisted she never made.
'First-class MP'
At the time, Mr Carmichael said the first he had heard of the memo was when he was contacted by a journalist.
He has since acknowledged that while he had not seen the document before it was published, he was aware of its content and agreed that it should be made public.
Sir Malcolm Bruce stood down as an MP at the election, having served for 30 years
The parliamentary standards commissioner has said she has received a number of complaints about Mr Carmichael's conduct and is considering whether they fall within her remit.
The BBC's Tim Reid said Mr Carmichael was not an MP at the time of the episode - because parliament had broken up for the general election - but he was campaigning to retain his seat and remained a cabinet minister.
A member of the public has also complained to the police about Mr Carmichael's conduct, our correspondent added.
Sir Malcolm said Mr Carmichael had faced up to the consequences of his actions, having apologised and foregone the severance pay he was entitled to after losing his Cabinet position.
But he told the BBC that it was "perfectly reasonable" for him to remain as a "first-class" MP for Orkney and Shetland.
"Alistair has recognised that he has made a mistake," he told Radio 4's Today programme. "People are entitled to make mistakes, learn from them and move on."
'Heated atmosphere'
Sir Malcolm, who was MP for 30 years until retiring at the election, said Scotland was a "divided and bruised" country after the election and that Mr Carmichael, as one of only three non-SNP MPs elected to Westminster, had a key role to play in representing his constituents and holding both the UK and Scottish governments to account.
The SNP, he said, were "judging people by standards that they do not apply to themselves" and if Mr Carmichael quit "what we will have seen is the SNP bully a very good MP out of office for a mistake he has acknowledged and apologised for".
"The SNP clearly want to extinguish all opposition in Scotland. That is their objective and they will stop at nothing to do it."
The parliamentary standards watchdog has received a number of complaints about Mr Carmichael's conduct
Asked whether it would be acceptable for an MP who had not told the truth to remain in office, he replied: "I'm acknowledging that if (Mr Carmichael) has said 'I didn't know about something I did know in the heated atmosphere of an election campaign' that was part of the mistake, which he has apologised for."
"My point is if you are suggesting that every MP who has never quite told the truth or indeed told a brazen lie - including ministers, including Cabinet ministers, including prime ministers - we would clear out the House of Commons very fast, I would suggest.
'Ludicrous'
Asked if lying was widespread in public life, he said: "No, well, yes. I think the answer is that lots of people have told lies and you know that to be perfectly true....
He added: "We should, of course, hold people to account and if people lie they should take some consequences but Alistair has taken consequences."
The SNP said the comments amounted to an "increasingly desperate attempt to defend the indefensible".
"Being an MP or MSP is a huge privilege for anyone elected to serve - and untruthfulness can never be simply brushed aside in the way that Sir Malcolm suggests it should," said MP Pete Wishart.
"The Lib Dems' defence of Mr Carmichael gets more ludicrous by the day, and all Sir Malcolm has succeeded in doing is to keep the focus on his colleague."
The Cabinet Office said the cost of its investigation had been "minimal" and said there were no plans for a further investigation into whether Mr Carmichael had breached the ministerial code.
Labour MP John Mann said the row illustrated the need for a stronger system of voter recall for politicians accused of misconduct. "There are plenty of people who avoid answering a question but that is not the same as lying," he said.
Under a law championed by the Lib Dems in the last Parliament, an MP's seat becomes vacant if they are suspended from the Commons for at least 10 days and a 10% of their constituents subsequently sign a petition calling for a by-election.
There has also been criticism from one prominent Lib Dem activist. "It is a rubbish defence/excuse and not one a party reduced from 57 MPs to just 8 should be making," tweeted Stephen Tall , former co-editor of the Lib Dem Voice website.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats have said that Mr Carmichael, who held off a strong challenge from the SNP to regain his seat by 817 votes, will not face any disciplinary action.

        <MainBody>Obesity in adolescence linked to bowel cancer risk, says study
26 May 2015
From the section Health
Being overweight in adolescence is linked to a greater risk of bowel cancer later in life, a study suggests.
Researchers followed nearly 240,000 Swedish men for 35 years.
The analysis, published in the journal Gut , showed overweight teenagers went on to have twice the risk of bowel cancer. The figures were even higher in obese teens.
The World Cancer Research Fund said the link between obesity and cancer was "strong".
Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, with nearly 1.4 million new cases each year.
Processed red meat and abdominal fat have been linked to the disease.
'Accelerated growth'
The participants in the study were aged between 16 and 20 at the start.
The overwhelming majority were a normal weight, but 6.5% were overweight and 1% were obese.
There were 855 cases of colorectal cancer in the study.
However, the results showed not all weights were affected equally.
Those who were obese were 2.38 times more likely to have developed a bowel tumour.
The study, led by Orebro University Hospital in Sweden and Harvard University, said: "Late adolescence marks the transition from childhood to adulthood and is a period of accelerated growth, especially among men, thus this period may represent a critical window."
"It is important that we understand the role of exposures in childhood and adolescence in the development of colorectal cancer.
"In fact, the strong association observed between adolescent obesity and early-to-mid-life colorectal cancer, coupled with the increasing prevalence of adolescent obesity, may shed light on the increase in colorectal cancer incidence among young adults," he added.
'Strong evidence'
Rachel Thompson, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said the evidence suggested that obesity was a risk factor for bowel cancer.
"This finding is interesting because it gives an indication that bowel cancer risk might be affected by our lifestyle habits throughout the life course," she said.
"In some ways, research into the relationship between factors like obesity and cancer risk is still in its infancy.
"It will be interesting to see if further research emerges in the future to back up the apparent relationship between body fatness in youth and later-life cancer risk."

        <MainBody>Dyslexia not linked to eyesight, says study
By Sean Coughlan Education correspondent
25 May 2015
From the section Education &amp; Family
Researchers say that dyslexia is not linked to eyesight
Dyslexia is not linked to any problems with eyesight, say researchers.
Teams from Bristol and Newcastle universities carried out eye tests on more than 5,800 children and did not find any differences in the vision of those with dyslexia.
This raises doubts about the value of using coloured overlays or lenses to help dyslexic children with reading.
Report co-author Alexandra Creavin said eyesight was "very unlikely" to be the cause of such reading problems.
The study draws on a long-term tracking study in the Bristol area, which has followed the health of more than 14,000 children since the 1990s.
About 3% of children have severe dyslexia and researchers, using a sample of 5,822 children from this tracking study, carried out detailed eye examinations on dyslexic and non-dyslexic children.
'Perfect vision'
They found that those with dyslexia were no more or less likely to have any sight or eye-related problems, such as short or long sightedness, squints or difficulties in focusing.
"Some practitioners feel that vision impairments may be associated with dyslexia and should be treated. However, our study results show that the majority of dyslexic children have entirely normal vision on the tests we used," said Cathy Williams, lead author and a paediatric ophthalmologist.
Where there were dyslexic children with eye problems, the occurrence was no more likely than for non-dyslexics, the study found. And a large majority of dyslexic children were defined as having "perfect vision".
This raised doubts about vision-based forms of assistance, such as using coloured filters to help with reading. This can include putting coloured acetate sheets over a page or wearing tinted lenses.
Dr Creavin, from the University of Bristol, said the research showed the need for clearer, evidence-based guidance for parents on what might help.
Dr Williams said the study was not looking for other possible causes for dyslexia, but it was the biggest study examining whether there was any link to children's vision.
Colour filters
John Rack, director of education and policy at Dyslexia Action, said the charity backed the report's findings.
"However, not everyone has followed us in following the evidence, and the view that dyslexia is rooted in some problems in vision or visual processing is still widespread.
"The confusion comes in part from the fact that a minority of people who are dyslexic do find that text is significantly clearer when viewed through a coloured filter or lens.  And some who are not dyslexic experience the same kind of benefit," said Dr Rack.
Kate Saunders, chief executive of the British Dyslexia Association, said that "some children and adults report benefits" from using coloured lenses or filters.
She said reading tests showed that such coloured filters could help people with dyslexia.

        <MainBody>Queen's Speech: 'Coasting' schools improvement plan
By Sean Coughlan Education correspondent
27 May 2015
From the section Education &amp; Family
Nicky Morgan has signalled a further increase in the number of academies
A more rapid intervention for underperforming schools in England is expected to be announced in the government's legislative plans.
The Queen's Speech will set out how standards can be raised in so-called "coasting schools".
The Conservatives have also promised to double the free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds.
Labour's Tristram Hunt said a more pressing issue for school standards was "the quality of classroom teaching".
An education bill will set out plans for an accelerated way of improving struggling schools in England and changing their leadership.
This is likely to see more schools becoming academies - and last week Education Secretary Nicky Morgan launched the drive to encourage the setting up of a further 500 free schools.
The proposals expected in the Queen's Speech will call for higher standards in schools in the Ofsted category of "requires improvement" - which is below those judged as "good", but above those rated as "inadequate".
Tristram Hunt says there needs to be a stronger focus on teaching standards
Schools which are failing to make progress would have to work with expert advisers or bring in another high-achieving school as a sponsor.
If a "coasting school" does not show improvement the governing body could be replaced and the school turned into an academy.
"Where it is clear that a school does not have the capacity or the plan to get themselves out of 'requires improvement'. . . then, yes, we will intervene, we will put in support... and of course we will look at the academy model too," Mrs Morgan has said of the government's proposals.
Head teachers have complained about the negative language being used about schools and the National Union of Teachers has argued that there is no evidence that academies are more likely to improve than other schools.
Free childcare
There is also expected to be a step towards doubling the amount of free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 2017, increasing from 15 to 30 hours per week.
The government's plans for the next Parliament are also expected to include measures to speed up the adoption process in England.
Children can spend months in care waiting for adoptive parents to be found.
And in an attempt to get a wider range of possible adoptive parents, the government wants councils to work together and have a less localised approach.
Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said of the expected plans for schools: "Labour supports having the option of converting coasting schools to academy status and the devolution of school improvement decisions away from Whitehall.
"But unlike the Tories we realise that raising standards and tackling underperformance requires far more.
"We need from government a much stronger focus upon raising the quality of classroom teaching, greater collaboration between schools at a local level and  better support for head teachers so standards stay high."

        <MainBody>UK nations have biggest skills gaps, says OECD
27 May 2015
From the section Education &amp; Family
There are large skills gaps between young people in and out of work, says the study
UK nations have the biggest skills gaps between young people who are not in education, employment or training and those in work, suggests a study.
They had the widest literacy gap out of 22 countries included in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) analysis.
They also had the biggest gap in problem-solving skills, says the study.
The Department for Education said its "relentless focus on standards" was boosting skills in England.
OECD researchers looked at 2012 and 2013 data for 22 developed countries, including England and Northern Ireland - which for the purposes of the report were labelled "the UK".
'Disengaged'
The UK-based group had the largest differences between the literacy and problem-solving skills of those who were not in education, employment or training (Neet) aged 16 to 29 and their employed peers, the researchers found.
Overall, there was a 12.6% gap in literacy, double the OECD average of 6.5%.
In Japan, the difference was 0.3%, in Korea 0.4% and in Norway, which had the biggest gap after the UK, it was 11.2%, followed by the Slovak Republic where it was 10.5%.
There was also a 9.6% difference between the problem-solving skills of UK Neets and young people in work.
The country with the next biggest gap was the Netherlands, where the difference was 8.6%, followed by Norway with a gap of 7.4%.
In Korea, the difference in problem-solving skills was just 1.2%.
Ensuring all young people leave education with sufficient skills is a priority, say the researchers in a country note on the UK figures.
"Policies should focus on helping the Neets, including those who have become disengaged, to renew with education or integrate into the labour market."
The note emphasises the need to continue reforms and improve links between young people and employment and education institutions "including through second-chance options".
The researchers also note that, unlike many other OECD countries, the UK's Neet rate did not increase during the global economic and financial crisis.
However, young people with poor skills face more problems in their careers than other young people, they add.
Some have completely given up looking for work, the statistics show, with more than half (56%) of those classified as Neet in 2013 deemed "inactive" and not seeking work, compared with an OECD average of 54%.
"Many of the Neets are far from the labour market not only due to their low skills but also because they are not looking for a job and thus may have fallen under the radar of education and labour market institutions," the report warns.
'Off the radar'
Statistics published last week showed one in eight young people in England is deemed to be a so-called Neet - down to a 10-year low.
In January, the Commons Public Accounts Committee warned that tens of thousands of teenagers fell off the radar when they left school and missed out on support and advice.
A Department for Education spokesman said: "Following years of stagnation in international education league tables, this government's relentless focus on standards is ensuring that thousands more young people are able to read, write and add up properly...
"But there is no room for complacency. We will continue to build on this success by ensuring all young people leave school with the knowledge and skills they need to compete with their peers from across the globe."
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the report was "an important reminder that skills and training for young people will be vital to productivity growth".
"But with the government making major cuts to further education, we are moving in the wrong direction.
"If the government is serious about higher productivity, it will need to reconsider these cuts."

iPhone owners used Periscope to share the wait for the birth of Princess Charlotte
Twitter's live video streaming app Periscope is being launched on Google's Android platform, exactly two months after its debut in the Apple store in March.
Rival streaming app Meerkat has been available for download on Google's Play store since the beginning of May.
Twitter acquired Periscope in January 2015.
It claims there were more than a million downloads of the Apple version of the app during its first week.
Both apps offer a live broadcasting service via mobile phone. Those watching can show their appreciation and send messages which pop up on screen during the stream.
However, such services are data-heavy, experts have warned.
"I was streaming for about 11 minutes on 4G and I used up in the blink of an eye 250MB [of data]," said reporter Kate Russell from BBC Click.
"If you're watching random streams for about half an hour you're going to chew through about 400MB, so if you're on a low-data plan, be aware of exactly how much data you're consuming."
Periscope android engineer Sara Haider said in a blogpost that Android users of the app will be able to return to watch a broadcast where they left off if, for example, an incoming phone call or text message interrupts the feed.
Those using it to broadcast will not have to upload a file in order to enable replays.
Ms Haider described the app as "the closest thing to teleportation".

        <MainBody>Apple design guru Jony Ive promoted
26 May 2015
From the section Technology
Sir Jonathan's promotion will allow him to pass on some of his day-to-day management duties
Apple has promoted British designer Jony Ive to the role of chief design officer at the world's most valuable company, according to reports.
Sir Jonathan previously held the role of senior vice president of design and helped design of some of the tech giant's most popular gadgets.
He was knighted in 2012 for his services to design.
The move was first revealed in an interview with Sir Jonathan in the Telegraph newspaper.
In an internal memo to employees, published later by tech blog 9to5Mac, chief executive Tim Cook said Sir Jonathan's newly created role would now expand beyond its devices and into designing the company's retail stores, new California campus and even office furniture.
Apple is in the middle of building a new campus, also known as "spaceship" for its circular shape that will house about 12,000 workers.
"In this new role, he will focus entirely on current design projects, new ideas and future initiatives," Mr Cook said in the memo.
"Jony is one of the most talented and accomplished designers of his generation, with an astonishing 5,000 design and utility patents to his name."
Sir Jonathan has helped design products like the iPod, iPhone, iPad and smartwatch over the last couple of decades.
There were reports earlier this year that Apple was working on a car and that he could be behind its design.
He will start the new role in July.
Delegating work
Some of Sir Jonathan's previous day-to-day management duties will now be shared by two other executives, who will work under him.
Richard Howarth - another Brit - will take over as the new head of industrial design at Apple, making him responsible for the crafting of its hardware.
His name previously came to prominence during an Apple v Samsung patent fight in 2012 , when court filings revealed he had played a key role in the design of the original iPhone.
And Alan Dye - an American - will become vice president of user interface design - putting him in charge of engineering the way consumers interact with its software.
He recently featured in a Wired article, which described the work he had done on the Apple Watch .
Allowing Sir Jonathan to take a step back from some of his previous duties may reflect the fact that he was described as "exhausted" in a recent profile by the New Yorker .
"I just burnt myself into not being very well," he told the magazine, referring to the fact he had suffered pneumonia in the run-up to the release of the firm's smartwatch.
The promotion should free up more of Sir Jonathan's time to work on the Apple Campus 2 project
The article, published in February, said Sir Jonathan had wished to discourage the suggestion that he might be preparing to leave Apple.
Confirmation that he intends to stay with the company - albeit while engaging in more travel away from its California base - is likely to reassure investors.
"Jony Ive is intrinsically linked to the Apple phenomenon," commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight tech consultancy.
"Apple runs through his veins in the same way it did with Steve Jobs, thanks to the focus he has given to the products that it has delivered.
"To be one step removed from that does come with some risks for the organisation."
Apple's market capitalisation currently stands at $763.6bn (495.3bn), making it the most valuable company in the world.

        <MainBody>Quake-hit Nepal seeks experts advice on tourism
By Navin Singh Khadka Environment reporter, BBC World Service
27 May 2015
From the section Science &amp; Environment
Landslides were caused both during and after the earthquake and its aftershocks
Tourism operators in earthquake-hit Nepal say they are seeking guidance from international experts on which areas can be declared safe for trekking and mountaineering.
They want to secure an assessment from top geologists because of the increased risks from earthquake-torn mountains.
This type of tourism is a major source of income for Nepal.
Major destinations are still facing landslides, after the quake and its aftershocks left mountains unstable.
Places seen as highly risky are mainly in the Manasalu, Langtang, Rolwaling and Helambu trekking areas in central Nepal. But there are also concerns for the Annapurna and Everest regions, which see the highest numbers of trekkers and mountaineers.
Reputation risk
"Before we announce that the earthquake-hit areas are safe as tourist destinations, we are determined to get an assessment report from international geologists and experts who will be visiting the ground," said Ramesh Dhamala, president of Trekking Agents' Association of Nepal.
"Without them first saying which areas no longer have the risk of mountains coming down, we will not be doing this risky business just for an immediate benefit.
"We are also recommending to the government, in writing, that these areas should not be reopened (for trekking and mountaineering) before the team of experts make their assessment public internationally."
Trekking agents say they are worried that if tourists are allowed to visit the earthquake-hit areas under present circumstances, and if disaster strikes such areas again, the country's tourism industry will suffer irrecoverably.
Mountaineering operators are similarly worried.
"We too think the same way, and we have joined forces with trekking agents and the government to ascertain a scientific assessment - because it is equally, if not more, risky for mountaineers to be in the region that has been so badly shaken by the earthquake," says Ang Tshering Sherpa, president of Nepal Mountaineering Association.
But there are some operators who believe business should resume as soon as possible, because not everywhere has been badly hit and that there are some areas with lesser risks.
Roads in Langtang National Park were strewn with boulders by the April earthquake
Nearly 800,000 tourists visited Nepal in 2013, and a similar number in 2012. Around 13% of those visitors were trekkers and mountaineers.
The Annapurna region sees the highest number of trekkers, followed by the Everest region.
The April 25 quake had its epicentre in Gorkha to the west of Kathmandu, but it shook mountains as far away as Everest to the east.
That quake ruinously rattled mountains mainly in the Langtang valley, where entire villages were buried under avalanches and landslides and debris killed nearly 200 people including foreign trekkers.
The main quake zone also shook many mountains in the Annapurna region, where landslides have continued and one of them even blocked a major river on Sunday.
The biggest aftershock - a 7.3 magnitude quake on 12 May - had its epicentre to the northeast of Kathmandu where there are popular trekking regions including the Rolwaling and Helambu.
That tremor caused huge devastation in these areas and there was damage in the Everest region again.
Officials said a small glacial pond near Mount Everest burst its containment on Monday night, causing panic among villagers because they fear the earthquake and aftershocks may have destabilised bigger glacial lakes in the region.
Geologists say the quakes triggered more than 3,000 landslides in the affected areas and the upcoming monsoon could worsen conditions.
"The reason why the mountains remain unstable is that earthquakes cause intense shaking of the landscape, which damages the rock and soils on hillsides," says Prof Alex Densmore from the Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience at Durham University in the UK.
"This means that even hillsides that did not fail during the earthquake are more damaged, and thus more prone to failure, than they were before 25 April.
"In some cases this damage may be visible at the surface in the form of cracks or fractures in the ground, but this is not necessarily the case; the damage may be at depth and not immediately visible."
Tricky assessment
Prof Jeffrey Kargel, a glaciologist at the University of Arizona who has studied landslides on Nepalese mountains and their impacts on rivers, says an assessment of the situation is absolutely critical.
"We have seen so much activity of the earth following the main shock and the largest aftershock that we have to presume that there is going to be a state of greatly heightened activity during this monsoon, and quite possibly into coming years," he said.
Thousands were left without shelter by the quakes
"It's very clear that we have to do what's possible, not just to keep trekkers and climbers safe, but also the people who service the trekkers and climbers and the entire economic structure of these very hard-hit areas."
But given Nepal's difficult topography in the Himalayan region, assessing the risks would not be easy.
"It will take quite a bit of work because every valley, every glacier, every mountain is going to be different depending on the circumstances of the glaciers, the moraines and possible fracturing of the rocks," Prof Kargel said.
International tour operators are waiting and watching as well.
"To rush out and simply say it's safe to come to Nepal without factual knowledge is a little bit foolhardy, potentially," said Nicholas Cowlie, Nepal general manager for Intrepid Travel - the largest international provider of trekking tourists to the country.
"At this point, our clients are holding on to their (Nepal) holiday bookings and our major focus is to report back to them and show them that we are ready for business when we know that it is operationally safe."

        <MainBody>How Arctic ozone hole was avoided by Montreal Protocol
By Helen  Briggs BBC Environment correspondent
26 May 2015
From the section Science &amp; Environment
Arctic ozone without the Montreal Protocol (left) and following its implementation (right)
The Antarctic ozone hole would have been 40% bigger by now if ozone-depleting chemicals had not been banned in the 1980s, according to research.
Models also show that at certain times, a large hole would have opened up at the other end of the globe.
The Arctic hole would have been large enough to affect northern Europe, including the UK, scientists say.
The Montreal Protocol is regarded as one of the most important global treaties in history.
The protocol provides a lesson for the future and we must hope that the coming climate change talks show the same foresight
Dr Jonathan Shanklin, British Antarctic Survey
It was signed in 1987 after the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic, the part of the upper atmosphere where ozone is found in high concentrations.
Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the ground.
Concerted international action led to the signing in Montreal of a UN agreement which phased out ozone-depleting chemicals, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - once widely used in fridges and spray cans.
The new research, led by scientists at the University of Leeds, simulated what the ozone hole would have been like today if nothing had been done.
The largest hole in the ozone layer appears over Antarctica
Lead researcher, Martyn Chipperfield, said: ''We would be living in an era of having regular Arctic ozone holes.
''The Antarctic ozone hole which was discovered before 1987 would have got bigger and we would also have a fairly significant ozone depletion over mid-latitudes where there are high populations, including parts of Europe.''
Foresight
The study found that the Antarctic ozone hole would have grown in size by 40% by 2013, and the ozone layer would be thinner over middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
There would also have been a hole over the Arctic at times, which would have rivalled that of the Antarctic and would have affected northern Europe, including the UK.
The ozone loss would have led to increases in UV levels of about 10% in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, leading to more skin cancers, the study concludes.
Jonathan Shanklin of the British Antarctic Survey is one of three Cambridge scientists who discovered the ozone hole 30 years ago this month.
He said the Montreal Protocol was the UN's most successful treaty to date and observations from the British Antarctic base were showing signs of a ''recovery'' in ozone levels.
''The protocol provides a lesson for the future and we must hope that the coming climate change talks show the same foresight and result in a treaty that will benefit the whole planet,'' said Dr Shanklin.
Since the Montreal Protocol came into force, levels of chlorine and bromine containing ozone depleting chemicals have peaked and then declined.

        <MainBody>Never Mind The Buzzcocks to end after 18 years
26 May 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
The show launched in 1996 with host Mark Lamarr (centre) and captains Sean Hughes (left) and Phill Jupitus
The BBC has pulled the plug on comedy panel show Never Mind The Buzzcocks after 18 years and 28 series.
First broadcast in 1996, the music trivia quiz has been hosted by Mark Lamarr, Simon Amstell and, most recently, Rhod Gilbert.
It had a reputation for upsetting its guests - with Lemmy, Huey Morgan and Preston all storming off the set.
A revamp in 2014 failed to improve ratings, and the BBC has now dropped the show.
Guests have included Amy Winehouse, who appeared with Rich Hall and Phill Jupitus in 2004
Phill Jupitus has been a team captain for all 28 series, while Sean Hughes, Bill Bailey and Noel Fielding have filled the opposing captain's chair.
"After 28 series we've decided not to bring Never Mind the Buzzcocks back to the BBC," said a spokesperson. "This will create space for new entertainment formats in the future.
"We'd like to thank the team at Talkback, Rhod Gilbert, all the brilliant hosts over the years and of course Noel and Phill for the years of enjoyment they've given BBC Two viewers."
Named in tribute to the Sex Pistols' Never Mind The Bollocks album, the show took a similarly anarchic approach to the TV quiz show format, delighting in insulting its guests.
Ordinary Boys frontman Samuel Preston appeared to take umbrage as soon as Simon Amstell introduced him as a "professional celebrity" at the beginning of a 2007 episode.
He stuck around until Amstell read extracts from his wife Chantelle Houghton's biography, including the line: "The photoshoot was for the Daily Mail, which made me feel really posh and upmarket."
Preston later said he regretted walking off the TV show
Declaring "I can't be bothered with this", the singer stormed off with half an episode left to record.  Audience member Ed Seymour was drafted in to fill the vacant seat.
BBC 6 Music presenter Huey Morgan also saw the red mist descend during his appearance in 2013, violently smashing a mug after an altercation with guest hosts Rizzle Kicks.
Meanwhile, Mark Lamarr used his stint as host to berate the British public for voting Robbie Williams' Angels the best song of the last 25 years.
"I've done a quick list of other songs that maybe should have been considered. Number one, Ghost Town by the Specials. I think that's a better song than Angels.
"Number two, every other song recorded in the last 25 years."
Phill Jupitus and Noel Fielding were the resident team captains for the last five years of the show
Phill Jupitus was the show's mainstay, taking part in almost all of the 270 episodes.
But he briefly considered quitting the show during Amstell's tenure.
"It struck me with Simon that people were being booked especially to have the piss taken out of them in a very overt fashion," he told the Guardian in 2010.
"Mark [Lamarr] didn't book people to rag on them, it was just in the flow of the show that people suddenly went a bit weird and Mark could turn on them. It became something else with Simon and started to get a bit wearing."
However, ratings never recovered after Amstell left, dropping from an average of 2.5 million viewers in 2008 to 1.1 million for the most recent series.

        <MainBody>Philip Larkin poem discovery discredited
26 May 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
Philip Larkin admired the poem's real author Frank Redpath
A leading literary magazine that claimed to have found an unpublished poem by Philip Larkin has admitted that it was the work of a different writer.
The Times Literary Supplement (TLS) recently printed In and Out , which was found in one of Larkin's workbooks in Hull's History Centre.
However, it has since been identified as being by Hull poet Frank Redpath.
The TLS said it regretted the error and that the poem had been authenticated by the Larkin estate and other experts.
"We now know this poem was, in fact, written by Frank Redpath, a much less well-known Hull poet who admired and was heavily influenced by Larkin, and we regret the error," a spokeswoman for the magazine said.
Redpath contributed to a 1982 anthology of Hull poets titled A Rumoured City, to which Larkin contributed a foreword.
Larkin's publisher Jean Hartley later recollected how Larkin told Redpath that, of those included: "Yours are the only poems in the book I would have been glad to have written."
'Perfectly Larkinesque'
In and Out made its way into Larkin's workbook in the form of two loose pages of typescript.
Earlier this month, the TLS said it had a "typeface and spacing that match many other examples of Larkin's finished poems".
The original article said: "Larkin clearly did not consider the poem worthy of publication; but nor did he destroy it entirely."
It did note that "the strangest thing about the poem is the absence of any of the usual meticulous drafts".
But it continued: "The text, however, speaks unambiguously for itself. There are striking similarities to work before and after the probable period of its composition: it not only shows where Larkin had come from, but where he was going next."
It added that the speaker was "a recognizably Larkinesque one", although it concluded that his "lingering immaturity does show through in places".
In a follow-up blog on Tuesday, the TLS wrote: "Contrary to what we and the Larkin scholars who inspected it believed, In and Out isn't by Larkin, after all. Yet it seemed so perfectly (too perfectly?) Larkinesque."

        <MainBody>What I learnt from 46 consecutive days in church
24 May 2015
From the section Magazine
Broadcaster Adrian Chiles recently set himself a challenge - to go to church every day for more than a month, and never the same one twice. Why?
For the Lent just gone by, I resolved to go to church every day. I'm a Catholic, so it would be Mass every day for more than a month. It felt like it would be a real struggle - a penance. It turned out to be anything but. It was a rich and enriching experience - spiritually, obviously, but I was also enraptured by the churches themselves, the communities they serve, and the people with whom I shared all those Masses.
I made it extra hard for myself by undertaking to go to a different church every day, so by Easter Sunday I'd been before 46 different priests in 46 different churches in 46 days. Someone pointed out to me at around the 35-priest mark that even the Pope probably hadn't heard Mass said by so many different priests in so many different churches in such a short space of time.
From day one, Ash Wednesday, I was captivated. I happened to be in the Swansea area, so I went to St Illtyd's in Port Tennant, a neat little community with rows of terraced houses clinging to the side of a very steep hill overlooking the bay.  In every church I went to on this odyssey, without fail there was something to entrance me. It could be anything from the priest's trainers - priestly footwear is something I could write a whole article about - to the majesty of a stained glass window. At St Illtyd's it was the statue outside of Christ on the cross. It was made from some metal that had corroded, kind of creating new stigmata on it. Transfixed, I looked up at it for what must have been ages, until I spotted a couple of teenagers just across the road, cigarettes in mouths, beholding me doubtfully.
St Illtyd's
Other random Mass moments that will never leave me include the Polish lady next to me one Tuesday morning in Our Lady of Grace and St Edward's in Chiswick. She held a tiny passport-sized photo in a miniature, gilded frame.  I took it to be her mum. With tenderness almost unbearable to behold, she occasionally stroked her face.
On a Friday lunchtime at St Patrick's in Soho Square I chose my pew, but before my bottom touched the seat I sprang back up in alarm as I realised there was someone in a sleeping bag motionless at my feet. I looked around at the rest of the congregation but no-one else seemed very concerned, so I shrugged inwardly, knelt and prayed for him, or it may have been a her. Who knows?
Then there was the Church of the Sacred Heart and St Catherine of Alexandria in Droitwich Spa. If you're passing, do go and see the mosaics: they are simply breathtaking. The priest's sermon referenced something about a trip across a lake in India. Walking through the dark churchyard after the service, a lady behind me said to her friend: "That was good; you don't think of them having lakes in India, do you?" Oddly, I knew what she meant.

At Sacred Heart in Fareham at 7am one Wednesday morning, I sighed a little as an impossibly ancient lady in a woolly hat stepped forward to do the reading. This could take a while, I thought. But it turned out that in her younger days she could only have been an actor or Radio 4 newsreader. Her voice, clear as a church bell, sang out. I swear even the angels and cherubs around us cocked a pleased ear.
My loudest involuntary snort of laughter came in St David's Priory in Swansea. I was having a crafty Google of St David's Wikipedia entry. It turned out his miracle came to pass at Llanddewi Brefi where, I read, the ground on which he stood is reputed to have risen up to form a small hill. A Welsh scholar called John Davies was quoted as writing that "one can scarcely conceive of a miracle more superfluous in that part of Wales than the creation of a hill".  Brilliant.
St David's Priory in Swansea
Wherever I went in the country, and most of my Masses were in London, Birmingham, Swansea and Manchester, it was striking how similar the congregations were at weekday Masses. There's no getting away from it: the average age must be somewhere in the seventies. At 48, I spent most of this spring feeling like a spring chicken. But there was also invariably a young family of Asian origin, usually with young children. And at the 7am Masses in Central London there was the odd go-getter, who strode out after Mass was ended as if they had hedge funds to run. They probably did.
So, a mixed bag, as were the priests. A third of them I found to be great, with a handful quite life-changingly brilliant. Another third were sort of OK. The rest were pretty hopeless, not least because I often couldn't actually hear what they were saying. And a handful were grumpy to the point of malevolence.
Spiritually, if I'm to really "connect" at Mass, I need a good priest to help me. And by good I mean, first and foremost, that they should look pleased to be there and pleased that we're there. Often they speak of great "joy" while looking as bored as swimming pool attendants.
Secondly, with the liturgy - essentially the same script which they do day in, day out - the best of them find a way of making it sound fresh. As the inestimable Father Paul Addison of Our Lady of Delours in Kersal put it to me: "The clue's in the word; communion is all about communicating." And the same is obviously true of the sermon. One of the beauties of daily Mass is, frankly, its brevity - invariably less than half an hour. Sometimes the sermon is dispensed with altogether, but often it just takes the form of a thought or two, which I find much easier to get my head round than one of Sunday's lengthy orations.
My favourite ever came from my first priest (I'm a convert), a Father Terry Tastard, a man with an unforgettable name in the happy habit of delivering pretty unforgettable homilies. At one weekday Mass he simply said: "How is it that we're always so keen for others to change when we're so reluctant to change ourselves." That was years ago, but I think about it often. As I'll always think back to this Lent as one of the most rewarding and quietly intense 46 days of my life.
Adrian Chiles spoke to BBC Radio 4's PM on 20 May about the ways Mass is celebrated.

        <Description>Novelist Isabel Wolff reveals how her family saved Harold Wilson from drowning.</Description>
        <MainBody>The strange day my father saved Harold Wilsons life
23 May 2015
From the section Magazine
Harold Wilson died 20 years ago, on 24 May 1995. He would have died many years before that, writes novelist Isabel Wolff, had her family not saved him from drowning.
As a child I spent many family holidays on the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles off the Cornish coast. We'd spend our time walking, cycling and, best of all, rock-pooling.
But where we would normally expect to catch a few shrimps and the odd crab, there was one memorable year when we pulled the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition out of the water.
It was 10 August 1973 and we were enjoying a bike ride around the largest island, St Mary's. I was with my parents, my elder brother Simon, 16, then a pupil at Rugby School, his best friend Robert, and my younger brother, Matthew, who was 10.
As we cycled along a path above an isolated bay, Matthew spotted an empty rubber dinghy racing out to the open sea. As we watched it speed towards the horizon we wondered whose it was and why it was loose.
Isabel Wolff
Suddenly my father said that he thought he'd heard a cry. Sure enough, above the buffeting of the wind we could just make out a distressed male voice.
My father cupped his hands and shouted: "What is your trouble?"
"I can't get into my boat," the voice answered. "Fetch a dinghy!"
We pedalled down to the bay as fast as we could.  My father yelled: "We'll get to you in a few minutes. Can you hold on?"
"Yes - for a bit," came the faint reply.
While Robert sped off to alert the Coastguard, Simon found a dinghy - but it had no oars. My father hurriedly looked around for a pair but then, further off, saw a wooden "pram" dinghy, its oars still in its rowlocks.
He and Simon carried this to the water's edge and, with Simon guiding him, my father rowed out towards a group of motor launches moored about 300 yards from the shore. While they did this my mother, Matthew and I waited on the beach, which was deserted except for a benign looking Labrador chained up by a fisherman's hut.
The dog's name tag said "Paddy" and Matthew and I stroked his ears while we anxiously waited for events to unfold.
Twenty minutes later we saw my father and Simon coming back. Hunched between them in the boat was a bedraggled looking, but familiar figure.  "It's Harold Wilson," I said.
As my father rowed towards the quay, the Labour leader suddenly stood up, nearly swamping the boat. He then sat down again until it had docked, and Simon helped him onto dry land.
Paul Wolff in 1999
I vividly recall how shocked he looked. His shorts and shirt were drenched, his hair was plastered to his scalp, his teeth were chattering and his face was white.
He declined my father's offer of further help, including the loan of a bike to get back to his bungalow, but said that he was glad that we'd come along when we did.
My father jovially responded that it wasn't every day one pulled a former prime minister out of the water and that we were happy to have been able to help.  Satisfied that Wilson was all right, we left him with Paddy and cycled away.
As we ate our picnic lunch my father and Simon explained that Wilson had slipped into the sea while attempting to step from his rubber dinghy onto his motor launch.  The dinghy had shot away from him - the dinghy that we'd seen.
Unable to pull himself into the boat, Wilson had been left hanging on to the fender ropes for dear life. He'd told them that he'd been feeling sea-sick and that his arms felt "numb" and were "giving out".
Simon had stepped on to Wilson's boat and had then hauled the man on to the deck "like a sack of potatoes".  Dad then swore us all to secrecy - if the story got out it could ruin the opposition leader's holiday, and our own.
The next morning we went down to Porthcressa and by chance we saw Wilson coming off the beach.   I remember thinking that he'd be happy to see us again - perhaps he'd even ask us to tea? To my surprise I saw a flash of irritation cross his face.
My father greeted him and asked how he was.  He replied that he felt all right, if rather stiff, and that he had spent the rest of the day in bed.  "I've had my swim for the holiday though," he added pleasantly, then he went on his way and we didn't see him again.
Returning home after the holiday we told no-one what had happened but somehow, a month later, the story got out.  First my father was approached by our local paper which made the story a splash: "Rugby Family Rescues Mr. Wilson From Sea."
Was Paddy the culprit?
This got picked up by the Birmingham Post and within 48 hours my father's face was on the front of every national newspaper.  Headlines such as "Wilson Snatched From Drowning" and "Wilson Rescued in Sea Drama" amused us, but we were outraged by the Daily Mirror's "My Dog Tipped me In!"
In a piece of Labour spin, Wilson's press secretary, Joe Haines, had apparently blamed the labrador.  There was even a photo of "the culprit", Paddy, who was "in the doghouse".
One could see the need for damage limitation - the incident was extremely embarrassing for Wilson, not least because the Prime Minister Ted Heath was a world-class yachtsman. There were cartoons of Heath grinning at the news on board his yacht, Morning Cloud.
My father, a nuclear engineer, was besieged at work by TV film crews and quizzed about his voting habits. "Lifelong Tory Saves Wilson from Drowning", announced the Daily Telegraph.  The Times pointed out that the Labour Leader, whose party had pledged to end private education, had been rescued by a public schoolboy.
And so it went on. We put up with myriad jokes of the "Why didn't you throw him back?" variety.
Wilson ties up up his boat on the Isles of Scilly
In the meantime Haines continued to elaborate on the story.  Wilson, he claimed in the Mirror, was in "no danger".  He "could have swum to the beach" but was "waiting for a friend".
The truth is, Harold Wilson would have died.  Aged 57, he'd been in the cold water, never more than 15C on Scilly, for more than half an hour.
Knowing the strong Atlantic currents, he hadn't dared risk the long swim back to the beach.  Worst of all, in that deserted spot, there had been no-one to hear his cries.
Reflecting on the incident afterwards, my father told us that Wilson seemed not to understand that it was "only by the slenderest margins" that his life had been saved.
Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down
Denis Healey
Six months later, in February 1974, Harold Wilson became prime minister again.
It's now 42 years since "The Wilson Affair" as my family always called it.  It seems strange that despite all the publicity this very significant event in the life of Wilson is almost unknown.
Neither of his official biographers, Ben Pimlott and Philip Ziegler, mentioned it in their respective books, nor did Joe Haines revisit it in his own memoir of Wilson, Glimmers of Twilight.
I sometimes wondered how Wilson's colleagues had viewed the story at the time. Were they sympathetic? Amused?  Did they pull his leg about it?
"Oh I remember it well," Denis Healey told me when I phoned him in the House of Lords a few months ago. "Harold seemed very embarrassed by it and was clearly anxious to play the whole thing down.  We didn't feel that we could mention it to him - definitely not."
And if my family hadn't happened to pass by when we did?  It's fair to say that the course of British politics might have been rather different.
Denis Healey or Jim Callaghan might have succeeded Wilson. Edward Heath might not have been defeated in 1974 and there might well have been no Tory leadership challenge the following year and therefore, quite possibly, no Thatcher premiership.
My late brother, Simon, used to wonder whether our father may, on that fateful August day, have inadvertently launched Margaret  Thatcher's prime ministerial career.
The rest, as they say, is history.

        <MainBody>Joshua Gafney death: Nurse Amanda Young on trial
26 May 2015
From the section Somerset
Amanda Young denies manslaughter by gross negligence
A nurse killed a patient with a "massive overdose" of an anti-psychotic drug, a court has heard.
Amanda Young is accused of administering a lethal dose of the drug to Joshua Gafney, 22, at his home in February 2012.
Bristol Crown Court was told Mr Gafney had been given 14 times the amount of clozapine needed to treat him.
Ms Young, 40, from Yeovil, denies manslaughter by gross negligence. Her trial is expected to last three weeks.
The court was told Joshua Gafney suffered paranoid schizophrenia
Mr Gafney had serious mental health issues and was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, the court heard.
Prosecuting, John Price QC told the jury Mr Gafney had been given a "massive overdose" of a drug he had been prescribed to treat a serious condition he had.
Ms Young was instructed to administer 6ml - a little more than a teaspoon - of clozapine to Mr Gafney but the court heard she "hadn't seen" the dosage written on the medication.
Instead she poured six bottles into a glass for him.
She mistakenly believed each 14ml bottle contained 50mg of clozapine when in fact this figure was per millilitre - meaning a single container actually had 700mg inside, the court heard.
His mother, Tina Marren, immediately raised concerns at the half-full glass but Ms Young allegedly replied: "I know, we will put a bit of water with it".
Mr Gafney drank the glass, containing 84ml, and was pronounced dead two hours later.
Mr Price said there was "no doubt" Ms Young gave the "fatal dose" and that "she was at fault for his death," he said.
The trial continues.

        <MainBody>Party-death girl Sarah Clerkson 'in drinking game'
26 May 2015
From the section Tees
The inquest was held at Crook Civic Centre
A 14-year-old girl in foster care who was found hanged at a house party was "very drunk" after taking part in a drinking game, an inquest heard.
Sarah Clerkson, of Sunderland, who was staying with a County Durham family, went to sleep after she was sick.
Party-goers found her an hour later in a bedroom.
Coroner Andrew Tweddle said the only conclusion was an "open one" as there was no indication that she intended to kill herself.
'No bullying'
The tragedy happened at a party in Spennymoor in December 2013.
Det Insp Wendy Tinkler said that Sarah had "drunk quite a considerable amount of whisky and Disaronno (an amaretto-flavoured liqueur)."
She agreed that there was no indication of "unpleasantness" or bullying at the party.
Sarah's foster father, Andrew Young, said she had been living with them since October 2013 after a "troubled time".
He added there were issues at school where there were "bad influences" and she had been exposed to drink and drugs previously.
Although she had mentioned self-harm in the past in notepads and books, there was no mention of suicide, Mr Tweddle said.
Because of her drunkenness, her age and a lack of a note, he said he could not be certain that Sarah intended to kill herself.
The teenager's family were aware of the inquest but chose not to attend, he added.
A review by Sunderland Safeguarding Children Board will be published in the coming weeks.

        <MainBody>Queen's Speech 'is test of good faith', say SNP
27 May 2015
From the section Scotland politics
A Scotland Bill is expected to be included in the Queen's Speech
The Queen's Speech will be a test of Westminster's "good faith" towards the Smith Commission, the SNP has said.
A Scotland Bill, based on recommendations of the cross-party group, is expected to be part of the Conservatives' legislative programme.
It is set to include more powers for Holyrood, such as setting income tax rates and controlling a share of VAT.
But the SNP said draft legislation published in January did not go far enough.
The Smith Commission was set up following the "no vote" in the independence referendum to discuss further powers for Scotland.
Angus Robertson, the party's Westminster leader, said the Scotland Bill must implement the Smith recommendations in full.
He said: "In terms of more powers for Scotland, it is an early test of the UK government's good faith that the Scotland Bill lives up to both the spirit and the letter of the Smith Commission.
"The Scottish government has already set out the shortcomings of the draft legislation published in January, and submitted detailed amendments to the UK government to bring their original proposals into line with Smith, so there can be no excuse."
New powers
Conservative leader David Cameron pledged to give more powers to Scotland within 100 days of winning the election.
It is expected the Scotland Bill will be based on draft legislation published by the coalition government in January, following recommendations by the Smith Commission.
New powers will include:
setting income tax rates and bands
controlling a proportion of VAT raised in Scotland
fully controlling air passenger duty
creating new benefits in devolved areas and making discretionary welfare payments
managing the assets of the Crown Estate.
David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon discussed further powers for Scotland at a meeting at Bute House following the general election
In addition, the Scottish Parliament has already been given the power to extend voting to 16 and 17 year olds in time for the 2016 Scottish Parliamentary elections.
Ian Murray, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, said his party would ensure the Scotland Bill implemented the "Vow" made by the pro-Union parties during the referendum campaign.
He said: "This bill is a serious offer of more power to Scotland, and Scottish Labour will work constructively to push the Tories to deliver the power to the Scottish Parliament to defend Scotland against further austerity.
"But the threats to Scots don't end with the Tories. Nicola Sturgeon has committed her party to amending the Scotland Bill to include full fiscal autonomy, which would mean an end to the Barnett Formula and an additional 7.6bn of cuts to the Scottish budget."
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said a full commitment to the Smith Agreement must be part of the Queen's Speech.
He said: "David Cameron must put the more powers for Scotland agreed by the five-party Smith Commission front and centre of his Queen's speech today.
"It must be delivered in full. No ifs, no buts.
"That commitment will give confidence that Scotland is moving towards the stable, lasting change voted for by the majority of Scots at last year's historic referendum.
"Scottish Liberal Democrats will continue to argue for both governments to honour Scotland's desire for meaningful constitutional reform - pushing democracy back down into local communities and beyond."
The Queen's Speech will be broadcast on Democracy Live from 11:00 BST on Wednesday 27 May.

        <MainBody>MSPs to vote on Assisted Suicide Scotland bill
27 May 2015
From the section Scotland politics
Supporters said the plan had widespread public backing, but critics have argued the bill is unethical
MSPs are to vote on the Assisted Suicide Scotland Bill as the legislation is debated at Holyrood.
The bill, which would allow those with terminal illnesses to end their own life, could fail if it does not secure enough votes at this stage.
Supporters said the plan had widespread public backing but critics have argued a change in the law would be unethical.
The Scottish government does not support a change in the law, but MSPs will be given a free vote.
The Assisted Suicide Bill would give people whose lives have become intolerable through a progressive degenerative condition or terminal illness the right to seek the help of a doctor to help end their lives.
The legislation says the final act must be carried out by the person seeking to end their own life.
It was originally brought forward by the late independent MSP Margo MacDonald, who died last year after a long battle with Parkinson's disease .
It is now being championed by Mr Harvie, who said he gave a commitment to Ms MacDonald to present this bill as best he could to parliament.
The bill was brought forward by Green MSP Patrick Harvie who said there was a compelling case for a change in the law
A Holyrood committee recently concluded that the bill contained "significant flaws" and opposed its general principles, but said the full parliament should decide whether or not to throw out the proposed legislation.
Mr Harvie said he hoped the Stage 1 debate would be conducted with respect.
He said: "Public opinion is clearly of the view that people should have the right to make their own choice if they find themselves faced with an illness or condition which leaves them with a quality of life they find unacceptable and from which they have no prospect of improvement.
"I have responded in detail to the committee's concerns and reiterated my willingness to consider constructive amendments to improve the bill.
"I would appeal to MSPs who support the basic argument, and to those who agree that a need exists to address the lack of clarity in the current law, to support the bill at Stage 1 and allow the debate to continue."
Assisted suicide - the legal position
It is not illegal to attempt suicide in Scotland, but helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution.
In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt, which is almost identical to the situation in Northern Ireland.
The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has to approve any assisted suicide court action in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In 2010, Keir Starmer, then the DPP, issued guidance that made it clear that family or friends who travelled with a loved one to the Swiss suicide group Dignitas would not risk prosecution.
The guidelines were the result of a case brought by Debbie Purdy, a terminally ill woman, who in 2009 won a legal ruling requiring the DPP to set out whether her husband would be committing an offence if he accompanied her to Dignitas to end her life.
Scotland's prosecution service, the Crown Office, has issued no such guidance.
Assisted suicide is legal in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium as well as Switzerland.
Campaigners who back the bill, including representatives of the My Life, My Death, My Choice campaign, will gather outside the Scottish Parliament to urge MSPs to support the general principles of the legislation.
But a number of organisations, including the Law Society of Scotland, Church of Scotland, Council of Imams Scotland and the Christian charity Care for Scotland, have raised objections.
Alison Britton, convener of the Law Society's health and medical law committee, said she was concerned the law lacked clarity.
She said: "We have said throughout the passage of this bill that legislation in this area needs to be absolutely clear and those seeking to end their lives, and those who assist them, need a robust and transparent process to be certain under which conditions it would be lawful for assistance to be provided.
"We remain concerned over the lack of definition of the key terms, such as "assistance" and "life-shortening" and the functions of the licensed facilitator are still uncertain.
"Lack of such clarity leads to ambiguity and leaves the legislation open to interpretation."
And the Church of Scotland urged MSPs to do more to improve end-of-life care instead of backing the bill.
Public attitudes
In a letter, Rev Sally Foster-Fulton, convenor of the Kirk's Church and Society Council, wrote: "We believe that this bill represents much more than simply a tinkering with the law, breaching as it does the societal prohibition on the taking of human life.
"It carries implications for the whole of society, not just for those who will seek assisted death, and for attitudes to many aspects of health and social care."
Margo MacDonald launched the bill before her death last year
Assisted Suicide Bill - key measures
Only those who are terminally ill or who are suffering from deteriorating progressive conditions which make life intolerable can seek assisted suicide
An "early warning" aspect, whereby anyone over the age of 16 can inform their GP of their support in principle for assisted suicide
The indication can be noted in the person's medical records, but must be stated at least seven days before they can formally request help to end their life
Any requests to GPs must be backed up by a second professional opinion, and followed by a 14-day "cooling off" period
The process is then repeated again with a second request, after which one of the doctors concerned supplies a licensed facilitator with a prescription to enable assisted suicide to take place
The facilitator, or "friend at the end", has no relationship with the patient and is given the task of collecting the prescription and agreeing the process of assisted suicide
If the prescription is not used within 14 days, it must be returned to the chemist
In 2010, a similar piece of legislation was defeated by 85 votes to 16, with two abstentions , by MSPs who were allowed a free vote on the proposals, rather than on party lines.
You can watch the full debate on Democracy Live From 2.45pm, Wednesday 27 May.

        <MainBody>Gun used in IRA man Gerard 'Jock' Davison's murder 'extremely rare'
26 May 2015
From the section Northern Ireland
Gerard 'Jock' Davison was shot dead in the Markets area of Belfast
A handgun used in the murder of a senior IRA man in Belfast was "extremely rare" and came from eastern Europe, police have said.
Gerard 'Jock' Davison, 47, was shot dead at Welsh Street, in the Markets area at 09:09 BST on Tuesday 5 May.
A gunman shot him from behind before standing over him and shooting him four more times in the head.
A senior police officer told the BBC Crimewatch programme that the gun and bullets were unusual.
The gun used in the killing was a Makarov from eastern Europe
"The weapon and bullets used were an eastern European type called Makarov," Det Supt Kevin Geddes said on the programme.
"These 9mm bullets are unusual in as much as they will not work in most types of western handgun.
"They are a slightly different size and can only be fired using a Makarov type gun.
"This type of weapon and ammunition are extremely rare in Northern Ireland."
Witnesses to the shooting said the gunman was 5ft 6in tall and was wearing a dark, hooded rain jacket. He escaped up an alleyway towards Stanfield Place.
"We need to know where he went next. We are also issuing a photo of a similar type jacket in the hope this may jog someone's memory," Det Supt Geddes said.
Police believe the gunman may have been standing at the junction of Welsh Street and McAuley Street shortly before the shooting.
A man was also seen with a red and white carrier bag, holding it with two hands on Welsh Street.
Police also appealed to anyone who parked a car in the Markets area between 08:00 BST and 09:00 BST on that Tuesday, and then walked to work, to contact them.
Police have said they do not believe dissident republicans were behind the attack, and do not believe Mr Davison's murder was sectarian.
So far, three people have been arrested over the murder, but all of them have been released without charge.
It is understood Mr Davison was involved in the fight in a Belfast bar in January 2005 that led to the death of Robert McCartney. It was one of Northern Ireland's most high profile killings.
Mr Davison's uncle, Terence, was later acquitted of Mr McCartney's murder.
Crimewatch was broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Tuesday at 21:00 BST and is available on BBC iPlayer

        <MainBody>Man gets life for murder of Finbar McGrillen and Caron Smyth
26 May 2015
From the section Northern Ireland
Mr McGrillen, 42, and Ms Smyth, 40, were found dead at Ravenhill Court, Belfast
A man has been sentenced to life imprisonment after admitting murdering a man and woman in Belfast.
The bodies of Caron Smyth, 40, and Finbar McGrillen, 42, were discovered in Mr McGrillen's apartment at Ravenhill Court, on 13 December 2013.
Shaun Patrick Joseph Hegarty, 34, and Ciaran Nugent, 33, were charged with murdering Ms Smyth and Mr McGrillen.
Both men denied the charges, but Shaun Hegarty was re-arraigned on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to both murders.
The two men had been due to be tried together at Belfast Crown Court.
Hegarty, formerly of Grainne House in north Belfast, but whose address was given as HMP Maghaberry, was given a life sentence.
The judge informed him that the minimum sentence he will have to serve before being considered eligible for release, will be set at the conclusion of the trial involving co-accused Ciaran Nugent.
Mr Nugent, formerly from the Simon Community in west Belfast, has denied murdering Ms Smyth and Mr McGrillen.
His trial on charges of double murder begins on 27 May.

        <MainBody>Conner Marshall: Man admits murdering teen in Trecco Bay
26 May 2015
From the section South East Wales
A 26-year-old man has pleaded guilty to the "brutal" murder of Vale of Glamorgan teenager Conner Marshall in an attack at a caravan park.
The 18-year-old from Barry died four days after the serious assault at Trecco Bay caravan park in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, on Sunday, 8 March.
Appearing at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday, David James Braddon, 26, from Caerphilly, admitted carrying out the attack.
He will be sentenced on 3 June.
Speaking after the court hearing, Det Ch Insp Kath Pritchard of South Wales Police said: "This was a brutal attack on a teenage boy which has left his family and friends devastated by the incident, and brought shock and sadness to both the visitors of Trecco Bay and also the community of Barry.
"We know incidents like this can cause a great deal of concern and anxiety. The community support has undoubtedly helped us to bring the person responsible for Conner's murder to justice."
Following the fatal attack in March, his family paid tribute to the former Ysgol Bro Morgannwg pupil as "a unique, caring and compassionate young man with a warm, infectious smile complete with a cheeky wink".

        <MainBody>Libya PM 'escapes assassination attempt' in Tobruk
26 May 2015
From the section Africa
Prime Minister al-Thinni is trying to run the country from the eastern city of Tobruk
Libyan Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni says he has survived an assassination attempt by gunmen who attacked his car in the city of Tobruk.
"Thank God, we managed to escape," Mr al-Thinni told TV news channel al-Arabiya after bullets hit his car as it left a parliament session in the city.
A government spokesman said the prime minister escaped unharmed but one of his bodyguards was wounded.
Libya has been in turmoil since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted from power in 2011.
Mr al-Thinni is trying to run the country from Tobruk after being expelled from the capital, Tripoli, by militias in 2014.
His power has been challenged by the establishment of another body in Tripoli that claims to be the legitimate government.
Lawmakers in Tobruk told the Reuters news agency that crowds had gathered outside the parliament building on Tuesday to protest against Mr al-Thinni's rule.
The protesters were said to have set fire to a car outside the building and Mr al-Thinni was reportedly told by parliamentary speaker Aqila Saleh to leave for his own safety.
Prime Minister al-Thinni has struggled to stamp his authority on the fragmented country since coming to power in March 2014.
His government had originally planned to set up parliament in the eastern city of Benghazi but was forced to relocate to Tobruk after heavy fighting between government forces and Islamist militias.
Those militias have established a strong presence in the country over the last two years and some militants have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group.

        <MainBody>Nigeria's Boko Haram 'increases' suicide attacks
26 May 2015
From the section Africa
Suspicion exists that some of the girls are duped into carrying explosives
The UN children's agency says there has been an "alarming" increase in the number of suicide attacks in northern Nigeria, with many of them involving women and children.
There had been 27 attacks so far this year, compared with 26 for the whole of last year, Unicef said in a statement .
Three-quarters of the attacks were carried out by female bombers, some as young as seven, it added.
Militant Islamist group Boko Haram is waging an insurgency in Nigeria.
BBC Nigeria analyst Naziru Mikailu says Boko Haram may be increasingly resorting to suicide attacks, following its loss of territory to regional forces.
'Exploited'
Nigeria's army said in March that it had recaptured all cities and towns from the group, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State militants fighting for a global caliphate.
Unicef said it did not believe that the girls carried out the bombings willingly.
The insurgency has left about 1.5 million people homeless
"Children are not instigating these suicide attacks; they are used intentionally by adults in the most horrific way," it said. "They are first and foremost victims - not perpetrators."
Some of the girls had been abducted and were being exploited by militants who knew that they were less likely to be checked when entering target areas such as busy markets or bus stations, the statement added.
Our correspondent says there is suspicion that some girls are duped into being bombers, thinking they are carrying parcels when they are, in fact, explosives.
More than 15,500 people have been killed during the six-year insurgency.
About 1.5 million people have been displaced and hundreds more abducted by Boko Haram.
Earlier this month, the military rescued nearly 300 women and children who were being held by the group in its forest hideout in north-eastern Nigeria.
Among those still being held captive are 219 girls who were taken from their boarding school in Chibok town in April 2014, sparking global outrage.

        <MainBody>Gunfire and explosions hit Kabul guesthouse
27 May 2015
From the section Asia
Police reportedly shot out street lights to cover their movements
Gunmen have tried to storm a guesthouse in a diplomatic area of the Afghan capital, Kabul, police say.
At least a dozen explosions were heard in one hour in the Wazir Akbar Khan district, that is home to several embassies and government buildings.
Police reportedly said that the attackers were surrounded after trying to enter the guesthouse.
Gunfire and explosions early on Wednesday morning continued to be heard several hours after the attack began.
No group has said it carried out the attack, although a tweet purportedly sent by the Taliban said that the attack is part of the group's spring and summer offensive.
Police are reported to have surrounded the attackers
Police have smashed street lights in the area of the attack to cover their movements in the dark
"We have surrounded the area and cornered them [the attackers]," Kabul police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi told the AFP news agency, adding that no casualties have been reported.
"The attackers wanted to get into Heetal Hotel but failed. They have now taken position among the trees behind the hotel and are firing at security forces."
The hotel manager told AFP that all guests were in safe rooms and no one was hurt.
"Heetal is very well fortified. After one or two initial explosions, our guards started firing on attackers who were unable to get inside," the manager was quoted as saying from a telephone from inside the guesthouse.
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder, in Kabul, said he had heard " sustained explosions, small arms fire and also the sound of grenades ".
The Associated Press said the attack began shortly before 23:00 (18:30 GMT) and that police were later seen smashing street lights to cover their movements in the dark.
Afghanistan's interior ministry told the BBC that the target was the former Heetal guesthouse, that was targeted by the Taliban in December 2009 and is now officially known as the Rabbani Guesthouse.
It is owned by the Rabbani family, including Afghanistan's current Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani, and its former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani.
The guesthouse is popular with foreigners, AP said.
Reports by witnesses on social media said that the fighting was close to the Tajik embassy and Street 15 in the Wazir Akbar Khan district.
While the area is popular with foreign workers and also houses government employees, it has been subject to several high-profile attacks in recent years, most notably in the Taverna du Liban restaurant last year .
In recent weeks, a new wave of attacks by the Taliban has targeted foreigners in Kabul.
Two weeks ago, 14 people were killed as they waited to attend a concert in a guesthouse in Kabul.
The Taliban said it carried out that attack.
With the Taliban's traditional summer offensive under way, the UN says the number of civilians killed and injured across Afghanistan stands at nearly 3,000 over the first four months of the year, up 16% on the same period last year.

        <MainBody>Asia migrant crisis: Malaysia exhumes mass graves
26 May 2015
From the section Asia
A senior Malaysian police official said there were graves "all over this area"
Malaysia has begun exhuming bodies suspected to be migrants buried in 139 grave sites close to the Thai border.
Authorities believe the migrants were held for ransom in jungle camps by gangs of human traffickers.
Thousands of migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar have left for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia in recent weeks.
Thailand has offered a "floating naval base" to help migrants stranded at sea but said only those needing serious medical treatment will be taken ashore.
Meanwhile, authorities in Myanmar have charged 20 people with offences related to human trafficking. They were arrested from a vessel carrying 200 migrants from Bangladesh that was rescued last week.
'Shocking cruelty'
On Tuesday, Malaysian police teams began sifting through a series of camps found in the jungle near the country's border with Thailand.
Some migrants were apparently held in "human cages" made of wood and barbed wire at the camps, which officials believe were only abandoned recently.
Malaysian national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said there were signs that torture had been used, but he did not elaborate. "We were shocked by the cruelty," he told reporters.
The discovery of the camps in Malaysia followed the uncovering of similar graves on the Thai side of the border at the beginning of May.
After those graves were found, Thailand began cracking down on the routes used by traffickers to move Bangladeshi migrants and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar through its territory.

Migrants have been given temporary shelter in Malaysia and Indonesia - but not in Thailand
The migrants, who want to reach Malaysia, were instead being sent by sea, but thousands were left drifting as no country wanted to take them in.
The UN's refugee agency says about 3,000 people have now reached land, but estimates another 2,600 may still be out at sea.
Last week, Malaysia and Indonesia agreed to stop rejecting boats and to provide temporary shelter to the migrants.
But while Thailand said it would stop towing boats away from its territory, it said it would not take in migrants.
If anyone is injured or sick, they can be treated at hospitals in Thailand but will face illegal entry charges - it is up to them to decide
Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thai prime minister
Facing international pressure to do more, Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said this week that the country would establish a "floating naval base" to help migrants.
But this seems like an attempt to keep the boats at arms' length rather than a display of genuine desire to help the migrants, according to the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok.
A total of seven ships, two surveillance aircraft and two helicopters are involved in the Thai operation in the Andaman Sea - but only migrants with serious medical needs will be taken to land, where they will be considered illegal arrivals.
"If anyone is injured or sick, they can be treated at hospitals in Thailand but will face illegal entry charges - it is up to them to decide," he said.
Thailand has also agreed to allow US navy aircraft searching for migrants to operate from its bases after refusing a US request last week - but only if they do so under Thai military command.
Thailand is due to host a regional meeting on Friday to discuss the crisis.
Asia's migrant crisis
Rohingya Muslims mainly live in Myanmar, where they have faced decades of persecution.
Rights groups say migrants feel they have "no choice" but to leave, paying people smugglers to help them.
The UN estimates more than 120,000 Rohingyas have fled in the past three years.
Traffickers usually take the migrants by sea to Thailand then overland to Malaysia.
But Thailand recently began cracking down on the migrant routes, meaning traffickers are using sea routes instead often abandoning the boats once at sea.

        <MainBody>Austria boy guilty of Vienna terror plot
26 May 2015
From the section Europe
The boy was placed in detention earlier this year after breaking the terms of his bail
A 14-year-old boy has been convicted of terrorism offences in Austria, including a potential plot to bomb a railway station in the capital, Vienna.
The court sentenced him to a minimum of eight months in detention with another 16 months of his sentence suspended.
Born in Turkey, he had been in Austria since 2007 and was arrested in October.
Prosecutors said he had contact with supporters of Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, with the aim of going to fight in Syria.
The boy had been facing up to five years in custody and prosecutors said they would decide in the coming days whether to accept the decision.
Austria, like several other European countries, has struggled to stop the recruitment of teenagers by IS. A 16-year-old girl was facing charges in Vienna on Tuesday of supporting IS.
Islamist propaganda
The boy's lawyer said that probation officials had made his client realise he had been the victim of propaganda
The boy, due to turn 15 shortly, was accused of having ties to terrorist groups and obtaining instructions on how to make an explosive device.
Before the trial began behind closed doors in the town of St Poelten, west of Vienna, his lawyer Rudolf Mayer told reporters his client would plead guilty.
According to Austrian media, his mother had tried to prevent him from being lured by Islamist propaganda, sending him away to his uncle in Germany last year.
But he was arrested last October, when police said he had looked into buying chemicals for a bomb to be detonated in public places such as Vienna's Westbahnhof station.
He was eventually released but returned to custody earlier this year after he broke his bail conditions and tried to recruit a 12-year-old.
Originally from a Turkish Alevi family, he was brought up by his mother after his parents divorced.
Prosecutors said the boy had shown no remorse for his actions. However, his lawyer said he was cautiously optimistic that the child had understood he had been targeted by propaganda.

        <MainBody>French farmer on trial for killing 'truffle thief'
26 May 2015
From the section Europe
Laurent Rambaud said he was surprised by the intruder and feared for his life
A French farmer has gone on trial over the killing of a suspected truffle thief on his land.
Laurent Rambaud, 37, says he felt threatened when he found Ernest Pardo, 42, and a dog while guarding his farm in south-eastern France in 2010.
He shot Mr Pardo, known to sell truffles at local markets, with two blasts from a pump-action shotgun.
Truffles are a prized delicacy in French cuisine, fetching up to $1,000 (708) per kilogram (2.2 lb).
The killing, in the small town of Grignan, came days before Christmas, with the truffle harvest underway and demand for the luxury fungus at its peak.
'Ordinary man'
With prices high, truffles have long been tempting for thieves - police have even resorted to micro-chipping batches as a deterrent .
Mr Rambaud is a well-known local figure, who has been president of his regional branch of Young Farmers, and worked as a volunteer firefighter.
"This is an ordinary man who committed an extraordinary act," the psychiatrist who examined him told the trial in Valence, Le Dauphine reported (in French).
The lawyer for Mr Pardo's family contested Mr Rambaud's version of events, saying "it's not normal to go in made-up, dressed in camouflage, armed to the teeth, and to fire twice", according to French newspaper 20 Minutes .
The charge against Mr Rambaud has been reduced from murder to manslaughter after the court decided the killing was not premeditated.
If convicted, Mr Rambaud faces 30 years in jail. The verdict is expected later this week.

        <MainBody>Texas floods: Three dead in Houston after severe storms
26 May 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
At least three people have died in the Houston area after major flooding and tornadoes swept across the southern US over the weekend.
At least 16 people in Oklahoma and Texas were killed and dozens of people were missing after the record rainfall.
Heavy rains continued to fall on the area on Tuesday afternoon.
Houston - the US's fourth most populous city - was under water in many parts on Tuesday, with thousands of cars abandoned on city streets and highways.
Thousands of residents have been displaced and over 1,000 homes were destroyed.
On Tuesday morning, Houston's highways were still flooded, making driving impossible for residents.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency in 24 counties in Texas.
The effects of the massive storms were also felt near the Texas border in Mexico.
On Monday, at least 14 people - including an infant - were killed by a tornado that hit the northern Mexico border city of Acuna.
Mexican authorities said that more than 1,000 homes were damaged by the storm.
Thousands of vehicles were left stranded on Interstate 45 in Houston.
Houston's public transport services were suspended and many residents of Houston were told to stay home from work and school.
More than 11 inches of rain fell overnight on Monday and into Tuesday morning.
Fire fighters have carried out more than 500 water rescues of mostly stranded motorists.
Houston Mayor Annise Parker said at the news conference that many parts of Houston were not as badly affected by the storm, but she urged people to stay inside and not seek out the floodwaters for photos.
"We urge folks not to go out looking for floodwaters...we urge people to people to continue to be safe. The worst thing that's happened is a loss of life," she said.
Alyssa Renee Ramirez, 18, in a photo posted to Instagram by her sister
One victim of the floods was Alyssa Ramirez, an 18-year-old from Devine, Texas, who was driving home from her school prom, where she had just been named prom queen.
Barricades were not being used on the road Ms Ramirez was driving home on after prom, News 4 San Antonio reported.
Ms Ramirez called 911 and tried to escape,  but the floodwaters came too fast and too heavy. Crews found Ms Ramirez and her car Monday morning.
The McComb family was vacationing in central Texas when the storm hit
A home was swept away in Wimberley, Texas, where teams are searching for 12 members of two families.
The families are missing after a rain-swollen river in central Texas swept their vacation home off its foundation and slammed it into a bridge downstream.
"We are floating in a house that is now floating down the river", one missing family member Laura McComb told her sister Julie Shields on Saturday night, according to local TV station KXAN. "Call mom and dad. I love you, and pray".
Laura's husband Jonathan McComb escaped the floodwaters, his father Joe McComb told the Washington Post. Laura McComb and her two children are still missing.
Thousands of cars were abandoned on highways
Problems continued elsewhere in Texas as Dallas-Fort Worth airport was forced to close a runway when a sinkhole was reported.
The airport confirmed the closure on Twitter , and said the sinkhole was not on the runway but in a "safety area".
Texas often experiences long periods of drought, despite heavy rainfall at times.
As of the week of 19 May, areas in central Texas were experiencing abnormal to severe levels of drought, with 795,851 residents affected, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Pasquale Scotti was arrested while taking his children to school
An Italian organised crime boss convicted for more than 20 murders has been caught in Brazil after 31 years on the run.
Pasquale Scotti - a leading member of the Camorra, a Naples-based mafia-style crime gang - escaped from an Italian hospital in 1984.
He was found in the Brazilian city of Recife, and police said his fingerprints confirmed his identity.
He is now expected to be extradited to Italy in the next few days.
Scotti had evaded police since escaping from hospital, where he was being treated after a shoot-out with police.
Scotti was convicted for extortion, murder and firearms offences committed between 1980 and 1983. In his absence, he received a life sentence, and a warrant for his arrest was issued in Italy in 1991.
However, many reports - based on evidence given by a former Camorra associate of Scotti - said he had died soon after his escape in 1984.
According to Italy's Interior Ministry, Scotti was arrested in Recife in an operation that brought together officers from Naples' police, Italian anti-mafia officers, Brazilian police and Interpol.
Reports in Brazil said Scotti, 56, was held while driving his two children, aged 12 and 15, to school. He was reportedly using the pseudonym Francisco de Castro Visconti , owned a food import company and was a partner in a nightclub.
Brazilian police said Scotti had fake identification and was even registered to vote in Recife.

        <MainBody>Iran trial for Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian starts
26 May 2015
From the section Middle East
Jason Rezaian has been in custody in Iran for 10 months
The trial of a Washington Post journalist detained in Iran for almost 10 months on charges that include "espionage" has opened in the capital Tehran behind closed doors.
Jason Rezaian, a dual US-Iranian citizen, has been accused of passing information to "hostile governments".
He defended himself in court, saying he had carried out his activities as a journalist, Iranian media reported.
Mr Rezaian could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
He is being tried in one of Tehran's revolutionary courts, usually reserved for political cases or those related to national security.
Mr Rezaian appeared in court alongside his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and a third detainee, reported to be a female photojournalist.
The judge, Abolghassem Salavati, outlined the charges against Mr Rezaian as "espionage through collecting classified information and providing it to hostile governments" and "spreading propaganda against the regime", Iran's Mehr news agency reported.
Mr Rezaian rejected some of the charges, Mehr reported, saying: "I am a journalist and I carried out all my activities legally and as a journalist."
The presiding judge: Abolghassem Salavati
The presiding judge, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for handing down harsh sentences and is accused by human rights groups of cracking down on journalists and activists.
He has been dubbed the "judge of death" for imposing several death sentences after the 2009 post-election opposition protests.
He first came to public attention in 2006 when he sentenced two defendants to death for the murder of Hassan Moghadas, the Revolutionary Court judge who sentenced a prominent journalist - Akbar Ganji - to 15 years in jail.
Since then, Mr Salavati has presided over or sat in the trials of several prominent political figures, including a daughter of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
In January 2009, he found four people guilty of conspiring with the US government against Iran in their work on an HIV prevention programme.
In September 2014, Mr Salavati sentenced Mohsen Amir-Aslani to death for heresy for his interpretation of the Jonah and the Whale story as a symbolic tale.
The US State Department repeated its call for the "absurd charges" to be dropped.
Iran has not recently commented on the case, but the Washington Post has spoken out forcefully.
"The shameful acts of injustice continue without end in the treatment of [Mr] Rezaian," a statement by the newspaper's Executive Editor Martin Baron said on Monday .
"Now we learn his trial will be closed to the world. And so it will be closed to the scrutiny it fully deserves.
"There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance."
Both Mr Rezaian (right) and his wife Yeganeh (left) face criminal charges
The paper points out that Mr Rezaian was arrested without charge and jailed in Iran's notorious Evin prison - placed in isolation for many months and denied medical care he needed.
His brother, Ali, meanwhile told the BBC there was no evidence to support the charges: "They've cherry-picked information to come up with whatever they could to charge him with to make it seem like there was a reason that they've held him."
Sensitive timing
The BBC's US state department correspondent, Barbara Plett Usher, says US officials have repeatedly raised his case during months of nuclear negotiations with Iran, but have declined to link the two.
The imprisoned journalist's family have taken heart from recent comments by President Barack Obama, who said that the White House would not rest until Mr Rezaian was brought home safely, our correspondent adds.
Mr Rezaian's case was referred to a revolutionary court in Tehran
The case is all the more sensitive because it has unfolded during negotiations between Iran and the West over the country's nuclear programme.
Some analysts have suggested the arrest was related to internal power struggles in Iran over the outcome of the talks.
Iran and six major world powers, including the US, have set a 30 June deadline for a conclusive nuclear deal to end a 10-year impasse.
Mr Rezaian had been the Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief since 2012.
His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, was arrested alongside him in July but later bailed after spending two and a half months in custody.
It is not clear when the next trial session will be held.

        <MainBody>Yemen conflict: Rebels 'driven out of southern city'
26 May 2015
From the section Middle East
The UN says two months of fighting and air strikes have left more than 1,000 civilians dead
Militiamen allied to Yemen's exiled government are reported to have driven Houthi rebels out of a southern city.
Southern separatist fighters and Sunni tribesmen had regained control of Dhalea following heavy fighting on Monday, officials and residents said.
It is the first major advance by the Houthis' opponents since Saudi-led coalition air strikes began in March.
Overnight, seven members of the same family were said to have been killed in an air strike in a northern village.
Residents of al-Mohssam, which is close to the border with Saudi Arabia, told the Reuters news agency that two children were among those who died.
Cross-border clashes were also reported after medics said one person was killed by suspected Houthi shellfire that targeted the Saudi city of Najran on Monday.
Journalists killed
The Houthis and army units loyal to Yemen's former leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, took control of Dhalea last month as they advanced southwards after overrunning the capital Sanaa in September.
Thirteen people were killed when a lorry carrying oil was hit by crossfire in Taiz on Monday
But on Tuesday, residents said that militiamen and tribesmen allied to exiled President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi had regained full control of Dhalea, a day after seizing the main security headquarters and strategic mountaintop buildings.
The pro-government fighters had also managed to capture the base of the 33rd Armoured Brigade, which is loyal to Mr Saleh, and seize large caches of weapons and ammunition, armoured vehicles, and Katyusha rocket launchers, officials told the Associated Press.
"The whole city of Dhalea is now under the control of the Popular Resistance Committees," local tribal chief Saleh al-Mansub told the AFP news agency, referring to an umbrella group of southern factions.
Pro-government forces also made advances near the Houthi-controlled al-Anad military base, outside the southern city of Aden on Tuesday, residents told the Reuters news agency.
Saudi-led coalition aircraft also reportedly carried out up to 18 air strikes on Houthi positions in the Khor Maksar and Crater areas near the port, they added.
Saudi-led coalition air strikes had until now failed to halt the rebels' advance in the south
President Hadi took refuge in Aden after escaping house arrest in Sanaa in February, but he fled to Saudi Arabia at the end of March as the Houthis and their allies advanced on the city.
Yemen's journalists' union meanwhile said that two reporters detained by the Houthis had been killed in an air strike on a military base, and accused the rebels of "premeditated murder", AFP reported.
The UN says two months of fighting and air strikes have left at least 1,037 civilians dead, including 130 women and 234 children, and displaced half a million others.
There has also been massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, and a sea and air blockade has caused severe shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel.
The humanitarian charity Oxfam warned on Tuesday that at least 16 million people, or two thirds of the population, had no access to clean drinking water.

        <MainBody>Cleveland police department agrees to carry out federal reforms
26 May 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
Protesters took the streets of Cleveland over the weekend after a police officer was acquitted in a manslaughter case
The Cleveland police department, which has been criticised for aggressive tactics against African Americans, has agreed to strict federal reforms.
Mayor Frank Jackson said on Tuesday that the police will adhere to the most exacting standards in the US.
The US Department of Justice settlement comes after a series of cases where officers killed unarmed people.
The rules prohibit officers from using force against people for talking back or as punishment for running away.
Pistol whipping is prohibited, as is firing warning shots, the agreement says.
An independent monitor will track the police department's progress.
The department will be required to collect data on use-of-force incidents, will be banned from neck holds, and won't be able to use Tasers targeting head, neck or genitalia.
Officers will also undergo mental health consultations.
Tamir Rice, 12, was killed by police after officers mistook his toy gun for a real one
The windshield of Timothy Russell's car was used as evidence in the trial of Cleveland police officer Michael Brelo
If the city does not carry out the terms of the settlement, known as a consent decree, a federal judge has the authority to demand them.
Mr Jackson said all police officers will have body cameras by the end of 2015.
The DOJ report does not lay out this specific goal about body cameras but states that the department will arrange for 'body-worn camera video downloads.'
Cleveland's police force most recently came under criticism in November 2014, when an officer fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice after mistaking his toy gun for a real one.
The caller who contacted police that day told them the gun was "probably fake".
Cleveland police are still investigating Rice's death.
Protesters took the streets after a judge acquitted white police officer Michael Brelo on 2012 charges of voluntary manslaughter of Malissa Williams and Timothy Russell, two black people.
Mr Brelo fired multiple rounds into the car Williams and Russell were in after police chased the car.
The Cleveland Police Department will now be subject to strict federal oversight
Just after Rice's death, federal investigators released a report on harsh and abusive police practices in Cleveland.
In another case, 37-year-old Tanisha Anderson, who had a heart condition and bipolar disorder, died in Cleveland police custody when she was handcuffed and restrained in prone position.
More than 71 people were arrested in Cleveland over the weekend during mostly peaceful protests.
"Today marks a new way of policing in the city of Cleveland, one built on a strong foundation of systemic change," Mr Jackson said of the agreement with the DOJ.
The agreement comes on the heels of racial tensions and police-involved shooting deaths of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Maryland, Eric Garner in New York City and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
Baltimore and Ferguson's police departments have also came under close scrutiny of the Department of Justice.

        <MainBody>US court backs hold on Obama immigration action
26 May 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
President Obama announced the unilateral action in November last year
A US court has backed a temporary hold on President Barack Obama's plans to shield almost five million illegal immigrants from deportation.
The hold was imposed after 26 states launched a legal challenge against the executive action, alleging it was unconstitutional.
An appeals court has now denied a government request to overturn it.
The White House said the action was essential to fix a "broken immigration system".
Under the plans, announced last year, people who entered the US illegally as children and parents of children who are US citizens would be offered temporary protection from deportation.
Aside from arguing President Obama acted outside his authority, the states say the move forces them to invest more in law enforcement, health care and education.
The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling keeps the plans on hold while the states' legal challenge proceeds.
It is not clear yet whether the Obama administration will appeal.
The White House said the president acted within his powers to fix a "broken immigration system".
The Justice Department has argued that immigration policy is for the federal government to determine, not the states.
The department is now evaluating its next steps, a US official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity.
The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who has been a persistent critic of the president's immigration policies, tweeted : "The constitution wins".

        <MainBody>Eurovision Song Contest 2015: In pictures
24 May 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
The 60th anniversary Eurovision Song Contest, which was watched by 10,000 people in Vienna's Stadthalle and a further 200 million on TV, was a typically colourful night.
Sweden's Mans Zelmerlow celebrated winning this year's contest with his song Heroes. It is the sixth time Sweden has won the competition.
Zelmerlow's performance included the clever use of animations projected on the stage, helping him to amass a total of 365 points.
Dozens of Swedish fans cheered on their compatriot in the Austrian capital.
The show was hosted by Alice Tumler, Mirjam Weichselbraun, Arabella Kiesbauer and last year's winner, Conchita Wurst.
Guy Sebastian represented Australia, which was invited to participate to celebrate Eurovision's 60th anniversary. He finished in a respectable fifth position with 196 points.
It was an emotional night for Russia's Polina Gagarina, who ended up in second place after leading the field for a time.
Italian pop opera trio Il Volo were among the fan favourites going into the competition and finished third.
Latvia surprised many commentators, with Aminata's Love Injected finishing sixth.
Lithuania's Monika Linkyte and Vaidas Baumila (left) and their backing dancers created one of the memorable moments with a performance that included a three-second kiss.
Serbia's Bojana Stamenov lifted the crowd with her pop anthem Beauty Never Lies. The song had been expected to do well after the semi-finals, but finished 10th.
Despite their elaborate staging and light-up costumes, UK entry Electro Velvet were awarded a total of just five points from Malta, Ireland and San Marino.
Germany's Ann Sophie looked glum during the voting and failed to score any points - the first time a country has received the infamous "nil points" since 2003.
There was disappointment too for the home country's entry The Makemakes, who also failed to pick up a single point.

        <MainBody>In pictures: Women of Hargeisa
22 May 2015
From the section In Pictures
Photographer Alison Baskerville has recently returned from Hargeisa, in Somaliland. While there, she was struck by the women she met - from those working in the hospital, to others who have built their own businesses.
Edna Adan Ismail is known as the First Lady of Somalia and was a government minister when Somaliland declared independence in 1991 - a move that has not been internationally recognised. She went on to become Somaliland's foreign minister and then in 2002 founded the Edna Adan University Hospital, the only maternity teaching hospital in the territory.
She has also been a fervent campaigner against female genital mutilation and currently runs an awareness campaign across the country.
The outpatients service now has about 15,000 women on its register, so training new midwives is essential to keep this service going. The service also records whether those registered have been "cut".
Specialist care can be provided as international surgeons volunteer to spend time in the hospital. The hospital has operated on nearly 200 children suffering from hydrocephalus  or "fluid on the brain".
The hospital also treats other conditions, such as cleft palate. A visiting maxillofacial surgeon is on hand every six weeks, and these operations are performed free of charge.
Away from the hospital, Baskerville photographed a wedding. She said: "In public, women will be covered from head to foot in traditional clothing. However, behind closed doors, the women have a chance to wear bright clothing and to show off their elaborate hairstyles and make-up."
Baskerville also pictured women starting their own businesses in Hargeisa, including Sara Haji, who has opened an Italian coffee house.
Ms Haji has faced some resistance to the project, known as the Cup of Art, she said: "The prejudice is pushing me to try harder and fight back.
"I want to push social barriers.
"I came back to Somaliland as this is my spiritual home, but I was tired of the bad coffee.
"So my brother Khamal and I decided to do something about it."
"We like the decor and the music," said two of her customers, Mona and Layla.
"We are working out our business plan to open our own beauticians.
"We can relax more here, and it's nice to be able to wear our jeans under our clothes."
Tucked away in the Jiga Yar district of the city, the Royal Lounge backs on to a more affluent area.
Used by local businessmen and their families, the restaurant is the creation of a single mother of five, Sagal Olad.
"I built this place brick by brick," she said.
"It was hard to get men to listen to me, especially those that I employ - but after months of work we made our own little palace in the city."
Born in Mogadishu and raised in London, Ms Olad helped her mother raise her six siblings.
"We were always stared at on the bus, no-one had really seen Somalis in the 90s in London," she said.
"I realised I wanted to do more with my life and be a good example to my kids, so I left for Hargeisa to start out on my own."
The images are to be exhibited as part of Women of the World festival in Hargeisa in July.

At first glance, these images look like model soldiers in a manufactured landscape, lined up and ready for battle. Yet, look again, these are the real thing. Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe's pictures from Western Sahara explore a conflict that has been forgotten, yet has lasted for 40 years, with no sign of a resolution.
Although under the de facto administrative control of Morocco, the status and sovereignty of Western Sahara remains unresolved, with the Polisario Front fighting for independence. Here Brann Thorpe talks about the work, produced in collaboration with a military commander.
Toy Soldiers by Simon Brann Thorpe is published by Dewi Lewis.

        <MainBody>How male and female bathing suits got smaller and smaller
By Paul Kerley BBC News Magazine
22 May 2015
From the section Magazine
Over a century of swimwear is being celebrated in a new exhibition. Things have been getting smaller.
"In the 50s, all young girls aspired to look like their mothers. In the 60s, the big change was the mothers wanted to look like the daughters," quips acclaimed fashion designer David Sassoon.
Now retired, Sassoon - creator of eveningwear for Princess Diana and other members of the Royal Family - is surrounded by colourful top-end beach clothing from the 1920s and 30s.
He is helping put the finishing touches to London's Fashion and Textile Museum's new summer exhibition, Riviera Style, which looks at how resort and swimwear fashions have changed since 1900.
The rules regarding beach etiquette have changed tremendously he says. "Today you can practically walk on a beach with nothing on."
One of the exhibition's curators, Dr Christine Boydell - a design historian from De Montfort University, Leicester - agrees. The changing styles tell you a lot about morality in the past, she says, "what was permissible to show and what wasn't."

At the turn of the 20th Century women wore bathing dresses at the seaside - which were not at all conducive to swimming.
Made from woven wool, they would be heavy and itchy when wet. They covered shoulders and stretched to just above the knee. Matching bloomers would be worn underneath, often with black stockings.
Christine Boydell says for a time bathing corsets would also have been worn underneath - making the whole experience of taking a dip even more uncomfortable.
Men too would also have to be conscious of what was on show.

These red and white stripy stockinette shorts would have lost their shape when wet - so men would have also worn the red pair of pants, known as "athletes", over the top to cover their modesty.
Boydell explains that in the run up to the 20th Century it was really only men who swam - naked on segregated beaches.
But that soon changed - beaches became mixed and there was a need to cover up. And, like women, men were expected to cover their chests.

This men's swimsuit from the 1930s left shoulders uncovered, and pushed etiquette boundaries at the time.
It was knitted - in a tight stitch, similar to that on the round cuffs of modern-day cardigans or jumpers.
The belt was there for a practical reason not just as a style accent, says Boydell. It would stop the garment sagging when wet.

The popularity of beach holidays and day trips - for people from all walks of life - grew between the wars.
In 1900 working class people who visited the seaside would have been fully clothed, says Boydell. The most they could hope to do in the water was have a paddle.

But by the 1930s, as whole factories closed down for a week or fortnight each summer, spending several days by the sea was achievable for more people.
Railway company posters made the UK coast look like the French Riviera.
There would have been sunny days, but these stylised views were perhaps a step or two away from the reality of a blustery day in Scarborough or Bridlington.

Designers and manufacturers realised there was a mass market for beachwear - but they also tried to protect the notion that spending time at the seaside was glamorous and aspirational.
There was a trend for beach pyjamas - which could be worn while taking cocktails in the evening.

By the late 1930s several UK companies were trying to work elastic into fabrics.
Knitted garments lost their shape easily and were not comfy to wear when wet - and in the 1940s and 50s, as fashions changed, there was demand for swimsuits which could show off bodily curves.
This women's swimsuit is made from lastex - a type of satin elastic - with a corset tailored cut.

Designers had to "remember to flatter", says David Sassoon. The costumes could be unforgiving for some body shapes, he adds, "because there are very few places to hide".
"A lot of beachwear is based on corsetry, it has to stay up, stay in shape, stretch and mould."
This black and white image shows so called "telescopic" technology - where elastic was sewn inside swimsuits both horizontally and vertically.
The parallel elastic thread in both directions resulted in ruching.

A licence to use the telescopic technique was taken out by swimwear manufacturer R and W H Symington with the aim, says Christine Boydell, of creating "one size fits all" garments.

Then came another stretchy development - nylon.
Often combined with the telescopic technique, it made garments much lighter and quick to dry.

Swimwear became a factor in the beauty contests of the 50s, 60s and 70s. In 1965, Diana Westbury was crowned Miss Great Britain by comedians Morecambe and Wise in the Lancashire resort of Morecambe.

Rather than have a swimsuit specially-made, as was the usual practice, she bought this ready-made version by R and W H Symington.

The exhibition has an identical one.

Cultural changes in the late 1960s also found their way to beach fashion.
This collection of psychedelic swimsuits, from the R and W H Symington catalogue from the time, were created by New York designer Oleg Cassini.

The colourful bathing hats, adorned with rubbery jewels and flowers, did sell - says Christine Boydell.
"They might look ridiculous now - but they are great fun."

At the start of the 21st Century, swimwear designs are supposed to be "sensual and sexy" - for both women and men.

On show at the museum is a pair of light blue men's trunks sold on the high street by H&amp;M and inspired by those worn by Daniel Craig, as James Bond in Casino Royale in 2006.

And with style there has also been speed.
A century on from the modesty of bloomers and soggy knitted costumes, the ability of swimwear to make us travel faster in water - as well as make us look good - is more important than ever.
These two final costumes were worn at two Summer Olympics.
On the right, the LZR Racer suit developed by Speedo is made from Teflon coated Lycra. It streamlines the body by reducing resistance through the water.  It helped break dozens of swimming records in less than a year - and was eventually banned from competitive swimming after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
On the left, the women's Team GB swimsuit from the 2012 London Games. Made from recycled nylon and spandex, it was designed by Stella McCartney and made by Adidas.
And gradually these types of technological innovations - mixed with a pinch of seaside styling - will eventually find their way to everyday costumes and trunks worn on the beach.

        <title>Photo challenge: 12 by 12</title>

        <Description>Tasks to develop your photo skills</Description>
        <MainBody>From the section In Pictures
When looking for a way to challenge yourself photographically it can pay to scan the online photographic community in search of ideas, or events you can join.
One that is currently under way is the 12 by 12 challenge , a set of month-long photography challenges that aim to help develop your skills.
Each month, a photographer will set you a task, and the first of these this year was set by Vanessa Winship , who asked the group to:
"Take a route you're familiar with but have never photographed along and photograph someone or something every 100 or so steps."
Those taking up the challenge on Flickr or Instagram soon got to work, and here is a selection of entries that caught Winship's eye.
Emma Georgiou
I drive my sons to school 195 days of the year. My route is the same and one I'm very familiar with and yet I have never walked it.
The challenge gave me the opportunity to explore this piece of landscape I drive through, allowing me to discover things that I only normally have a chance to glance at through my car windscreen.
George Hill
I chose this route as I had been working in Shoreditch for the previous couple of weeks but other than that, hadn't visited the area for a while. I was struck by a couple of things - firstly the level of development going on and secondly the disproportional number of barber shops  - but then I guess somebody has to cater for the maintenance of all those 'big' beards.
I really like the area as it still has a feel of grungy subversiveness about it -  this obviously isn't going to be the case for much longer as the place is full of cranes and pile drivers.
Ilya Shtutsa
This shot was taken in the Sennaya Square, St Petersburg, on International Women's Day. On this day, every man thinks it's his sacred duty to give his wife some flowers. The elderly man and woman came to the kiosk and returned not with the usual tulips but instead held in their hands a plant in a pot. It was very touching.
Kathleen Bridget Austin
I love to portray the street, however, I find that most town and city centres are, along with their public audience, now so brand and style-conscious that going back to the indoor and outdoor markets is the best way to reveal a true street theme.
There are many genuine characters and great shooting opportunities reveal themselves amongst the eclectic mix of tat, second-hand, antique and genuinely interesting product stalls. It is the people that make street shots, and the people in these markets are REAL people.
Larry Larsen
I was wandering the streets of Portland and came across great afternoon light. The kind of light that I am always looking to find.
Meredith Wilson
I knew I wanted to use instant film and so I decided to take a walk around my neighbourhood and just take shots along the way. I found I was faced with lots of hedges, brick walls and fences on the first part of the walk. When I looked back through the images later, those barrier shots seemed the most connected, so I decided to explore the idea further.
It was interesting to see the different types of barriers that people put up (or inherited) between their front doors and the rest of the world. I ended up walking around several different streets (always shooting every 100 or so steps) to get the final selection.
I think the narrow framing of the Instax mini film works very well with this series too. It sort of reinforces and contains the idea in a way that other larger instant formats might not.
Michael May
For the brief I chose a route which I was quite familiar with, but had rarely photographed. Normally I use the car or bike to reach my workplace and thus pass interesting places, but this time I took a little bit more time for a walk and went on this alternative trip, discovering a lot of spectacular details.
Paul Castro
I normally drive my girlfriend crazy with my continual stopping to take photos and so the every "100 steps" part of the task, which placed a reasonable limit on my usual distraction, really helped maintain domestic harmony that day.
Paul Marsh
Taken on a very rainy day, I had started walking but soon got very wet. As I got back in the car, the steam from inside, and the rain outside, made for a softening of the image.
If you are interested in this then head over to the 12 by 12 site to see what the current challenge is.  Of course you can also take part in our weekly photo-challenges here on the BBC .

On 24 March 2015, the Treasury Committee heard evidence on the Budget from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, and James Bowler, Director of Strategy, Planning and Budget at HM Treasury.
In the Budget, the last before the general election, the Chancellor unveiled a range of measures.
They included a rise in the tax free allowance to the first 11,000 of earnings by 2017, a tax free allowance on interest earned on savings, and a Help to Buy ISA for people saving up for a deposit on their first house.
During the committee hearing, the Chancellor declined to give a "cast-iron guarantee" to match Labour's promise not to increase VAT over the five years of the next Parliament.
He told the committee that the Tory economic plans did not involve VAT rises.

Ukraine crisis: The town where war still rages on
26 May 2015 Last updated at 23:24 BST
The conflict in Ukraine is entering its second year and a ceasefire, nominally in place since February, has failed to stop the violence in areas around Donetsk airport.
Among the hardest hit is the village of Pisky. It had a population of 3,000 before the war started, but now only a handful of civilians remain.
Fergal Keane has been granted exclusive access to the village, which has been sealed off by the Ukrainian army.

Lebanon racism: Photo exhibition addresses prejudice
27 May 2015 Last updated at 00:03 BST
Lebanon is known for its religious diversity, but many are not aware of the country's range of ethnicities  - with some people not accepting that difference races can also be Lebanese.
Many Africans, Asians and people of mixed race face racism, from people assuming they are domestic workers to police harassment - with no discrimination law to protect them.
Lebanese Nigerian Nisreen Kaj - who features in this report - was involved in an exhibition addressing these issues with family photographs of mixed race Lebanese families dating back to the 1970s.

One of the world's most distinguished conductors and pianists, Daniel Barenboim, has unveiled a new type of grand piano.
He says it is "radically different" to the standard concert grand as it is built with straight, parallel strings that produce a superior sound.
Will Gompertz is at the Royal Festival Hall on London's South Bank where the piano is being unveiled.

        <MainBody>Ukraine's stubborn frontline civilians defy bombardment
By Fergal Keane BBC News, Pisky
26 May 2015
From the section Europe
It was a perfect afternoon in early summer.
Somebody had placed a garland of fresh flowers on the rusting wreckage of a tank. Men died here and were remembered. Although the fields were empty it was possible to imagine them filled with workers harvesting the sunflower crop.
This was the lull, the space between bombardments when the land reminded us of its true purpose: not a battlefield but a place of abundance.
I remarked to a colleague that the calm was our greatest enemy here. It lulled us into a false sense of ease.
And then it started. I heard shouts of "Go, go, go" in English and Ukrainian.
There were loud cracks and flashes in the fields nearby, then the surge of adrenalin; the fear - impossible to convey - of being caught in the open by artillery.
Another small moment in the life of a war we have reported on for the past year.
Much of that time has been spent in the villages around Donetsk airport, like Pisky.
Of a pre-war population of 3,000, there are now only around 40 people left.
Pisky, near Donetsk, was once home to over 3000 people - now only 40 remain
Beekeeping amid bombardment
We had come back to Pisky to spend a night in the company of a couple who refused to leave one of the most embattled places on the Ukrainian front.
Anatoliy and Svetlana Kosse, both aged 68, were among the few residents still here.
The pair could not bear to be separated or leave their home
All around them were the ruins of houses struck by shellfire.
Their days and nights are punctuated by the noise of artillery, rockets, mortars and gunfire. But alongside this murderous back and forth there was a more hopeful soundtrack.
We heard it in the garden where Anatoliy tends his bees, in the kitchen where Svetlana cooked us dinner from the vegetables she grew and the eggs from her henhouse. It was the unrehearsed but determined music of life that refused to be yield in the face of war.
Stuck in no-man's land, the village has been pummelled by shelling
'Pain in my soul'
The village sat close to Donetsk airport and on the frontline between the Government and rebel armies.
There was no electricity or water. Food supplies were meagre: the couple survived on what they produced and on occasional aid deliveries.
"It is terrifying," said Svetlana. "Before I only had a few grey hairs here. And now you can see. When I look at myself with my glasses on, it is terrifying."
So why did they stay? Why did they not leave for the city? I asked these questions of Anatoliy as he tended the beehives.
"I am taking care of them, they are here, how can I just leave them?" he replied.
This was home. To leave would be to abandon all they had worked for.
Despite shelling, Anatoliy cannot bring himself to abandon his bees
In fact Svetlana did move to the city for several months. Anatoliy stayed behind to take care of the home they had created together with its crop-filled garden, beehives and neat rows of flowers.
We were sitting over dinner when Svetlana described what happened after she left.
"When he was alone here, every morning and evening we called each other. I had a strong pain in my soul and so did he. He was a lonely man here because all the neighbours moved away."
So she returned. They decided to endure the danger and the stress.
I asked Anatoliy what his wife meant to him. "How can I explain what she means to me?" he said. Then he smiled and leaned across and placed his head on her shoulder.
They both laughed.
'The nicest and bravest'
Svetlana grows vegetables in her garden
The shelling and shooting went on. It was a perfectly clear, starlit sky. And below the stars, shining brightly, we could see the unmanned aerial drones searching for targets on the ground.
When we left the following morning I told Anatoliy and Svetlana that in war I had met all kinds of people but they were among the nicest and bravest I'd ever come across.
"You make too much of us," Anatoliy replied.
They laughed again.
I was struck by how much laughter there was in this home. Every day now I read of fighting in Pisky; I think of the beekeeper and his wife and I curse the war that threatens such decent people.
Houses all around Pisky have been badly damaged by bombardment

        <Description>What new governments – from Attlee to the coalition – did first</Description>
        <MainBody>First Queen's Speeches: How new governments used their power
By Tom Moseley Political reporter
26 May 2015
From the section UK Politics
All eyes will be on the Palace of Westminster on Wednesday as the Queen reads out the legislative plans of David Cameron's new government.
It will be a chance for the first all-Conservative government for almost 20 years to set out its stall for the next five years. Here's how some other new governments have used their Queen's (and King's) speeches.
1945
Clement Attlee and his wife Violet after Labour's general election victory in 1945
The 1945 election marked a watershed in British history. The Conservative wartime leader, Sir Winston Churchill, was defeated by Clement Attlee's Labour Party.
The state opening of Parliament, on 15 August 1945, came at the end of World War Two, on Victory in Japan Day.
King George VI's speech was delivered in the House of Lords, which had been occupied by MPs since the Commons chamber was destroyed by bombs.
"Echoes of great events in British history mingled with the rejoicings of victory when the House of Commons assembled this morning in St Stephen's Hall for the state opening of Parliament," the Times newspaper reported, noting that Churchill was cheered as he took his seat.
In quotes
"The continuing shortages in the supply of many necessaries, especially houses, food, clothing and fuel, will call for the same spirit of tolerance and understanding which the nation has displayed during the past six years of war."
Key measures
MPs were told money would be needed "not, happily, for the continuance of the war, but for expenditure on reconstruction and other essential services"
As well as post-war reconstruction, the government would also have to complete the social reforms started by the previous government, the Times said, predicting most interest in the King's speech would be "in matters about which there is acute disagreement among the parties".
The government planned to press ahead with nationalisation, starting with the Bank of England and the coal industry.
An "urgent and vital task" would be to "increase by all practicable means the number of homes available both in town and country"
What happened next
Key services and industries were nationalised, and Attlee's government ushered in the welfare state and the National Health Service.  India was granted independence.
The Attlee government changed the face of British society, creating a new social consensus that was to remain largely unchanged until 1979, but its majority was slashed in 1950 amid public frustration at continued austerity and rationing, and the following year saw Churchill return to power with a comfortable majority.
After the state opening, King George VI received ministers and chiefs of staff at the Buckingham Palace
1979
Margaret Thatcher became the UK's first female prime minister, ousting Jim Callaghan's Labour with a 43-seat majority. During the campaign she had promised to cut taxes, reduce public spending and curb the power of trade unions.
In quotes
"My government intend to achieve a fair balance between the rights and duties of the trade union movement."
Key measures
The flagship right for local authority tenants to buy their homes
On the economy, "reducing the burden" of tax and "restricting the claims of the public sector on the nation's resources"
Trade union reforms including amending the law on picketing and the closed shop
A reduction in "the extent of nationalised and state ownership"
Increased competition by "providing offers of sale, including opportunities for employees to participate where appropriate"
What happened next
"Right to buy" proved extremely popular, with about 1.5m homes purchased under the rules by 2003. It was seen as a major vote winner for the Conservatives in subsequent elections, and in 1985 Labour dropped its official opposition to the scheme.
Critics said it contributed to a reduction in the number of available council homes.

Meanwhile, Mrs Thatcher's battles with trade unions became one of the defining features of her premiership. Ultimately their power was reduced and membership plummeted.
Many of the services nationalised under the Attlee government were privatised.
Public spending was slashed, and documents released in 2009 revealed even some Conservative ministers were alarmed at the scale of cuts planned in 1979.
Mrs Thatcher was prime minister until 1990, winning three general elections. The Conservatives won one further election and remained in power until 1997.

1997
On 1 May 1997, Labour's 18 years in opposition came to an end. Tony Blair's New Labour won a 179-seat majority - the biggest in its history - on a manifesto which not only promised no income tax rises, but also a pledge to stick to Conservative spending plans.
In quotes
"The central economic objectives of my government are high and stable levels of economic growth and employment, to be achieved by ensuring opportunity for all."
Key measures
Handed responsibility for setting interest rates to the Bank of England
A ban on tobacco advertising
A Freedom of Information Bill to increase transparency
Referendums on a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly
What happened next
"These are only the first steps on a long journey," was the Guardian 's verdict, adding that "Labour begins that journey sustained by enormous national delight".
Business leaders broadly welcomed the decision to free the Bank of England, which had divided the Conservatives. The Bank's monetary policy committee continues to set interest rates.
Tony Blair's first Queen's Speech promised a referendum on a Scottish Parliament
Labour got into hot water with its tobacco advertising ban, as it announced an exemption for Formula One and then had to return a 1 million donation from F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone.
The Freedom of Information Act remains in place - although Mr Blair subsequently described it as one the biggest regrets of his time in office. The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly were established after referendums.
Labour went on to win two more general elections, with the 2010 election bringing an end to its 13-year tenure.
2010
David Cameron and Nick Clegg formed a coalition government in 2010
After the general election left no single party in overall control of Parliament, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came together to form Britain's first coalition government in 70 years. The result was the coalition agreement , which would form the backbone of the government's legislative programme for the next five years.
In quotes
"Action will be taken to accelerate the reduction of the structural budget deficit."
Key measures
Welfare reform including a new universal credit
A referendum to approve any future treaties handing powers to the European Union
The scrapping of ID cards
Reform of the NHS including scrapping primary care trusts
The creation of a new independent Office for Budgetary Responsibility
A referendum on a new voting system
Construction of a new high speed rail line
What happened next
Contrary to some predictions, the two parties remained together throughout the parliament.
Civil liberties measures like scrapping ID cards proved more straightforward than issues where the two parties were on opposite sides of the debate, like the proposed move to the Alternative Vote system, which was resoundingly rejected in a referendum.
The voting system referendum promised in the Queen's Speech resulted in a No vote
The government went on to change the structure of the NHS - despite vocal opposition from Labour - and set out details of the HS2 rail line, with construction due to start in 2017.
After sticking together for five years, the two parties experienced differing fortunes at the 2015 election - the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority while the Lib Dems lost all but eight of their MPs.

Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes rose to prominence with a man-of-the-match performance as England beat New Zealand in the first Test at Lord's on Monday.
In only his 10th Test, the 23-year-old hit the fastest century in a Lord's Test, a swashbuckling 101 from 92 balls with 15 fours and three sixes.
He also took three wickets in the second innings with his attacking seam bowling as England won by 124 runs.
With the Ashes series starting on 8 July, have England found a new hero?
Why's he being talked about?
England followers love a big-hitting match-winner. From Botham to Flintoff and Pietersen, interest grows significantly when these kind of players are in the side.
A genuine all-rounder is also vital to the England hierarchy, offering more options to the selectors and helping the balance of the side if they are confident they have a batsman and bowler rolled into one.
England captain Alastair Cook said the 101 made by Stokes was "one of the best innings I've seen" but added that New Zealand-born Stokes also had a commendable work ethic.
After his century, Stokes played a key role with the ball as England wrapped up victory
"We have always known how talented Ben is, but you need to work hard and if anyone goes to the nets they will see the first guy hitting the ball, half-an-hour before anyone else, is Stokesy," he said.
Ironically he was left out of the England World Cup squad last year after a modest run of form in which he scored 89 runs in nine one-day international innings. Without him, the squad did not fare well, losing to Bangladesh and failing to progress beyond the opening group stages.
What's his background?
Stokes is one of a number of England players born outside the United Kingdom, and coincidentally grew up in New Zealand. The son of rugby league player and coach Ged Stokes, he moved to England aged 12 when his father was appointed coach of Workington.
Making his debut for Durham aged 17 in 2009, Stokes dismissed the prolific Mark Ramprakash, now the England batting coach, with his third legal delivery in senior cricket.
Having scored a hundred against India in the Under-19 World Cup in 2010, Stokes made his one-day international debut in 2011 and his Test debut on the Ashes tour of 2013-14, when he scored 120 in only his second appearance.
There have also been moments of controversy. In 2013, he and Matt Coles were sent home from the England Lions tour of Australia for disciplinary reasons, while he missed the 2014 World Twenty20 with a hand injury suffered when he punched a dressing room locker in the West Indies after being dismissed first ball.
Botham is the most celebrated England all-rounder, scoring 5,200 runs and taking 383 wickets in 102 Tests
Is he the new Ian Botham?
Botham was worth his place in the team as either a batsman or a bowler. He made 14 Test centuries and, until recently deposed by James Anderson, was England's leading Test wicket-taker, with 383 scalps in his 102 matches, taking five wickets in an innings 27 times.
A more favourable comparison at this stage for Stokes would perhaps be Andrew Flintoff, who was the cult hero of the memorable 2005 Ashes series, taking 24 wickets and hitting a century and three fifties.
Flintoff's overall record was more modest, averaging 31 with the bat from his 79 Tests with five centuries while taking 226 wickets at an average of 32.
Michael Vaughan, who captained England to victory in that 2005 Ashes, told BBC Radio 5 live: "People will say we shouldn't talk in terms of Flintoff and Botham but we've got a cricketer here who is completely natural. English cricket has got to promote him and that style of cricket.
"He'll have his off days but I think he's going to have a lot of the moments we've seen over the last few days because he's got raw talent.
"English cricket needs that kind of player that all kids try and emulate, that style that people can relate to, they think 'yes, he's one of us,' who just has that mentality to take the opposition on."
Stand-in England coach Paul Farbrace said: "It's not always going to be 90 and 100 in the same game, and wickets, but he gives so much to the team with his energy. He's someone you want on your team. He gets in the face of the opposition, he plays tough, hard cricket but he's so talented."
Previous false dawns
Since Botham's final Test in 1992 England have been searching for his successor. Chris Lewis and Dominic Cork were among those labelled as the "new Botham" and Flintoff overcame the pressure of that tag as his star shone brightly during an 11-year Test career.
Vaughan is convinced that Stokes has the ability and he said: "He's going to win England matches on a regular basis. He reminds me so much of the great all-rounders, they've got that presence, they make things happen.
Alastair Cook praise for 'unbelievable' Ben Stokes
"He's got that wow factor, that buzz, when Ben Stokes is in the game no-one is going to go, people are going to make sure they are watching."
Botham and Flintoff were arguably two of the greatest characters to play for England with their buccaneering, exuberant styles. Stokes has a lot to live up to, but with his tattooed arms, combative approach and, above all, impressive displays, he is already carving a name for himself.
Farbrace added: "The more experience we give Ben, the more he's involved in the game and a centrepiece player, the more we get out of him.
"He wants to be at the centre of the game. He's all-action and exciting. The more we get him involved and give him responsibility, the more he will respond to that."
And Stokes senior, his father Ged, said: "He had a natural talent for the game ever since he picked his first plastic bat up, he could straight drive when he still had nappies on. I used to play with him in the hallway and he wouldn't hit the wall - he would drive it straight past me.
"He's got a talent, but he's a nice lad, and his contribution to the team is more important to him than personal stats."
Listen to more reaction from Ged Stokes and others on the Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show's podcast
What are people saying?
Scyld Berry, Daily Telegraph: "Around such a talismanic all-rounder as Stokes an excellent Test team can be built."
Stephen Brenkley, Independent: "The crowd loved him and he loved them back. Like certain all-rounders before him he knows about carpe diem all right.
Vic Marks, Guardian: "Stokes was unfettered and dangerous. Just do not expect too much consistency. That can't be part of the current deal. Be grateful, not greedy."
Paul Newman, Daily Mail: "This will be forever known as the Test when Ben stokes announced himself as an all-rounder of rare ability and star quality."
Dean Wilson, Daily Mirror: "England's brave new era has a new hero and his name is Ben Stokes."
Former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior: "He's always going to take the positive approach, he really did turn the game round for England."
David Lloyd, ex-England batsman, now commentator: "The public know when a new talent emerges... and one with 'edge' too."
Andrew McGlashan, Cricinfo: "It was Ben Stokes who really lit up Lord's for the second afternoon running in with an electrifying over in which he removed two of New Zealand's lynchpins."
Former England football captain Gary Lineker: "Great stuff from Ben Stokes! Thrilling Test match and a great win for England. Watch out Australia!"
John Gibson from Cockermouth CC, Stokes's first club: "Ben first came here from New Zealand as a 12-year-old and played with us for five or six years. I thought he was a good player, but I think we'd have been foolish to say we thought he'd play for England - there are lots of junior players who impress. But it's incredible what he has gone on to achieve."
Broadcaster Piers Morgan: "Not hearing those England fans who brand Kevin Pietersen a 'South African' call Ben Stokes a 'Kiwi'... would love to see them bat together."

        <MainBody>Viewpoint: Why do people waste so much time at the office?
26 May 2015
From the section Magazine
The workplace is where people go to work. But much of the day is increasingly padded out with less productive activities, writes Peter Fleming.
A few years ago a disturbing story appeared in the media that seemed to perfectly capture the contemporary experience of work and its ever increasing grip over our lives: "Man Dies at Office Desk - Nobody Notices for Five Days".
The case was unnerving for one reason mainly. People die all the time, but usually we notice. Are things so bad in the modern workplace that we can no longer tell the difference between the living and the dead?
Of course, the story turned out to be a hoax. An urban myth.
As it happens, each country has its own variation that still fools people when they periodically appear. In the US the dead person is a publisher. In other countries, a management consultant.
We might even embellish the story ourselves. Perhaps the dead accountant not only went unnoticed for five days but was rewarded with a promotion for all the extra hours and loyalty, possibly making vice president. In all variants of the myth the worker is never a woman which is interesting for its own reasons.
Isn't it strange that so many of us who encounter this apocryphal story genuinely shrug and mumble "Yeah, that's about right"?
Why does it resonate so well with our experiences of employment today? A number of reasons might be behind this.
About the author
Peter Fleming is professor of Business and Society at Cass Business School at City University London
He is the author of The Mythology of Work: How Capitalism Persists Despite Itself
First, it reminds us that the otherwise crazy idea of working non-stop for hours or even days on end has quietly become the new normal. Behaviour that our grandparents would have deemed insane is now rather pedestrian.
The average British worker spends 36 days a year answering work emails. London workers in particular receive close to 9,000 emails each year. As a result, work spills over into private time. One recent survey revealed that 80% of employers consider it perfectly acceptable to contact their employees outside business hours .
And then there's the commute. British workers waste 18 months of their lives commuting, which is often expensive and stressful.
All of this work comes at cost. Job-related illness, for example, is a growing problem in the UK and elsewhere, exacerbated by stress and more of us being overwhelmed by the "to do" list.
Making matters worse, in times of recession we are more willing to put up with horrible workplace environments, which adds to the pent-up frustration. A recent study found that job burnout is more adverse to your health than chain smoking.
Only in this context could we ever see accounts of having "worked to death" being reported in the corporate sector, as was the case with the Bank of America intern, Moritz Erhardt in 2013. He died of an epileptic seizure after working 72 hours straight. And let's not even mention the new phenomenon of work-inspired suicides that has followed in the long wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
A recent study of management consultants in the US found that 35% 'faked' an 80-hour work week
But the "Man Died at Desk and Nobody Noticed" urban myth strikes a chord for another and more depressing reason. Yes, the office should have noticed the man was dead. Five days is a long time. But they also ought to have noticed that his work wasn't actually getting done.
Unfortunately, this is not how the modern workplace functions today. Take those 36 days spent on email. It would be simply impossible to fill every minute online with only productive work. The same goes for the long hours put in at the office.
Apart from getting the actual task done, which is typically completed in short bursts, there is also a good deal of messing about, chatting, paying the bills, surfing the net, daydreaming and waiting for the day to finish. Most importantly, much of our day is spent busy being busy rather than doing things that are socially useful.
This gives contemporary employment something of a ceremonial feel about it. Not only are we working more now than ever (or searching for it if unemployed) but a good deal of it is unnecessary.
We are obliged to look like a worker as much as actually be one, whether we are working in Poundland for nothing (as part of the UK government's back to work programme) or employed in high finance.
A recent study of overworked management consultants in the US found that 35% employed in this occupation actually "faked" an 80-hour work week . For various reasons these individuals pretended to sacrifice themselves on the altar of work and still got everything done.
In this respect, entire occupations might be considered phoney - from life coaches to "atmosphere co-ordinators" (people hired to create a party vibe in bars) to "chief learning officers" in the corporate world. For those economists trying to figure out the present "productivity puzzle" in the UK, best start looking here.
What is productivity?
Productivity measures how much each employee makes over a period of time
Calculated by dividing total output by the number of workers - if a factory employing 50 staff produces 1000 tables a day, then the productivity of each worker is: 1,000 tables/50 staff = 20 tables
Does Britain have a productivity problem? (BBC News Online, 21 May)
None of this is to say there aren't many of us working hard doing important things that society depends upon. But this sheer amount of time spent at work is totally disproportionate to the vital tasks that need to be achieved. Disconnected too from the pay we receive for doing them.
In other words, work has become ritualised and detached from the practical things it was invented to accomplish.
Why do we work? The obvious answer is "to live". But it's not our actual job - giving a lecture, selling a car, nursing a patient or flying a passenger jet - that directly secures our life conditions.
For sure, most occupations in the West have drifted far away from the baseline of biological self-preservation. A job simply grants us access to man-made vouchers we call money. We then redeem these so we can then purchase life.
How many vouchers we obtain and what we have to do to get them is the political question par excellence under neoliberal capitalism. But it's this growing disconnect between labour as a biological/social requirement versus work as a cultural artefact that has seen it take on a life of its own, spiralling out of control, taking over everything else.
Herein lies the work paradox. At the very moment it is glorified as the highest civic virtue (on both the political left and right) it is drying up at an unprecedented rate.
Like it or not we are moving into a post-work future. According to some estimates, half the eligible global workforce is currently unemployed.
Technical innovations are exponentially automating routine manual labour and now cognitive work too. Our work-centric society is swiftly becoming obsolete. No matter how much governments bribe the business sector with tax breaks and subsidies to keep people employed in needless jobs, the necessity of work is rapidly disappearing.
As a society we probably secretly know all of this. But we have no idea what to do next.
Almost all of our institutions have been built around the mythology of work. Our very sense of self-worth is based upon it. It is almost taboo to even question work.
Regardless, the possibility of a jobless future might soon be a reality. It's up to us to decide whether this future is going to be a nasty nightmare (involving corpses frozen at their desks) or a beautiful paradise of play.
More from the Magazine
Many people might think of office-bound life as a modern phenomenon, but there's a long history of people chained to their desks, explains Lucy Kellaway.

        <title>Where does the word 'deflation' come from?</title>

        <Description>Where does the word 'deflation' come from?</Description>
        <MainBody>Linkedin
Whether to use the word "deflation" caused furrowed brows in the past week when average prices fell for the first time since 1960.
The BBC's economics editor said many economists were "desperately anxious" that he should not use " the 'd' word ".
After decades of complaints about inflation, it might seem surprising that people wished to avoid using a word which suggests the opposite. There were concerns that it should only be "deflation" if prices went on falling.
But headline writers anxious for brevity rushed to say Britain was "in deflation" (though no-one ever said it was "in inflation"). Which sounded bad, like "in recession".
Also deflation sounds sad - just as we say a proud or hopeful person is "deflated" by a disappointment. It makes the country seem like a squashy old football lying forgotten in a shed.
"Inflation" is the classical Latin word "inflatio" from "inflo", combining in and flo, meaning blow.
Latin also has "deflo", from flo and de (meaning "from"). The agricultural author Varro writes of impurities in olive oil being "deflatum" - blown away.
Some Roman somewhere may have used the word deflatio (though it is not recorded). But that is not where our word deflation comes from. If it existed in Latin, "deflatio" would have meant "blowing away".
"Inflation" was a word in Latin and other languages for many centuries before "deflation" appeared.
The word came into use during the bicycle boom of the 1890s
Nor was inflation a very common word in English at first. It rarely meant blowing air into things, but more often had unpleasant overtones which it also had in Latin - sometimes meaning swelling, or flatulence (which also comes from "flo") or excess.
In 19th Century America , "inflation" began to be used to criticise the actions of governments putting too much money into circulation, causing prices to rise. Later it was used loosely to mean the rise in prices itself.
A word for the opposite - both letting air out of something, and restricting money and prices - would be needed sooner or later, but it was only in the 1890s that "deflate" and "deflation" came into use.
Why then? Suddenly inflating and deflating had become familiar to millions, for the 1890s was the time of the bicycle boom, when "safety cycles" with chain drives as we know today became widely available and hordes of ordinary people took to the rugged roads - and had to care for their suffering tyres.
And in the cycling column of the Pall Mall Gazette in August 1891 a new word appears: "Good news for the oft-suffering users of pneumatic tyres a new patent valve, possessing the long-desired means for deflation as well as inflation."
The figurative use followed - HG Wells's War in the Air in 1912 has a character "left in an extremely deflated condition".
When "deflation" was first used by economists is not known, but Sir Ralph Hawtrey's 1919 book Currency and Credit uses it several times.
The new arrival had quickly made itself at home - though still people are "desperately anxious" about what exactly it means.

        <Description>The state-of-the-art hospital for poorly birds</Description>
        <MainBody>Welcome to the falcon hospital of Qatar
By Justin Marozzi Qatar
26 May 2015
From the section Magazine
Hunting with falcons is a popular sport in the Gulf - and Qatar's capital city, Doha, has a specialist hospital where injured birds are treated.
If you're not ready for it, it could be an alarming sight.
The first thing that greets me in the reception is a hooded falcon standing to attention on a perch. Behind the bird is a large television screen showing X-ray images of what could be mistaken for a scrawny supermarket chicken. Not much breast on that.
Medical staff in smart blue scrubs bustle about the place impressively, consulting charts and comparing notes on patients. Whichever way you look in this immaculate, air-conditioned building, you see state-of-the-art equipment. And the occasional feathered predator in need of medical attention.
Welcome to Souq Waqif Falcon Hospital in the Qatari capital of Doha. This extraordinary institution, with its 30 vets and staff from right across the Muslim world, from Pakistan to Iraq, caters to the needs of falcons and their deep-pocketed owners, passionate players in this ancient sport of kings.
Falconry is big in the Gulf and with Qatar emerging as a fantastically wealthy state, rich in natural gas, perhaps it's no surprise that the facilities here are so lavish.
"Falcons are very brave birds and will attack anything so sometimes they come in to us damaged," says Mohammed, the medical engineer who proudly shows me around.
If your falcon is missing a feather or two after a nasty scrap with a houbara bustard, not a problem. The hospital has a well-stocked feather bank. A broken wing? Whisk the bird off to orthopaedic surgery. Digestion issues? Time for a fecal and blood check. If that doesn't do the trick, perhaps pharmaceutical and toxicology analysis is the answer.
We pass one endoscopy station where a bird under anaesthetic is being examined with a tube down its throat. A micro camera relays images of the falcon's insides on to a large monitor.

All this sort of treatment must come at a fearsome price, I suggest. I'm completely wrong. A check-up costs 100 riyals - less than 20 ($30). An X-ray will cost 20 riyals - less than 4 ($6).
"We get people coming from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and all over the Gulf bringing their falcons in here," says Mohammed. No wonder when the treatment is so heavily subsidised.
The falcon hospital is just one of many signs that this once sleepy village of pearl divers and fishermen has become an astonishingly rich Arab city.
Between my first visit in the late 90s and my second in 2014, an entire new city has soared into the skyline of once empty West Bay. Skyscraper after skyscraper, including the beautiful Doha Tower, creation of the French architect Jean Nouvel. "It's as though they've built Singapore or Hong Kong in a decade," says an expat.

If the falcon hospital points towards the future of Doha, the private pearl collection of the businessman Hussein al Fardan, said to be the largest collection in the world, pays heritage to the old pearl diving tradition, which came to an end in the 1950s.
There are pearls of all shapes, sizes and colours here, including the world's largest, a 276-carat whopper fashioned into a ring. Most of these pieces are not for sale but the price tags for those collector pieces that are available are not for the faint-hearted. I offer quiet thanks my wife is not with me to see these amazingly opulent jewels.
Hussein al Fardan with his pearl collection
No less impressive in the annals of conspicuous consumption is the private carpet collection of Sheikh Faisal bin Qasim al Thani, a billionaire businessman and member of the royal family.
In one of the sheikh's many Doha tower blocks what used to be a hotel parking lot is now given over to hundreds of fine carpets, mostly antique Persians. This is in addition to the sheikh's huge museum outside Doha, a must-see, highly eclectic collection of everything from antique coins and elderly dhows to Islamic art and American sports cars. "He just keeps on buying," says a Qatari. These days you could say that of Qatar.
We say our goodbyes in the Souq Waqif Falcon Hospital. "Some of the owners really love their birds," our guide says. "They hold them close to their chests, they kiss them and look after them like a member of the family."
What happens to those falcons the vets are unable to save, which have gone to chase bustards in the great hunting skies of heaven? "Do they bury them?" I ask. Mohammed shakes his head and says, "No - we have an incinerator upstairs."

        <MainBody>Inside Jordan's fight against home-grown extremism
By Frank  Gardner BBC security correspondent, Amman
26 May 2015
From the section Middle East
On Jordan's bleak, windswept border with Iraq there is little two-way traffic these days.
The convoys of articulated lorries that used to thunder through the Karama crossing, shuttling goods between Baghdad and Aqaba, have dwindled to a trickle.
On the Iraqi side is Anbar province, where the jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group have seized towns and large tracts of territory and where a suicide car bomb detonated near the border in late April.
To the north-west lies Jordan's tense border with Syria, and a plethora of competing armed groups.
Rich pickings
"We are facing at least three different armed groups on the Syrian side," says Gen Tawfiq al-Tawalbeh, who until last Sunday was head of Jordan's Public Security Directorate (PSD) and the man tasked by King Abdullah II to shore up the country's internal security.
"In the far west we face al-Nusra Front [linked to al-Qaeda], then in the middle there is the Free Syrian Army, beyond that there are the soldiers of the Assad regime. So we face a lot of threats, a lot of challenges."
Traffic through Jordan's desert border with Iraq has slowed to a trickle, hurting trade
Since the advance of IS in Iraq and Syria, border patrols have been stepped up
Most of those threats are invisible and lie deep inside Jordan itself.
Unlike the oil-rich Gulf Arab states, this is not a rich country. Jordan has few natural resources and high unemployment amongst the young.
In this overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim kingdom, overcrowded backstreets in towns like Maan, Zarqa and Rusaifa have become hotbeds for Salafist extremists.
The late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the forefather of Islamic State, came from just such a place.
IS and al-Nusra recruiters have found rich pickings for their cause here: more than 2,000 young Jordanians have left for Syria to join proscribed terrorist groups.
De-radicalisation programme
Most have not returned, but the dozens who have have found themselves arrested, put on trial and handed lengthy prison terms.
Those suspected of being hardcore, unreformed jihadists end up in high-security wings. But those who can convince the authorities they have turned their backs on extremism are put into a de-radicalisation programme.
"We don't want them to feel they are branded as outlaws," says Lt Col Faris al-Rashid from Police Special Branch.
"So we chose a form of words that won't offend. We call it the Community Peace Centre and it went operational on 1 January this year with the first 69 prisoners".
Al-Rumaimain prison, near Salt, houses more than 500 inmates, including convicted jihadists
In fact, it is more of a programme than a centre. Like similar efforts in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, it uses the power of religious argument by government-approved scholars to try to convince extremists that violence unsanctioned by the ruler is wrong.
After several requests, I was allowed to meet one of the prisoners now going through the programme.
He is being held at al-Rumaimain jail, a short drive out of Amman into the hills.
They call it a "correctional facility" here, but it is still basically a prison with armed and helmeted guards on the gate.
"Abdullah" was not his real name - he did not want his identity to be revealed, partly, I suspect, to save his family from shame. His story is a salutary one.
Persuaded by a friend to drop out of his university degree course to go and fight in Syria, he tried to join the al-Nusra Front but he ended up with IS.
After just two weeks of basic training and indoctrination with the jihadists in north-east Syria he became disillusioned.
Inside Al-Rumaimain prison near Salt - the BBC crew were told they were the first foreign journalists to be allowed in
"I thought I was going to be defending Muslims from the Nusayris," he said, using a derogatory term for President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, "but when I saw Muslims fighting Muslims I decided I had to escape."
He crossed the border into Turkey where after several phone calls home his father persuaded him to come back to Amman.
But Jordan takes a very tough stance on anyone going to join proscribed groups and he was arrested and tried on his return and to his horror, given a lengthy prison sentence.
"I thought that if I went home the authorities would be lenient. I only spent two weeks with [IS], I was just a young guy who had been brainwashed. But instead they gave me five years in prison for joining an armed group, which is too much for me."
Enlisting the public
Abdullah is still hoping for some sort of pardon from the king, but current events are not in his favour.
Jordan is formally at war with IS after it burned to death one of its downed pilots in January.
Since then, opinion in much of the country has swung from being lukewarm about Jordan joining the US-led coalition against IS to being right behind it.
Western diplomats in the region fear it could be only a matter of time before IS hit back with an attack inside Jordan.
The Public Security Directorate call centre can handle up to 25,000 calls a day from the public
Just as in the UK, a part of the country's counter-terrorism strategy involves enlisting the public's help.
Inside the headquarters of the Public Security Directorate in Amman is a giant police call centre linked to CCTV and automated number plate recognition systems around the kingdom.
Staffed by policemen and women around the clock, it takes up to 25,000 calls a day from the public, though most are non-terrorism related.
Jordan is getting a lot of technical help behind the scenes from British counter-terrorism agencies.
But it has also developed its own mobile phone app, called "Jordan Knights", so young Jordanians can report any suspicious sightings.
"We want to improve our tools to meet the language of the new generation," says Col Rashid from Jordan's Special Branch. "So this application... can be easily used to report any single information by text or by recording or by voice message or by taking a snapshot and sending it to us".
Fear of attack
The PSD also has a large number of human informants and even in the cafes of Amman one sometimes has the sense that there are eyes everywhere.
Internal security is clearly a top priority for the government.
It is now 10 years since the last big terrorist incident here, when al-Qaeda in Iraq sent suicide bombers to blow up hotels in Amman, and enormous efforts have been made since then to plug the gaps in security.
But Jordan has some difficult factors working against it: poverty in some quarters, high unemployment, the influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees, and the fact that two of its neighbours are at war.
Given the upheavals across this region, some fear Jordan will not stay immune from that violence indefinitely.

        <MainBody>Driverless convoy: Will truckers lose out to software?

Living the dream: Daimler's new autonomous lorries drive themselves while the safety driver can read a book, watch the game or write a bestseller
Sleepiness and stress are perennial risks for the long distance lorry driver, and accidents are sadly too frequent.
However, a radical new driverless truck being trialled by Daimler may offer a solution.
Earlier this month, the automotive giant was granted the first licence ever to test such a vehicle on a public highway by the US state of Nevada.
Using a combination of GPS, radar and video cameras, the Freightliner Inspiration can drive by itself on open stretches of road, freeing a driver to take breaks, check his emails and even watch DVDs.
The catch is that a qualified person must remain in front of the wheel at all times so they can take control if something goes wrong.
However, proponents say that the technology, once perfected, will reduce accidents by lessening the chance of human error, boost productivity and cut emissions.

Fully automatic
It is perhaps ironic that fully driverless vehicles are already being used in low-speed, controlled environments.
Rio Tinto, for instance, operates over 50 self-drive trucks at its mines in Pilbara, Australia, while Lockheed Martin has built a range of autonomous trucks for the US Army.
One such is the SMSS vehicle which made its combat debut in Afghanistan in 2011. According to Lockheed, it can "track and follow" the movements of a single soldier, transport supplies over rough terrain and carry out casualty evacuations, all without the aid of a human driver.
Where things get tricky is moving these vehicles onto public roads, with other vehicles and pedestrians.
Daimler's truck, for example, only works on freeways, and a human must take over when it reaches city streets - a far more "complicated traffic environment", according to the company.
The good news, predicts the German consultancy Roland Berger, is that we will overcome these technical hurdles within the next 10-15 years - in fact by 2030, we will probably have the capacity to take human drivers out of the equation entirely.
Much more challenging, however, will be solving the deeper social and legal barriers.
"There are some really big ethical issues," explains Wolfgang Bernhart, partner at Roland Berger.
"They relate to how a computer-controlled vehicle should react in certain situations, when an accident is unavoidable and the vehicle has to decide what to do and whom to harm.
"It requires a clear consensus in societies about what to do in terms of liability, and it will take a very long time to reach."

Playing god
He gives the example of a fully self-driving truck, which unexpectedly hits an object that has fallen onto a highway and loses control.
The truck may at this point have to make a choice: veer to the right onto a walkway, where a mother and her children are walking and would be killed; or to the left where three elderly people are crossing the road.
"If a human was at the wheel, he would have to make this really tough decision in the moment," explains Mr Bernhart.
"But if a truck is being powered by a computer algorithm, then these decisions would have to be made in advance by the programmers. And who is going to accept such a decision that sacrifices three elderly people instead of a mother and her children?"
Scott Le Vine, a transport expert at Imperial College, says the corollary would be endless lawsuits for automotive firms. And that could really put off customers and investors.
However, he does believe we could find a way round it.
"What you would want as the programmer of such a vehicle is to be following a 'classical standard' of reasonable behaviour," he says.
"Lawmakers would obviously have to establish that, the question being 'what would a reasonable man do?' And if you can demonstrate you followed that when building your algorithm, then you would have administered your duty of care."

The bumpy road to adoption
Perhaps not surprisingly only two US states - Nevada and California - have granted licences for the testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads - and both require 'safety' drivers to be present.
However, other states and countries are working to update their laws, and both Mr Le Vine and Mr Bernhart expect public acceptance to increase as the benefits become clear.
As Mr Bernhart notes, almost every automaker is now piloting or using forms of autonomous driving technology - and the market for hardware and software could be worth $40-$60m by 2030.
Still, jumping further into the future, what specifically would the impact be if trucks like Daimler's become ubiquitous - and drivers became mere accessories?
According to the American Trucker Association, in the US alone, there are 3.5 million professional truck drivers , and an additional 5.2 million people employed within the trucking industry who don't operate vehicles.

That's a whopping 8.7 million trucking-related jobs that could face some form of displacement.
There could be upsides too, though, not least in terms of safety. In 2012, 330,000 large trucks were involved in crashes in the US, killing nearly 4,000 people , the majority of them caused by driver error.
However, according to one study, driverless trucks could in future reduce collisions by more than 70%, as they'll drive more slowly and react to challenging environments, generally, in the safest way.
Another plus is that autonomous drivers could help tackle skills shortages.
According to the American Trucking Associations, the US trucking industry could see a shortfall of some 240,000 qualified drivers by 2022.
While at the moment this is just speculation, the mass production of self-driving trucks seems inevitable - and the results will be hard to ignore.
