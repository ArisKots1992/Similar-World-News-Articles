Tunisian TV ran footage from one hotel close to the attack
At least 27 people have been killed, including foreigners, in an attack on a beach near two tourist hotels in the Tunisian resort town of Sousse, according to the interior ministry.
Officials say one gunman has been shot dead and another is being pursued.
Sousse is a popular tourist destination.
Tunisia has been on high alert since March when militants killed 22 people, mainly foreign tourists, in an attack on a museum in the capital Tunis.
The interior ministry told the BBC "a terrorist attack" was ongoing.
Tunisia attacks: Live updates
A British man on holiday told the BBC that he heard the attack on a neighbouring hotel and saw a man with a pistol from his room, but did not know whether this was an attacker or a member of the security forces.
The holidaymaker said he and other guests had been told to take shelter in the hotel's staff quarters and have been told to wait for the all-clear.
One image circulating on social media appeared to show a man lying face down in the sand with what looks like blood around his head.

        <MainBody>France attack: Man decapitated in attack near Lyon

A man has been decapitated and several others injured at a factory in France in what President Francois Hollande has called a terrorist attack.
Two men drove into the Air Products gas factory near Lyon, officials said, before several explosions were heard.
One of the suspects, who was investigated by police in 2006, has been arrested.
The dead man was found with Arabic inscriptions on him and an Islamist flag was found near the site.
Live updates: France beheading attack
At a press conference from Brussels, Mr Hollande confirmed that two attackers had targeted the chemicals factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, crashing into it in a car.
"We have no doubt that the attack was to blow up the building. It bears the hallmarks of a terrorist attack," he said.
Referring to the terrorist attacks in and around Paris that killed 17 people in January, he said: "We all remember what happened before in our country. There is therefore a lot of emotion."
Mr Hollande said he would leave the EU summit in Brussels this afternoon and return to France.
Speaking from the scene, France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the suspect in custody has been under investigation between 2006 and 2008.
Mr Cazeneuve said the identity of the suspect was yet to be confirmed but that he was thought to be Yacine Sali.
"This person was under investigation for radicalisation but this investigation was not renewed in 2008. He had no police record," Mr Cazeneuve said.
Officials said the suspect in custody has been known to police since 2006
According to France's Dauphine Libere newspaper, a second suspect has been arrested at his home in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier.
He is believed to be the man seen driving back and forth past the factory before the attack occurred at around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), the newspaper said.
A spokesman for Air Products said: "We can confirm that an incident occurred at our facility in L'Isle-d'Abeau, France this morning.
"Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for."
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has ordered that security be stepped up at sensitive sites around Lyon.
Alain Juppe, the mayor of Bordeaux, took to Twitter to condemn the attack.
"The terrorist threat is at a maximum," he said, adding that France "must make every effort to protect its citizens".

        <MainBody>Syria crisis: Islamic State 'kills 120 civilians' in Kobane
26 June 2015
From the section Middle East
Many of the wounded were taken across the border into the Turkish town of Suruc
Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say.
IS "fired at everything that moved" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says.
Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled.
IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS "caliphate", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
'Women and children'
"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers," said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory.
He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey.
He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer.
The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes.
The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings.
Women and children were said to be among the civilians killed in the latest attack
Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms.
In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town.
Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added.
Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.
Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.

The mosque was packed at the time of the attack
At least four people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack on a Shia mosque in the Kuwaiti capital.
Many people were injured, and unconfirmed reports put the death toll much higher.
The blast hit during Friday prayers at the Imam Sadiq Mosque in al-Sawaber, a busy area to the east of Kuwait City.
An Islamic State- (IS) affiliated group said it was behind the attack. IS has carried out similar recent attacks in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
An Islamic State-affiliated group said it was behind the bombing
The governor of Kuwait City, Thabet al-Muhanna, told Reuters four people had died in the suicide attack. However, the AFP news agency said at least 13 people were killed. At least eight people were reportedly wounded.
A Kuwaiti MP, who saw the attack, said the mosque was packed with some 2,000 people when there was a loud explosion, Reuters news agency reported.
Footage posted online said to be from the scene of the attack showed men, some in blood-splattered clothing, walking around a smoke-filled room with rubble on the floor.
Al-Jazeera also reported that the Kuwaiti emir was heading to the scene of the blast.
Sunni-ruled Kuwait has a large Shia minority, which IS considers to be heretics.

        <MainBody>EU leaders agree to relocate 40,000 migrants
26 June 2015
From the section Europe
EU leaders holding late-night talks in Brussels have agreed to relocate tens of thousands of migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece.
Summit chairman Donald Tusk said 40,000 would be relocated to other EU states over the next two years.
However, there will be no mandatory quotas for each country.
The Greek debt crisis was also on the summit's agenda. Greece and its international creditors remain deadlocked after talks on Thursday.
Earlier, Mr Tusk called on EU member states to share the burden of the boat loads of illegal migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean.
'Modest' plan
New figures from the UN refugee agency UNHCR show that 63,000 migrants have arrived in Greece by sea this year and 62,000 in Italy.
"Leaders agreed that 40,000 persons in need will be relocated from Greece and Italy to other states over the next two years," Mr Tusk told reporters. "Interior ministers will finalise the scheme by the end of July."
Leaders also agreed to resettle another 20,000 refugees who are currently outside the EU. French President Francois Hollande said he expected most of them to be Syrians and Iraqis, AP reported.

Details of where the refugees will go has yet to be decided.
The scheme was made voluntary after some nations in eastern Europe refused to accept set quotas. The UK also opted out of the scheme, using one of its exemptions as agreed in the EU Lisbon treaty .
Hungary, which has seen thousands of migrants cross its border by land, and Bulgaria, one of the EU's poorest countries, have also both been granted exemptions.
This angered Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who called the plan "modest".
Italy has sought more help from its EU partners to handle the thousands of migrants arriving by sea, many of whom are fleeing war and poverty in countries such as Syria, Eritrea, Somalia and Nigeria.
More than three million people who fled the Syrian civil war are being housed in neighbouring countries - far more than the EU has taken in.
The migrant crisis has been high on the agenda for the EU summit, which opened on Thursday.
The final day of the summit on Friday is due to focus on security issues, namely the Ukraine crisis and tensions with Russia.
EU summit: Greece and migrants to dominate agenda
The relationship between Alexis Tsipras, Italian PM Matteo Renzi and Germany's Angela Merkel appeared jovial at the EU summit despite the deadlock
Meanwhile, the impasse in the Greek debt talks threatened to overshadow the summit, with two hours of unscheduled talks on Thursday.
Only once agreement on economic reforms is reached between Greece and its creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - will the final 7.2bn tranche of bailout funds be released to Greece.
Counting down to the default deadline
Fri 26 June: Final day of EU summit, although Greece is not expected to be high on the agenda
Sat 27 June: Greece meets Eurogroup creditors in Brussels in effort to reach a deal or face default on a 1.6bn (1.1bn) IMF loan
Sun 28 June: Absolute final deadline for a deal, says Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling
Mon 29 June: Day on which any agreed deal must be approved by Greece's parliament. German legislators also have to sign it off before funds can released for Greece to start repaying its IMF loan
Tue 30 June: Greece's current bailout expires and it should have paid back the IMF loan. This may prompt the ECB to reconsider its support for Greek banks
Wed 1 July: Day on which country would be in arrears with the IMF if it misses Tuesday's deadline. If so, it would be hard for the ECB to continue any support it is still giving to Greek banks
EU President Donald Tusk said European leaders are pushing for a weekend deadline for a deal to be reached, tweeting : "Another Eurosummit is not foreseen. Leaders expect the Eurogroup to conclude this process at their meeting on Saturday."
Cash-strapped Greece must make a 1.6bn (1.1bn) IMF debt repayment by Tuesday or face default and a possible exit from the euro.
On Thursday, a meeting of eurozone finance ministers also broke up without progress on the issue.
It was the fourth time in a week that the Eurogroup had met in an attempt to prevent a Greek debt default. They will meet again on Saturday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that meeting would be "decisive" in finding a solution.
IMF head Christine Lagarde said lenders had been presented with a counter-proposal by the Greek parties "at the last hour" on Thursday and needed more time to assess it, Reuters reported.
Also during Thursday's talks, UK Prime Minister David Cameron outlined his plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
Mr Tusk said EU leaders should consider British concerns but "only in a way that is safe for all of Europe".
Greek debt talks - main sticking points
Greece has refused to accept cuts to pension payments or public sector wages
The IMF is pushing for deeper spending cuts, not just more tax rises
A key point of friction is a special benefit paid to some low-income pensioners, which creditors want scrapped
Creditors also want a wider VAT base; Greece says it will not allow extra VAT on medicines or electricity bills, and has also resisted calls for VAT hikes on hotels and restaurants
Athens wants a concrete commitment to debt relief, something its creditors are not offering

        <MainBody>US spy chief James Clapper says China lead suspect in cyber hack
26 June 2015
From the section China
James Clapper is the highest ranking US official to publicly implicate China
China is the "leading suspect" in the massive hack of a US government agency holding the personnel records of millions of Americans, US intelligence chief James Clapper has said.
He is the highest-ranking US official to publicly implicate Beijing since news of the data breach emerged.
China always dismissed suggestions that it was behind the hacking.
The statement comes after three days of high-level talks in which China and the US agreed to a "code of conduct".
"China remains the leading suspects," said Mr Clapper at a conference in Washington DC, but "the US government continues to investigate" he added, according to his office.
Background to a "massive" hack in five points
On 5 June the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said more than four million employees, retirees, contractors and job applicants may have had their personal data compromised
Some reports have put the number at 14 million or higher - this remains unconfirmed
The OPM first became aware of the breach in April
Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the hackers were believed to be in China
It's not the first attempt: In March 2014 hackers breached OPM networks - an intrusion blamed on China - but the attempt was blocked
China military unit 'behind prolific hacking'
At the Washington talks where cyber security was a top priority, US Secretary of State John Kerry said there was a need to work with China to develop a "code of conduct" on state behaviour in cyberspace - Chinese representatives had agreed with these conclusions.
"It's something that we agreed needs to be addressed and hopefully it can be addressed soon," State Department spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday.
China has said any suggestion that it was behind the hacking is "irresponsible and unscientific".

Many people are still stranded in the worst-affected Amreli district
Authorities in India's Gujarat state say incessant monsoon rains have caused widespread damage to public and private properties.
Air force helicopters have been dropping food in affected areas after more than 70 people were reported to have died in flood-related incidents.
More than 10,000 people have been moved to higher ground, including 1,000 who were airlifted to safety.
India regularly witnesses severe floods during the monsoon season.
Heavy rains have triggered house collapses in the worst-affected Saurashtra region with some reports saying these are the worst floods in 90 years.
The coastal district of Amreli is the worst affected, where more than 600 villages have been affected.
Farmers are among the worst hit with crops over a large area damaged, Gujarat Health Minister Nitin Patel told BBC Hindi's Ankur Jain in Ahmedabad.
Rescue and relief work is on, he added.
Indian air force has been carrying on rescue operations in Amreli district
Rains have caused widespread damage to public and private properties
The defence ministry said on Thursday that air force helicopters carried out 23 sorties to drop food packets to those stranded.
There have been reports of lions coming out of their habitat in the Gir forest in Junagadh - the only home to Asiatic lions - which has also been hit by rains.
Meanwhile, flood warnings have been issued in Indian-administered Kashmir state where floods killed about 300 people last year.
The Jhelum river in the state's main city of Srinagar was flowing above the danger mark, reports said.
In the northern state of Uttarakhand, authorities have halted pilgrimage to Kedarnath and other Hindu holy sites due to heavy rains.
India receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September.

Al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack
At least 30 people have been killed after gunmen attacked an African Union military base in southern Somalia, witnesses say.
A suicide car bomber drove into the main gates of the base in Leego, along the main road connecting the capital, Mogadishu and the city of Baidoa.
The militant Islamist group al-Shabab says its fighters have taken control of the base but this is not confirmed.
Al-Shabab is battling Somalia's government for control of the country.
The base is manned by Burundian soldiers from the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom), which has more than 20,000 troops in the country.
Amisom confirmed on its Twitter account that an attack was ongoing, but has not given any details on casualties.
Leego residents have seen militants burning vehicles, carrying off weapons and removing the bodies of their fighters killed in the attack, reports the BBC's Mohamed Moalimu from Mogadishu.

        <MainBody>Chinese shares tumble more than 7% amid Asian losses
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Mainland Chinese shares plunged on Friday as investors began to show concern about another wave of new listings absorbing liquidity in the market.
The Shanghai Composite closed down 7.4% at 4,192.87 points.
However, shares of Guotai Junan Securities - China's third-largest brokerage - jumped 44% on its debut after raising $4.8bn (3bn).
It was the country's biggest initial public offering since 2010.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed down 1.8% at 26,663.87, with investor sentiment hit by the share fall on the mainland.
Sentiment was also hit by a crackdown on margin trading and concerns over whether the government would continue to ease policy in order to boost growth in a slowing economy.
Regulators have been cracking down on illegal margin financing and urging brokerages to tighten rules.
However, Bernard Aw, market strategist at trading firm IG, said the "correction" in the market was healthy in the longer term and was also what the central bank wanted to see.
"It is probably not a bad idea to repeat my view that China's leaders still view a strong capital market as beneficial for the Chinese economy. More importantly, a stable bull market is desired," he said in a note.
Japan data weighs
Shares in Japan ended lower after government data showed a mixed picture of the world's third-largest economy, which seems to be struggling to gain momentum.
Household spending rose 4.8% in May from a year ago to mark the first annual increase in more than a year, a sign that consumers are finally spending again after last year's sales tax rise.
But core consumer prices rose 0.1%, still well below the central bank's target of 2%.
The Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.3% at 20,706.15.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.3% in May from April, in line with expectations.
Marcel Thieliant, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said Friday's data cast doubt on the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) upbeat view on the economy and consumer spending.
"With increasing signs that the economic recovery is faltering, we think the BOJ will have to step up the pace of easing before too long, perhaps as soon as October," he said.
Takeover talk
In Australia, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed down 1.6% at 5,544.60.
Shares of supermarket giant Woolworths rose 3.9% after reports that US private equity firm KKR would bid to take over the struggling retailer.
South Korean shares were bucking the trend, with the Kospi closing up 0.2% to 2,090.26.
The benchmark index ended four straight weeks of losses this week.

        <MainBody>Nigeria court in Kano sentences nine people to death for blasphemy
26 June 2015
From the section Africa
An Islamic court has sentenced nine people to death for insulting the Prophet Muhammad in the northern Nigerian city of Kano.
The accused, who were all Muslims, had pleaded guilty, the head of Kano's religious police, Aminu Ibrahim Daurawa, told the BBC.
The trial was speedily done in secret after a section of the court was burnt down by angry protesters last month.
It is not known if they will appeal against the sentence.
The alleged offence was committed last month at a religious gathering in honour of Sheikh Ibrahim Niasse, the Senegalese founder of the Tijaniya sect, which has a large following across West Africa.
The nine, eight man and a woman, were reported to have said that "Niasse was bigger than Prophet Muhammad", triggering unrest.
The venue was burnt to the ground by an angry mob and the nine were arrested,
"There has been consensus among Muslims scholars that insulting the prophet carries a death sentence," Mr Daurawa told the BBC Hausa service.
"We quickly put them on trial to avoid bloodshed because people were very angry and trying to take law into their hands," he added.
Kano has a predominately Muslim population and Islamic courts operate alongside secular courts.
BBC Kano reporter Yusuf Yakasai said people celebrated in some parts of the city when news of the judgement emerged.
Tijaniya at a glance
The Sufi sect of Tijaniya was founded in Algeria in 1784 by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tijani.
It spread all over the world, with large following in north and west Africa. It also has followers in South Africa, Indonesia and other parts of the world.
There are other Sufi sects in Islam but Tijaniya is the largest.
They have three main daily practices: Asking the forgiveness of God; sending prayers to the Prophet Muhammad and affirming the Oneness of Allah.
Senegalese-born Sheikh Ibrahim Niasse was credited with reviving the sect in the 20th Century. People travel from across the continent to visit his shrine.
They have several factions including the Haqiqa (Realist) group, whose leaders were convicted accused of blasphemy in Kano.
Several states in predominantly Muslims northern Nigeria have introduced Sharia law after the country returned to civilian rule in 1999.
This is the first time a death sentence has been handed down for blasphemy in northern Nigeria.
The sentence has been delivered for other offences such as adultery but none has been carried out.

        <MainBody>Indonesia seeks to quieten noisy mosques during Ramadan
26 June 2015
Mosques are particularly active now during the holy month of Ramadan
Indonesia has set up a team to investigate complaints that its mosques are too noisy.
Hussein Abdullah, vice president of the country's mosque council, told the BBC the team gathered samples of noise from places of worship in about 10 cities.
They found loudspeaker volumes set too high, the call to prayer broadcast at different times and sermons at hours there shouldn't be any, he said.
There are approximately 800,000 mosques in the country.
They become particularly active during the holy month of Ramadan, which began in mid-June.
Mr Abdullah said part of the problem was that mosques were competing with one another at such loud volumes that "Muslims couldn't focus on what was being broadcast".
He said the authorities would appeal to mosques to ensure they were only heard in their immediate area and not beyond.
"They should agree on the time and duration. Say for the morning there's a prayer for 5 to 7 minutes, then the call to prayer. That's enough. Don't broadcast a prayer loudly from 4 o'clock in the morning," he said.
The new team would complement a previous initiative, which saw around 100 groups of technicians deployed across the country to help fine-tune mosque loudspeakers and give advice on how best to arrange speakers to reduce noise, the AFP news agency reported.
"This is not to limit the freedom to pray. We just want to manage the noise, so the sound that comes out of mosques is more harmonious and soothing and people can pray better," Mr Abdullah said.

        <MainBody>Baseball welcomes first openly gay professional player

From the section US &amp; Canada
Conroy has been out since he was 16
Baseball has welcomed its first openly gay professional player, in a minor-league game in California.
Pitcher Sean Conroy, 23, took the mound for the Sonoma Stompers after agreeing to come out publicly in time for the team stadium's gay pride night.
The team is part of the independent Pacific Association of Baseball Clubs.
Several baseball players have disclosed their sexual orientation while in retirement but Conroy is thought to be the first active player to do so.
New Yorker Conroy joined The Stompers from college in May and had already told his team-mates and coaching staff he was gay, said general manager Theo Fightmaster.
"His goal has always been to be the first openly gay baseball player so he was very much in favour of telling the story, of carrying that torch," he said.
Major League Baseball historian John Thorn said he thought Conroy was the first active professional to come out.
Both Glenn Burke (Oakland Athletics and LA Dodgers) and Billy Bean (Detroit Tigers, LA Dodgers and San Diego Padres) did so after they retired.

Conroy told his family he was gay when he was 16 and he said it was important to be honest with his new team-mates, especially when conversation turns to girlfriends.
"Instead of getting the different looks or questions when I didn't join them, I'd rather tell you the truth and let you know who I am and have real conversations instead of the fake ones," he said.
Some Stompers will wear rainbow-themed socks or symbols to mark the occasion, the club has said.

        <MainBody>Univision dumps Donald Trump over Mexico remarks
25 June 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
Donald Trump with Miss Connecticut Erin Brady in 2013
US television network Univision says it is cutting ties with businessman Donald Trump and ending coverage of the Miss USA beauty pageant, which he co-owns.
The network, one of the largest US Spanish-language broadcasters, said it follows the hotel tycoon's disparaging remarks made about Mexicans.
Mr Trump said Mexicans brought drugs and crime to the US, during his announcement last week to seek the Republican presidential nomination.
He is now threatening a lawsuit.
In his speech last week, Mr Trump said of Mexico: "They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we are getting."
In announcing the breakup, Univision said that his words were "insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants" and said it would not air the Miss USA pageant on 12 July. The company also said it would be severing all business ties with the celebrity businessman.
Mr Trump has said his remarks were a criticism of US lawmakers, not the Mexican people or their government. He has also said that if Univision follows through with its decision it would be in breach of a contract that "has no termination rights".
"We intend to pursue all legal rights and remedies available to Mr Trump pursuant to the terms of the licence agreement as well as a defamation case against Univision," lawyer Michael Cohen said.
Mr Trump also accused the Mexican government of pressuring the network into "laying down".
"They want to silence Donald Trump. And Donald Trump can't be silenced," Mr Trump said in reference to himself.
"Of course I have a signed contract: five years, they have to pay me almost $15m [9.5m]," he said in an interview with the Fox News television network.
Univision has not commented on these remarks.
Singer J Balvin has withdrawn from both broadcasts
Cristian de la Fuente, one of the two co-hosts who pulled out of the programme, said: "It's a shame that such an important institution as Miss USA is now in the hands of a clown."
While English-language television network NBC has the primary broadcast rights to the spectacle, Univision was - for the first time - going to simultaneously air the event in Spanish.
Colombian singer J Balvin was set to give a performance that would air on both broadcasts, but has withdrawn from the event.
NBC plans to air the programme despite Univision pulling out.

        <Description>Louisiana Republican Governor Bobby Jindal's US presidential campaign launch becomes the subject of online mockery.</Description>
        <MainBody>Bobby Jindal presidential bid sparks Twitter mockery
25 June 2015
From the section India
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal announces his candidacy for the 2016 Presidential nomination during a rally at the Pontchartrain Center
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's announcement that he is entering the Republican presidential race has become the subject of online mockery.
Mr Jindal launched his campaign with a call for a uniform US identity, saying he disliked Americans being identified by origin, ethnicity or wealth.
The hashtag #BobbyJindalisSoWhite began trending on Twitter after the launch.
The tweets poked fun at Mr Jindal's speech and alleged attempts to distance himself from his Indian heritage.
"We are not Indian-Americans, African-Americans, Irish-Americans, rich Americans, or poor Americans. We are all Americans," he told supporters.
Also a subject of ridicule was the fact that Mr Jindal railed against allowing "people to immigrate to this country so that they can use our freedoms to undermine our freedoms".
He added it was incumbent on migrants entering the United States to be "ready and willing to embrace our values, learn English, and roll up your sleeves and get to work".
The presidential hopeful had begun his speech with the words: "Forty-four years ago, a young couple who had never been on an airplane before left their home on the other side of the world to come to a place called America."
Indians online were not amused by the remarks.
The original hashtag #bobbyjindalissowhite was started by Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu , with a series of tweets. Following the success of the tag he said it was the most "satisfying thing" he had ever done.
Others chimed in, like Aasif Mandvi from the Daily Show.
The hashtag was also picked up in India, where it was among the country's top trends for much of the day.
Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Louisiana
Gopinath Gopalam, a healthcare professional from Baton Rouge, travelled to New Orleans to watch Bobby Jindal make his presidential announcement on Wednesday. Although Gopalam hails from India, he says the governor's Indian ancestry is of little importance to him. What matters, he says, is what his success says about the US.
"It's an open economy, open community," he says. "Anybody can come here and have the skill and ability they can rise to the top."
The focus on Mr Jindal's ethnicity in recent media coverage has angered many conservatives. In particular, they point to a Washington Post article that featured a quote from a Louisiana University professor who said "there's not much Indian left in Bobby Jindal".
"For years, liberals have attacked Governor Jindal for not being brown or Indian enough for their liking," Mr Jindal's office said in a statement. "Governor Jindal is proud of his heritage. He believes we need to stop fixating on race and hyphenated Americans."
Mr Jindal, who was born Piyush, told CBS news that he changed his name to Bobby after a character in US sitcom The Brady Bunch.
He also converted to Catholicism from Hinduism while he was at school.
A report in the Washington Post said many Indian-Americans who were among his first supporters are now disillusioned with what they see as efforts by Mr Jindal to distance himself from his roots.
"So what if he's Republican? So what if he's Christian? I don't care about those things, But you can't forget about your heritage. You can't forget about your roots," one of his first donors Suresh C. Gupta was quoted as saying.

        <Description>The US Supreme Court has handed President Barack Obama a major victory by upholding a key portion of his landmark healthcare law.</Description>
        <MainBody>Obamacare subsidies preserved in US Supreme Court ruling
25 June 2015
From the section US &amp; Canada
The US Supreme Court has upheld a key portion of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, preserving health insurance for millions of Americans.
In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue.
The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy.
Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law.
"We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America," Mr Obama said.
The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court.
Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens.
The decision sparked celebrations outside the court in Washington
The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so.
In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it.
In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law.
"Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion.
Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday.
Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable.
Analysis - Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor
The stakes could not have been higher.
People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake.
Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3.
I bet "No-drama Obama" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is.
Obama defies lame-duck expectations
Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning.
Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted "If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."
"This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country," said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. "The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land".
"Today is a good day for healthcare in America," said activist Benton Strong. "I hope this is the end of the line."
Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence.
Demonstrators added tape that read "still covered" to their signs after the decision was announced
Media staff sprinted with the news from the court to colleagues outside
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others.
"We should start calling this law Scotuscare" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. "Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard of."
Congressional Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undo the law.
House Speaker John Boehner said that they will continue their "efforts to repeal the law and replace it with patient-centred solutions that meet the needs of seniors, small business owners, and middle-class families".
Following the enactment of the ACA in 2010, states were given the option of establishing their own healthcare exchanges - online marketplaces for citizens to buy health coverage.
Citizens in states that refused to establish exchanges could shop for coverage on a federal exchange.
Rep Steve Scalise described the ACA as a "dismal failure" and vowed to continue fighting it
In the court, opponents argued that a phrase included in the law, "established by the state," meant the federal government could only provide subsidies to people in states that set up their own exchanges.
However, most Americans receiving subsidies purchase healthcare through the federal exchange, after many states decided not to set up their own marketplaces. Only 13 states and Washington DC have set up their own exchanges.
The Obama administration argued that was a too-narrow reading of the law, which spans nearly 1,000 pages, and the rest of the legislation makes clear subsidies are intended for those who meet income requirements, regardless of which exchange insurance was purchased from.
Obamacare by the numbers
citizens in 37 states depend on federal subsidies to make healthcare affordable
only 13 states and Washington, DC have established their own exchanges
over 10m people have purchased coverage through one of the new exchanges - federal or state
on average, the federal government provides a $272 (173) monthly subsidy
Source: Reuters
The upholding of the law cements President Obama's biggest legislative victory. Limiting the subsidies could have unravelled Mr Obama's signature healthcare reforms.
Republican Congressional leader Steve Scalise said he was disappointed with the ruling and would work to have the law "repealed and replaced," echoing near-universal Republican sentiment.
"It does not change the fact that Obamacare has been a dismal failure for millions of Americans who have lost the good healthcare that they liked, and are paying more for the plans that they have," Mr Scalise said in statement.
Meet the Supremes

Ethel Lance's grandson Brandon Risher touches his grandmother's casket
The first of the funerals for victims of the Charleston church shooting have been held in the South Carolina city.
The services for Ethel Lee Lance took place after a viewing at a Baptist church in North Charleston.
Ms Lance, 70, worked for the church for 30 years and was a mother of five.
The funeral for Sharonda-Coleman Singleton, 45 took place at another Baptist church. She was a speech therapist, pastor and high school track coach, as well as a mother of three.
Their funerals were the first two of nine, with five more to take place on Friday and Saturday. The families of two of those who died have not yet released details.
The nine worshippers were shot dead at a bible study group at an African-American church last week.
Ethel Lance worked for the church for 30 years
Reverend Jesse Jackson, Mayor of Charleston Joe Riley and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and US representative Mark Sanford were in attendance at Lance's funeral.
"She can be a symbol for love," said Lance's grandson Brandon Risher. "Hate is powerful but love is more powerful."
Security was high at the funeral, with police standing guard and checking bags as hundreds of people filed in.
Members of Mother Emanuel church stood and said: "Sister Lance, we are here! Mother Emanuel, we are here!"
Reverend Jesse Jackson and Reverend Al Sharpton were present at Ethel Lance's funeral
Funeral attendees released doves at Lance's funeral
At Singleton's funeral, hundreds of mourners filed past the casket at Mt Moriah Missionary Baptist Church. Police officers surrounded the church and surrounding roads.
On Friday, President Barack Obama will give the eulogy at a service for Rev Clementa Pinckney, 41, who was the pastor at the Emanuel AME church. Vice-President Joe Biden will also attend the service.
Both Mr Obama and Mr Biden were friends of Mr Pinckney, who was also a state senator in South Carolina.
His remains were taken to South Carolina's State House in Columbia on Wednesday, where his coffin will lie in state until Friday's service.
Clementa Pinckney's remains were carried by horse drawn carriage to government buildings

Footage emerged on Tuesday of suspect Dylann Roof being arrested by police officers in Charleston. He appeared to surrender without incident.
Mr Roof has been charged with the murder of those who died at the Emanuel AME church.

        <MainBody>New Brazil delegation travel to Venezuela after 'bus attack'
25 June 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Senator Requiao met Lilian Tintori, the wife of jailed opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez
A group of Brazilian senators has travelled to Venezuela to try to promote dialogue between the country's government and opposition.
More than 40 people have been killed since last year in street protests.
Most of the senators in the delegation are close to Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and support Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
Last week, a delegation of opposition Brazilian senators said their bus came under attack in Caracas.
The group, which included former presidential candidate Aecio Neves, said it had to flee the country after landing in Caracas because their bus was stoned by government supporters.
The Venezuelan authorities have denied involvement in any violence.
The Brazilian government delegation arrived in Caracas on Thursday and said it would talk to all sides.
"Brazil has a duty to identify and promote conditions for dialogue and the reduction of aggression, which has been a feature in Venezuela's democratic process," said Senator Roberto Requiao, who is leading the mission.
'Against the arrest'
The senators later met Lilian Tintori and Mitzy Capriles, the wives of jailed opposition politicians Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma.
They have also met former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles and will hold talk with government officials.
"In Brazil we are in principle against the arrest of anyone taking part in the political process," said Mr Requiao, who is leading the delegation.
But the senators are not planning to visit Mr Lopez or Mr Ledezma, who were arrested last year after being accused of inciting violence during anti-government protests.
The visit comes at a crucial time in Venezuelan politics. Earlier this week, the government announced that parliamentary elections would be held on 6 December.
Delays in setting a date had drawn criticism from the opposition.
The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) of President Nicolas Maduro currently holds a majority of seats.
Venezuela is facing a major economic crisis, which the opposition blames on 16 years of mistaken left-wing policies.
The government accuses the opposition of sabotaging the economy and inciting violence to topple President Maduro.

26 June 2015
From the section Latin America &amp; Caribbean
Ms Murillo suffered some injuries and burns but she is recovering well
A young mother and her baby have been found alive five days after their plane crashed in the jungle of western Colombia.
A Colombian Air Force chief described their survival as "a miracle".
Maria Nelly Murillo, 18, and her one-year-old son were found by rescuers near to where their small Cessna plane crashed in Choco province.
Ms Murillo had some injuries and burns while her baby appeared to be in good health.
Contact lost
The twin-engine Cessna, which was carrying fish and coconuts, had been flying from the town of Nuqui on the Pacific coast to Quibdo, the capital of Choco.
Stories of miraculous plane crash survivals
Baby Yudier Moreno was held by a rescuer on the flight back to Quibdo
It disappeared from the radar of the civil aviation authorities 20 minutes into the flight. A search plane eventually found the wreckage in the Alto Baudo region.
The reason for the crash is not known. The pilot of the Cessna was found dead in the cockpit.
Glimmer of hope
There was no trace of Ms Murillo or her baby, Yudier Moreno, which the passenger list said had been on board.
But according to Col Hector Carrascal of the Colombian Air Force, rescuers took hope when they noticed that the cabin door was ajar.
Search and rescue aircraft found the wreck of the plane. The cause of the crash is unclear
"It could have opened on impact, but it could have been opened from the inside," he said.
"We didn't have a clue what had happened to them: they could be lost in the jungle trying to survive or they could have died already."
Part of the search party searched the area on foot, while others flew in a helicopter using a loudspeaker to shout Ms Murillo's name and urge her to return to the crash site.
But for two days their search yielded no results.
'Miracle'
Finally, on Wednesday, they located Ms Murillo about 500m from the site of the crash in a ravine on the banks of a river.
Ms Murillo and her baby were taken by helicopter to a hospital in Quibdo
"It's a miracle," Col Carrascal said. Of the baby, who is unharmed, he said: "His mother's spirit must have given him strength to survive."
The pair were airlifted to a hospital in Quibdo. BBC Mundo's Natalio Cosoy has spoken to Ms Murillo's elder brother, Carlos.
Mr Murillo said she had managed to open the cabin door and run into the jungle as fire was spreading in the cabin.
"It was then she remembered she had a baby and went back from him," said Carlos Murillo. She sustained burns to her face, an arm and a leg.
Afraid the plane might explode, she walked into the jungle along the bank of a small river.
She was able to survive by drinking coconut water from the coconuts the plane had been carrying, her brother said. She used big leaves to collect and drink rain water.
Ms Murillo eventually heard the calls over loudspeaker from the rescue helicopter which prompted her to make her way back to the crash site.

Ghana 'ball boy' receives same fee as players at 2014 World Cup
Consider a world in which the England kit man is paid as big an appearance fee as Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart or Raheem Sterling.
Tough to imagine? Not so if you worked for Ghana's Football Association at the 2014 World Cup where their "equipment officer" earned $100,000 (64,000).
In a 396-page report which investigates the Black Stars' first-round exit in Brazil, payment for a role also defined as "ball boy" is highlighted.
Ismail Hamidu was the lucky recipient of a sum equal to that earned by individual players, doctors, coaches and manager James Kwesi Appiah.
The report also found a fee of $5,263 (3,345) was paid to Ghana's official drummer.
His beat was not enough to help the team beat Portugal in their final group fixture to reach the second round, a match which followed the country's FA flying $3m out to South America to settle a pay dispute with players.
Two sentences in the Dzamefe Report that perhaps sum up the frustrations and difficulties of Ghana's World Cup campaign are:
The government's decision to pay $100,000 to each of their 23 players "reduced the tension"
"The players however insisted on being paid in cash and this reignited the tension"
The report aims to unpick myriad financial issues surrounding Ghana's World Cup campaign, including some payments which could not be verified or accounted for.
The African side received $8m (5m) for their group-stage exit, but spent almost $4m more than that on their campaign from the beginning of qualifying.
The Dzamefe Report took four months to compile this year and aims to highlight Ghana's shortcomings at the Brazil World Cup

        <MainBody>South Africa police accused over Marikana mine deaths
25 June 2015
From the section Africa
A South African commission has recommended a criminal investigation into police over the deaths of 34 miners during a strike in 2012.
President Jacob Zuma said the inquiry concluded the police had a "defective plan" to end the strike at the Marikana mine and were wrong to proceed with it.
Police have always claimed self-defence over the shooting of the workers during a protest over wages.
Mr Zuma called it a "horrendous tragedy that has no place in a democracy".
"We should, as a nation, learn from this painful episode. We should use it to build a more united, peaceful and cohesive society," he said.
Criminally liable?
The killings were the worst violence in South Africa since the end of apartheid 20 years ago, and led to intense scrutiny over the roles of the police, mining companies, unions and the government.
The miners had been striking for a number of days, and 10 other people had already died at the site - including non-striking miners, security guards and two police officers - before the events of 16 August.
Reading out the findings of the inquiry, Mr Zuma said that the police had planned to encircle the strikers with barbed wire in the morning and allow them out after disarming them.
But as the number of strikers grew later in the day, they implemented a "tactical option" which the commission said was "defective in a number of respects".
The miners had been protesting over wages and conditions
The commission concluded the police should have appreciated that the situation was such that "it would have been impossible to disarm and disperse the strikers without significant bloodshed".
Police were accused of allowing the situation to get out of control.
In its conclusions, the commission said a full investigation should be launched to determine whether any officers are criminally liable. It also called for an inquiry into whether police chief Riah Phiyega was fit to hold office.
The report also criticised the delay in getting medical attention to the injured, which it said contributed to the death of at least one of the workers.
It recommended that a panel of experts should be set up to revise policing methods and investigate new tactics for crowd control that do not involve "weapons capable of automatic fire".
Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg
Judging by what President Zuma said when he released the report, there will be many disappointed people in South Africa tonight.
It seems that the person who will carry the can of the first massacre by the state since the end of apartheid will be police chief Riah Phiyega.
President Zuma said that his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, who was a shareholder at Lonmin at the time of the killings, has been exonerated.
This will certainly not go down well with opposition parties, who have been a thorn in his side over the controversial security upgrades at the president's home in Nkandla.
Mr Zuma can expect an even noisier national assembly flowing directly from his address to the nation tonight.
Marikana deaths: A case for murder?
Both the mining unions and Lonmin, the mine's owners, were criticised for not doing enough to resolve the original dispute, which was over pay and accommodation.
But the commission did exonerate two government ministers and Cyril Ramaphosa, who was a non-executive director at Lonmin at the time and is now South Africa's deputy president.
It said the accusation that Mr Ramaphosa had put pressure on the police to take action against the strikers was "groundless".
The killings were the worst violence in South Africa since the end of apartheid
Lonmin has called the findings of the commission a "vital step in the healing process".
The commission, headed by retired judge Ian Farlam, has spent nearly three years investigating the shooting and the issues surrounding it.
No-one has been charged or held responsible for the killings. A lawyer, acting for the injured miners, said that they were looking into instituting civil claims.
Some of the lawyers for the dead miners' families have also made accusations of a cover-up, describing the killings as revenge by the police for earlier deaths at the mine.

        <MainBody>Thailand halts Human Rights Watch event on Vietnam

Sunai Phasuk (left), HRW senior researcher in Asia, speaks to police at the event
Thailand's military-run government has forced Human Rights Watch (HRW) to cancel an event in Bangkok to launch a report into alleged abuses in Vietnam.
Thai officials said the event, which was halted minutes before it was due to start, could have affected relations between the two countries.
The HRW report focuses on the treatment of a Christian group in Vietnam.
The group said the Thai response showed how freedom of speech had been eroded since the army seized power last year.
Thai police said the event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand could "have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam".
It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month.
The HRW report describes what it says is the persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the Vietnamese government as "evil".
Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher in Asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was "very disappointing".
"Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [Southeast Asia], which adds more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule," he added.
Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in May 2014.

        <MainBody>Pakistan asks UK over claims India funded MQM party
25 June 2015
From the section Asia
The MQM has a loyal support base among the Mohajir community
Pakistan says it will pursue more information from the British government over claims that the MQM party was funded by Indian's government.
MQM officials told UK investigators they had received money from the Indian government, the BBC has learned.
A Pakistani official also told the BBC that India has trained hundreds of MQM militants over the past 10 years.
Indian authorities say the claims made to the BBC are "completely baseless". The MQM also denies them.
Party spokesman Saif Muhammad Ali told BBC Urdu that the MQM had never received any funding or training from India. He said authorities in Pakistan were running a campaign against the party.
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Pakistan's interior minister, said on Thursday he would write to the British government on Friday.
He said they had a duty to "extend as much help as possible" to Pakistan on the investigation.
With 24 members in the National Assembly, the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) has long been a dominant force in the politics of Pakistan's largest city, Karachi.
British authorities investigating the MQM for alleged money laundering held formal recorded interviews with senior MQM officials .
They told investigators the party was receiving Indian funding, the BBC was told. UK authorities also found a list of weapons in an MQM property.
A Pakistani official told the BBC that India has trained hundreds of MQM militants in explosives, weapons and sabotage over the past 10 years in camps in north and north-east India.
Before 2005-2006, the training was given to a small number of mid-ranking members of the MQM, the official said.
More recently, greater numbers of more junior party members have been trained, the BBC was told.
The arrest of Altaf Hussain prompted unrest in Karachi
The claims follow the statement of a senior Karachi police officer in April that two arrested MQM militants said they had been trained in India.
Asked about the claims of Indian funding and training of the MQM, the Indian High Commission in London said: "Shortcomings of governance cannot be rationalised by blaming neighbours."
The UK authorities started investigating the MQM in 2010 when a senior party leader, Imran Farooq, was stabbed to death outside his home in north London.
In the course of those inquiries, the police found around 500,000 ($787,350) in the MQM's London offices and in the home of Mr Hussain.
That prompted a second investigation into possible money laundering.
Who is Altaf Hussain?
Born in Karachi in 1953 to a middle-class family; studied pharmacy at university.
Formed MQM party in 1984 to represent Mohajirs - descendants of Urdu-speaking Muslims who migrated from India to Pakistan.
Requested political asylum in UK in 1992, later gained British citizenship; continues to run MQM from north London.
British investigators then found a list itemising weapons, including mortars, grenades and bomb-making equipment in an MQM property, according to Pakistani media reports that the BBC believes to be credible.
The list included prices for the weapons. Asked about the list, the MQM made no response.
The MQM insists it is a peaceful, secular party representing the interests of the middle classes in Pakistan.

        <Description>Greece and its international creditors remain in deadlock over its debt crisis despite a series of top-level meetings.</Description>
        <MainBody>The relationship between Alexis Tsipras, Italian PM Matteo Renzi and Germany's Angela Merkel appeared jovial at the EU summit despite the deadlock
Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis attended the Eurogroup meeting to put forward Athens' own ideas
After the meeting of finance ministers broke up without agreement, Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem said it was not too late for Greece to accept the proposals of its international lenders.
It was the fourth time that the finance ministers had met in a week in an attempt to prevent a Greek debt default. They will meet again on Saturday.
An EU diplomat told the BBC that the Eurogroup had to make a decision then - yes or no.
The Greek government has criticised the international creditors for rejecting its own ideas, which were initially welcomed.
IMF head Christine Lagarde said the lenders had been presented with a counter-proposal by the Greek parties "at the last hour" on Thursday and needed more time to assess it, according to Reuters.
The IMF has been particularly strong in refusing to accept Greece's proposals put forward earlier this week.
Correspondents say the Greek plan included far more tax rises and far fewer spending cuts than creditors had suggested.
Why the IMF is worried - by Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent
Throughout the Greek crisis, the IMF has been concerned that the programme should add up. That means that specific actions should be able to achieve whatever targets are agreed for the Greek government's borrowing needs.
In the current impasse, one concern is that the Greek proposals include too much emphasis on tax rather than spending.
The IMF worry is that might aggravate the economy's weakness. For the long term the IMF's concern is that Greece should ultimately have a sustainable debt burden and has been telling the eurozone that it should be thinking about debt relief.
Like the other players in this crisis, the IMF has politics to contend with: IMF member countries (Brazil has been a notable example) who have in the past been unhappy about the organisation's financial support for Greece.
Greece's PM Tsipras held talks on Thursday morning with IMF leader Christine Lagarde and European Central Bank head Mario Draghi as well as Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and Eurogroup leader Mr Dijsselbloem.
Technical experts met several hours earlier to continue deliberations. However, no deal was struck.
If an agreement is reached, it will have to be endorsed by Greece's parliament, with some critics at home accusing the prime minister of reneging on his party's campaign pledge to end austerity.
Greek debt talks - main sticking points
Greece has refused to accept cuts to pension payments or public sector wages
The IMF is pushing for deeper spending cuts, not just more tax rises
A key point of friction is a special benefit paid to some low-income pensioners, which creditors want scrapped
Creditors also want a wider VAT base; Greece says it will not allow extra VAT on medicines or electricity bills, and has also resisted calls for VAT hikes on hotels and restaurants
Athens wants a concrete commitment to debt relief, something its creditors are not offering

        <MainBody>France cracks down on Uber service after protests
26 June 2015
From the section Europe
France's interior minister has ordered a ban on the low-cost car-sharing service UberPOP after a day of nationwide protests by taxi drivers.
Bernard Cazeneuve said the service was "illegal" and ordered police and prosecutors to enforce its closure.
His announcement followed a day of sometimes violent protests by French taxi drivers, who say the US-based firm Uber is stealing their livelihoods.
US rock singer Courtney Love Cobain was caught up in the unrest.
She tweeted her frustration, saying her taxi had been ambushed as she left the airport.
The musician shared an image of the window of her car spattered with egg, and thanking two motorcyclists she said rescued her.
Windows smashed
Uber officials have insisted they will continue their activities until France's highest court rules on the service - an attitude Mr Cazeneuve called "cynical and arrogant".
Key highways around Paris were blocked and tyres were burned during the day-long strike. Barriers also appeared around Marseille and Aix-en-Provence in southeast France.
Some cars were overturned and others had their windows smashed with bats.
Riot police responded to protests in Paris after French taxi drivers overturned cars and set fire to tyres in protest against taxi app Uber
Aeroports de Paris, the operator of the French capital's Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly airports, warned passengers to travel by train, saying "access by road is completely blocked".
Some travellers walked along the side of the motorway to reach the airport.
Taxi drivers also blocked access to Marseille and Aix train stations and protested on the main access to Marseilles-Provence airport.
France's taxi drivers - who have to pay thousands of euros for a licence - say they are being unfairly undercut by UberPOP.
"Many taxis drivers are infuriated," Abdelkader Morghad, a representative of the FTI taxi union, told Bloomberg.
He said a law that forbids unlicensed drivers to carry paying passengers should be implemented.
France's licensed drivers have lost between 30% and 40% of their income over two years because of the growth of UberPOP, Mr Morghad said.
UberPOP is a car-sharing service offered by Uber, which brings together customers and private drivers at prices lower than those charged by both traditional taxi firms and even other Uber services.
UberPOP differs because it allows non-professional drivers to register their car and transport other passengers.
It has been illegal in France since January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and the service continues to operate, AFP news agency reports.
Mr Cazeneuve said on Thursday that he had ordered police in Paris to issue a decree banning UberPOP and said any cars defying the order would be seized.
Uber spokesman Thomas Meister said the firm had contested the law under which UberPOP has been ruled illegal, and accused the interior minister of overriding the normal legal process.
"The way things work in a state of law is that it's for the justice to judge whether something is legal or illegal," he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.
The nationwide protests saw violence in Marseille as well as Paris
San Francisco-based Uber says it has a million users in France, including 250,000 for UberPOP. Uber also operates a luxury service which is not banned.
Uber has faced similar teething problems in cities all over the world, with traditional taxi drivers protesting against being undercut by the unlicensed company.
But licensed taxi drivers have been criticised for being slow to adopt the app-based geolocation technology behind Uber's success.

        <MainBody>Iran nuclear talks: Obama warned over concessions
25 June 2015
From the section Middle East
John Kerry and Mohammad Javad Zarif are due to join the negotiations in Vienna on Friday
Former senior advisers to US President Barack Obama have expressed concern at the emerging deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme.
In an open letter , the security and foreign policy experts say it "falls short of meeting the administration's own standard of a 'good' agreement".
They call for fewer concessions on international nuclear inspections and on research and development activities.
The publication of the letter comes as the deadline for a final accord nears.
US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif are to fly to the Austrian capital Vienna on Friday to join the negotiations, which may need to continue beyond 30 June.
The so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - wants to limit Iran's sensitive nuclear activities to ensure that it could not build a nuclear weapon quickly.
Iran, which wants sanctions lifted in exchange, insists its nuclear work is peaceful.
'Tracks with US position'
The open letter published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy on Thursday is signed by a bipartisan group of US diplomats, legislators, policymakers and experts who have met regularly over the past three years to discuss Iran.
They include:
Dennis Ross, who advised President Obama on Iran
Former CIA director David Petraeus
Robert Einhorn, a former member of the US negotiating team with Iran
James Cartwright, a former vice-chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gary Samore, a former Obama adviser on nuclear policy
Stephen Hadley, who was a national security adviser to President George W Bush
Iran insists its nuclear work is solely for peaceful purposes
"Most of us would have preferred a stronger agreement," the letter says.
"The agreement will not prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapons capability. It will not require the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure," it adds.
"It will however reduce that infrastructure for the next 10 to 15 years. And it will impose a transparency, inspection, and consequences regime with the goal of deterring and dissuading Iran from actually building a nuclear weapon."
The letter calls on Mr Obama to insist that Iran provide information about nuclear weapons research Western powers suspect it has carried out, and allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to military sites.
The president is also urged to establish strict limits on the research and development of centrifuges used to enrich uranium to preclude the "rapid technical upgrade and expansion" of Iran's enrichment capacity at the end of any deal. Enriched uranium can be used to make fuel for both nuclear energy and weapons.
A senior Obama administration official said it had received the letter and that it "in large part tacks with the US negotiating position inside the negotiating room".

The UAE ambassador survived as he was in a bulletproof vehicle
A military vehicle escorting a United Arab Emirates' diplomatic convoy was hit by a car bomb in Somalia's capital, killing at least 12 people, police say.
The UAE ambassador survived the suicide attack as he was riding in a bullet-proof land cruiser vehicle, the BBC's Mohamed Moalimu reports from Mogadishu.
The militant Islamist group al-Shabab says it carried out the attack, to target "a foreign enemy".
Al-Shabab is battling Somalia's government for control of the country.
On Sunday morning, a suicide car bomber and gunmen attacked a training centre for the national intelligence agency .
The militants have vowed to intensify attacks during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which began on Wednesday.

        <MainBody>David Cameron 'delighted' EU renegotiation under way
26 June 2015
From the section UK Politics
David Cameron says he is delighted the process of "reform and renegotiation" of the UK's membership of the EU is "properly under way".
The PM was speaking in the early hours after formally setting out his aims to EU counterparts in Brussels.
He addressed EU leaders for 10 minutes at a summit dominated by the migrant crisis and Greek debt , although his exact speech was not reported.
The European Council's Donald Tusk said there was a will to help the UK.
Follow the latest developments on our live page
However Mr Tusk, who is overseeing the membership negotiations, added that basic values, such as freedom of movement to live and work within the EU, "were not for sale".
Detailed discussions would now begin in earnest, he added, with EU leaders next considering the matter in December.
'Safe for all'
Mr Cameron, who wants to reform the UK's membership of the EU before holding an in/out referendum of the British public by the end of 2017, tweeted that "significant progress" had been made in Brussels.
The prime minister, who is under pressure from his Conservative backbenchers to deliver a far-reaching and lasting deal, has not set out in full detail what he wants but his key demands include:
An opt-out on the core EU aim of "ever closer union"
The sovereignty of national parliaments to be boosted, so groups of them can block proposed EU legislation
Safeguard the City of London and other financial centres outside the eurozone
Curb EU immigration by cutting benefits
Make the EU more streamlined and competitive
To get what it wants the UK believes it will need to rewrite treaties agreed by all 28 EU members.
Downing Street has said the prime minister remains committed to "proper, full-on treaty change" but it has acknowledged this is unlikely by the end of 2017 since it would trigger referendums in other EU countries as well.
The government is understood to be seeking "legally-binding" guarantees by the time of the referendum that EU treaties would be changed at some point in the future.
Analysis
By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent
It was during the night's long, acrimonious discussion about Europe's migrant crisis that David Cameron was given time to set out his case. The prime minister's remarks to fellow EU leaders were brief and will not have been a surprise.
He had spoken to each of them in the weeks leading up to this summit - explaining why Britain will have an in/out referendum by the end of 2017 and sketching out his aims.
He has also made it clear Britain could leave the EU if he doesn't get a meaningful deal. For Britain, for Europe, this summit has marked a significant moment - and the start of official renegotiation talks between London and Brussels.
The prime minister of Malta said David Cameron "had worked the crowd well" over recent weeks. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was broadly supportive too, but said EU leaders had some different ideas to those proposed by Mr Cameron.
There remains a big question mark over exactly what the prime minister will be asking for.
Aspirations such as new powers for national parliaments, a British exemption from "ever closer union" and efforts to curb EU migration to Britain through welfare changes will be controversial.
What does David Cameron want?
The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said EU leaders accepted treaty change would be needed further down the line to reflect closer integration within the eurozone.
"The idea is to use that to get in the British changes as well but that cannot happen before 2017," she said.
Estonian prime minister Taavi Roivas told the BBC that treaty change could not be ruled out but a process which required a referendum in every country could pose some "difficulties".
"First of all we have to agree what we want to achieve and then we will talk the legal aspects, whether it is treaty change or secondary legislation," he told Radio 4's Today.
While the principle of freedom of movement could not be circumscribed in any way, he said EU leaders should be willing to listen to all the UK's ideas, including on benefit restrictions.
"I wouldn't draw any red lines just yet. My country men are coming to Britain only to work and to study and are not travelling for benefits so if Britain has this serious concern, we should be open for this discussion."
'Sensible'
UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the prime minister was "accepting the inevitable" that there would be no treaty change.
He said there would be "nothing really fundamental in Britain's renegotiation of its membership".
Former Conservative Home Office minister Damian Green, a pro-European MP, said it was "perfectly sensible for the prime minister to leave his options open" to get the results he wanted.
But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said Mr Cameron was "signalling retreat while pretending that all he ever wanted was a post-dated cheque".
Mr Benn said Mr Cameron had "made a mess" and "should have known what the position of other countries would be".
Tory MP Steve Baker, co-founder of Conservatives for Britain, said he and colleagues were "more concerned" about the "substance" of any new relationship between the UK and the EU "rather than the mechanism" which will deliver it.

        <MainBody>Network Rail 'too big', says Sir Richard Branson
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Network Rail is too big and should be broken up into regional units, Sir Richard Branson has told the BBC.
Many of the delays that passengers on Virgin Rail suffer are down to Network Rail, he said.
"Network Rail is far too big a company," he said. "I think that companies that kind of size should be broken up into small units."
Network Rail said decisions on its future would be taken by the government.
Investment delays
Sir Richard added that "ideally" the train operators should manage the track they use.
"We get enormously frustrated that people say will say that Virgin Rail has delays, but 90% of those delays are down to Network Rail," he told the BBC.
"If we were running the track underneath, because we've got our trains running on that track we'd make absolutely certain that track was fixed and running well, because we value our reputation."
When asked if a break-up of Network Rail was likely, he said: "I don't know; I've thrown that idea out before. Maybe right now it's an option that might be considered."
A spokesman for Network Rail described Sir Richard's figures as "incorrect", adding: "Over the last year (to 30 May), infrastructure faults were responsible for around a third (36%) of delays to Virgin Trains services."
On Thursday, the government said it would delay or cut back a number of modernisation projects planned for Network Rail.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said rising costs and missed targets made an existing 38.5bn investment plan untenable,
Mr McLoughlin said Network Rail should have foreseen the improvements would cost more and take longer.
Network Rail said the plan, which was launched last year as the "largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times", was too ambitious.
Under the changes, the government said electrification work on the Midland main line and on the Trans-Pennine route between Leeds and Manchester would be "paused".

        <MainBody>Hong Kong rejects Jetstar bid to start local airline
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Hong Kong has refused an application by Jetstar to set up local operations there
Hong Kong authorities have rejected an application by Qantas-backed Australian budget carrier Jetstar to set up a local airline, after nearly two years of deliberation.
The regulator said the bid did not comply with the laws of having its principal place of business in the Chinese territory.
The city's other carriers had also objected, it said.
Qantas said it would reconsider basing the low-cost carrier in Hong Kong.
The carrier is a three-way joint venture between Qantas Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Hong Kong investment firm Shun Tak Holdings.
"Jetstar Hong Kong cannot make its decisions independently from that of the two foreign shareholders," said the Air Transport Licensing Authority when handing down its decision.
It also said the city's other carriers, including Cathay Pacific and Dragon Airlines, had objected to Jetstar's application.
'Disappointing' decision
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the decision was disappointing for shareholders as well as "for the travellers that Jetstar Hong Kong planned to serve".
"It's the travelling public who have lost out, because the message from this decision is that Hong Kong appears closed to fresh aviation investment even when it is majority locally-owned and controlled," he said in a statement on Friday.
He added that Hong Kong was going in the opposite direction of other aviation markets in Asia that were "opening up".
"Given the importance of aviation to global commerce, shutting the door to new competition can only serve the vested interests already installed in that market."
The airline, along with its partners, said it had not yet decided on whether to appeal the decision.
The joint venture was valued at $10m Australian dollars ($7.7m; 4.9m), according to Qantas.
Shares of Qantas were down 1.4% in Sydney in reaction to the news.

        <MainBody>Tesco's sales decline in UK slows
26 June 2015
From the section Business
Tesco has reported a slower rate of decline in sales at its UK stores as it tries to stem the flow of customers switching to discount chains.
UK sales fell 1.3% for the three months to the end of May, compared with a 4% decline a year earlier.
The result beat analysts' forecasts of a fall of 1.6%-3%, and was better than the 1.7% fall reported in the fourth quarter of the last financial year.
Tesco chief Dave Lewis said it was a "step in the right direction".
"We are fixing the fundamentals of shopping to win back customers and relying less on short-term couponing," he said.
Shares in Tesco were up 3.4% in morning trade.
Including its international businesses, sales across the Tesco group dropped 1.3% in the quarter compared with a 3.4% dip a year ago.
Mr Lewis, who took the helm in September, is trying to revive the fortunes of Britain's largest supermarket after it reported the worst loss in its history in April.
Tesco reported a full-year pre-tax loss of 6.4bn, one of the largest in UK corporate history. About  4.7bn of the losses were the result of the fall in property value of its UK stores, 43 of which it said would close.
Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor
To understand why Tesco is slowly turning the corner, it is worth looking at the rather mundane world of the humble ham sandwich.
Tesco now offers 30% fewer sandwich lines after it realised that the wide range it was selling meant that customers often could not buy their favourite, simple sandwich, like, say, one with ham in it.
So, it reduced the range and increased the supply of the top sellers. Customers were happier that they could buy what they wanted and the number of transactions increased.

The trading update from Tesco comes ahead of an annual meeting of shareholders later.
Tim Bush of pension advisers Pirc told the BBC's Today programme that investors are likely to question payoffs for Tesco's former chief executive and finance director Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee, who shared 2.2m in severance pay after the supermarket said it was "contractually committed" to make the payments.
The pair, who left the firm last year, were awarded 1,217,000 and 970,880 respectively.
The payments were initially suspended while Tesco investigated last year's 263m accounting scandal.
"Things have stopped getting worse but they haven't yet started getting better," said Mr Bush.
Tesco said data from researcher Kantar Worldpanel had also shown that 180,000 more customers shopped at the supermarket in the 12 weeks to 24 May.

Woolworths is Australia's largest supermarket chain but faces stiff competition from discount rivals
Shares in Australia's biggest supermarket chain Woolworths have risen as much as 5% in Sydney on media reports of a possible takeover.
The Australian newspaper reported fresh rumours that US private equity giant KKR had a bid that could be "almost ready" for consideration.
It would be one of the biggest deal in Australia's corporate history, the newspaper said.
The news comes amid turbulent times for the supermarket chain.
Woolworths' media team made no comment in relation to the takeover rumours, while KKR's media team in Australia was unavailable for comment.

Turbulent times
Earlier this month, Woolworths announced that its chief executive, Grant O'Brien, was stepping down after nearly four years.
The firm also said it had plans to cut about 1,200 jobs. The changes are aimed at cutting millions of dollars in costs and improving sales after Woolworths' first-half profits fell.
The retail giant has been up against rivals such as Coles and Aldi and it has been trying to win more customers with improved stores and competitive pricing.
Woolworths recently cut its profit guidance for the year to June 2015.

        <title>Fifa chief Blatter 'did not resign'</title>
        <Link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33284185</Link>

        <MainBody>Sepp Blatter: Fifa president says he did not resign
Sepp Blatter says he has not resigned as Fifa president.
The 79-year-old Swiss was thought to have ended his 17-year reign on 2 June amid claims of corruption in world football's governing body.
But, according to Swiss newspaper Blick, Blatter told a party at a Fifa museum: "I did not resign. I put myself and my office in the hands of the Fifa congress."
Blatter is thought to be considering standing for re-election as president.
Two criminal investigations into alleged Fifa corruption began in the week that Blatter was elected for a fifth term in charge.
Four days after being voted president, Blatter - who is reportedly under investigation in the United States - said: "While I have a mandate from the membership of Fifa, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football.
Blatter resigns as Fifa president
"Therefore, I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective congress. I will continue to exercise my functions as Fifa president until that election."
However Blatter did not use the words 'resign' or 'resignation'.
Meanwhile, Blatter may not attend the final of the Women's World Cup in Canada because of the twin investigations into Fifa by American and Swiss authorities.
He would normally present the trophy to the winning team, but Fifa will not confirm whether Blatter or secretary general Jerome Valcke will attend.
A Fifa spokesperson said: "In terms of the Fifa president and the Fifa secretary general, their future travel plans will be confirmed in due course."

The 2013 champion is in the opposite half to top seed Novak Djokovic, who takes on German Philipp Kohlschreiber - ranked 33rd in the world.
Third seed Murray, 28, could face Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals and Roger Federer in the semi-finals should he progress that far.
British women's number one Heather Watson plays 32nd seed Caroline Garcia.

The Serb, who has played no competitive grass-court tennis before Wimbledon, is in the same half of the draw as Swiss fourth seed Stan Wawrinka, who beat him in the final of the French Open earlier this month.
Scot Murray, whose first-round match will be on Tuesday, has won his two previous meetings against Kukushkin, both of which were on Australian hard courts in 2012.
The world number three looked in impressive form when he beat Kevin Anderson on Sunday to secure a fourth Queen's Club title.
With Nadal only seeded 10th, Murray could face the two-time winner as early as the quarter-finals, should both men reach that point.
Nadal could face eighth seed and fellow Spaniard David Ferrer, who starts against Britain's 110th-ranked wildcard James Ward, in the fourth round.

        <MainBody>India's Satam Singh Bhamara creates NBA draft history
Satnam Singh Bhamara has made history as the first India-born selection in the NBA draft.
The 19-year-old 7ft 2in centre, who comes from a small Punjab village, was the 52nd overall pick to the Dallas Mavericks.
The draft gives NBA teams the chance to sign up the best college and young international talent.
Fellow teenager Karl-Anthony Towns was chosen by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the first pick.
Towns, 19, averaged 10.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots a game last season for the University of Kentucky.
But New York Knicks fans were unhappy with their team's selection Kristaps Porzingis, booing the announcement of the Latvian's acquisition as fourth choice.
"These people don't know me, might think I'm soft, European, a bust," said the 19-year-old, who is aiming to become the third Latvian to play in the NBA. "I'm different. It's my passion that sets me apart."

        <Description>JK Rowling announces the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will open in London's West End next year.</Description>
        <MainBody>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to open in 2016
26 June 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
JK Rowling is the author of the seven Potter novels and three companion books
JK Rowling has announced her Harry Potter stage play will open in London's West End next year.
Called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it will tell the "untold part" of the boy wizard's story, including the story of the lives of his murdered parents.
However, the author said on Twitter the play was "not a prequel".
It will run at the Palace Theatre in the summer of 2016, with tickets on sale this autumn.
Rowling said she chose to make the announcement on Friday because it was "a very special day" - the 18th anniversary of when her debut book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was first published in the UK.
But she was tight-lipped about the plot of the play, saying she did not "want to say too much more, because I don't want to spoil what I know will be a real treat for fans".
She added: "To answer one inevitable (and reasonable!) question - why isn't Cursed Child a new novel? I am confident that when audiences see the play they will agree that it was the only proper medium for the story."
The play was first announced in December 2013, after the author said she had "received countless approaches" over the years "about turning Harry Potter into a theatrical production".
Although the new story has not been written by Rowling, it is a collaboration between herself and writer Jack Thorne - who previously adapted Let The Right One In for the stage and won a Bafta for his work on Channel 4's This is England '88 - and John Tiffany, who will also direct the play.
It will be produced by Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, and British singer Imogen Heap will provide the music.
Analysis - Tim Masters, entertainment correspondent
The plot details might still be hazy, but there's little doubt Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will have a magical effect at the West End box office.
It will be at the 1,400-seat Palace Theatre, which was home to theatrical blockbuster Les Miserables for a record 19 years.
JK Rowling's success needs no introduction, but the new Harry Potter play reunites the creative dream team behind the stage adaptation of supernatural love story Let The Right One In.
When it comes to West End hits, producer Sonia Friedman has a golden touch.  Her biggest successes include Book of Mormon and Sunny Afternoon, while her musical Bend It Like Beckham kicked off to rave reviews this week.
When it opens in summer 2016 the play is likely to spark the kind of Potter-mania that surrounded the release of the books and films.
And it won't end there. The stage show will be closely followed by the Potter film spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in November 2016.
Eddie Redmayne will star in a movie adaptation of Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
"Jack, John and Sonia Friedman are a dream team," Rowling said.
"It has been a huge pleasure to share with them (and soon, with you!) this untold part of Harry's story."
Producers originally said the play would explore "the previously untold story of Harry's early years as an orphan and outcast".
"Featuring some of our favourite characters from the Harry Potter books, this new work will offer a unique insight into the heart and mind of the now legendary young wizard," they said.
The Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye claimed The Cursed Child would "delve into what happened to Harry's parents before they were killed by Lord Voldemort, forcing an infant Harry to be raised in miserable circumstances by his mother's sister, Petunia, her horrid husband Vernon and their spoiled son Dudley".
Rowling's seven Harry Potter best-sellers were adapted into eight blockbuster films starring Daniel Radcliffe as the boy wizard.
The author is making her screenwriting debut on Potter spin-off film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, starring Eddie Redmayne, due in cinemas next November.

        <MainBody>Arrest warrant issued for street artist Shepard Fairey
26 June 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
Fairey faces a prison sentence for malicious damage
Street artist Shepard Fairey is wanted by police in Detroit after they say he tagged buildings across the city.
An arrest warrant has been issued for the designer, best known for creating the "Hope" image of President Obama during his 2008 election campaign.
Just because he is a well-known artist does not take away the fact that he is also a vandal
Detroit police sergeant Rebecca McKay
He was commissioned to paint a huge, 18-storey mural in Detroit last month but police say he used his down time to plaster buildings with posters.
The warrant accuses him of two counts of malicious destruction of property.
Each is punishable by a prison sentence and a $10,000 (6,347) fine.
"When you're in Detroit, we welcome your work, Shepard Fairey, your commissioned work, not your Wild West work," Detroit police sergeant Rebecca McKay said.
"Just because he is a well-known artist does not take away the fact that he is also a vandal," she added.
However, Fairey laughed off the charges, calling them "hilarious".
The artist, who has been arrested 17 times in his 20-year career, told the Independent he did not know what the warrant would amount to.
"Sometimes it's a day or two in jail. Normally the charges get downgraded. Most of the arrests aren't for serious stuff," he said.
The Detroit mural took five days to complete
Fairey's commissioned work was the largest mural of his career - a 184ft by 60ft stencil on the side of an office block, which took  more than 300 cans of spray paint to complete.
It featured many of his recurring motifs - lotus leaves, a peace sign, the scales of justice and a stylised image of the late wrestler and Princess Bride star Andre The Giant.
But Fairey had told local newspaper The Detroit Free Press he intended to tag buildings during his visit.
"I still do stuff on the street without permission. I'll be doing stuff on the street when I'm in Detroit," Fairey said.
Fairey's portrait of Barack Obama became a symbol of the 2008 presidential election
The artist's murals can be seen in Philadelphia, New York and Paris (pictured)
Police say that between 16 and 22 May, Fairey pasted nine posters, including some with the face of Andre the Giant on buildings around the city, causing damage totalling $9,105.54 (5,779.20).
Detroit is trying to shed its reputation as a haven for illegal street artists. Last summer, Mayor Mike Duggan formed a quality-of-life task force targeting graffiti and building code violations. The team has since apprehended about a dozen people suspected of vandalism.
"Whether it's appealing to the eye or not, it is a crime," Ms McKay said. "He is well aware of the law, and instead of respecting the city of Detroit he took us two steps back."

26 June 2015
From the section Entertainment &amp; Arts
Actor Patrick Macnee, star of The Avengers TV series, has died in California at the age of 93.
The Briton, best known for playing John Steed in the 1960s television spy show, died at home with his family at his bedside, his son Rupert said.
Macnee, who served in the Royal Navy during World War Two, also played roles in theatre, appearing on Broadway.
Avengers co-star Dame Diana Rigg paid tribute, saying: "Patrick was a very dear man and I owe him a great deal".
A statement on Mcnee's website read : "Wherever he went, he left behind a trove of memories."
He died peacefully at his home in California's Rancho Mirage on Thursday, Rupert said.
Patrick Macnee reprised his John Steed role for The New Avengers TV series, starring alongside Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt
James Bond ally
Born in London, Macnee grew up in Berkshire and was educated at Summerfields Preparatory School and Eton.
At the age of 11, he acted in Henry V opposite a young Sir Christopher Lee. He first appeared in the West End while still in his teens.
He played a number of minor roles - including one in Laurence Olivier's 1948 film version of Hamlet - before rising to fame in the original Avengers series between 1961 and 1969.
The series developed a cult following around the world, with Macnee portraying the quintessentially English and mysterious super-spy John Steed.
Steed was known for his dress sense, always donning a bowler hat and carrying an umbrella, which was used as a secret weapon. He never used a gun.

His co-stars during the initial run included Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg and Linda Thorson.
Macnee returned when that series was reprised as The New Avengers in the 1970s, appearing alongside Joanna Lumley's Purdey and Gareth Hunt's Mike Gambit.
Later, he starred on Broadway in Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth, touring internationally with that play and several other productions.
He also appeared in the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill, playing an ally of Roger Moore's Bond character, and made a cameo appearance as the head of a record company in This is Spinal Tap.
Sir Roger tweeted: "So very sad to hear Pat Macnee has left us.
"We were mates from 1950s and I have so many happy memories of working with him. A true gent."
Thorson, who played assistant Tara King, remembered Macnee as "a paradox".
"He was the best-dressed man on television and a nudist in real life," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"He was always upbeat. He had great stories and great detail and wonderful energy," she continued. "Patrick [had] a very happy and long life and the most wonderful children who took the greatest of care of him, in the last decade in particular."
Macnee also featured as a guest star in dozens of British, American and Australian TV productions; and made a cameo in Oasis's video for Don't Look Back In Anger.
He scored a top 10 hit of his own in 1990, with Kinky Boots - a novelty song recorded with Avengers co-star Honor Blackman - which was championed by Radio 1's then-breakfast DJ Simon Mayo.
'Ahead of their time'
In a 2014 interview with The Lady magazine, Macnee said he believed The Avengers was a success because it "did something different and did it better."
He told the magazine : "It was beautifully written, the ideas were very good, way ahead of their time and they incorporated fantasies for people who dreamed of doing exciting things."

Macnee had two children, son Rupert and daughter Jennifer, and one grandson.
He was married three times, including to actress Katherine Woodville, with whom he acted in The Avengers.
He had been a US citizen since 1959, according to the AP news agency.

        <MainBody>Lebanon pivotal to Iran's reach across Middle East
By Kevin Connolly BBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut
26 June 2015
From the section Middle East
The Baalbek festival takes place against a backdrop of turmoil and war just across the border
On the road to Baalbek, in the hot afternoons of Ramadan, the Bekaa Valley shimmers in the midsummer sun.
The soaring columns of the ruined temples of Baalbek are one of the glories of the ancient world - but there are few tourists around these days to admire them.
Lebanon's own civil war petered out 15 years ago, leaving tensions smouldering below the surface of daily life. Syria's is raging uncontrollably just a few kilometres up the road.
The town is cradled by snow-capped mountains and surrounded by emerald fields under sapphire skies - but the bewitching quality of the landscape isn't enough to attract visitors in the numbers that Baalbek's economy needs.
Tourists are understandably risk-averse, and the proximity to Syria is enough to deter all but the bravest.
So, not for the first time, Baalbek is hoping that its cultural festival will bring the visitors flooding back. It has worked before.
In the dreary years after the Second World War, the Baalbek festival - held against the spectacular backdrop of the ruined temples - was a sign that better and brighter days lay ahead.
Now, after it was suspended in recent years because of the fighting in Syria, the festival is to open again this summer.
Pragmatic course
It is a fact of political life in this part of the Bekaa Valley that a decision of this magnitude requires the consent of Hezbollah - the powerful Lebanese militia founded and funded by Iran.
Its local dominance indeed may also be a factor in keeping visitors away.
Hezbollah, of course, is heavily committed to the fighting in Syria where it is the most disciplined and effective element in the coalition struggling to keep Bashar al-Assad in power.
But even as it is engaged in a vicious civil war with strong sectarian overtones on the Syrian side of the border, it has demonstrated in Lebanon a pragmatic ability to coexist with rival communities in the context of a demographic patchwork which is rather similar to Syria's.
No-one should be under illusions about the nature of that coexistence, of course - most Lebanese assume, for example, that Hezbollah was behind the car bomb that killed the powerful Sunni politician Rafik Hariri in February 2005.
But optimists believe it shows that Hezbollah's sponsor Iran is prepared - to some extent at least - to be flexible and pragmatic about the way it exercises influence in the Middle East.
Hassan Hamad from the Baalbek Municipality told me: "The moderate social policy that Hezbollah follows here helps to keep Lebanon safe from terrorism and from the Syrian war.
"They recognise that Lebanon is Lebanon - it isn't Iran and it isn't Europe."
New 'Cold War'
Now, this all matters because an old order is disintegrating in the Middle East - the order imposed by France and Great Britain on the ruins of the Turkish Empire which collapsed here at the end of the First World War.
The US-led Western Alliance is still a player in the battle for influence now raging but the real struggle is between Shia Islam under Iranian leadership  and a grouping of Sunni powers led by Saudi Arabia.
Shia Iran and regional Sunni powers view each other with deep suspicion
In Yemen, Iraq and Syria, their proxies fight each other - you could draw a modern comparison with the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union or perhaps more accurately with the division of Europe in Catholic and Protestant camps in the 16th and 17th Centuries.
To some extent, Iran's modern leaders are reviving an ancient Persian appetite for influence in the Arab world. In Beirut, political commentator Charmine Narwani told me that West does not work hard enough to understand the changing Middle East from Iran's point of view.
She says there is resentment in Tehran that the country is always portrayed as a destabilising force with dangerous nuclear ambitions, and points out that Iran is in the frontline of a battle with Sunni extremism which is hostile to the West as well as to Shia Islam.
"Iran is probably Ground Zero - a centre for the fightback against Islamic State and al-Qaeda and Sunni extremists in the region," she said.
"The only boots on the ground fighting this fight in earnest are backed, funded and supported by Iran."
That analysis may underplay the role that the Kurds are playing in fighting Islamic State in Iraq but it does help to explain why everyone in the Middle East is talking about Iran.
State-with-a-state
The US-led Western powers are currently seeking a political deal with Iran in which the lifting of crippling economic sanctions could be traded for some sort of verifiable cap on Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But even as those long negotiations approach what will probably prove to be a protracted end-game, the underlying attitude towards Iran remains one of suspicion.
That is partly, of course, because Iran is a revisionist power which feels it has the right to export revolution.
But it is partly because of the way in which Hezbollah - so pragmatic in Lebanon - has emerged as the cutting edge of Iranian power on a wider stage.
In that role, it has been blamed by the West for bomb attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets as far afield as Bulgaria and Argentina.
Hezbollah, which began as a force against Israel, has grown into a major social, political and military movement
And within Lebanon, Hezbollah may offer a glimpse of how Iran sees the future of the Middle East.
What was created as a vehicle to fight Israeli forces of occupation in Lebanon in the 1980s has grown into a powerful state-within-a-state.
Equipped and funded by Iran, it comfortably outguns the Lebanese Army and has perhaps 25,000 fighters under arms.
The movement has social and political responsibilities, too, in its own areas like southern Lebanon but Iran does not seem to aspire to a Hezbollah takeover of the whole country - partly, at least, because it does not need to.
Nothing can happen in Lebanon unless Hezbollah agrees to it and for now it enjoys many of the advantages of being a state - like possession of a powerful army - without the problems that would come from responsibility for Sunni, Christian or Druze regions.
Strategic vision
It is possible that Iran may hope to create other similar non-state Shia entities elsewhere in the Middle East, especially if old multi-confessional nation-states like Syria and Iraq turn out to have reached the limit of their viability.
It does help to explain why Hezbollah is so important to Iran.
I have heard it argued that Iran's involvement is not really about using Hezbollah to maintain President Assad in power - it is more about keeping Mr Assad in office to maintain the land-bridge through which it supplies Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
Iran is heavily involved in supporting Syria's regime in the war, seeing Damascus as a critical gateway to Lebanon
At a turbulent time in the Middle East, when it feels like influence is up for grabs, Iran has a strategic vision and it brings to it a sense of purpose and energy which other regional players appear to struggle to match.
So when Baalbek holds its festival this summer, it may feel as it has felt before, like a sign of better days to come in the Middle East.
But make no mistake - this is a time of profound upheaval based on deep rivalries between regional powers like Iran and the Gulf monarchies.
And the changes that will flow from that upheaval are far from over.

From the section Magazine
Renee Richards made history when she walked out on to the centre court of the Forest Hills stadium to play in the 1977 US Open. She was the first transgender woman to play in a professional tennis tournament.
"I had a very good and full life as Dick but I had this other side of me that kept emerging and that kept pushing back, until finally it just wasn't possible to submerge Renee any more and Renee won out," Richards says.
Born Richard Raskind, tennis was a huge part of her life from an early age. She was captain of the men's tennis team at Yale University and later, while serving in the Navy as a medic, won the All Navy Tennis Championship.
She forged a career as a successful eye surgeon, and at a time when the major tennis tournaments were only open to amateurs - professionals were only allowed to compete from 1968 - she took part in the US Open several times as a man.
"I was just another young doctor, married and with a child, practising medicine and having a great life," Richards says.

Renee Richards spoke to Sporting Witness on the BBC World Service
But she says it always felt like there were two personalities competing inside her.
As a child, she used to dress up in her sister's clothes. "It gave me some relief and I felt good doing that... Recently Bruce Jenner [Caitlyn Jenner], who's a very famous athlete, is beginning a transition and talked about the same thing. I gave myself the name Renee, which actually means 'reborn' - I didn't even know that."
Richards had gender reassignment in 1975 at the age of 40 and moved to California to start a new life. But when she started competing in tennis tournaments her 6ft 2in (1.88m) frame and trademark left-hand serve began to attract attention - and after she won the La Jolla Tennis Tournament in July 1976 a journalist reported that she had previously competed as a man.
"My world kind of blew up on me when people found out who I was," she says.

Her critics said it was unfair for her to play in women's competitions because she would have an unfair advantage in terms of strength.
But it's more complex than that, says Richards. "Of course the men are stronger and they do hit the ball harder but there are other variables too. Serena Williams sometimes gets her serve up greater than 120mph and some of the men don't serve as hard as 120mph."
Controversy raged over whether Richards should be allowed to play. The US Open was just a few weeks away, but for the first time in its 95-year history a chromosome test was made a prerequisite for female entrants.
"I never had any intention of playing in the US Open... but when they said, 'You're not allowed to play,' that changed everything. I said, 'You can't tell me what I can or cannot do - I'm a woman and if I want to play in the US Open as a woman I'm going to do it,'" she says.
Richards was invited by a friend to compete in the South Orange Open in New Jersey, which took place just before the US Open, but more than 20 women players boycotted the event in protest. She reached the semi-final. Then she set about suing the United States Tennis Association for gender discrimination - and found the odds firmly stacked against her.
"The Tennis Association and the people on the other side had top New York lawyers. They brought in witness after witness that said I shouldn't be able to play and it was a big case. Then on my side, my lawyer Mike Rosen, he only had one witness for me," says Richards.

But that witness proved crucial - she was one of the greatest players in the history of the women's game, a former world number one who was still playing on the circuit.
"My lawyer handed over an affidavit from Billie Jean King that said she had met me, that I was a woman, that I was entitled to play, and that I couldn't be denied. And that was it. We won.
"It was very dramatic, and we all went out and got drunk after we got the verdict," says Richards.
The court victory prompted her to turn professional, but she then faced a struggle to get other players to accept her.
"I had death threats, I had people that hated me, I had people that told me I was immoral, and people told me I was awful. There were some players who would walk off the court when I played them or they wouldn't play me at all.
"There was a lot of objection in the beginning and then finally they realised I was OK and I wasn't going to take everybody's money away and gradually a lot of those that had been against me ended up being very good friends of mine.

"I was 43 years old and embarking on a professional career playing against Chrissie Evert, Tracy Austin, and Andrea Jaeger, and they're all 19 and 20 years old. So I had a pretty good disadvantage in terms of age but I said, 'I'm going to do it for a little while and see how I like it,'" says Richards.
In the first round of the women's singles at the 1977 US Open Richards faced that year's Wimbledon champion, Virginia Wade.
"I was on centre court in the stadium at Forest Hills and Virginia Wade had been used to that situation her whole life and I hadn't been. No matter how much good tennis I had played as an amateur there's nothing that compares to playing as a pro in the US Open on centre court.
"I remember she beat me pretty easily in the first set, 6-1. We had a very close second set as I got going and she finally won it 6-4, and that was it.
It was in the women's doubles at the same 1977 Grand Slam that Richards would achieve her best result.
"In the doubles nobody gave my partner Betty Ann Stuart and I much of a chance because nobody had ever heard of us. We won the first round and the second and then all of a sudden we're in the finals of the US Open doubles. We played Martina Navratilova and Betty Stove and we lost to them 7-6 in the second set.
"We stood up there on the podium at Forest Hills on that beautiful Indian summer day, and the band was playing, and they were presenting the prizes. I turned to my partner Betty Ann after we received the silver bowl for being the runners up and I said under my breath, 'Next year we'll be back here for the gold bowl.'"

As it happened, Stuart did not return, and although Richards returned with another partner the following year they were knocked out in the second round.
Richards continued to play in the US and Latin America until retiring in 1981. Despite being banned from tournaments in Europe she briefly reached 20th position in the Women's Tennis Association world rankings.
"I never beat any of the first five women in the world. I didn't beat Martina, I didn't beat Chrissie Evert, but I did have wins over some of the players in the second five. So I was up there but I wasn't at the very top," she says.
After retiring Richards remained in tennis and coached Martina Navratilova to victory in all of the four Grand Slam tournaments. Afterwards she resumed her career as an eye surgeon and now, aged 80, she is planning on retiring later this year.
She is the only player in history to play top-level tennis in both the men's and women's competitions. Initially, Richards says she was overwhelmed by the thousands of people who would try to catch a glimpse of her at tournaments.
"I was not set out for that. I mean I wouldn't say I was reclusive, because I wasn't - I was captain of every team I was on - but I was a quiet person and I lived a private life and now all of a sudden everybody in the world knows who I am.
"I became a public figure, a reluctant pioneer, for all of the disenfranchised groups in the world, no matter whether they were transgender, gay or lesbian."

        <title>Why bankers believe Greece will do a deal with its creditors</title>
        <Link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33283005#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa</Link>
        <Description>Why bankers think Greece and the EU will eventually agree</Description>
        <MainBody>From the section Business
comments
It is going to be 24 hours from hell for Greek bankers (and of course for the Greek people).
Senior bank executives tell me they have more than enough cash in their branches to meet whatever demand for withdrawals there may be today - and in fact they believe that the rate of withdrawals by worried customers will remain at a lower level than at the beginning of the week.
"We're OK" says one.
And what about next week? "There is going to be a deal [between the Greek government and its creditors]. That is certain".
His certainty is not based on the increasingly sceptical and wary tone of statements and comments from ministers and officials in Brussels, crucible of the negotiations.
It stems from financial logic. If there were to be no deal, the consequences for the Greek banking system would be cataclysmic - and the knock-on to the Greek economy would be dire.
Bankers have been warned by the Bank of Greece, the Greek central bank, that no deal means the probable end of emergency liquidity assistance, or the loans they receive both to finance withdrawals by worried investors and to fund vital short-term loans to the Greek government.
if you woke up tomorrow to be told that there was no way of getting money out of your bank, you will understand why this is not a prospect any rational minister or banker would wish to contemplate
So it also means, they've been told (as if they needed telling), that the Greek government would have to impose capital controls - or severe limits on cash withdrawals - were the liquidity tap to be turned off.
However there would be several days of bank holidays, or branch and ATM closures, before customers were permitted to withdraw any money under the circumstances of capital controls - because legislation would need to pass through the parliament to impose such controls.
If you conduct a thought experiment about what it would mean if you woke up tomorrow to be told that there was no way of getting money out of your bank, you will understand why this is not a prospect any rational minister or banker would wish to contemplate.
Apart from the short-term blow to confidence and economic activity, the current drought of lending by banks would turn into a nuclear winter.
Greek businessmen tell me it is hard enough - and ludicrously expensive - for them to finance investment and exports right now. In the circumstances of capital controls, many Greek companies would collapse, because the banks would no longer have the capacity to provide any credit at all - pending the recapitalisation, or resurrection, of the banking system.
The point is that Greek banks not only have a liquidity problem, a chronic problem borrowing and taking in deposits. Their solvency would also be in question - because something like a third of all their loans are classed as "non-performing" (borrowers are struggling to keep up the payments) and because around a half of their capital resources are tax-refund claims (so-called deferred tax assets) on a government seen to be close to defaulting on its obligations.
So in the unlikely event that you have missed the point, today's talks in Brussels are not just about whether Greece can make its 1.5bn-euro payment to the IMF next week. It is about whether the Greek banking system can be maintained as a going concern.
But don't however conclude please that the Greek government has everything to lose and its creditors - eurozone governments, the ECB and the IMF - will be immune from harm if it all goes spectacularly wrong.
The damage to the eurozone, and indeed to the wider European Union, would be potentially devastating.
Here are just a few illustrations.
The hard and painful reality of the Greek banking system in turmoil would lead, inevitably, to capital shifting from banks in economies perceived to be weaker - Portugal, Spain and Italy, inter alia - to the stronger north, especially Germany.
This would increase the cost and decrease the availability of finance in those weaker economies, and stymie their nascent recoveries. It would also widen the damaging economic inequality between the eurozone's flourishing north and its struggling south.
The only beneficiary, arguably, of Greek anomie would be a Russia under President Putin looking for new allies
Second, there would probably be colossal losses for the European Central Bank and therefore for eurozone taxpayers.
Having provided, directly and via the Bank of Greece, something like 120bn euros of loans to Greek banks, the ECB has in effect financed around 100bn euros of capital flight from Greek banks. Of this an estimated 45bn euros is cash under mattresses and buried in gardens, with the rest moved to overseas banks.
All of that cash and exported money represents hard "promises to pay" by the European Central Bank. By contrast the collateral it has received for its loans from the Greek government would be of questionable value.
The reputational damage to the European Central Bank, were it to incur severe losses, could imperil its primary responsibility - namely to maintain confidence in the euro as a store of value.
Without a deal, would the protests in Greece turn to riots?
And finally, if you get back to that thought experiment of what it would mean for an entire banking system to be closed for days and impaired for months, it would be naive to expect anything but fury from Greek people. Recriminations would fly against their own government and - inevitably - against Germany and the rest of the eurozone.
Diplomats working in Athens have told me of their anxiety that there would probably be riots. There is a risk of political extremists seizing this bleak day.
Social breakdown in Greece, the cradle of civilisation, would be more than embarrassing for the European Union. If the EU means anything, it means a collective endeavour to provide peace and stability in Europe.
The only beneficiary, arguably, of Greek anomie would be a Russia under President Putin looking for new allies.
So just maybe Greek bankers are right when they tell me that agreement will imminently be reached between Greece and its creditors - because the alternative is nightmarishly unthinkable.

        <MainBody>South Africa frustration at Marikana deaths inquiry
By Milton Nkosi BBC News, Johannesburg
26 June 2015
From the section Africa
A total of 44 people died during the strike, including 34 in one police operation
President Jacob Zuma's release of the 600-page Marikana report has sparked yet another national conversation about the rule of law in South Africa.
This follows hot on the heels of the Omar al-Bashir controversy , and the trials of Oscar Pistorius and Shrien Dewani .
Was the report a whitewash? Ferial Haffajee, editor of the weekend newspaper City Press, tweeted : "Sticking my neck out: I don't think 'whitewash' sticks."
Many South Africans took to social media to condemn the report, especially its recommendations.
They wanted to see a huge political figure, such as Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, take responsibility for his actions.
At the time, Mr Ramaphosa was a shareholder in Lonmin, the owner of the Marikana mine.
But President Zuma was reading the commission's recommendations. These were not his findings.
Some South Africans wanted to see Cyril Ramaphosa (left, pictured with Jacob Zuma) found guilty
Reports of this nature appear to be simple but they are full of legalese. A lot of the conclusions are left to interpretation or suggest another investigation.
One can sympathise with the people who lost loved ones three years ago and are utterly frustrated by the idea of yet another inquiry.
If an investigation is launched by prosecutors, the trial might drag for a very long time, meaning victims and relatives may never find closure.
While the report apportions some fault to the unions who took part in the wildcat wage strike, much of the blame is aimed squarely at the police .
Police Chief Riah Phiyega seems to be the highest-ranking person likely to take the hit.
Some of her junior staff are vulnerable too, such as the regional police chief of the North West province, Lieutenant-General Zukiswa Mbombo.
President Zuma called the deaths at Marikana "horrendous tragedy"
Just before police opened fire on the miners, Lt Gen Mbombo told the media: "Today is D-Day: we are ending this matter".
Last month, she announced she was retiring.
There does not seem to be any politician who is going to take responsibility for the killings of the 44.
There is no way President Zuma could afford to let his trusted deputy Cyril Ramaphosa shoulder some of the blame because that would jeopardise the current leadership succession plan.
If Mr Ramaphosa had to go to prison for sending emails asking the police minister to intervene at the mine during the violent wage strike, there would be a gaping hole in the post-Zuma ANC leadership line-up.
Once the dust settles, we will see whether the police chief will voluntarily step down or if she leaves the man who appointed her no choice but to fire her.
The sad part of this saga is that there are no talks of reparations for the miners who died and most of them were breadwinners.

        <Description>Can a game explain the crisis facing Greece?</Description>
        <MainBody>Can game theory explain the Greek debt crisis?
26 June 2015
From the section Magazine
The Greek finance minister is an expert in game theory. Could this help predict how the Eurozone negotiations will turn out, asks Marcus Miller, professor of economics at the University of Warwick.
Game theory is what its name implies. It's the use of games to study behaviour and decision-making.
The most famous game of all is the Prisoner's Dilemma. Imagine two prisoners have to choose between confessing and staying silent. If they both stay silent, they both go to jail for one year. If one confesses and the other stays silent, the first goes free and the second gets 20 years. If both confess, they both get five years.
Neither can communicate with the other. So, rationally, what should each do? Sadly for the prisoners - but not the jailer - the answer is for both to confess.
Now, take the situation facing the Greek government, which needs a deal with its eurozone partners within days to secure to avoid defaulting on its debts. Will it have the same unfortunate outcome as the Prisoners' Dilemma?
Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, spent his academic career (which included teaching posts at the University of Essex and the University of East Anglia) studying game theory.
In February 2015, he denied that he was "busily devising bluffs, stratagems and outside options" using game theory to "improve upon a weak hand".
Nevertheless, game theory should apply in situations like this where the outcomes for each player depend on the actions of both. The world being an uncertain place, random chance may also play a role - game theory takes account of this, too.
The Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is an expert on game theory
So how might Varoufakis have visualised negotiations with the rest of the eurozone panning out?
He may well have drawn a decision-tree like that shown below, with Greece and the eurozone partners as key players. He would also include random outside factors, referred to in game theory jargon as "nature", which may also affect the outcome.
The outcomes, known as payoffs, of each player when the game ends are shown in brackets - so (1, 0) would be a good payoff for Greece and a bad one for the eurozone, whereas (1,1) would be good for both and (0,0) would be bad for everyone.
So what does the decision tree imply?
Imagine Greece moves first to avoid default by putting a plan on the table. This plan involves new taxes on the wealthy and changes to pensions - avoiding spending cuts and and having some of its debts written off in exchange. If this plan is accepted by the rest of the eurozone, then Greece is content. Let's give its payoff a score of 1.
To work out how the rest of the eurozone will respond, one has to see what they stand to gain by accepting Greece's plan, or by rejecting it.
If the eurozone accepted this deal, the monetary union would remain intact, but it would have to ease its strict rules on fiscal policy and take a loss on holdings of Greek debt. Let's give the eurozone payoff a score of . So the overall payoff is (1,  ).
What if the eurozone rejected the deal? Then Greece, unable to pay its creditors on time, would be in what is called "technical default".
What follows next is not at all clear. Let's look at two possibilities.
First there could be "Grexit" - Greece alone leaves the eurozone but the other members live happily ever after.
Second, Greek departure leads to the collapse of the eurozone.
The first scenario is likely to be pretty bad for Greece but not for the eurozone - a payoff of (0,1). The second is bad for everyone - the payoff is (0,0).
The truth, of course, is that no one really knows which of these will transpire - here is where nature throws the dice. If the two prospects are equally likely, the expected payoffs look pretty bad for both players.
So what is the bottom line? Faced with the messy prospect of letting Greece slide into default - and the significant risks of chaos that this entails - it looks better for eurozone partners to avert default and accept the Greek plan - or a watered-down version of it - after all.
This is better for Greece too - so unlike the Prisoner's Dilemma both players avoid the bad stuff.
This may be what has been concluded - if so, there will be a settlement with no technical default at the end of the month. But a lot depends on how well the agreed plan works. If it is a botched job, the drama may be repeated. Such is the game of life.
More from the Magazine
Game theory can be described as the mathematical study of decision-making, of conflict and strategy in social situations. It helps explain how we interact in key decision-making processes.

        <Description>High-end designer goods proving big business in Iran</Description>
        <MainBody>Why a luxury-shopping revolution is coming to Iran
By Amir Paivar &amp; Camelia Sadeghzadeh BBC Persian
26 June 2015
From the section Middle East
From the roadside billboards advertising Rolex and Louis Vuitton, to the glitzy shopping centres that have sprung up across Tehran, it's clear that big brands are becoming big business in Iran.
After decades of austerity following the Islamic Revolution , middle-class Iranians have developed a taste for high-end designer goods, and for Tehran's young rich, shopping has become the new religion.
"Exposure to foreign trends through travelling, the internet and satellite television has created a desire for branded products," says Bahar, a 30-year-old fashion blogger.
"Showing off is a big part of the story. By spending huge amounts of money on big brands, well-off Iranians want to show they've made it."
Living the high life
One group of super-rich young Tehranis have taken showing off to new levels with their own Instagram site - Rich Kids of Tehran , where without any perceptible sense of irony, they post pictures of their designer clothes and designer lifestyles.
When the site first appeared last year it prompted fury and resentment among poorer Iranians and the conservatives who dominate Iran's political and legal institutions.
But the Rich Kids seem undeterred by the controversy.

Recent postings include pictures of Tehran Fashion Week and a question about where people are going on holiday this year - the responses range from Italy and Istanbul to Japan and Dubai.
Because luxury brands are still the preserve of the rich, they don't yet show up in the Iranian Customs Authority's list of top 100 imports.
But there is an indication of the potential for growth in the most recent figures for cosmetics imports.
In the year to March 2015, cosmetics made up 0.1% of the country's $52bn (32.8bn) total imports - many of them big name brands snapped up by increasingly image-conscious consumers.
Mall envy
Iranians shop at the main old bazaar in Tehran
In big cities all across Iran, traditional bazaars now face fierce competition from American-style urban shopping centres where big name Western brands are on conspicuous display.
But although these luxury shopping centres look exactly the same as retail outlets anywhere in the world, the designer goods on display have actually been brought in by third-party importers via Turkey and the Gulf States.
The outlets that sell them have no connection to the big brand manufacturers.
Big Western fashion brands are not banned from doing business in Iran.
But international banking sanctions in place against Iran over its nuclear programme make it very difficult for them to get their profits out.
To date Spanish clothing retailer Mango, Italian fashion boutique Benetton, and luxury women's designer Escada, are among the very few Western companies to open shops in Iran.
Strict Islamic dress code in Iran also applies to advertising, so companies either have to show women fully covered, or just show the clothes on their own
The backdoor way in which foreign brands are imported into Iran means they are more expensive than they would be abroad, but so far this doesn't seem to be deterring the shoppers.
Mariam, an office worker who earns the equivalent of just $17,000 a year, has just blown more than a month's salary on a new Burberry bag.
She bought it online from an Iranian website that offers clothes and accessories from big brands and Western High Street retailers.
The site takes payments via local credit cards, and offers a free home-delivery service.
In the vanguard: Luxury retailers in Iran
Luciano Benetton
Benetton was the brainchild of Italian Luciano Benetton, who launched the company back in 1963 with his sister and two brothers.
Benetton now has about 5,000 stores, employing more than 10,000 people.
Mango was founded in Barcelona, Spain, launched on the web in 2005, opening its first shop in 2000.
Mango now has 2,731 stores in 105 countries.
Escada was founded in 1978 by Margaretha and Wolfgang Ley in Munich, Germany.
Escada has shops in 80 countries worldwide.
Mariam told BBC Persian she would rather pay more for good-quality brand names than cheaper but inferior, locally made equivalents.
But she concedes that status also plays a big role in how she decides to spend her money.
"There's a lot of pressure on middle-class people to go out wearing designer clothes or an expensive watch," she says. "Personally I feel more confident when I'm wearing brands."
'Untapped market'
Fashion houses like Burberry currently have no control over this so-called "grey market" of their brand names in Iran.
But that is clearly something which could change.
Despite years of sanctions, the International Monetary Fund puts Iran's per capita GDP (gross domestic product) at $16,500.
That means Iranian consumers on average have more money to spend than their counterparts in emerging markets like Brazil, China, India and South Africa.
With the prospect of banking sanctions being lifted if a nuclear deal is finally reached, the big brands are waking up to the potential of a barely tapped market which could offer big dividends in the future.
