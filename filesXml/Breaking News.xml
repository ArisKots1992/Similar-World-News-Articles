ATHENS, Greece - The latest developments on Greece's bailout negotiations (all times local):
___
4:10 p.m.
Greece's finance minister is suggesting that his country might not pay the 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) it owes to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.
Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis refused to reply to a direct question Sunday on the payment. Instead, he told BBC radio that the European Central Bank should pay the money to the IMF out of the profits it made on Greek bonds in 2014. Varoufakis calls that idea "a very sensible transfer."
Asked directly, for the second time, whether Greece will pay up Tuesday, Varoufakis replies: "We are owed money by one part of the troika and we owe money to another part of the troika? Why don't they sort themselves out and transfer money from one pocket ... to the other?"
___
3:35 p.m.
The European Central Bank has announced it is maintaining emergency credit to Greek banks at its current level.
The decision keeps a key financial lifeline open but does not provide further credit to Greece's banks, which are seeing deposits drain away as anxious Greeks withdraw savings.
The ECB said it was working closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability and added it could reconsider the decision on credit levels.
ECB head Mario Draghi said "we continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro-area economies."
___
3:20 p.m.
France's prime minister is urging Greece and other nations to do whatever they can to keep Greece in the 19-nation bloc that uses the euro currency.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Sunday that "we don't know  none of us  the consequences of an exit from the eurozone, either on the political or economic front. We must do everything so that Greece stays in the eurozone." He was speaking on France's i-Tele TV.
Valls added that "means respecting Greece and democracy, but it's also about respecting European rules. So Greece needs to come back to the negotiating table."
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' call for a national referendum on creditors' demands has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil.
___
2:35 p.m.
Germany's Foreign Ministry is advising travellers to Greece to ensure they have enough cash on them before they depart.
An updated version of the ministry's travel advice issued Sunday noted that people seeking to withdraw cash in Greece could face "significant waits" and possible shortages at cash machines.
Worried Greeks were lining up at ATM machines on Sunday, the day after the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on creditors' financial proposals in return for rescue loans and creditors refused to extend Greece's international bailout beyond Tuesday.
While some machines in Greece were running out of cash, others were being replenished. Another top Greek financial official urged Greeks on Sunday to remain calm and not withdraw all their savings.
___
1:45 p.m.
The European Central Bank faces a major decision.
It has been allowing Greek banks to draw emergency credit from Greece's central bank, a financial lifeline that has been keeping Greece's four major banks going during the country's tense bailout negotiations with creditors. The ECB has been slowly increasing the emergency credit to compensate for the increase in withdrawals from Greek banks.
But the ECB has said it can only continue such assistance if the banks are basically solvent. A failure by Greece's government to get more aid before its bailout ends Tuesday and a big payment to the International Monetary Fund is due could prompt the ECB to decide the Greek banks are not financially solid any more.
Capping the aid would quickly force Greek banks to limit withdrawals  but such controls could take Greece a step closer to leaving the 19-nation eurozone.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said it's up to elected officials to decide Greece's fate. Analysts say the central bank wants to give politicians every chance to negotiate a deal.
___
12:50 p.m.
Two opinion polls indicate most Greeks want to keep using the shared euro currency and would prefer a deal with Greece's European partners rather than a rupture.
The polls published Sunday were both conducted before Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared early Saturday that he was calling a referendum on financial proposals made by Greece's creditors in return for continuing to fund the country with bailout loans. Still, they provide an indication of public sentiment.
In the poll by Alco for the Proto Thema Sunday paper, 57 per cent said they believed Greece should make a deal with its EU partners while 29 per cent wanted a rupture. A separate poll by Kapa Research for the To Vima newspaper found 47.2 per cent of respondents would vote in favour of a new, painful agreement with Greece's creditors, compared to 33 per cent who would vote no and 18.4 per cent undecided.
Both nationwide polls were conducted from June 24-26. The Alco poll had a margin of error of 3.1 per cent while Kapa Research's was 3.09 per cent.
___
12:25 p.m.
A Greek finance official says the government expects the European Central Bank to continue approving emergency liquidity assistance that Greek banks can draw even after Tuesday, when Greece's international bailout officially expires.
The ECB was expected to meet Sunday to decide what action to take about Greece. The central is bank is under pressure to end that emergency assistance.
A decision by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call for a national referendum on creditor demands in exchange for bailout loans has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil. In response, other nations in the 19-nation eurozone are refusing to extend Greece's bailout program beyond its Tuesday expiration date.
Alternate Greek Finance Minister Nadia Valavani told private Mega television on Sunday "we are expecting the funding of Greek banks to continue normally via the ELA after Tuesday."
Worried Greeks have formed lines at ATM machines all weekend and some machines were running out of cash Sunday morning.
Valavani said the country's banks could see "business as usual" next week if they receive the emergency support "so long as there is calm" and Greeks don't attempt to withdraw all their savings.

Gunmen opened fire on a beach popular with tourists in Tunisia on Friday, killing at least 27 people, the country's interior ministry said.
Tunisia's Interior Ministry told NBC News that at least six people were injured in the attack in the Mediterranean city of Sousse and that one attacker had been killed. The interior ministry said the operation was ongoing.
Gary Pine, a product manager from the U.K., told NBC News he was one of dozens of vacationers on the beach when the attack took place not far from his hotel, the El Mouradi Palm Marina.
He said he initially thought he was hearing firecrackers but that "it was only when you could hear the bullets whizzing through the air that we realized it was gunfire." His 22-year-old son saw one person get shot, Pine added.
He said guests started running off the beach and were told to go to their rooms by hotel staff, he said. Some guests ran back out onto the beach to get their room keys, he added.
The entertainment manager at the hotel, who only gave his first name, Hamouda, said guests had told him two gunmen "came from the sea" and attacked the beach. He confirmed that staff had told guests to hide in their rooms.
Sousse, some 150 kilometers from Tunis, is a popular resort for both Tunisians and Europeans.

Bomb diffused in train station in Upper Egypt's Beni Suef
An improvised bomb attack in Egypt on Friday halted trains between Cairo and the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, but left no casualties, security officials said.
A home-made bomb went off near the city of Damanhour, some 70 kilometres from Alexandria, director of security Maj. Gen. Mohamed Fathy said. 
The blast left no casualties, he said, but caused damage to the railway line, bringing train movement to a halt.
Railway lines are frequently targeted by anti-government militants operating in Egyptian cities.
Bomb explosions in Kafr El-Zayat in the Nile Delta briefly halted Cairo-Alexandria trains in February.
Similar attacks also disrupted services in the southern city of Aswan and in the Nile Delta city of Zagazig the previous month.
No casualties were reported in relation to the incidents.

Katherine Burdick-Crow
Sunday, June 28, 2015 10:03AM
CARY, NC (WTVD) --
The Cary Police Department has charged four people with murder in a hit-and-run that left 16-year-old Green Hope High School student Katherine Burdick-Crow dead.
They're identified as:
Jourdan Chanquion Mack, 20, of Rambling Hill Drive, Morrisville
Beth Strange, 18, of Fallborough Court, Morrisville
Abijah James Masse, 17, of Narrow Leaf Drive, Morrisville
Joshua Odell Simmons, 17 of Autumn Day Drive, Morrisville
PHOTOS: Hit-and-run suspects
Around 9:20 p.m. on Friday, police and emergency services got a 911 call from Lawrence Road near the entrance of Walnut Street Park from a witness who came up on the scene and said the teen may have fallen off or out of a car.
"Apparently, she was on a car and fell off and a gentleman is here with blood all over his face. He is acting very strange. He said not to call the police but I am calling you cause this girl, I don't feel a pulse or anything, so someone needs to get here very quickly," reported the caller.
Emergency workers tried frantically to save the teen but she died.
Cary police said they believe the four charged got together with Burdick-Crow to make a drug deal, but in the course of the transaction Burdick-Crow was robbed and became involved in an altercation with the suspects.
During the struggle, Burdick-Crow fell from a pickup truck driven by Simmons as the suspects fled the scene.
The Ford F150 has been located by police and processed for evidence.
Although arrests have been made, police say anyone with information is still encouraged to contact the Town of Cary Police Department at (919) 469-4012 or file a report anonymously with Cary Crime Stoppers at (919) 460-4636. Crime Stoppers pays up to $2,500 for the arrest or indictment of those responsible for committing certain types of crimes. All calls will be kept CONFIDENTIAL at the caller's request.

The Ebola crisis proves the World Health Organization (WHO) lacks the "capacity and culture" to deal with global health emergencies, says a damning independent report, commissioned by the WHO itself.
The review panel says WHO was too slow to act to get on top of the deadly virus which has now killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.
And it calls for an urgent overhaul of the organisation.
WHO says it has plans for reform.
It has already admitted that it waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern.
Inaction
The disease began spreading in December 2013, but it took until August 2014 for WHO to sound the alarm. By that point, more than 1,000 people had died of the virus.
The death toll now stands at more than 11,000.
According to the report, WHO lacked a culture of rapid decision-making.
In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent about the seriousness of the situation but these "either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance".
"There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action," the report says.
WHO was also criticised for failing to keep governments and the public up to speed about the extent and severity of the outbreak.
But the review praised WHO for playing a critical role in pushing forward work to find new treatments and cures for Ebola.
And it said WHO should be given the job of leading future health emergency responses - be that for Ebola or an outbreak of pandemic flu, for example.
It suggests an immediate contribution from all member countries towards a $100 million special outbreak response fund, and says WHO should establish a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response.
The panel's head, Dame Barbara Stocking, former chief executive of the charity Oxfam, said the WHO must now be made fit for the task.
"To me, coming from somewhere like Oxfam which is an emergency culture, you are very much, if you like, on the front foot. You are always trying to prevent a situation coming through or grab it when it starts and really get it under control very fast and those are some of the internal changes that have to be made at WHO."
The WHO said it was "already moving forward on some of the panel's recommendations including the development of the global health emergency workforce and the contingency fund to ensure the necessary resources are available to mount an initial response".
Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said: "The recommendations outlined by the independent panel should give WHO the mandate it needs to lead the global response to future health crises. The proposal to establish a WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response is encouraging.
"It's essential that this new body is accountable and can show leadership in the face of emerging health threats, with the authority and independence to act quickly when needed. The support of the global community is also crucial if we are to avert another catastrophe on the scale of Ebola."

Iran, big powers plan to keep negotiating beyond June 30
VIENNA, June 28
VIENNA, June 28 The six nations seeking to negotiate a long-term agreement with Iran to curb the most sensitive parts of its nuclear programme plan to continue negotiating beyond Tuesday's deadline, a senior U.S. official said.
The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said Washington was not troubled by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif's decision to return to Tehran overnight, saying it was always expected that ministers would come and go from Vienna as the nuclear talks heated up.
Iran's Tasnim news agency reported that Zarif would return to Austria on Monday.    (Reporting By Arshad Mohammed and Louis Charbonneau)

        <MainBody>NI driver killed in Belgium school trip bus crash
28 June 2015
From the section Northern Ireland
A bus driver from Northern Ireland has been killed in a coach crash in Belgium.
He was on a bus carrying 34 school children from an Essex school in the UK.
Another driver, also from Northern Ireland, has been seriously injured.
A pupil from Brentwood School who was on the bus suffered a head injury and is in intensive care. It is understood that three pupils and two teachers are in hospital.
The bus company, Richmond Coaches, is from Lisburn, County Antrim.
The bus overturned on the A18 (E40) at Middelkerke, West Flanders at 09:45 local time (08:45 BST).
Eyewitnesses said it crashed into a motorway bridge pillar.
West Flanders traffic police confirmed that one person is dead and one is injured.
A rescue worker carries students' backpacks from the bus
Thirty-one children and three teachers walked away from the crash.
The children from Brentwood School were all aged from 11 to 13 years old.
Ian Davies, the school's head teacher said: "There are three children in hospital. We don't know the full extent of their injuries.
"I know that one boy has a head injury which is being monitored very carefully.
"I have spoken to the lead teacher on the trip. He is in hospital, I think he broke his collar bone, but seemed in as good a shape as could be expected."
A spokesman from Richmond Coaches of Ballinderry Road, Lisburn, confirmed that one of its vehicles had been involved in the crash.
He said what had happened was "a tragedy" and the company was co-operating with the authorities.
He said the company's thoughts were with everyone involved and they were cooperating fully with the authorities.
Janna Rommel-Opstaele, the mayor of the nearby coastal town of Middelkerke, told press agency Reuters that the bus driver had been killed and another seriously injured.
"Some of the children with light injuries have been taken to hospital and local medical centres," she said.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were aware of the crash and were working with  the Belgian authorities to establish details.

Plan to increase Sunday shopping hours in Britain
LONDON  The British government announced plans on Tuesday to allow shops to open longer on Sundays to compete with online shopping and global tourist destinations like Paris and New York.
Finance Minister George Osborne said he wanted to give mayors and local authorities the power to decide Sunday shopping hours in his budget, which will be unveiled on Wednesday.
"It is clear that there is still a growing appetite for shopping on a Sunday," Mr Osborne said.
"The rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend."
A previous bid to reform Sunday shopping hours proved controversial and failed amid protests in 2006, and Mr Osbornes plan is expected to meet opposition from unions and the Church of England, which has defended a common day off on Sunday as important for "family stability and community life".
Britains existing 1994 law prevents larger shops from opening for more than six hours on Sundays, a rule that was relaxed during the London Olympics in 2012.
Mr Osborne described the Olympics trial as a success and said there was a "growing appetite" for Sunday trading in high streets and retail parks, but said that the decision would be not be made nationally. "This wont be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities," Mr Osborne said.
The Treasury has said that Britain has fallen behind as France recently relaxed its laws to allow shops to open more frequently on Sundays, while New York has no restrictions.
In Britain, shops larger than 280 square metres can open for a maximum of six hours between 10am and 6pm on Sundays.
Retail campaign group the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) said the change would force small shops out of business.
"Existing Sunday trading laws are a popular compromise that balance the needs of consumers, shopworkers, small stores and families," said ACS chief executive James Lowman.
"The short period of time that small stores are open while large stores are shut is a crucial advantage for convenience stores, most of which are owned by small businesses."

        <Description>Irish couple confirmed dead in Tunisia beach attack, bringing confirmed toll for Ireland to 3 - @rtenews</Description>
        <MainBody>MORE RELATED CLIPS +
The couplehave one daughter.
Mr Hayes was a school bus inspector with Bus ireann and had worked at the company for 20 years, beginning as a bus driver in Galway.
The companyextended its sympathy to the couple's family, andfriends as well as Mr Hayes' colleagues.
Garda and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs are liaising with the family.
The third Irish victim is Lorna Carty, a mother-of-two from Robinstown in Co Meath.
She was on holidayin the popular beach resort of Sousse with her husband Declan when the attack happened.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan urged people travelling to Tunisia to exercise extreme caution.
"I'm not in the business of imposing travel bans but I would say to people be extremely vigilant and extremely cautious in implementing any holiday plans in the region and keep in close contact with the tour operators and the police authorities."
Tour companies have already evacuated thousands of holidaymakers from Tunisia following the attack in which 38 people died, the majority of whom were British.
Tunisia's tourism minister called the attack a "catastrophe" and authorities vowed to toughen security, drafting in army reserves and arming tourism police at beaches and hotels.
Sousses tourism commissioner said more than 3,000 foreign tourists had left the town yesterday, including around 2,200 British and nearly 600 Belgians.
The British Foreign Office confirmed that 15 Britons had died in the attack, which was carried out by a lone gunman.
Among the British citizens killed was Joel Richards, 22, who played for James Connolly Gaelic Football Club in Birmingham and was also actively involved in Birmingham County FA Youth Council.
Sad to learn that one of those killed in Tunisia was Joel Richards, who played Gaelic Football for the James Connolly club in Birmingham.

Mr Richards' uncle, 46-year-old Adrian Evans and his 78-year-old grandfather Patrick Evans, were also killed in the attack.
His 16-year-old brother Owen survived.
Lincolnshire Photographer Carly Lovett, 24, was killed as were Sue Davey and her partner Scott Chalkley from Staffordshire.
Another British couple, Jim and Ann McQuire from Cumbernauld, are also among the dead.
Tunisian studentSaif Rezgui opened fire on the beach of the Imperial Marhaba hotel before making his way to the pool and hotel before being shot dead by police.
Tunisian authorities said Rezgui was not on any watchlist of known potential militants.
But one source said he appeared to have been radicalised over the last six months by Islamist militant recruiters.
The self-styled Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for the attack.
It identified the gunman asAbu Yahya al-Qayrawani - a "soldier of the caliphate".
Several thousand Tunisian jihadists have gone to fight in Syria, Iraq and neighbouring Libya, where some have set up training camps and vowed to return to attack their homeland.
Traveller safety 'paramount' - Sunway
A spokeswoman for Irish tour operator Sunway saidit istrying to contact as many of its customers as possible, including a large number who no longer want to travel to Tunisia.
Sunway said while it is still flying to Tunisia, traveller safety is paramount and it will be guided by the Department of Foreign Affairs.
The 177 people due to travel to Tunisia next Friday are being offered a full refund or a change of destination depending on availability.
Tanya Airey confirmed a high proportion wanted to change their destination and Friday's flight to Monastir is being kept under review.
For departures from 10 July, passengers can cancel for a fee, stay with Tunisia, or be offered a chance to switch to another destination.
There will be no full refunds for departures from 10 July.
Sunway is also facilitating those traveled to Tunisia despite the attack with 59 of the 177 booked on Fridays flight deciding not to go to Tunisia.
"We are holding welcome meetings for them at hotels," Ms Airey said, adding that many of the hotels are at another resort around half an hour away from Sousse where the attack occurred.
Sunway only deals with a proportion of Irish holidaymakers to Tunisia.
Many others are travelling with English companies who are taking direction from the British Foreign office.

ATHENS, Greece (AP)  The latest developments on Greece's bailout negotiations (all times local):
___
4:10 p.m.
Greece's finance minister is suggesting that his country might not pay the 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) it owes to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.
Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis refused to reply to a direct question Sunday on the payment. Instead, he told BBC radio that the European Central Bank should pay the money to the IMF out of the profits it made on Greek bonds in 2014. Varoufakis calls that idea "a very sensible transfer."
Asked directly, for the second time, whether Greece will pay up Tuesday, Varoufakis replies: "We are owed money by one part of the troika and we owe money to another part of the troika? Why don't they sort themselves out and transfer money from one pocket ... to the other?"
___
3:35 p.m.
The European Central Bank has announced it is maintaining emergency credit to Greek banks at its current level.
The decision keeps a key financial lifeline open but does not provide further credit to Greece's banks, which are seeing deposits drain away as anxious Greeks withdraw savings.
The ECB said it was working closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability and added it could reconsider the decision on credit levels.
ECB head Mario Draghi said "we continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro-area economies."
___
3:20 p.m.
France's prime minister is urging Greece and other nations to do whatever they can to keep Greece in the 19-nation bloc that uses the euro currency.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Sunday that "we don't know  none of us  the consequences of an exit from the eurozone, either on the political or economic front. We must do everything so that Greece stays in the eurozone." He was speaking on France's i-Tele TV.
Valls added that "means respecting Greece and democracy, but it's also about respecting European rules. So Greece needs to come back to the negotiating table."
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' call for a national referendum on creditors' demands has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil.
___
2:35 p.m.
Germany's Foreign Ministry is advising travelers to Greece to ensure they have enough cash on them before they depart.
An updated version of the ministry's travel advice issued Sunday noted that people seeking to withdraw cash in Greece could face "significant waits" and possible shortages at cash machines.
Worried Greeks were lining up at ATM machines on Sunday, the day after the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on creditors' financial proposals in return for rescue loans and creditors refused to extend Greece's international bailout beyond Tuesday.
While some machines in Greece were running out of cash, others were being replenished. Another top Greek financial official urged Greeks on Sunday to remain calm and not withdraw all their savings.
___
1:45 p.m.
The European Central Bank faces a major decision.
It has been allowing Greek banks to draw emergency credit from Greece's central bank, a financial lifeline that has been keeping Greece's four major banks going during the country's tense bailout negotiations with creditors. The ECB has been slowly increasing the emergency credit to compensate for the increase in withdrawals from Greek banks.
But the ECB has said it can only continue such assistance if the banks are basically solvent. A failure by Greece's government to get more aid before its bailout ends Tuesday and a big payment to the International Monetary Fund is due could prompt the ECB to decide the Greek banks are not financially solid any more.
Capping the aid would quickly force Greek banks to limit withdrawals  but such controls could take Greece a step closer to leaving the 19-nation eurozone.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said it's up to elected officials to decide Greece's fate. Analysts say the central bank wants to give politicians every chance to negotiate a deal.
___
12:50 p.m.
Two opinion polls indicate most Greeks want to keep using the shared euro currency and would prefer a deal with Greece's European partners rather than a rupture.
The polls published Sunday were both conducted before Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared early Saturday that he was calling a referendum on financial proposals made by Greece's creditors in return for continuing to fund the country with bailout loans. Still, they provide an indication of public sentiment.
In the poll by Alco for the Proto Thema Sunday paper, 57 percent said they believed Greece should make a deal with its EU partners while 29 percent wanted a rupture. A separate poll by Kapa Research for the To Vima newspaper found 47.2 percent of respondents would vote in favor of a new, painful agreement with Greece's creditors, compared to 33 percent who would vote no and 18.4 percent undecided.
Both nationwide polls were conducted from June 24-26. The Alco poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percent while Kapa Research's was 3.09 percent.
___
12:25 p.m.
A Greek finance official says the government expects the European Central Bank to continue approving emergency liquidity assistance that Greek banks can draw even after Tuesday, when Greece's international bailout officially expires.
The ECB was expected to meet Sunday to decide what action to take about Greece. The central is bank is under pressure to end that emergency assistance.
A decision by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call for a national referendum on creditor demands in exchange for bailout loans has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil. In response, other nations in the 19-nation eurozone are refusing to extend Greece's bailout program beyond its Tuesday expiration date.
Alternate Greek Finance Minister Nadia Valavani told private Mega television on Sunday "we are expecting the funding of Greek banks to continue normally via the ELA after Tuesday."
Worried Greeks have formed lines at ATM machines all weekend and some machines were running out of cash Sunday morning.
Valavani said the country's banks could see "business as usual" next week if they receive the emergency support "so long as there is calm" and Greeks don't attempt to withdraw all their savings.

GERMAN broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 and publishing company Axel Springer are in talks to combine their businesses in a transaction that would shake up the media market in Europes biggest economy, people familiar with the matter said.
The two companies combined market capitalisation is about 14.4bn. The media companies envision a tie-up with ProSiebenSat.1 emerging as the senior partner, according to the people.
Shares in ProSiebenSat.1 gained 3.5% in early trade on Tuesday, while those in Axel Springer rose about 6% in response to the news.
Negotiations remain at an early stage and could still break down, the people said. A deal would face several issues, including regulatory scrutiny.
A tie-up could let the companies jointly tackle the challenge of new digital rivals. Still, industry bankers and lawyers said the deal would face antitrust hurdles.
Axel Springer is Europes biggest newspaper publisher and ProSiebenSat.1s channels together have the highest market share among nonstate-controlled broadcasters in Germany.
Both trail closely held Bertelsmann, Germanys largest media company, which posted revenue last year of 16.7bn. ProSiebenSat.1 and Axel Springer together reported revenue of about 5.9bn.
The two companies know each other well. Axel Springer in 2005 launched a takeover bid for ProSieben that valued the Munich-based broadcaster at more than 4bn. The deal was rejected a year later by Germanys federal cartel office and the local media watchdog KEK.
But last year, Germanys federal administrative court ruled that the KEKs refusal was unjustified, potentially removing at least one obstacle from a transaction. Industry bankers and lawyers said the rise of digital rivals had changed the competitive landscape and could facilitate a deal. But they added that getting approval could require the companies to shed some assets.
Unlike 10 years ago, ProSieben is now the larger company with a market capitalisation of about 9.7bn. Axel Springer is currently valued at about 4.7bn.
Axel Springer owns Germanys best-selling daily, Bild, and daily Welt. It also bought news broadcaster N24 from ProSieben last year.
Both companies have launched initiatives to fight off newcomers and build new revenue streams. Video-on-demand platforms like Netflix or Amazon.com are increasingly grabbing market share from traditional broadcasters, undermining their viewer base and threatening advertising revenue.
ProSiebenSat.1 in April extended a licensing deal with Warner Bros International Television Distribution to continue broadcasting Hollywood blockbusters. And in a move to boost nonadvertising-related revenue sources, ProSieben in June spent 170m for an 80% stake in Verivox, Germanys largest independent consumer portal for comparing energy prices.
Axel Springer, meanwhile, is finding itself under pressure from free content offered by internet rivals that are hurting print publications. The Berlin-based company in April last year sold off newspaper titles, including Hamburger Abendblatt and other local papers, instead investing in online platforms including job board Stepstone and property portal Immonet.
A deal would require approval of Friede Springer, widow of founder Axel Springer, who owns 57% of the company. CE Mathias Dpfner holds 3.1% and stock investors own the remaining free float.
ProSiebenSat.1 said it recorded a domestic market share of 28.9% of the free-TV market in the first quarter. German broadcaster RTL in June said its market share stood at 28.6%.

        <Description>Disney World will ban selfie-sticks from its theme parks beginning Tuesday - @orlandosentinel</Description>
        <MainBody>1
Visitors will be told of the policy in locations such as the parking lots and at the resort's hotels. The prohibition will be added to the park rules post on Disney World's website.
The issue has been building at Disney. Previously, the sticks were prohibited from its rides, and "no selfie-sticks" signs were at select rides, such as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Magic Kingdom. Cast members have given verbal warnings to rule breakers.
Several incidents preceded the change, but officials have been discussing the rules for some time, Disney said. This week at Disney California Adventure park, a roller coaster was halted after a passenger pulled out a selfie-stick. The ride was closed for an hour.
Selfie-stick users put smartphones and cameras on the ends of poles to extend their reach, frequently capturing theme-park moments through self-portraits. The tools have been banned in public places  including some museums and stadiums  worldwide for obstructing views or causing safety issues.
Disney World already prohibits items such as skateboards, inline skates, wagon, folding chairs and glass containers, according to its official website, which also lists other items that we determine may be harmful or disruptive.
Universal Orlando has prohibited banned selfie-sticks and other loose items from certain thrill rides at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure theme parks, but it has not instituted parkwide bans. SeaWorld Orlando also does not keep the sticks from entering the parks.

ATHENS, Greece (AP)  The latest developments on Greece's bailout negotiations (all times local):
___
4:10 p.m.
Greece's finance minister is suggesting that his country might not pay the 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) it owes to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.
Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis refused to reply to a direct question Sunday on the payment. Instead, he told BBC radio that the European Central Bank should pay the money to the IMF out of the profits it made on Greek bonds in 2014. Varoufakis calls that idea "a very sensible transfer."
Asked directly, for the second time, whether Greece will pay up Tuesday, Varoufakis replies: "We are owed money by one part of the troika and we owe money to another part of the troika? Why don't they sort themselves out and transfer money from one pocket ... to the other?"
___
3:35 p.m.
The European Central Bank has announced it is maintaining emergency credit to Greek banks at its current level.
The decision keeps a key financial lifeline open but does not provide further credit to Greece's banks, which are seeing deposits drain away as anxious Greeks withdraw savings.
The ECB said it was working closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability and added it could reconsider the decision on credit levels.
ECB head Mario Draghi said "we continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro-area economies."
___
3:20 p.m.
France's prime minister is urging Greece and other nations to do whatever they can to keep Greece in the 19-nation bloc that uses the euro currency.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Sunday that "we don't know  none of us  the consequences of an exit from the eurozone, either on the political or economic front. We must do everything so that Greece stays in the eurozone." He was speaking on France's i-Tele TV.
Valls added that "means respecting Greece and democracy, but it's also about respecting European rules. So Greece needs to come back to the negotiating table."
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' call for a national referendum on creditors' demands has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil.
___
2:35 p.m.
Germany's Foreign Ministry is advising travelers to Greece to ensure they have enough cash on them before they depart.
An updated version of the ministry's travel advice issued Sunday noted that people seeking to withdraw cash in Greece could face "significant waits" and possible shortages at cash machines.
Worried Greeks were lining up at ATM machines on Sunday, the day after the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on creditors' financial proposals in return for rescue loans and creditors refused to extend Greece's international bailout beyond Tuesday.
While some machines in Greece were running out of cash, others were being replenished. Another top Greek financial official urged Greeks on Sunday to remain calm and not withdraw all their savings.
___
1:45 p.m.
The European Central Bank faces a major decision.
It has been allowing Greek banks to draw emergency credit from Greece's central bank, a financial lifeline that has been keeping Greece's four major banks going during the country's tense bailout negotiations with creditors. The ECB has been slowly increasing the emergency credit to compensate for the increase in withdrawals from Greek banks.
But the ECB has said it can only continue such assistance if the banks are basically solvent. A failure by Greece's government to get more aid before its bailout ends Tuesday and a big payment to the International Monetary Fund is due could prompt the ECB to decide the Greek banks are not financially solid any more.
Capping the aid would quickly force Greek banks to limit withdrawals  but such controls could take Greece a step closer to leaving the 19-nation eurozone.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said it's up to elected officials to decide Greece's fate. Analysts say the central bank wants to give politicians every chance to negotiate a deal.
___
12:50 p.m.
Two opinion polls indicate most Greeks want to keep using the shared euro currency and would prefer a deal with Greece's European partners rather than a rupture.
The polls published Sunday were both conducted before Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared early Saturday that he was calling a referendum on financial proposals made by Greece's creditors in return for continuing to fund the country with bailout loans. Still, they provide an indication of public sentiment.
In the poll by Alco for the Proto Thema Sunday paper, 57 percent said they believed Greece should make a deal with its EU partners while 29 percent wanted a rupture. A separate poll by Kapa Research for the To Vima newspaper found 47.2 percent of respondents would vote in favor of a new, painful agreement with Greece's creditors, compared to 33 percent who would vote no and 18.4 percent undecided.
Both nationwide polls were conducted from June 24-26. The Alco poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percent while Kapa Research's was 3.09 percent.
___
12:25 p.m.
A Greek finance official says the government expects the European Central Bank to continue approving emergency liquidity assistance that Greek banks can draw even after Tuesday, when Greece's international bailout officially expires.
The ECB was expected to meet Sunday to decide what action to take about Greece. The central is bank is under pressure to end that emergency assistance.
A decision by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call for a national referendum on creditor demands in exchange for bailout loans has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil. In response, other nations in the 19-nation eurozone are refusing to extend Greece's bailout program beyond its Tuesday expiration date.
Alternate Greek Finance Minister Nadia Valavani told private Mega television on Sunday "we are expecting the funding of Greek banks to continue normally via the ELA after Tuesday."
Worried Greeks have formed lines at ATM machines all weekend and some machines were running out of cash Sunday morning.
Valavani said the country's banks could see "business as usual" next week if they receive the emergency support "so long as there is calm" and Greeks don't attempt to withdraw all their savings.

        <MainBody>Flickr/Christian Cable Twinkies
(Reuters) - Hostess Brands LLC, the U.S. bakery company whose snack cake brands include Twinkies and Ding Dongs, has pulled itself from the auction block and will instead pursue an initial public offering (IPO), according to people familiar with the matter.
The move underscores the growth prospects of Hostess as well as its quick turnaround. In 2013 the Kansas City, Missouri-based company was picked up from bankruptcy by private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC &lt;apo.n&gt; and consumer industry investor C. Dean Metropoulos for $410 million.
Hostess, which launched a process to sell itself earlier this year, snubbed offers in recent weeks from other companies and private equity firms that valued it at between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, including debt, the people said.
Hostess will now borrow money to pay a dividend to its owners, the people said. It will also begin preparations in the coming months for an IPO that it believes will give it a higher valuation than the acquisition proposals it received, the people added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Apollo declined to comment, while Hostess and Metropoulos did not respond to requests for comment.
Founded in 1930, Hostess is one of the largest wholesale bakers and distributors of breads and snack cakes in the United States. Its products, particularly the golden, cream-filled Twinkies cakes, are deeply ingrained in American pop culture and have long been packed in school children's lunch boxes.
When the company filed for bankruptcy three years ago, it blamed heavy debt and burdensome wage and pension obligations for its financial woes.
Under Apollo and Metropoulos, it relaunched its brands, improved its profitability and regained market share, focusing on distribution channels where it had historically lacked a significant presence, such as dollar stores and vending.
"Operating performance during fiscal 2014 has exceeded our expectations," Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services LLC analysts wrote in a research note last March.
The credit ratings agency noted however that Hostess's market share is still below pre-bankruptcy levels. It has the No. 2 spot in U.S. sweet baked goods, trailing McKee Foods Corp.

Story highlights
Northern Nigeria has seen near-daily attacks on civilian and government targets this month
Bomb rips through government building in Zaria on Tuesday, witness says
More than 200 have died in Nigeria in bombings and gun attacks since July 1
Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)
A bomb killed 25 people at a local government building in north-central Nigeria Tuesday, a state governor said -- marking the latest in a series of recent deadly attacks in a country where the government is battling the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram .
The bomb -- "most likely carried by a suicide bomber" -- exploded at a local government council's office in the Sabon Gari section of the city of Zaria, Kaduna state Gov. Nasir El-Rufai said.  Thirty-two other people were injured and being treated at a hospital, he said.
The building was crowded because residents were welcoming the new chairman of Sabon Gari's interim management committee, El-Rufai said. That leader was taking office Tuesday, and other civil servants were being registered at the building.
A 2-year-old child was among the dead, the governor said.
El-Rufai said extra security forces would be deployed throughout the state. An official statement from the state government called the attack "mindless."
"We call on our citizens to be vigilant and avoid crowded places like markets, mosques, churches and motor parks in the next few weeks," El-Rufai said on Twitter following the incident.
I am sad that a terrorist bomb attack just killed 20 people in Sabon Gari Zaria. May the souls of our innocent departed rest in peace, Amen.
Also Tuesday: In Kenya, at least 14 killed in attack on residential building
Northern Nigeria has seen near-daily attacks on civilian and government targets since last week, leaving more than 200 dead. Witnesses and government officials have blamed last week's attacks on Boko Haram, the terror group that has been fighting the Nigerian government for more than a decade, pushing to bring an extreme version of Islamic law, or Sharia, to the masses.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack in Zaria.
A summary of northern Nigeria's bloody July:
 On July 1, Boko Haram fighters raided villages in northeastern Nigeria's Borno state , killing more than 150 people, witnesses and government officials said.
 On Sunday in Jos state, just east of Kaduna, an explosion ripped through a restaurant full of customers in a shopping complex. Also in Jos that day, attackers shot at a crowded mosque before launching a rocket-propelled grenade at the building. At least 44 people were killed and 47 others were injured in the pair of attacks , said Mohammed Abdussalam, an official at Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency. No claims of responsibility were immediately made.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday called last week's attacks "inhuman and barbaric" and pledged that every last "Boko Haram bandit ... would be hunted down without mercy and compromise."
Elected earlier this year, Buhari vowed to focus on the fight against the terrorist group, which has pledged allegiance to ISIS. But so far, he has struggled to stop the heavy bloodshed in the Northeast.
Along with suicide bombings, Boko Haram has attacked churches and mosques, raided once-peaceful villages and kidnapped people young and old, most infamously more than 200 girls taken in April 2014 from a school in Chibok .
Boko Haram's strongest presence is in northern Nigeria, where the majority of the country's Muslims live. The country's south is largely Christian and animist.

        <MainBody>Confession in French beheading attack as gruesome 'selfie' emerges
By Richard Carter, Stphane ORJOLLET 3 hours ago

.
.
Paris (AFP) - The man suspected of decapitating his boss in an attack on a gas factory in France has confessed to the grisly crime, sources close to the investigation said Sunday.
Yassin Salhi, 35, "has also given details about the circumstances" surrounding the killing, according to the sources, who said he would be transferred to Paris for further questioning later Sunday by anti-terrorist police.
Salhi's confession came after it emerged the married father-of-three sent a gruesome selfie photo of himself and the severed head to a WhatsApp number in Canada.
Investigators have warned however that it could be a relay number and the intended recipient could be anywhere in the world.
After several hours of silence, Salhi has begun to open up to investigators about the assault, which came six months after 17 were killed in Islamist attacks in Paris that began with the Charlie Hebdo massacre.
On Friday morning, Salhi rammed his van into the US-owned Air Products factory near France's second city of Lyon in what President Francois Hollande said was a "terrorist" attack designed to blow up the whole building.
He was overpowered by a firefighter as he was trying to prise open a bottle of acetone in an apparent suicidal bid to destroy the factory.

Police then made the grisly discovery of the severed head of Salhi's boss, 54-year-old Herve Cornara, lashed to the gates of the factory near two flags on which were written the Muslim profession of faith.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls repeated that the world was engaged in a "war against terrorism".
"We cannot lose this war because it's fundamentally a war of civilisation. It's our society, our civilisation that we are defending," Valls told iTELE rolling news channel.
France is facing "a major terrorist threat" which needs to be fought "over the long-term", warned the prime minister.
It's not a question of whether there will be another attack, but "when" and "where", stressed Valls.

Friday's attack came on a day of bloodshed on three continents that saw 38 people mown down on a Tunisian beach and 26 killed in a suicide attack in Kuwait.
The Islamic State extremist group has claimed responsibility for those two attacks but no group has said it carried out the French operation.
Sources close to the investigation said Salhi was radicalised more than a decade ago after contact with Muslim convert Frederic Jean Salvi -- known as "Ali" -- who is suspected of preparing attacks in Indonesia with Al-Qaeda militants.
An autopsy on the victim has proved inconclusive, with experts unable to determine whether he was killed before being beheaded or decapitated alive.
The French probe is naturally focusing on Syria, where hundreds of people from France have gone to wage jihad, officials said.
Anti-terrorist authorities have identified 473 people who have left France to fight in Iraq or Syria and Valls said 1,800 people in France were "linked" in some way to the jihadist cause.
French President Francois Hollande delivers a statement during an EU summit in Brussels on June 26, 
- 'Being here, together' -
Nearly six months after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the attack raised painful memories for France, which is still on high alert for potential repeats.
Around 200 people in the town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier -- where the attack took place -- staged a minute's silence in the victim's honour followed by a rousing and spontaneous rendition of the French national anthem.
One man, Philippe Ouastani, said he came to show solidarity with the victim. "It's unheard of to decapitate someone in the 21st century. What weapons do we have to combat that? Being here, together."
Another woman, wearing the Muslim headscarf, said she was "unable to speak" when she heard the news.
"These acts have got nothing to do with religion. The Prophet never said to kill innocent people," raged the woman, who asked to remain anonymous.
Trying to find the words to explain the killing to her four-year-old son, she said: "There are naughty people who have done bad things. The police will put them in prison to punish them for their silly, silly actions."
Like the Charlie Hebdo attackers and Islamist Mohamed Merah who gunned down soldiers and Jewish children in the southwest city of Toulouse in 2012, Salhi had been known to French security services for "radicalisation" but slipped through the net.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Friday Salhi had been investigated for links to radical Salafists in Lyon, but was not known to have participated in terrorist activities and did not have a criminal record.
Europe has for months been bracing for so-called "lone wolf" attacks by supporters of Islamic State, which has urged its followers to strike wherever they can.
France, which has the highest Muslim population in Europe, last week passed a controversial new spying law granting sweeping powers to snoop on citizens.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The nation's trade deficit rose 2.9% in May, mostly because the U.S. exported fewer aircraft and other manufactured goods. The U.S. trade deficit climbed to a seasonally adjusted $41.9 billion from a revised $40.7 billion in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast a deficit of $42.1 billion. Exports dipped 0.8% to $188.6 billion, hurt by a strong dollar and weaker growth outside the U.S. Imports slid 0.1% to $230.5 billion. The trade deficit has averaged $41.3 billion in the first two months of the second quarter, down from a $43.4 billion average in the first quarter. So the trade deficit is unlikely to be a big drag on U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter like it was in the first three months of the year, when the economy contracted. For the first time since 1990 the U.S. ran a surplus with Canada, the result of lower oil imports and a stronger dollar. The deficits with China and the European Union both rose, however.

Federal authorities raid home of Subway spokesman Jared Fogle in child pornographyinvestigation
ZIONSVILLE, Ind. (July 7, 2015)  Federal authorities raided the home of Subway spokesman Jared Fogle Tuesday morning. FBI sources told FOX59 state and federal investigators were serving warrants at Fogles Zionsville home in connection with a child pornography investigation.
The raid started around 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. An evidence truck could be seen parked in the driveway. Investigators from the FBI and Indiana State Police were at the scene.

Earlier this year, Russell Taylor, the former director of the Jared Foundation started by Fogle, was arrested in a child pornography case . He was accused of possessing and producing child pornography. Investigators said a search of Taylors home turned up more than 500 videos with images of child pornography. In May, Taylor unsuccessfully tried to kill himself while in jail.
Fogle said the foundation severed all ties with Taylor following the arrest. Investigators wouldnt say if Tuesdays raid was connected to that case.
Fogle gained national fame after attributing massive weight loss to eating Subway sandwiches. He was a freshman at Indiana University at the time. He later became a visible presence in Subway ad campaigns, pitching the restaurants sandwiches and touting their health benefits.

        <MainBody>Greece debt crisis: ECB 'to end' bank emergency lending
28 June 2015
From the section Europe
An Athens ATM: The ECB has been sending cash so that Greek banks can continue to lend
The European Central Bank is expected to end emergency lending to Greece's banks on Sunday, the BBC understands.
Well-placed sources told BBC economics editor Robert Peston a decision to end the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) would be made by the ECB's governing council later on Sunday.
Greek banks depend on ELA funds daily.
Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said his government would consider overnight what measures to take "to minimise the burden on our people".
Cutting the ECB lifeline could push Greece out of the euro.
Such an ECB cut would mean "Europe has failed", Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's World this Weekend.
It would mean Europe had "failed in its duty to preserve in parallel a democratic process and a monetary union", he said. "It is a dark hour for Europe."
The lenders have "not met Greece even a quarter of the way", he complained.
The government would consider "what can be done to minimise the burden on our people from Europe's refusal to grant us democratic rights".
A BBC reporter in Athens says long queues are forming at bank ATMs.
The EU-IMF bailout for heavily indebted Greece expires on Tuesday and talks have broken down.
Greek banks would find themselves in serious straits as soon as Monday if the ECB cut the ELA funding, Robert Peston says.
Greece will probably have to announce a bank holiday on Monday, pending the introduction of capital controls, he says.
Historic decision
It is one of the most momentous decisions the ECB has ever faced, since the euro was launched on 1 January 1999.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the ECB "is independent but... I don't think it can cut off rations [for the Greeks]". He said "it's the Greek nation that is suffering".
Capital controls are restrictions on how much customers can withdraw from banks. Until now, the Greek government has signalled that it does not want to impose such controls.
In recent weeks, Greeks have withdrawn billions of euros from banks.
Grexit risk looms
A Greek withdrawal from the euro - known as "Grexit" - is not inevitable, says Robert Peston, as the eurozone did resolve Cyprus's banking crisis in 2013 and the country stayed in the euro.
Capital controls were imposed on Cypriot banks, and remained in place for a long time - the last restrictions were only lifted in April this year.
Greece's situation is more difficult, our editor reports. Capital controls are seen as an important step towards leaving the euro, because the single currency's rules require free movement of capital.
But Greece could remain in if its government and the bailout providers - the EU and IMF - can restart constructive negotiations, he reports.
Greek PM Alexis Tsipras says voters must decide whether the bailout is acceptable
A country on the brink - chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt writes:
It is the most important decision in the ECB's history.
A withdrawal of funding could plunge Greece into chaos and yet the ECB cannot break its own rules by funding a banking system where the country is heading for a default.
Alexis Tsipras has gambled both with his future and that of his country. He committed Greece to a vote, but only after the current bailout has expired, so leaving Greece vulnerable and exposed.
What are the Greek papers saying?
On Saturday eurozone finance ministers - the Eurogroup - refused to extend Greece's desperately-needed bailout beyond Tuesday.
The ministers blamed Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's surprise call for a referendum on 5 July on the bailout conditions.
The final 7.2bn (5bn; $8bn) of Greece's second bailout has been frozen since last summer, as lenders demanded more Greek progress on deep economic reform.
Without more lending to Greece the country will default on a 1.6bn repayment due to the IMF on Tuesday.
Economic pain
Under the rules governing the euro, the ECB's emergency lifeline could not be continued if the ECB considered Greek banks to be insolvent.
Robert Peston says that with Greece no longer participating in a formal rescue programme, the solvency of the Greek state would be in doubt, as it is so intimately linked to the banks' solvency.
Mr Tsipras's leftist Syriza government rejects the bailout terms, after five years of lender-imposed austerity that has increased Greek unemployment and cut pensions and welfare benefits.
Greece has endured five years of recession, and total output (GDP) has shrunk by 25%.
Greek referendum preparations are under way at the interior ministry

Carnival has gained U.S. approval for limited cruises to Cuba as early as next year as part of its recently launched social impact cruising brand, the company said Tuesday.
The tripswhich are cleared under existing U.S. Treasury rules that allow approved travelers to go to the island for cultural and humanitarian exchangesstill need a green light from Cuban authorities.
"We look forward to working with the Cuban authorities for their approval to help make the social, cultural and humanitarian exchanges between U.S. citizens and the people of Cuba a reality," Carnival CEO Arnold Donald said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear what additional Cuban approvals the company would need to launch the Miami-to-Cuba trips.
Source: Carnival
Carnivals Adonia ship is being turned into a new brand called Fathom.
Carnival's efforts come as Washington and Havana attempt to normalize diplomatic relations that were severed more than 50 years ago. The countries last week announced an agreement to re-open embassies in each other's capitals, possibly this month.
The Obama administration has pushed for goods and people to flow more freely between the U.S. and Cuba. The Carnival initiative falls under "fathom," the "social impact" line the carrier launched in June.
Seven-day trips to Cuba would start at $2,990 per person, the company said.

DURHAM (WTVD) --
Vandals spray-painted "black lives matter" on the Confederate monument located next to the old Durham County Courthouse on East Main Street sometime overnight Tuesday.
The attack is similar to ones at the "Silent Sam" Confederate memorial on the campus of UNC Chapel Hill over the 4th of July weekend and another at the Confederate memorial in Durham's Maplewood Cemetery July 1.
The courthouse monument features a statue of a Confederate soldier atop a granite tower decorated with the Confederate seal. At the base of the monument are four cannon balls and two lighted lamps.
The inscription reads "in memory of the boys who wore the gray." It was dedicated in 1924.
Workers were already out Tuesday morning with pressure washing equipment to clean graffiti off the monument.

A bus driver from Northern Ireland has been killed in a coach crash in Belgium.
He was on a bus carrying 34 school children from an Essex school in the UK.
Another driver, also from Northern Ireland, has been seriously injured.
A pupil from Brentwood School who was on the bus suffered a head injury and is in intensive care. It is understood that three pupils and two teachers are in hospital.
The bus company, Richmond Coaches, is from Lisburn, County Antrim.
The bus overturned on the A18 (E40) at Middelkerke, West Flanders at 09:45 local time (08:45 BST).
Eyewitnesses said it crashed into a motorway bridge pillar.
West Flanders traffic police confirmed that one person is dead and one is injured.

Thirty-one children and three teachers walked away from the crash.
The children from Brentwood School were all aged from 11 to 13 years old.
Ian Davies, the school's head teacher said: "There are three children in hospital. We don't know the full extent of their injuries.
"I know that one boy has a head injury which is being monitored very carefully.
"I have spoken to the lead teacher on the trip. He is in hospital, I think he broke his collar bone, but seemed in as good a shape as could be expected."
A spokesman from Richmond Coaches of Ballinderry Road, Lisburn, confirmed that one of its vehicles had been involved in the crash.
He said what had happened was "a tragedy" and the company was co-operating with the authorities.
He said the company's thoughts were with everyone involved and they were cooperating fully with the authorities.
Janna Rommel-Opstaele, the mayor of the nearby coastal town of Middelkerke, told press agency Reuters that the bus driver had been killed and another seriously injured.
"Some of the children with light injuries have been taken to hospital and local medical centres," she said.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were aware of the crash and were working with  the Belgian authorities to establish details.

        <MainBody>Mexico unites against Trump: 'He has no respect for human beings'
WASHINGTON (AP)  Worried about "Republican-on-Republican violence," top party donors are taking action, with one firing off a letter calling for more civility and another seeking to block businessman Donald Trump from the debate stage altogether.
Foster Friess, a Wyoming-based investor and one of the party's top 20 donors in the last presidential contest, issued a letter to 16 White House prospects and the Republican National Committee late last week calling for candidates to stay on the "civility reservation."
"Our candidates will benefit if they all submit to Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment, 'Thou shall not speak ill of a fellow Republican,'" Friess wrote in a letter sent to Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. A copy was obtained by The Associated Press.
In the dispatch, Friess cites the backing of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts. "Would you join the effort to inspire a more civil way of making their points?" Friess wrote. "If they drift off the 'civility reservation,' let's all immediately communicate that to them."
The call for calm comes as the sprawling Republican field shows signs it could tip into a bare-knuckles struggle for the nomination  a scenario that the party's elite donors see as a distressing echo of four years ago.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Monday charged that Republicans don't need Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's "lectures." Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker repeatedly dismisses Republicans in Congress as doing little. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul regularly jabs his Republican opponents by name.
Yet no candidate has injected more provocation into the 2016 Republican presidential primary than Trump.
While few party officials see the reality television star as a credible candidate, he has lashed out at a growing number of Republican critics who have condemned his recent description of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. Trump over the weekend posted a message from another user on his Twitter account charging that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush "has to like the Mexican illegals because of his wife," Columba, who was born in Mexico.
Campaigning in New Hampshire over the weekend, Bush said he "absolutely" took the remark personally. Trump has not apologized, but said Monday evening "somebody else" retweeted the message and "I don't know anything about it" even though it was under his account.

Trump stood firm on his comments about immigrants, saying earlier Monday "the Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States," and "criminals, drug dealers, rapists" are among them. He said "many fabulous people" come from Mexico and the U.S. is better for them, but this country is "a dumping ground for Mexico."
Republican donor John Jordan said Monday that GOP leaders should take steps to block Trump's access to the first presidential debate in early August.
Debate organizers at Fox News Channel, backed by the Republican National Committee, have released guidelines saying the top 10 candidates in national polling will be allowed to participate. Trump would qualify under the current terms, while contenders such as Ohio's two-term Gov. John Kasich would not.
"Someone in the party ought to start some sort of petition saying, 'If Trump's going to be on the stage, I'm not going to be on there with him,'" Jordan told the AP on Monday. "I'm toying with the idea of it."
"It's something I feel strongly about as somebody who not only cares about the Republican Party, but also Latinos," Jordan said.
Even as the other candidates say they're trying to avoid intraparty backbiting, however, they can't seem to avoid it.
In an interview Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Cruz refused to condemn Trump's comments, saying he's not going to perpetrate "Republican-on-Republican violence." Christie, who entered the presidential race last week, wasn't having it.
"I find it ironic, right, that Ted Cruz is giving lectures on Republican-on-Republican violence," Christie said on Fox News, accusing the Texan of sponsoring hardball ads against Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander in the 2014 primaries. "I mean, all due respect, I don't need to be lectured by Ted Cruz."

The Republican National Committee has dramatically reduced the number of primary debates before the 2016 contest largely to avoid the kind of attacks that bloodied their 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney.
As the last GOP nomination heated up in January 2012, Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich got particularly nasty. Gingrich joined Obama supporters in attacking Romney's business background, calling him a "vulture capitalist."
Donors remember those exchanges well and fear a repeat of primary vitriol would lead to another general election loss. "Ninety-nine percent of leading donors saw the candidates carve each other up in the 2012 primaries and come out weaker for it and are determined not to let that happen again," said Fred Malek, who has helped raise money for GOP presidential candidates for four decades.
Responding to Friess' letter, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee wrote he plans on "becoming the nominee by playing a better game, not by breaking the legs of my rivals."
"I hope that we don't commit fratricide again as a party," Huckabee wrote, according to a copy of his response obtained by the AP.
