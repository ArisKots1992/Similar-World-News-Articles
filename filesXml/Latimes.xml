As international negotiators gathered here Saturday for what is supposed to be a final round of nuclear diplomacy with Iran, the hope of achieving a deal hinges on a mystery: What does Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei really want?
An agreement limiting Iran's nuclear program would potentially be the most important diplomatic achievement of the decade, and it has seemed increasingly within reach since April 2, when negotiators reached a tentative deal.
But in recent weeks, Khamenei has moved away from understandings his negotiators had appeared to agree on. In particular, he has said he would refuse to allow international inspectors access to sites of suspected nuclear activity, including military bases.
In 2012, President Obama made it plain in a letter to Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that any attempt to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz would be met with American force. ( Paul Richter )
The six world powers seeking the agreement have called scrutiny of Iran's military sites a necessary part of any deal to prevent Iran from cheating on a nuclear accord. Khamenei and other top Iranian officials and lawmakers have repeatedly insisted that they will refuse such access.
Western officials still believe odds favor a deal after almost two years of bargaining. Some believe Khamenei is only seeking advantage ahead of the June 30 negotiating deadline.
But in Washington and European capitals, concern has deepened in recent weeks that Khamenei may truly be unwilling  or perhaps politically unable  to make the concessions needed to seal a fundamental compromise with foreign powers.
"People expected the Iranians to spout off, then simmer down," said Richard Nephew, who was a member of the U.S. negotiating team until earlier this year. "But they haven't; they've dug in deeper."

As Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other diplomats gathered at a former Habsburg palace here over the weekend, they insisted a deal was within reach, even as they conceded questions that seemed resolved in April are again in dispute.
"Everybody would like to see an agreement, but we have to work through some tough issues," Kerry said Saturday before a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.
Negotiations were expected to continue past the deadline by at least a few days and could last until mid-July. The final days will probably feature threats, all-nighters and perhaps even some theatrical departures, diplomats said.
Those who see Khamenei's tough statements as a negotiating tactic note that each side nonetheless has compelling strategic reasons to want a deal. The U.S. and the five other world powers involved in the talks  Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia  are hoping to postpone the threat of the Iranian nuclear program for at least 10 to 15 years; Iran desperately needs relief from punishing economic sanctions and seeks to end its status as international pariah.
Yet an agreement would be a huge step for an Iranian elite whose authority and personal wealth has been built on four decades of resistance to the United States. And Khamenei knows that among ordinary Iranians, much of the credit for the deal would not go to him and the hard-liners who back him, but to their more moderate rivals, including Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.
"An elite firestorm" over the issues of inspections and the United Nations' desire to look into Iran's past nuclear weapons research has clearly threatened the supreme leader, wrote Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group risk-consulting firm, in a report this month.

Since the April 2 tentative agreement, conservatives in parliament, the religious establishment, state media and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, all key parts of Khamenei's power base, have voiced criticism. There have been mass demonstrations and personal attacks on the negotiators, including during Friday prayers in Tehran.
The idea of inspections on military bases has generated particular controversy, with many in Iran saying the plan offends the country's dignity and treats it in a manner that no other country would allow.
How much Khamenei responds to such pressure remains a matter of intense debate among U.S. and allied officials.
The bargaining that began in September 2013 has allowed U.S. officials insights into the Iranian government they have not had in the 36 years since the Iranian Revolution. They now have regular access to top Iranian officials; U.S. diplomats have a congenial personal relationship with Iran's suave foreign minister, Zarif.
But the 75-year-old Khamenei remains an enigma. Within the U.S. government, opinions differ on the extent to which he is the decider, and on whether he can only struggle to shape a consensus of the most powerful political forces within the Iranian elite.
U.S. analysts see Khamenei as a weaker leader than his predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, who had more charisma and broader public support. Khamenei has struggled to juggle the goals of his hard-line inner circle with public demands for a better economy through an end to sanctions and an increase in foreign investment.
Last July, negotiators thought they had a deal, but Khamenei dashed their hopes just before a deadline by demanding that Iran's nuclear program, instead of shrinking, be allowed to expand many-fold over the course of a deal that he said should last for only seven years. Khamenei's red lines later melted away, as he seemed to accept a sharply constrained uranium-enrichment program and a longer duration for the nuclear deal.
When Khamenei appeared to accept the interim deal in April, some analysts and former U.S. officials said it appeared that the leader was turning out to be a pragmatist, rather than a fire-breathing revolutionary, as he had described himself. Now those judgments are again in doubt, particularly after a nationally televised speech Wednesday in which Khamenei seemed to rule out many of the compromises that Iranian negotiators had accepted.
In the speech, he said Iran must have relief from sanctions at the start of any agreement, not after it had taken verifiable steps to scale back its nuclear program, as previously agreed. He also said Iran wouldn't agree to a decadelong freeze in its uranium enrichment, as stipulated in April.
Khamenei made other provocative statements that appeared aimed at encouraging hard-liners. He claimed that President Obama had secretly offered to recognize Iran as a nuclear state in 2013 and appeared to be boasting that Iran's ability to enrich uranium to 20% put it within easy reach of having material usable in a bomb, noted Ray Takeyh, an Iran specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Khamenei also again ruled out "unconventional" activities by inspectors, including access to military bases and interviews with nuclear scientists.
The supreme leader may have several goals in mind. He may be trying to force a reopening and renegotiation of settled issues, following a pattern seen in past Iranian negotiations. He could be trying to temporarily placate hard-line constituencies at home, with a plan to back off later. Or he could have decided that pressure from the Revolutionary Guard and other conservative institutions has left him no choice but to jettison previous commitments, even if doing so threatens the deal.
Khamenei could pay a huge price for throwing up demands that would sink the deal. Iran could be blamed for a diplomatic collapse, raising the chances that world powers would agree to maintain, or even toughen, the sanctions that are crushing Iran's economy.
But his moves, at the very least, may make it impossible to complete the deal within a period even close to the current deadline. His negotiators now face a daunting task of squaring their past promises with the leader's pronouncements.
For the Obama administration, the effective deadline to complete the deal is around July 5. If the agreement isn't in hand then, the administration probably won't be able to meet a congressional deadline to provide lawmakers the text and all supporting documents by July 10. If the administration misses that deadline, Congress gets an additional month to review the deal, putting a final decision off to mid-September at the earliest.
Nephew, the former negotiator, says he remains optimistic that a deal will be struck. "It's so important, for so many strategic reasons, for both sides," he said. "But it could also fall apart."

Greece moved closer to a perilous bankruptcy Saturday after talks over a bailout package broke down with its creditors, who rejected any emergency extension of the aid that has kept the debt-ridden Mediterranean nation afloat.
A spot of good news came Sunday when the European Central Bank decided to continue emergency funding to Greeks cash-strapped banks, which it has provided for months. Observers had feared that the ECB might cut off that lifeline, which would have left many Greek banks broke and unable to function.
European Union finance ministers and major lenders warned Greece on Thursday that catastrophe looms within days for the heavily indebted country unless it brings a credible plan for reforming the economy to eleventh-hour negotiations now at an impasse. ( Carol J. Williams )
But the ECB froze the level of its aid, adding to the pressure that the banks are already feeling after depositors have withdrawn billions of euros over the past few weeks. Media outlets reported lines of worried customers at some ATMs in Greece on Sunday but no widespread panic.
Greeces financial turmoil increased Saturday when the other 18 nations that share the euro with Greece said they would not grant a grace period or await the outcome of a snap referendum the Greek government plans to hold next weekend on the bailout proposals on offer from international lenders. Without a deal in hand, Athens is expected to run out of money by Tuesday and default on a payment it owes the International Monetary Fund.

Such a default could throw the Greek economy into chaos, shut down the countrys banks and threaten its membership in the Eurozone. The ill effects could spread to neighboring nations and even the global economy.
European officials blamed Greeces left-wing government for unilaterally breaking off negotiations by announcing early Saturday its surprise intention to conduct a referendum on the creditors proposals  and to actively campaign against their approval.
The process wasnt finished, as far as we were concerned. The proposals werent definitive. They werent formally discussed or decided upon, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the leader of the Eurozones finance ministers. That is a sad decision for Greece, because it has closed the door on further talks where the door was still open in my mind.
But Greek officials accused their creditors of backing them into a corner and refusing to budge on a bailout formula prescribing more of the same austerity that has made the Greek economy contract by 25% in the last five years.
Early Sunday, the Greek parliament, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' anti-austerity Syriza party, voted to put the creditors' proposed bailout terms to a referendum July 5. Of parliament's 300 lawmakers, 178 voted in favor and 120 against, with two people absent.
@Beast of Burden Care to back that thought up........?

To cheers from his backbenchers, Tsipras declared that Greece would not be bullied into submission by its European partners and urged his compatriots to vote no in the plebiscite. But opposition leaders accused him of putting the country's membership in the European Union at risk.
The move to hold a referendum took Greeces negotiating partners by surprise. Analysts said that if it was a ploy to scare them into sweetening the deal, then it backfired spectacularly, with the other Eurozone nations digging in their heels. Instead of talking about new solutions Saturday, Dijsselbloem spoke of insulating the rest of Europe from the fallout of a Greek default.
The euro area authorities stand ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure financial stability of the euro area, financial ministers said in a statement after the collapse of talks Saturday.
Some Eurozone officials also said that the referendum would essentially be moot, because Greece's bailout will have expired by then and the Eurozone's proposals would no longer be applicable.
Despite the brinkmanship, the Eurozone remains eager to see a deal struck. Although nations such as Germany and France feel they can weather the consequences of a Greek default and its potential exit from the euro, they know that the loss of one of its members would raise serious questions over the stability of the currency.
The Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, warned as much when he criticized the Eurozones decision not to extend the current bailout by a few days to allow the referendum to take place.
Especially given that there is a very high probability that Greeks will go against our recommendation and vote in favor of the institutions proposal, that refusal will certainly damage the credibility of the [Eurozone] as a democratic union of partner member states, and Im very much afraid that that damage will be permanent, Varoufakis said.
Amid the harsh rhetoric on both sides, at least one Eurozone nation, France, expressed hope that a solution could still be found and offered to mediate.
Other Eurozone officials took pains to emphasize that Greece remained a member of their club  even though their joint statement came with the footnote: Supported by all members of the Eurogroup except the Greek member.

The attack raised fresh worries about the growing reach of the jihadists of the Islamic State, an affiliate of which claimed responsibility for the bombing. The disclosure of the bombers nationality, reported by Kuwaits official news agency, also heightened fears about the radicalization of youth in Saudi Arabia, Kuwaits powerful and oil-rich neighbor.
For normally tranquil Kuwait, the attack marked a devastating spillover of sectarian strife that has been sweeping the region, to which the emirate had previously been largely immune. It was the first strike of its kind in the tiny state, whose hereditary emirs are Sunni Muslim, but has a long tradition of peaceful co-existence with a sizeable Shiite minority.

The bomber was identified by Kuwaits Interior Ministry as Fahad Suleiman Abdulmohsen Al-Gabbaa, born in 1992. Authorities said he had flown into Kuwaits international airport at dawn on the day of the noontime attack at one of the emirates oldest Shiite mosques.
Chilling security footage that later surfaced on social media showed the white-robed assailant taking a moment to gaze out at a crowd of up to 2,000 men, nearly all of them prostrated in mid-prayer, before blowing himself up.
In addition to those killed, more than 250 were wounded, with the interior of the landmark Imam Sadiq mosque left strewn with bloody debris and broken bodies. The attacks symbolic significance was magnified by taking place during the holy month of Ramadan, and at Friday noon prayers, the most important of the Muslim week.
Kuwaiti authorities also said Sunday they had detained the driver of the vehicle that brought the attacker to the mosque. He was identified as a member of the countrys large and downtrodden stateless population known as bidoon.

The Interior Ministry said it was still investigating the plot surrounding the bombing, but described an alleged accomplice arrested earlier as involved with a deviant ideology -- a term generally used to characterize Islamist militancy. A government-linked newspaper said seven suspects were in custody, with a wave of arrests having begun on Friday, hours after the blast.
The bombing was claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State calling itself Najd Province, a historic reference to the region surrounding the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Offshoots of the group generally assign themselves names affiliated with their geographic base.
The Sunni extremists of the Islamic State consider Shiites to be heretics, and have repeatedly called on followers to target them. Similar attacks have taken place at mosques in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen, where a Saudi-led Sunni military coalition has carried out more than three months of bombing targeting Shiite Muslim rebels known as Houthis.
The Islamic State has urged stepped-up attacks during Ramadan, which began last week. The group also claimed responsibility for an assault Friday on a beach resort in Tunisia that left at least 38 people dead, most of them European tourists.
Kuwait on Saturday declared a day of mourning for the mosque victims, with Sunni religious leaders and thousands of Kuwaitis joining in paying tribute.

The fire late Saturday was sparked by an accidental explosion of a colored theatrical powder thrown from the stage in front of about 1,000 people, the local fire agency and media said. The powder for the one-time event called Color Play Asia ignited along the ground, mainly burning people's lower bodies, said Wang Wei-sheng, a liaison with the New Taipei City fire department command center.
The exact cause of the fire was still being investigated, but Taiwan Premier Mao Chih-kuo banned public activities that use the colored powder.

As hundreds of frightened tourists fled Tunisia on Saturday, the North African countrys leaders announced stringent new security measures in response to a massacre at a popular Mediterranean resort that left at least 38 people dead, nearly two-thirds of them British visitors.
The mass shooting on Friday in the coastal city of Sousse was the worst terror strike in the modern history of Tunisia, which had been considered an island of relative stability in an increasingly volatile region.

Within hours of the attack, diplomats, airlines and tour operators stepped in to provide bus transport from the stricken hotel and neighboring resorts to the nearest airport for flights out. More than a dozen evacuation flights took off overnight and at least 10 more were scheduled Saturday, the French news agency AFP reported. It said at least 2,500 foreign visitors expected to be repatriated by days end.
Elsewhere in the region, the Persian Gulf emirate of Kuwait declared a national day of mourning for victims of its own tragedy on Friday, the bombing of a crowded Shiite mosque. The death toll in that strike, the first of its kind in Kuwait, rose to 27, with more than 200 injured.
As it did in Kuwait, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in Tunisia. The jihadist group had also asserted that it carried out a deadly attack in March on a landmark museum in the capital, Tunis, though that claim was later called into question by Tunisian authorities, who blamed an Al Qaeda offshoot instead.
The museum attack left more than 20 people dead, and most of those victims, too, were European tourists.
Tunisian authorities emphasized that the motives and methods in Fridays assault remained under investigation. The one known assailant, shot dead by security forces, was identified as a student at a university in Kairouan, an inland city known for its piety.
In preparation for the attack, the gunman disguised himself as a beachgoer, in shorts and a T-shirt, and used a beach umbrella to conceal his Kalashnikov assault rifle. Terrified swimmers and sunbathers scattered as he raked the hotel beach and pool area with gunfire.
In a triumphalist statement issued hours after the attack, Islamic State asserted online that it had targeted infidels at the seaside resort, adding that the victims were mostly from Crusader countries that are fighting  the Caliphate, a reference to the groups self-declared state in parts of Iraq and Syria.
38 people dead in a shooting spree but where's the front page outrage? Since it's international and not about white people and it can't be connected to gun control in the US.

Tunisian officials announced Saturday that the 38 dead in the Sousse shootings included 24 British nationals  a heavy toll that British Prime Minister David Cameron had warned his public to expect as the magnitude of the assault became clear. The targeted hotel was popular with package tours originating in the United Kingdom.
The others killed included seven Tunisians, three Belgians, a Russian, a Ukrainian and a German, said Kamel Jendoubi, a Tunisian government minister. One victims nationality had not been determined, he said, though Irish authorities had previously said one Irish woman was killed.
Heightened safety measures unveiled at an overnight news conference by Prime Minister Habib Essid included the mobilization of army reservists for deployment to tourist-heavy areas such as beach resorts and archaeological sites, and the planned shutdown of some 80 mosques operating outside official controls and accused of spreading venom.
The prime minister also hinted at the possibility of a broader crackdown on political parties and other entities acting outside the constitution, a move that could prompt a backlash from Tunisiassizable Islamist bloc.
Islamists won power at the polls following the countrys 2010-11 uprising, which set off a wave of pro-democracy revolts across the region. But after a disastrous run at ruling Tunisia, the Islamists later ceded power and agreed to work in cooperation with a secular-minded administration. 
Still reeling from the March museum attack, Tunisia now faces a heavy new blow to its tourist trade, a mainstay of the faltering economy. Economic discontent was a driving force behind the uprising against longtime dictator Zine Abidine Ben Ali that erupted nearly five years ago, and chronic joblessness among young men is viewed as heightening the lure of Islamic extremism.
Tunisia has been the source of thousands of Islamic State recruits for the battlefield in Syria, and authorities fear their return home could have a deeply destabilizing effect. Chaos in neighboring Libya has also rattled Tunisia; the museum attackers were reported to have received training there.

The Sunni extremists blasted their way into Kobani, just south of the Turkish border, on Thursday with a series of car bombs, seizing a school and using it as a springboard for apparent revenge attacks. More than 200 people were killed, many of them civilians including women and children, according to activists. The ultimate toll could more than double once bodies in homes and structures are recovered, the activists said after the town had been re-secured.
Kobani assumed outsized significance last year when Islamic State besieged it for months before being driven back in January. Along the way, the city became a symbol of Kurdish defenders determination to fight off the jihadists, and of the Kurds role as the most reliable ground fighters allied with the U.S.-led coalition confronting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
These Kurdish fighters are the only ones who are successful against ISIS.Bravo!

Activist Mustafa Ebdi, speaking by phone from Kobani, said at least 250 people were killed during the three-day incursion, a count that could grow to 500, he said. On Saturday, the main Kurdish militia, known as the YPG, blew up the school where Islamic State fighters had been holed up and ejected them from five other areas, he said.
The YPG, also known as the People's Protection Units, is a militia tasked with protecting the Kurdish minority amid Syrias multi-sided civil war. But its presence along the Turkish frontier has infuriated Turkey. The Ankara government considers the force a close cousin of what it deems terrorists of the Kurdish Workers Party or PKK, which battled the Turkish state for decades.
In September, the U.S-led military coalition, in coordination with YPG fighters on the ground, launched withering airstrikes to roll back Islamic States presence in wide swaths of Iraq and Syria. U.S planes kept up an intense barrage as the group pressed its attack on Kobani.
In January, with Kobani reduced to little more than rubble, Islamic State withdrew. But its renewed raid on Kobani may have been meant to surprise and demoralize Kurdish forces, who were buoyed by victory earlier this month in another border town, Tal Abyad.
That battle helped Kurds unite territory under their control and cut off an important supply route Islamic State had used between the Turkish border and its de facto capital, Raqaa, 50 miles to the south.
Although driven from Kobani, Islamic State fighters continued to press an offensive against government-held areas in the northeastern Syrian city of Hasaka, which is jointly held by troops loyal to President Bashar Assad and Kurdish forces. The Reuters news agency reported the government had appealed to residents to take up arms to defend the city.
The U.S.-led coalition said Saturday it had staged 14 airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Syria since Tuesday, including four near Kobani, five near Raqaa and two near Hasaka.

Defense ministers of the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization wrapped up a two-day gathering in Brussels on Friday that followed announcements that the Pentagon would deploy hundreds of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and transports to six Eastern European countries that were once part of or allied with the Soviet Union.
As the Western alliance officials firmed up plans for their new rapid-reaction force to respond to dangers they see emanating from Russia and the Middle East, a senior Russian security official cast the moves as evidence that Washington and its "flaccid" European allies are aiming to dominate Russia.

They would like very much to see Russia cease to exist as a country, Russian Security Council chief Nikolai Patrushev told the newspaper Kommersant in an interview widely distributed by other state-run media.
Patrushev, who was director of the KGB-successor Federal Security Service for the decade before he was tapped to head the security council in 2008, portrayed the war in Ukraine as a U.S.-instigated disturbance to blame on Russia and undermine the regional balance of power between the Cold War-era rivals.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials have issued stern warnings of "consequences" should NATO deploy troops and armaments to Eastern Europe.
U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced during his tour this week of NATO's eastern flank that the alliance would be positioning equipment and arms for a bolstering of defenses against any Russian aggression. The military buildup is destined for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria -- all former Soviet republics or satellites that Moscow still considers part of its "sphere of influence."
Russia and the United States are embarked on massive military modernization programs that will commit hundreds of billions of dollars to upgrading defenses and armaments.

The Kremlin launched its $500-billion, decade-long defense upgrade in 2010, and Putin has said the program will be spared cutbacks even though the Russian economy is in recession and most other government spending is being pared sharply.
At an arms fair near Moscow this month, Putin announced that at least 40 new nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles would be deployed by the end of the year to confront what the Kremlin said in its newly revised defense doctrine is the greatest threat to Russian national security: NATO.
Carter responded to Putin's latest reminder to the West of his country's vast nuclear arsenal by telling reporters accompanying him on his European tour that "nuclear weapons are not something that should be the subject of loose rhetoric by world leadership."
On Thursday, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told the House Armed Services Committee that Putin and other Russian leaders were "playing with fire" in raising the specter of nuclear warfare.
The United States, which provides the bulk of NATO's weapons and funding, is also planning a major upgrade of its nuclear armaments that will cost a minimum of $355 billion over the next decade, the congressional representatives were told.
Work appealed to the U.S. lawmakers for more funding for the Pentagon to avoid having to cut into other important defense needs.
"Without additional funding dedicated to strategic forces modernization, sustaining this level of spending will require very, very hard choices and will impact the other parts of the defense portfolio, Work said.

Assault
Armed militants struck within hours of each other on three continents Friday, wielding bombs, firearms and a gruesome display of a decapitated head in a demonstration of the growing global reach of Islamist violence.
The militant group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing of a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a seaside resort in Tunisia, and it may have at least inspired an attack on a gas factory in France. The extremist organization, now controlling large parts of Iraq and Syria, has sought to expand its influence well beyond the Middle East.
As many as 60 people were killed in the attacks, more than half of them by a gunman who went on a rampage outside a hotel popular with foreign holidaymakers on the sunny Tunisian coast. Up to two dozen people died in the bombing of the mosque, and one man was beheaded in France. The violence marred the holy month of Ramadan, which began last week.
Islamists suspected in attack on French gas plant
Assailants rammed a car into a gas plant in France on Friday morning, triggering two blasts. The severed head of previously killed man and a flag with Arabic inscriptions were found at the scene.

An Islamic State leader this week had called on acolytes to use Ramadan, traditionally a time of spiritual reflection and acts of kindness, as an opportunity instead to bring calamity for the infidels.
Be keen to conquer in this holy month and to become exposed to martyrdom, Abu MohammadAdnani, a spokesman for the Sunni militant group, said in an audio message released Tuesday. He urged followers to mount attacks in Libya, Syria and Iraq against Westerners, Shiite Muslims and any Sunni Muslims who opposed Islamic State.
He also warned President Obama of retaliation for the air raids that U.S. forces have helped carry out against the militants.
8
The nearly half-hour audio message was a fresh example of Islamic States sophistication in disseminating its extreme worldview through online and social media, tools that allow the group to project its gospel of violence far outside the territory it rules with an iron fist.
Islamic State has definitely proved itself a lot more capable than major groups in the past at spreading that propaganda, whether it be blogging, the Internet, said Alan Fraser, a Middle East expert at the London-based risk consultancy AKE. And part of the brutality of Islamic States activities in Iraq and Syria [is] designed to get that kind of media attention.
Thats one of its tactics. Its very hard to combat.
Savagery akin to that seen in the groups slickly, and sickly, produced videos of mass executions and beheadings was evident in the attacks Friday, which struck places of work, worship and relaxation in Europe, Asia and Africa, respectively.
The severed head of a previously killed man was hung from a fence near the U.S.-owned gas factory in southeastern France that attackers tried to blow up by ramming a car into the plant about 9:30 a.m. Friday. Flags with Arabic inscriptions lay close by, French media reported.
French President Francois Hollande said a message had been written on the decapitated body. He added that there was no doubt it was a terrorist attack, and French anti-terrorism prosecutors have opened an investigation.
Two other people were injured in the explosion at the Air Products factory in the small town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, outside the city of Lyon, Hollande said.
A suspect was quickly arrested after the incident and, though prosecutors said he refused to talk, was identified as 35-year-old delivery truck driver Yassin Sahli, who was known to workers at the plant. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that French intelligence services had designatedSahli in 2006 as a potential extremist but stopped monitoring him two years later for undisclosed reasons.

Before being detained for questioning, a woman who said she was Sahlis wife told Europe 1 radio that she had been married to her husband for a decade and that they and their three children were normal Muslims who led a normal family life.
I don't know whats going on. Its not possible, she said in an increasingly distraught voice, describing her husband as very, very calm.
French media reported that the beheaded man was Sahlis employer, the boss of a local transport company.
The gruesome violence in France came less than six months after the Jan. 7 rampage in Paris at the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine targeted because of its cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, and a Jewish supermarket. Twenty people were killed, including the three attackers.
France has been on alert for further attacks. In April, an Algerian national linked by authorities to Al Qaeda and Islamic State was arrested on suspicion of plotting a gun attack on churches in Paris.
Security was stepped up at other sites in the region where Fridays assault occurred, for fear that the incident might either serve as a prelude to a larger attack elsewhere or inspiration for copycats.
In Tunisia, a gunman disguised as a bather killed at least 37 people with a Kalashnikov rifle that he hid under a beach umbrella and used to strafe the pool and shore area of a hotel in Sousse, a popular vacation spot about 90 miles south of the capital, Tunis.
Terrified swimmers dashed out of the surf to find cover. Sunbathers were shot dead in their lounge chairs on the private beach fronting the Hotel Riu Imperial Marhaba.
Many of the dead were European travelers, according to Tunisian officials. Britain confirmed that at least five British nationals were killed.
Vacationer Steve Johnson told the BBC that he and others barricaded themselves in the hotel spa to wait until they were told it was safe to come out.
We heard what we thought was fireworks, he said. Then people were screaming and starting to run in all directions.
An official from the Tunisian Interior Ministry told Tunisian radio that the gunman was killed by security forces. The official identified the attacker as a student from the city of Kairouan, 35 miles inland from Sousse.
It was the second major strike in three months on the crucial tourist industry in the North African nation, which had been one of the few bright spots to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings that tried to bring more democracy to the region. In March, attackers shot dead 21 visitors, most of them Europeancruise passengers, at the Bardo National Museum in Tunis.
------------
FOR THE RECORD
5:10 p.m.: A previous version of this post said most of the Bardo National Museum victims were Egyptian cruise passengers. They were European passengers.
------------
Militants declaring allegiance to Islamic State claimed responsibility for that assault.
Friday's rampage was praised on a forum associated with Islamic State. A Tunisian calling himself Abou Anas said gleefully on Twitter: Didnt we tell you that this is a month of conquests, a hard blow to tourism.
He characterized the dead as apostate crusaders and added: Hahahaha.
In the only one of Fridays three attacks that Islamic State said it directly instigated, a suicide bomber blew himself up inside a Shiite Muslim mosque in Kuwait. The Persian Gulf nation has witnessed a recent rise in sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.
Video footage showed dazed, white-clad worshipers milling about in the smoke from the blast, which killed up to two dozen people.
Despite the close timing of the three attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait, a Pentagon spokesman said it was too soon to tell whether they were coordinated centrally or coincidental.
We continue to look into it, U.S. Army Col. Steve Warren said. Were collecting intelligence as rapidly as possible.

With the threat of economic catastrophe less than four days away, Greek officials and their international creditors continued to clash Friday over how to raise the money the Balkan nation needs to keep up with debt payments and get an extension on its bailout program.
Early Saturday, after an emergency Cabinet meeting in Athens, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced he wouldcall a referendum July 5 to poll Greeks' willingness to endure more budget and services cuts. The nation'sdevelopment minister urged voters to say "no."
The differences between the budget-balancing visions of Greece's radical leftist government and the "troika" of lenders owed $270 billion boil down to the former seeking to put the austerity burdens on profitable businesses and the creditors demanding cuts to pensions and government salaries.

While no formal negotiations took place on Friday, the Greek delegation reportedly submitted a slightly revised proposal with concessions on raising the retirement age and eliminating pension supplements for the lowest earners. But Athens reportedly hasn't budged in its insistence on raising the money it needs on the backs of business.
There were also reports by European media of an offer from the creditors to extend Greece's bailout program by five months, until November, and provide an additional $13.4 billion to help Athens meet its obligations, on condition the heavily indebted country commit to a strict timetable for budget reforms.
8
Tsipras denounced the creditors' insistence on more budget cuts as "an ultimatum that is against the values of Europe." And in a move apparently aimed at getting another week's delay in making a $1.8-billion debt payment, Tsipras announced he would call a referendum to measure public support for the new belt-tightening demands. There was no immediate word from the creditors, who have insisted on a viable and politically endorsed reform plan by Tuesday.
Greek Development Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis predicted that his countrymen would answer "with a resounding no," the Associated Press reported from the emergency session that ended in the wee hours Saturday.
Tsipras and his Syriza party came to power in January after campaigning on promises to ease the painful austerity measures imposed by the creditors overseeing the bailout program. Five years of cuts to the government payroll and public services have contributed to Greece's economy contracting by 25% since 2010 and job losses that have left 26% of working-age Greeks unemployed.
Tsipras and his delegation to the negotiations raised hopes early this week with new offers to boost business taxes and raise enough future revenue to persuade the creditors to release the last $8 billion left in the bailout fund before the rescue program expires Tuesday.
But officials of the lending institutions -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission -- have said they fear putting the burden on business will suppress growth and scuttle long-term prospects for economic stability in Greece. The creditors want Athens to accelerate its plan for raising the retirement age to 67 and to phase out "solidarity grants" currently paid to retirees with the lowest incomes.
That divergence of priorities led the two sides to an impasse Thursday. The talks in Brussels between Greek officials and the foreign ministers of the other 18 countries that use the euro common currency failed to produce a plan to secure enough new borrowing to make the $1.8-billion payment on IMF debt due by Tuesday.
"We're expecting the payment to be made June 30, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said at the fund's headquarters in Washington, making clear that there will be no grace period offered to Athens.
cComments
@the_PB, Reading a bit more the 300 billion must include private debt. Federal debt is 175% of GDP, a high but manageable number if they get the financing. Fix the culture of tax evasion and excessive bureaucracy. The Greeks have simply run out of room to borrow.

Tuesday is also the last day of the current bailout program, and if no deal has been reached on an extension or renewal, the $8 billion left in the fund will revert to the lenders and Greece will be cut off from further operating funds and cash infusions to keep the banks solvent.
Fear of that default has already caused a run on euro deposits in Greek banks over the last two weeks, compelling the European Central Bank to provide almost daily emergency liquidity funds to deter full-scale panic. If the bailout program expires and Greece misses its Tuesday debt payment, the ECB would have neither obligation nor interest in providing more euro infusions, forcing Athens to issue a national currency that would quickly lose value versus the euro.
Tsipras and Greek Finance Minister YanisVaroufakis have been resistant to the creditors' insistence on spending cuts, in particular any that would hurt already struggling pensioners, in a standoff that suggests they expect their Eurozone colleagues and creditors to make further concessions to protect the integrity of the common currency union. Analysts are divided on how widespread would be the economic fallout if Greece were to drop out of the Eurozone but many think the other Eurozone countries are loathe to gamble on an assumption that there would be little or no damage to their own well-being.
Leaders of the 28-nation European Union met in Brussels on Thursday for their semi-annual summit and issued a stern message to Greece and its European creditors to get a deal done this weekend.
"Leaders expect the Eurogroup to conclude this process at their meeting on Saturday, European Commission President Donald Tusk said early Friday.
Even if the Greek delegation manages to agree with the lenders on the reforms needed to get the last of the bailout funds released so Athens can make its IMF payment, the deal would still face hurdles in getting endorsement by the Syriza-dominated parliament. Many of the deputies elected for their promises to get austerity eased could face public backlash and ouster if they give their approval to the deeper and even more painful cuts demanded by the lenders.
A copy of the latest proposal submitted by Athens, obtained by Britain's Financial Times and posted on the newspaper's website, suggests that the Greeks have retreated from some earlier concessions to end special tax exemptions for Greek islands and raise taxes on processed foods.
Those backtracks, coupled with Athens' continued refusal to make spending cuts instead of tax hikes, could scuttle the weekend talks and the prospects for averting default -- unless other Eurozone countries want to keep Greece within the currency alliance more than the Greeks themselves want to stay in.

Emergency services were deployed to the site and all those who work there were evacuated, the statement said.
Air Products officials said security had been increased at its operations around the world as a precautionary measure. The company has facilities in more than 50 countries employing more than 21,000 people.
Founded in 1940, Air Products is a Fortune 500 company , placing at no. 284 on this year's list ranking the largest U.S. corporations, with more than $10 billion in annual sales.
The company is one of the world's largest suppliers of industrial gas, breaking down air to form oxygen, nitrogen and other components used in construction, oil refining, healthcare and other industries. It also produces specialty chemicals for electronics companies and equipment used in the energy sector.
Its French subsidiary, created in 1990, employs about 400 people. It is described on the company's website as the third largest producer of atmospheric gases in France, with more than 15% of the market. [Link in French]
Seifi Ghasemi, a native of Iran, took over as chief executive of Air Products last summer, replacing John McGlade after a protracted battle with billionaire investor William Ackman, who had complained that the company was trailing its competitors.
"This incident reinforces that we all need to take safety and security very seriously, every day, and remain vigilant in everything we do," Ghasemi said in a statement Friday. "I am very glad to know that all of our employees are safe and accounted for.

A gunman disguised as a bather, with an automatic weapon concealed under a beach umbrella he carried, raked a seaside hotels shore and pool area with bullets on Friday, killing at least 37 people, many of them European visitors, and injuring dozens more, Tunisian officials said.
It was the second major strike in just over three months against a tourist target in the North African country, rare in the region for its progressive and secularist traditions and one of the few beacons of relative stability in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings more than four years ago.
Islamic State militants stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack, but it was praised on a forum associated with the extremist group.

The assault took place outside a beach hotel in the Tunisian city of Sousse, at noontime on a hot summer day when the seaside was crowded with visitors. The city, about 90 miles south of the capital, Tunis, is a popular destination for tourists traveling from Europe as well as elsewhere in the country and the region, attracting many package visitors from Britain.
Officials initially believed there were two attackers, but later said the strike appeared to have been carried out by a lone gunman, who was shot dead. Tunisian media later reported the arrest of two accomplices.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though suspicion fell on Islamist militants who have sought to destablize Tunisia by harming its fragile economy. Tunisias Health Ministry said the dead included nationals from Tunisia, Britain, Germany and Belgium, and the Irish government said one of its citizens had been killed.
A Tunisian calling himself Abou Anas, who is affiliated with the Islamic State-affiliated forum Ifriqiyah Media, tweeted gleefully after the attack: Didnt we tell you that this is a month of conquests, a hard blow to tourism. He characterized the dead as apostate crusaders and added: Hahahaha.
Witnesses to Fridays attack described terrified swimmers dashing from the surf to run for cover and sunbathers shot dead in their lounge chairs on the private beach fronting the Imperial Marhaba hotel -- named for an Arabic greeting. British vacationer Steve Johnson told the BBC that he and others barricaded themselves in the hotel spa to wait until they were told it was safe to emerge.
We heard what we thought was fireworks, then people were screaming and starting to run in all directions, he said. Another vacationer, Briton Gary Pine, told Channel 4 in London that he heard dozens of gunshots.
You could hear the bullets whizzing through the air, he said. I was happy to get of that beach, as youd imagine.
@NOTATE REDMOND Exactly. A cheap vacation is not worth it if you can loose your life there.

The assailant sneaked into the complex by dressing like a beachgoer and carrying a beach umbrella under which he hid a Kalashnikov rifle, senior Interior Ministry official Rafiq Chelli told Tunisias Radio Mosaique. He identified the attacker, who he said was killed by security forces, as a student from the city of Kairouan, 35 miles inland from Sousse.
It was not the only terror attack to rattle the region on Friday. In Kuwait, an explosion at a Shiite Muslim mosque killed up to 24 people, according to news reports  the latest in a string of sectarian bombings in the Persian Gulf region at a time of rising Shiite-Sunni tensions. Islamic State, which says it has carried out similar attacks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, claimed responsibility.
At the scene of the shooting in Sousse, police swiftly converged on the waterfront, blocking off access to the hotel and neighboring resorts as an army helicopter buzzed overhead, witnesses said. A Tunisian radio reporter at the scene said security forces handled the body of the slain attacker with extreme care, apparently in case he had been carrying explosives.
Tunisias tourism industry had already suffered a devastating blow on March 18, when attackers hit the Bardo National Museum in the capital, whose antiquities were a major draw for visitors. That attack left 21 people dead, most of them European tourists on a cruise-ship stopover. Militants declaring allegiance to the Islamic State claimed responsibility.
The tourism sector is crucial for the economy in Tunisia, which is considered the only real success story in the wake uprisings that swept the region, the first of them beginning in Tunisia in late 2010. The country has been relatively politically stable, especially compared with its chaos-riven neighbor Libya, but the calm has been punctuated by occasional Islamist attacks, and economic stagnation and joblessness are major concerns.
Radicalization of young Tunisians has been a worsening worry for Tunisian authorities. The country has been by some reckonings the largest source of recruits to the Islamic State, with more than 3,000 young men having slipped away to fight in Syria or Iraq.

Lee Myung-bak
It was a prison term, Lee Min-young says, that he had been anticipating his whole life, and on Friday it was finally confirmed: The 25-year-old was sent to spend 18 months behind bars.
That is Lees punishment for objecting to South Koreas mandatory military service for all able-bodied men. The question of how to respect the civil and religious rights of those who refuse combat duty faces South Korean politicians and military seeking to maintain a fighting force capable of deterring North Korea.
Lee is from a family of Jehovahs Witnesses and says that military service requirements to fire a weapon, and possibly engage in combat with North Korean soldiers, conflict with his religious beliefs.
When Kim Dong-hyun arrived at work on April 16 last year, he turned on his computer and noticed a news alert: A ferry was sinking off South Korea's south coast. In an instant, Kim, 53, was overcome with dread, realizing the ship was carrying his only daughter, Da-young. ( Steven Borowiec )
Lee has also worried that his refusal to serve might hurt his prospects for career and marriage. If I go to jail, Ill be stigmatized forever. That stigma will be like a wall between me and the rest of society for the rest of my life, Lee said in an interview last month. Still, he said he was holding fast to his beliefs, pointing to a passage from the Book of Proverbs as the basis for his decision: Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth. Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him.

Some 600 conscientious objectors are currently behind bars in South Korea, most of them Jehovahs Witnesses, for refusing to serve in the 650,000-strong military. Though South Korea has several alternative service options for men like Lee, including working in administrative roles in government offices, even these recruits must go through a month of combat training  a requirement that some find unacceptable.
Jehovahs Witness groups estimate that 18,000 South Korean men have served time for being conscientious objectors. South Koreas mandatory military service has its roots in the 1950-53 Korean War. An armistice agreement ended the combat, but a peace treaty has never been signed. Actual conflict between North and South is rare but not unheard of; the last case involving casualties came in 2010, when two soldiers and two civilians were killed when North Korea shelled a South Korean island.
Proponents of mandatory service argue that South Korea must maintain a large, combat-ready military to deter North Korea and respond in case of an attack. Peace is not a birthright, but can only be preserved through military readiness, South Koreas Ministry of National Defense says in an e-book published on its website. (About 28,500 U.S. troops are also stationed in South Korea.)
In May, Amnesty International released a report on South Koreas conscientious objectors, calling on the government to release the 600 men currently incarcerated on such charges.
It seems that conscientious objectors can be given non-combat related duties that do not require combat training. Stretcher bearers, medics, cooks, etc., would fall into such categories. Besides, you would not want to trust a conscientious objector handling a weapon.
rtamtc

Military service is seen as a patriotic duty by mainstream society due to the security situation in the Korean peninsula. Men who do not fulfill this duty are often considered to be traitors, Amnesty wrote in the report, which found that more than 90% of jailed conscientious objectors in the world are South Korean.
In 2007, under liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, the South Korean government announced plans to expand alternative service options for conscientious objectors, but those plans were put on ice with the election of the conservative Lee Myung-bak the following year.
In May, a South Korean court acquitted three men facing charges for refusal of military service. All three gave religion as their reason.
It is necessary to provide a harmonious interpretation of freedom of conscience under the constitution and the duty of national defense prescribed in the constitution, as these two constitutional values come in conflict with each other, the court ruling stated.
Provincial courts have twice before issued similar rulings that were later overturned by the Supreme Court. In the case last month of the three objectors, the ruling will be reviewed by the Supreme Court and is likely to be overturned, in line with precedent.
Lee said last month that he had been encouraged by the May ruling. He was not available for comment after his own hearing Friday in the Supreme Court, his last and whose outcome he cannot appeal.
Lee was taken into custody Friday and will probably be transferred directly to a prison where he will serve out his sentence, said Steven Park, public information officer for the Jehovahs Witnesses Korea branch, that advises conscientious objectors.
Lee said in May he hadnt yet decided on a particular career to embark on once he is released, but he planned to spend his time in prison praying and making plans. His family operates a small jewelry store in Yangpyeong, about an hour east of Seoul.
Despite his loss of freedom, he said he had no regrets about objecting to military service.
Militaries are supposed to exist to work for peace, but even though we have this huge military, were not safe, Lee said. We need some other way of achieving peace -- not through force.

Terrorism
One man was decapitated and at least two other people were injured Friday morning in a terrorist attack on a factory in southeastern France, barely less than six months after the Charlie Hebdo massacre by Muslim radicals in Paris, French President Francois Hollande said.
One suspect has been arrested in connection with the attack, said French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, adding that intelligence services had identified the man as a potential extremist in 2006 but stopped monitoring him two years later.

Cazeneuve named the suspect as Yessim Salim or Yacine Sali, according to conflicting spellings given in various news reports.
In response, Hollande called a crisis meeting of France's Defense Council on Friday afternoon. Gerard Larcher, president of the Senate, the French upper house of parliament, described the attack as "intolerable" and said there was a sense of "deep shock" across France.

Speaking in Brussels on Friday morning before a planned European Union summit, Hollande said the attack was carried out shortly before 10 a.m. by one or possibly two men in a car who clearly intended to blow up the Air Products factory in the small town of Saint Quentin Fallavier, near the city of Lyon. The plant manufactures industrial gases.
Hollande said there was no doubt that it was a terrorist assault. French anti-terrorist prosecutors have opened an investigation.
French media reported that the severed head of the decapitated victim was found hanging on the factory fence, near a flag bearing Arabic inscriptions. Hollande said that a message of some sort had been written on the body.
The victim was a 50-year-old man who may have been the arrested man's employer at a transport company that had dealings with the factory, French officials and media reports said.
The other victims were hurt in an explosion set off when the attackers rammed their car into the factory gates, according to news reports. The severity of the injuries was not immediately clear.
A woman identified as the suspect's wife told Europe 1 radio that she had been married to her husband since 2005 and that they and their three children were "normal Muslims" who led "a normal family life."
"I don't know what's going on. It's not possible," she said, describing her husband as "very, very calm."
She said he worked as a delivery driver and usually left each morning at 7 a.m. and returned between noon and 2 p.m. But on Friday he did not return.
"War is the terrorism of the rich and powerful and terrorism is the war of the poor and powerless." -Peter Ustinov.

Gendarmes quickly sealed off roads around the Air Products factory and referred inquiries to the public prosecutors office more than 50 miles away in the city of Grenoble.
A 23-year-old man who gave his name as Mehdi and who lives close to the factory expressed his contempt for the attackers.
I am a young Muslim who is keeping Ramadan right now. To carry out this attack on a Friday during the holy month is not respectful of Islam, said Mehdi, who was dressed in a long white djellaba. These people may call themselves Muslims, but they are not.
"I say to them, you do not have the right to cut off someone's head; you do not have the right to explode anything near our homes not far from where we live with our children, our nieces and nephews.
The gruesome violence came less than six months after the Jan. 7 rampage in Paris at the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine targeted because of its cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, and a Jewish supermarket. Twenty people were killed, including the three attackers.
France has been on alert for further attacks. In April, an Algerian national linked by authorities to Al Qaeda and Islamic State was arrested on suspicion of plotting a gun attack on churches in Paris.
Security was stepped up at other sites in the region where Fridays attack occurred, for fear that the incident might either be a prelude to a larger assault or inspiration for copycats.
"The terrorist threat is at a maximum," Alain Juppe, a former French premier, said via Twitter. "The [French] state must do everything possible to protect its citizens."
Air Products is a U.S.-owned company founded in 1940 and headquartered in Allentown, Pa. It has offices around the world, including more than a dozen in Europe.

Islamic State jihadists engaged in a bloody rampage in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Kobani and its environs on Friday, officials said, executing at least 142 civilians before withdrawing as vicious fighting continued in the town for a second day.
Idriss Naasan, vice minister for foreign affairs in Kobani's Kurdish administration, said Islamic State's aim was to terrorize the population of the community near the Turkish border, which was the scene of heavy fighting last year.
Several months ago, Keith Broomfield informed startled relatives that he had decided to join the fight against Islamic State. ( Alexandra Zavis and Kamiran Sadoun )
"They tried to kill the largest number of civilians, so they roamed around neighborhoods and targeted them," said Naasan, explaining that many women and children had been taken hostage by the militant group, complicating efforts to rout the extremists from the town.
He said the YPG, a Syrian Kurdish militia that has emerged as a powerful force against Islamic State, "has them surrounded from four points, but fighting continues because they are using civilians as human shields."

Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the pro-opposition monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, described the attack as "a crime against humanity ... it's a barbaric massacre" in an interview with Sky News Arabia on Friday.
"The executions were perpetrated against entire families, [they were] completely exterminated," he said, adding that the death total would make this the second largest massacre perpetrated by the group. At least 28 Islamic State militants were killed in the clashes.
Kurdish activists uploaded scores of pictures showing victims of the rampage through Kobani as well as grim images of freshly dug trenches interspersed with lines of brick.
On Thursday, Islamic State fighters disguised as YPG fighters infiltrated Kobani after detonating a car bomb near the Mursitpinar crossing with Turkey. The group also struck the village of Brakh Botan, leaving tens of villagers dead as it made its way towards Kobani, 20 miles to the north.

It was the first attack on Kobani in six months, after YPG forces, backed by U.S. planes, thwarted a four-month campaign by Islamic State to take the town. Yet, despite thousands of tons of ordnance pounding Islamic State targets, the group has maintained its presence in the northeastern region of Syria.
Meanwhile, Syrian army units continued to battle Islamic State militants in the northeastern city of Hasakeh, where fighting has displaced an estimated 60,000 civilians, according to the United Nations. The U.N. on Thursday also warned that the violence could spur an exodus of 200,000 refugees towards the border city of Qamishli, 45 miles northeast.
Hasakeh province governor Mohammad Za'al Al-Ali reassured civilians that the city was secure and the army and national defense units would remain in place.
"This is a call to the citizens of Hasakeh to return to their homes and be steadfast in them," said Ali in an interview with Syrian State news broadcaster SANA on Friday, denying reports of withdrawals by police and army units from state institutions from the city.
"We must not believe the rumors and lies spread by opportunists."
Many Kurds blame Islamic State's rampage against Kurdish areas in Syria on neighboring Turkey, whom they accuse of granting open access to the militant group across its more than 500-mile border with Syria. They also point to recent successes by Kurdish and Syrian opposition forces against Islamic State, such as in the border town of Tel Abyad, 36 miles east of Kobani.
"The aim is to obstruct the joint forces that are liberating these areas of terrorists," explained Naasan, blaming "regional agendas that are afraid of the Kurds enjoying their right to self-determination."
Turkey, on the other hand, sees the YPG as little more than a branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, with which it has been locked for more than 30 years in warfare.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a deadly explosion that struck a Shiite mosque in the Kuwaiti capital after Friday prayers.

A posting on a Twitter account known to belong to the Islamic State group said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt. The attack was claimed by an IS affiliate calling itself the Najd Province, the same group that claimed a pair of bombing attacks on Shiite mosques in Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.

Friday's explosion struck the Imam Sadiq Mosque in the neighborhood of al-Sawabir, a residential and shopping district of Kuwait City. Paramedics on the scene said at least two people were killed, but the death toll was expected to rise. One eyewitness told The Associated Press that he saw at least 10 dead bodies. Police formed a cordon around the mosque's complex immediately after the explosion, banning people from entering or gathering near the area. Ambulances could be seen ferrying the wounded from the site.

"We couldn't see anything, so we went straight to the wounded and tried to carry them out. We left the dead," said witness Hassan al-Haddad, 21, who said he saw several dead bodies.
Abdullah al-Saffar, who was at the mosque, said the explosion took place just after midday Friday prayers. Friday midday prayers are typically the most crowded of the week, and attendance increases during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which started last week.
Another witness, Ahmad al-Shawaf, said worshippers were standing shoulder to shoulder in group prayer when the explosion struck near the door of the mosque, behind some of the worshippers. Al-Shawaf said the explosion took place near the end of a second prayer that is traditional to Shiites and that follows the main midday Friday prayer.
He said witnesses standing behind him said they saw a man walk in, stand in the back with other congregants and detonate his device.
Mohammed al-Faili, 32, said that his 70 year-old father was killed in the explosion and two of his brothers were also wounded. Speaking to the AP by telephone, he said he was not at the mosque at the time of the explosion but was heading to the morgue to identify his father's body.
The Islamic State group regards Shiite Muslims as heretics, and refers to them derogatively as "rafideen" or "rejectionists." The IS Twitter statement said the bomber had targeted a "temple of the apostates."
Kuwaiti Justice, Religious Endowment and Islamic Affairs Minister Yacoub al-Sanna described the attack as a "terrorist and cowardly action which threatens our nation and works at tearing apart the national unity."
Al-Sanna told the official state agency KUNA that, the government would take all necessary measure to ensure protection of houses of worship. "Kuwait was and will remain the oasis of security and safety to all components of the Kuwaiti society and sects," he said.

Cars overturned. Roads blockaded with flaming tires. That's what happens when the U.S. sharing economy tangles with French protectionism.
French taxi drivers protest in the southern city of Marseille as they demonstrate against Uber, which is facing fierce opposition from traditional cabs.
Hundreds of French taxi drivers took to the streets Thursday in sometimes violent protest against Uber, blocking access to major airports and train stations, and attacking vehicles suspected of working for the popular car service, which they accuse of stealing their livelihoods.
A taxi driver argues with a riot police officer standing guard during a demonstration at the Porte Maillot traffic roundabout on June 25 in Paris.
The violence follows weeks of escalating tension over the San Francisco-based firm's decision to continue offering its low-cost UberPop service despite an October law that bars companies from connecting passengers with unregistered drivers.
French taxi unions accuse UberPop of ignoring repeated court rulings and complain that police have turned a blind eye to the operation. The country's interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said Thursday that the service must be shut down, citing the serious public order disturbances and development of this illegal activity.
The company has appealed the judgments and says it is waiting for a final decision from France's constitutional court, which began deliberating on the matter Tuesday.
Thomas Meister, an Uber spokesman, accused Cazeneuve of disregarding the legal process. The way things work in a state of law is that it's for the justice to judge whether something is illegal or not, Meister told reporters.
Uber has faced repeated pushback from taxi operators and regulators as it has expanded into more than 300 cities across six continents. In an attempt to win over skeptical local authorities, the company has touted its potential to create jobs, reduce congestion and boost tax revenue.
A taxi driver holds a placard which reads, "Stop Uber, stop listening," during a protest in Paris.
Chief Executive Travis Kalanick made the case in January that many taxis in Europe operate off-grid and that Uber could be a way to bring them into compliance with local safety regulations and tax obligations.
The argument, however, does not appear to have swayed many European governments or taxi companies. More than a dozen lawsuits have been filed in recent months in countries across the continent, where some analysts say the company is in danger of being shut down or becoming so entangled in legislation as to be neutered.
In France, the battle is seen as the epitome of the culture clash between American free-market values and French economic protectionism.
They're very protectionist of their culture, their way of life, their way of doing things, said Hugh Tallents, a partner at the New York management consulting firm Cg42. It's not unheard of for unions to strike on a moment's notice or to retaliate against disruptive market forces.
Police officers stand next to a burned car during a taxi drivers demonstration in Paris.  French taxis are on strike around the country,  after weeks of rising tensions over Uber's ride-share service.
Tallents suggested that Uber might have to incorporate a little more cultural sensitivity into its operating model as it continues to expand.
Uber's strategy is one where they go in and take a very active approach.... They know their window for shoring up share and gaining riders and drivers is short because there are a lot of hungry competitors out there, he said. People will be looking at France as the poster child of how things can go wrong. I don't think this will necessarily derail Uber. But I think it could give them pause.
French taxi drivers complain that services such as Uber have an unfair advantage because their drivers don't pay for licenses that can cost up to $270,000. Some don't pay taxes and social charges, either, according to French officials. Cazeneuve berated Uber as a company that with arrogance applies none of the rules of law of the republic.
We are faced with permanent provocation, Serge Metz, the head of the taxi company G7, told French television. There can be only one response: a firm and systematic seizure of offending vehicles.
Travelers who were caught in the gridlock caused by anti-Uber protests walk along a freeway toward the Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris on June 25.
Uber counters that the taxi drivers are an outdated lobby fixed on defending their monopoly at the expense of customer needs. The company estimates that its smartphone app has about 400,000 French users a month.
Visitors to the French capital can testify to the frequent difficulty of finding a cab in Paris. French taxi drivers have also faced complaints of being resistant to change, including the use of credit cards and GPS technology.
An estimated 2,800 taxi drivers took part in Thursday's strike, setting up about 30 blockades across France, including on roads leading to Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. Lines of travelers could be seen trudging along busy highways, dragging their luggage behind them, to catch flights and trains. Riot police fired tear gas to clear protesting drivers from the ring road around Paris.
There were reports in the French media of gangs of taxi drivers hunting down drivers they suspected of operating for Uber at the two airports and of attacks on some private-hire cars and even licensed taxis that were not taking part in the protests.
Among those caught up in the violence was actress-musician Courtney Love, whose ride was ambushed by anti-Uber protesters.
they've ambushed our car and are holding our driver hostage. they're beating the cars with metal bats. this is France?? I'm safer in Baghdad
 Courtney Love Cobain (@Courtney) June 25, 2015
They're beating the cars with metal bats. This is France?? I'm safer in Baghdad, she tweeted.
In another tweet, Love lambasted the French president: Francois Hollande where are the ... police??? is it legal for your people to attack visitors?
The singer was rescued by two men on a motorcycle but said she had been scared out of her wits.
In the eastern city of Strasbourg, there were reports of taxi drivers posing as Uber customers to lure drivers to isolated spots where they and their vehicles were attacked.
Meister, the Uber spokesman, described the attacks as totally scandalous and the actions of yobs.
It's a small minority of taxi drivers who are not doing their profession any favors, he said.
It is not unusual for French industrial action to turn violent. This week, striking workers at the MyFerryLink transportation company blocked access to the Channel Tunnel. Eurostar trains were canceled for the afternoon after the rail company said strikers had damaged sections of the track. Riot police were eventually called in to drag the protesters away as they sang the French national anthem, La Marseillaise.
In 1999, a French sheep farmer became a national hero when he led a group to dismantle a McDonald's restaurant that was being built in the south of France. Jose Bove was protesting against restrictions imposed by the Clinton administration on imported Roquefort cheese.

        <title>Kerry's challenge as Iran talks resume: Avoid sharp turns</title>
        <Link>http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-kerry-iran-talks-20150626-story.html</Link>

	  Secretary of State John F. Kerry and his team are returning to international negotiations at a 19th century palace this weekend with a bounty of unsolicited advice on how they can wring a better nuclear agreement from Iran.
	</Description>
        <MainBody>4
The administration and the other world powers at the negotiating table agree with Corker that access to military bases is essential to any deal. But theyre not likely to get immediate access to sensitive Iranian sites.
The negotiators are planning to give Iran a number of days time to challenge any request from United Nations inspectors for access to an undeclared nuclear site.
On Wednesday, a group of respected former officials laid out in a letter their requirements for a nuclear deal. Their prescription was noteworthy because the group included former members of the administrations first-term inner circle on Iran -- Gary Samore, President Obamas former adviser on weapons of mass destruction; Robert Einhorn, former State Department nonproliferation chief; and Dennis Ross, former top administration advisor on the Middle East.
The groups negotiating advice tracked pretty closely with what the administration has been demanding. The former officials warned that they might not be able to support the deal if the administration caved at the last minute on key demands.
Interestingly, the groups strongest criticism of the administration was over President Obamas reluctance to do more with the U.S. military to halt the moves of Iranian forces and their armed proxies in the Middle East. The former officials said that to meet Irans threat fully, the administration needed to do more to train allied forces in Syria and Iraq, set up a safe haven in Syria, and stiffen resistance to Iranian arms shipment and harassment of commercial shipping in regional waters.
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobby, has laid out five requirements for a good deal. The agreement must authorize aggressive inspections; answer all questions about past nuclear research; lift sanctions only after Iran complies with obligations to scale back its program; restrain the nuclear program for decades; and dismantle Irans nuclear infrastructure, the group says.
The deal is sure to fall short of several of those goals. The six countries arent demanding dismantlement of excess Iranian centrifuges, for example; theyll be put in storage and monitored.
The six powers have given up hope of getting Iran to answer all the questions about its past nuclear research. Such a probe could take years, and still not answer all of the U.N.s questions about past nuclear work.
Iran would lose a lot if it acknowledged past research on nuclear devices, because that would puncture its claim that it has never sought the bomb.
So instead, the negotiators are bargaining over a specific list of steps Iran will be required to take, to try to answer some of the most important questions about past bomb research. Once Iran has completed those actions, the world powers will be willing to start lifting sanctions.

European Debt Crisis
Attempts to forge an agreement over Greeces troubled finances ended in failure Thursday, just five days before the Mediterranean country is due to make a loan repayment or risk going into default.
Finance ministers from the 19-nation Eurozone gathered in Brussels said they would meet again Saturday to try to bridge the glaring differences between Athens and its international creditors in order to stave off the threat of a bankruptcy that could force Greece to abandon the common euro currency.

It will need still many hours. The last hours have been really critical, European Union President Donald Tusk said, adding: But I have a good hunch that, unlike in Sophocles' tragedies, this Greek story will have a happy end.
It was a rare note of optimism on a day marked by more of the acrimony  especially between Greece and Germany, the EUs biggest economy  that has made reaching a deal difficult.

An agreement is necessary to unlock the final installment of funds from two bailouts that Athens has received from international lenders totaling about $270 billion. Without it, Greece will be unable to repay $1.8 billion it owes the International Monetary Fund by Tuesday's deadline.
The two sides are at odds over how Greece plans to keep its budget in surplus so it can service its debt even as its economy languishes in a deep and damaging depression.
Hopes of a deal received a boost earlier this week after new proposals were put forward by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Elected on an anti-austerity platform, Tsipras left-wing administration has pledged to hold the line on protecting pensions and public-sector wages, and has proposed raising more money through higher taxes, particularly on businesses.
Tsipras has also demanded some sort of debt relief or writedown, without which most economists say Greece will find it impossible to return to growth because of the staggering amount of public debt it must pay off.
But the creditor countries and institutions sent back Tsipras plan replete with corrections and objections written in red ink, saying that raising tax would hamper growth and insisting on more spending cuts.

The Greek leader accused Eurozone negotiators of trying to humiliate his country, while senior German officials complained that Athens had taken a step backward.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that reaching an agreement was essential before the markets opened Monday and before Greek banks, operating on a lifeline from the European Central Bank, ran out of money. Worried depositors have pulled out billions of euros over the past several days in what analysts describe as, if not a full-on run, then at least a slow jog on the banks.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who heads the group of 19 Eurozone finance ministers, said a fresh round of counterproposals arrived from Greece too late Thursday to be properly evaluated and voted on by European Union leaders gathering for a two-day summit.
On a number of issues there is still a wide gap with the Greek authorities, Dijsselbloem told reporters.
Down-to-the-wire negotiations with Greece have been the norm throughout the 5-year-old euro debt crisis, as both sides stake out maximalist positions and challenge each other to blink.
While this iteration might follow the same script, analysts warn that time is truly running short. Even if an agreement is reached among European leaders in Brussels, the deal will then be subject to approval by various national parliaments.
That includes both Germany and Greece itself, where Tsipras faces a potential revolt from backbenchers who believe he has already backtracked too much on their partys anti-austerity pledges. In Berlin, Merkel also must face down disgruntled lawmakers who feel Greece has gotten away with too much.

In its annual report on human rights around the world, the State Department cited the theocratic government for depriving its citizens of a range of freedoms, including the right to choose their leaders through free elections. The report portrayed the Iranian justice system as harsh and arbitrary, particularly in cases involving the government's political opponents, and said senior officials do not punish officials who commit abuses.
Some of the most serious abuses in the past year grew from the governments disregard for the physical safety of citizens, whom authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully detained, tortured or killed, the report said.
Iran was among a handful of countries singled out by Secretary of State John F. Kerry in an introduction to the report. The department also criticized the rights records of Cuba, Myanmar and Vietnam, countries with which the administration is trying to improve relations.

Cubas government was cited for harassment of political opponents, a lack of free speech, intimidation and abusive detentions. The report also said that Russia has become increasingly authoritarian and has moved to deny free speech.
Many of the abuses alleged in the report had been catalogued by the State Department in past years reports. But this year's volume has had more visibility than normal because of the nuclear negotiations with Iran.
The report was supposed to have been released on Feb. 25. The adminstration's critics had charged that the State Department was delaying its release to avoid provoking Iran and possibly hurting prospects for a nuclear deal.
State Department officials have said the release was delayed because of the hectic travel schedule of the secretary, who customarily is present at the reports release to give it visibility.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a presidential hopeful, had proposed fining the State Department for further delays.
I am ashamed to realize that our human rights record is far worse than Iran's. Let's do a body count for the last 20 years and see who has a bigger pile of dead innocents.

Without identifying him by name, the report cited the case of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, who was imprisoned last July in Iran and is now on trial on unspecified charges. Rezaian has been denied legal representation and U.S. consular help and is at risk because of health problems and psychological stress, the report said.
The report said the Iranian government has severely restricted freedoms of assembly, speech, religion and the press.
It detailed a variety of abuses in the judicial system, including disappearances, judicially sanctioned amputations, and violence against political adversaries. Iran has the second-highest rate of executions in the world and often ignores guarantees of due process made in the countrys own constitution, the report charged.
The report also questioned the political legitimacy of Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who will make the ultimate decision on whether Iran accepts a nuclear deal.
Khamenei dominates key power structures, the report said, noting that while many Iranians take part in elections, an unelected body screens out candidates deemed unacceptable.
The report acknowledged that much of its information came second-hand, through private human rights advocacy groups, because the United States doesnt have diplomatic relations with Iran.

It was unclear what international assistance impoverished North Korea received for constructing the two-story terminal, or how much it cost. A 30-photo slide show published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency showed Kim touring the terminal with his wife and a group of about a dozen people. Numerous photos showed the entourage in various states of laughter.
The facility, which also has a new control tower, willopen July 1, the agency said. It replaces a terminal that dated to the 1950s and may be part of efforts by Kim to increase the countrys appeal to tourists and earn foreign currency.
What a joke. They won't let citizens leave, because they would defect and who in their right mind would want to visit there (Dennis Rodman qualifies to go), why do they need an international airport?

Since Kim took the helm of North Korea three years ago, he has opened a variety of tourist attractions, including a ski resort, and invited foreign celebrities such as Dennis Rodman to the country. Overseasrunners have been invited to participate in the Pyongyang marathon. But Kim also has periodically closed the country to visitors, most recently this spring, when borders were shut purportedly because of fears of Ebola.
Just a few airlines, including North Koreas state-run Air Koryo, and Air China, operate flights into Pyongyang. Most tourists are from China and Russia.
Kim praised the soldier-builders who worked on the terminal, the construction of which was a cherished wish of his father, the late leader Kim Jong Il, KCNA said. The Associated Press reported in October that laborers were constructing the terminal largely by hand or with simple tools, with patriotic music blaring from loudspeakers. Huge signs urged the workers to carry out their duties with Korea Speed, AP reported.
Photos of the facility showed at least 12 check-in counters; an immigration desk featuring modern, automated, glass entry gates; a clothing shop; a gift shop; a duty-free store; and several restaurants. There also was a newsstand stocked with what looked like magazines and North Korean flags. Travelers will have use of luggage carts.
The state-run news agency said a master plan called for construction of high-speed railways and motorway from the airport to the city center to ensure smooth traffic. North Korea is known for its paucity of buses, cars and other vehicles, not to mention a scarcity of fuel.
Accompanying Kim were senior officials, including Hwang Pyong So, considered to be North Koreas No. 2 official; Premier Pak Pong Ju; and Kim Yang Gon, director of the United Front Work Department. Kims wife, Ri Sol Ju, was also in attendance, wearing a seafoam green skirt suit.

        <title>Islamic State opens multi-pronged offensive in northern Syria</title>
        <Link>http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-islamic-state-syria-20150625-story.html</Link>
        <Description>
	  Islamic State fighters on Thursday attacked Kobani, the Syrian town on the Turkish border they besieged for months before being repulsed in January by Kurdish militias assisted by punishing airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition.
	</Description>
        <MainBody>2
Isso accused Turkey of being complicit in the attack on Kobani, charging that Islamic State fighters entered Kobani from Turkish territory. Turkish officials dismissed that claim, saying they possessed "concrete evidence that there was no crossing from the Turkish side," according to Agence France-Presse.
Last week, Kurdish-led forces routed Islamic State fighters who almost a year earlier had seized the border town of Tal Abyad. That offensive, backed by coalition airstrikes, cut off the Islamic State's main supply route to Raqqa, some 50 miles south. It also gave Kurdish forces an opportunity to consolidate two areas in northeastern Syria under their control, as well as opening up a corridor to Iraqi Kurdistan.
Elsewhere in Syria, 51 rebel factions operating in the southern province of Daraa announced a campaign to wrest control of areas of Daraa city from the government. SANA reported that an attack by terrorists -- the governments standard description of rebel factions -- had been thwarted, with fighter jets pounding rebel targets in surrounding villages.
The news agency also denied that the rebels had taken control of the strategic Daraa-Damascus road, one of two main highways linking southern Syria to Damascus, the capital and seat of power of President Bashar Assad.
The rebel operation, dubbed "Southern Storm," was spearheaded by factions associated with the Southern Front, a coalition of so-called moderate fighters. If successful, it would grant the rebels a rear supply base to mount operations on Damascus, a scant 59 miles north, as well as creating a contiguous zone of rebel control stretching from Kuneitra province, bordering the Israeli-held Golan Heights, to the outskirts of the Druze city of Suweida.
The Syrian Observatory put the death toll at 14 on the rebel side but did not give casualty figures for civilians or government forces.
The battle for Daraa city comes after a recent string of important gains for the Southern Front. Opposition activists claim the battlefield successes are the result of an intense three-month period of supply and armament for the coalition from a logistics hub located in the Jordanian capital Amman, staffed by operatives from a number of intelligence services, including the CIA.

The toll from the sweltering heat wave in Pakistan's largest city continued to rise Thursday, surpassing more than 1,000 dead, according to state-run television, even as temperatures began to cool off.
The high temperature in Karachi was 100 degrees Fahrenheit, closer to seasonal averages and several degrees cooler than earlier in the week, as a sea breeze blew over the port city, officials said. The temperature had reached 113 degrees Sunday.

"The temperature will remain normal in the coming days," said Ghulam Rasool, head of Pakistan's government meteorological office.
The number of victims arriving at hospitals in the southern port city slowed considerably, although 35 bodies were received at morgues operated by the Edhi Welfare Organization, said the group's spokesman, Anwar Kazmi.
It was the lowest number of bodies seen all week at the morgues, which received 750 heat stroke victims over the last five days, Kazmi said.
State-run broadcaster PTV put the death toll at over 1,000.

        <Description>
	  French taxi drivers overturned cars, burned tires and blocked access to airports and train stations in a second day of violent protest Thursday against competition from the ride-sharing service Uber.
	</Description>
        <MainBody>In another tweet, Love lambasted the French president: Francois Hollande where are the ... police??? is it legal for your people to attack visitors? Get your ass to the airport. Wtf???
The singer later added that she had been "scared out of her wits."
An estimated 2,800 taxi drivers took part in the strike, setting up around 30 roadblocks across France, including on roads leading to Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. Some visitors had to walk between terminals and along busy roads to catch flights and trains.
There were reports in the French media of gangs of taxi drivers hunting down drivers they suspected of operating for Uber at the two airports and of attacks on some private-hire cars and even licensed taxis that were not taking part in the protests.
In the eastern city of Strasbourg, there were reports of taxi drivers posing as Uber customers to lure drivers to isolated spots where they and their vehicles were attacked. [Link in French]
Thomas Meister, an Uber spokesman, described the assaults as totally scandalous and the actions of yobs.
Its a small minority of taxi drivers who are not doing their profession any favors, he said.
France's interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, has called for a nationwide legal clampdown on UberPOP, citing the "serious public order disturbances and development of this illegal activity."
Meister accused the minister of disregarding the normal legal process.
"The way things work in a state of law is that it's for the justice to judge whether something is illegal or not, Meister told French journalists.
In October, France passed a law banning any service that puts passengers in touch with unregistered drivers. Uber has contested the measure, saying it is counter to business freedom.

Russia's ruble has been on a roller-coaster ride, posting the second-biggest drop in value of world currencies in 2014, then bouncing back this year with the highest rise against the dollar, euro, pound and yen.
The ruble's dizzying comeback, though, is due neither to an economic boom nor to sustainable intervention by the Russian Central Bank. And it came at a steep price.
Steadying the ruble at about 50 to the dollar has drained the country's hard-currency trove of $150 billion, more than a quarter of the reserves on hand at the end of 2013. Those cash infusions have done little to cheer Russian consumers or businesses: Inflation remains at more than 16% and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development predicts that the overall economy will shrink by 4.5% this year.
People know not to blame Putin. They know it is all the fault of Obama and the Ukrainian fascists that they have to suffer economically to confront these evil people. - Sergei Guriev, former rector of Moscow's New Economic School, mocking the prevailing sentiment
And stabilizing the ruble was achieved only after President Vladimir Putin shook down Russia's oligarchs for what he considered their fair share toward arresting the currency's tumble, a tactic unavailable to the stewards of a free-market democracy.
"There is no strategy and no vision. It's all 'live for today,'" said economist Sergei Guriev, a former rector of Moscow's New Economic School living in self-imposed exile in Paris.
Russia's disappearing middle class and the working poor are paying the price for the Kremlin's economic fiddling, Guriev said. He points to an average 10% drop in real income last year, a jump in mortgage defaults and rising food and utility prices.
A $500-billion, decade-long military modernization program augurs even grimmer years to come.
Car sales in Russia dropped 42% in April from the same month last year, the Assn. of European Businesses reported last month. The share of Russians who can afford no more than the absolute necessities has soared to 20%, the highest since polling on the subject began a decade ago, the Nielsen research firm reported last month.

Even during the 2009 recession, the report noted, only 7% of respondents said they could afford nothing more than food and shelter.
"But people know not to blame Putin. They know it is all the fault of Obama and the Ukrainian fascists that they have to suffer economically to confront these evil people," Guriev said, mocking the prevailing public attitude molded by a lavishly funded propaganda campaign on state-run television.
"In Russia we say that there's the television and there's the fridge," said the economist, who until last year was part of the Kremlin's financial inner circle. "People believe what they see on television, but when they don't see anything in the fridge they stop believing. If the government doesn't have the cash it needs and sees that its propaganda is no longer convincing, it may embark on a new military adventure to make people believe again."
The economy was ticking along with healthy growth in most recent years until Russian troops seized Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. The United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Moscow for its violation of international law and its neighbor's sovereignty.
Those measures, which cut off international lending and blacklisted dozens of Kremlin kingpins, have coincided with the decline of world oil prices to half their value of a year ago. And in spite of repeated pledges by Putin to diversify the economy since he first took office in 2000, Russia remained dependent on oil and gas sales for more than half of its income when the latest financial crisis hit.

The government in April revised its 2016 budget to take into consideration the decline in expected energy revenue, which originally had been calculated at $100 a barrel for oil. The deficit spending now envisioned for next year will eat up an additional $200 billion from the hard-currency reserves, and more if the military modernization project continues to be exempt from the budget cuts forced on almost every other economic sector.
Putin has micromanaged the financial crisis in much the same away as he has guided the country's geopolitical strategy. He summoned his nation's captains of industry to the Kremlin for an emergency session Dec. 16, when the ruble was trading at 80 to the dollar. According to the RBK business journal, he told them that the ruble's collapse threatened their welfare as well as that of the country and that they had an obligation to repatriate the money they had stashed in foreign banks.
There was no official edict issued, and the journal observed that the Kremlin has limited means of controlling how oligarchs or ordinary citizens handle their finances.
Putin did declare a "capital amnesty" after the December meeting, and the State Duma, the lower house of the parliament, has been struggling since then to draft legislation aimed at assuring offshore depositors that repatriating their capital won't lead to investigations of whether they came by it legally. A history of nationalizations, corruption and asset seizures has undermined faith in the security of Russia-based wealth, explaining the flight of more than $150 billion in capital last year alone.
But lost on none of the oligarchs was the unspoken threat of reprisals if they failed to do their part to halt the ruble's free-fall. Memories were still fresh of the September house arrest of oil magnate Vladimir Yevtushenkov and seizure of his assets, not to mention the 10 years that former billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky spent in prison for challenging Putin's political domination.
The billionaire owners of Lukoil, Severstal, Norilsk Nickel and three dozen other major enterprises had converted enough of their hard-currency holdings by late February to boost the ruble's value to about 60 to the dollar. Igor Sechin, head of the oil monopoly Rosneft, told the Tass news agency that he had sold $93 billion for rubles in 2014.
The winter run on the ruble was triggered by the converging effects of sanctions and the nadir in oil prices that flirted with $45 a barrel in December. Oil has lately traded for about $60 a barrel.
Putin has brushed off sanctions as little more than an irritant and banned European food imports in retaliation. He has ordered major importers to buy Russian-made goods to replace the components they used to get from Western manufacturers, though domestic production can't ramp up to meet the new demand when the scant credit available from Russian banks comes with double-digit interest rates.
As national coffers emptied late last year, Putin ordered 10% across-the-board cuts in government-funded services for regions and municipalities, with only pensions and the ambitious defense overhaul spared the budget ax.
Government economists have revealed little about the brainstorming that goes on behind the Kremlin's closed doors or their own candid views on Putin's handling of the crisis. But academics and independent economists willing to comment from their lofty remove see little to suggest that the current problems will be short-lived.
"There is nothing good" in the mid- or long-term forecast, concluded Alexander Savelyev, a senior scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations. "And the majority of experts expect further decline."

As a rising power, India is obsessed with its image in the world, so the announcement of the first U.S. presidential candidate with Indian roots figured to create a stir.
It probably wasnt the kind Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal wanted.
Indians on Thursday roundly mocked Jindals campaign kickoff announcement, particularly for the 44-year-old Republicans line that he was tanned, rested and ready to run. It was widely seen as an attempt to play down his skin color to appeal to conservative voters, and fit with what Jindals critics say is a longstanding effort to disassociate himself from his Indian heritage.
The Twitter hashtag #BobbyJindalIsSoWhite trended in India for several hours.
#BobbyJindalIsSoWhite that he couldn't win a spelling bee if he tried.
 VeeGee Narendra (@VeGeEn) June 25, 2015
#BobbyJindalIsSoWhite he's never been randomly selected at the airport
 Misha Choudhry (@MishaChoudhry) June 25, 2015
Some of Indias leading newspapers ran front-page mentions of Jindals announcement, although the coverage was less than effusive. Lalit K. Jha, longtime Washington correspondent for the Press Trust of India, wrote in a news report that Jindals announcement has failed to generate much enthusiasm among the Indian-Americans because of his recent statements in which he sought to distance himself from being an Indian-American.
Jindal was born in Louisiana in 1971 to Indian immigrants from the northern state of Punjab. As a child he changed his birth name, Piyush, to Bobby after the character from The Brady Bunch. Raised by devout Hindus, he converted to Catholicism as a teenager and says his faith inspires his conservative principles, including a staunch opposition to same-sex marriage.
Jindal invoked his parents at the start of his kickoff speech Wednesday but used the word India only once: in his oft-repeated accusation that Democrats were dividing the country along ethnic, gender and class lines.We are not Indian Americans, Irish Americans, African Americans, rich Americans or poor Americans, he said. We are all Americans.
Jindal enters the Republican presidential race near the bottom of the pack and has failed to inspire much support from U.S. voters of Indian origin, most of whom lean Democratic.
Bobby has never supported a single Indian issue, he refused to join the India Caucus when he was a congressman [on] Capitol Hill and is conspicuously absent from any event with a visiting Indian leader, Shashi Tharoor, an Indian politician and author, wrote in a recent book, India Shastra.
It is as if he wants to forget he is Indian, and would like voters to forget it too.
Jindal is an object of fascination for a rising Indian middle class that assiduously tracks their countrys stature in the world. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi led scores of countries in marking the first International Day of Yoga last weekend, many Indians beamed with pride.
But they are less charitable when it comes to Indians abroad who are seen to betray their heritage. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, has received less than favorable press coverage for the perception that he has targeted Wall Street executives with South Asian roots, such as Sri Lankan-born hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, for prosecution of financial crimes.
Young Indians flooded social media sites with sarcastic comments when Jindal unveiled his official governors portrait earlier this year because his skin looked shockingly white. A photo his office tweeted this week of his family playing Monopoly inspired mockery because his young children had their shoes on inside the house, a cultural no-no here.
 Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) June 23, 2015
Mihir Sharma, a columnist for the Business Standard newspaper, accused Indian Americans of a tendency to turn viciously on those they see as less Indian. But even he balanced his words with a critique of the candidate.
Typical: smug Indians trying to shame Bobby Jindal for his choices on identity, and not his awful politics, Sharma tweeted.
