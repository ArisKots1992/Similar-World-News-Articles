Pope Francis
It is 5 p.m., and the church bells in the center of the city begin to toll. Hundreds of commuters stream across the Praca da Se square, passing in front of the headquarters of the largest archdiocese in the nation with the most Catholics in the world.
But over the pealing sounds of the cathedral, many commuters are hearing a very different religious message.
"The world is dominated by sin! Only the Gospel can save you! Only evangelism can save you!" shouts a middle-aged man, gesticulating wildly and increasing volume as he utters each sentence. A rapt crowd of 30 or 40, mostly men, listens as the street preacher seeks to draw in additional passersby, warning them of danger to their souls.
I was born and raised Catholic like everyone else. But it's full of false doctrine and tradition which has nothing to do with the word. - Josemar Bento Mendes, Brazilian street preacher
"Satan is hidden everywhere! If you're with a religion, you're wrong! If you're Catholic, you're wrong! Put your hands together for Jesus!" The crowd obliges.
Nearby, homeless youths huddle together, passing a crack pipe back and forth. A young woman, apparently mentally ill, sits among the worshipers, playing with leaves and sticks on the ground.
Street preachers maintain a daily presence here and elsewhere around Brazil, calling upon believers to accept Jesus directly, rejecting the need for the Roman Catholic Church to serve as mediator.
Whereas some leaders behind Brazil's large evangelical churches have become famously wealthy and powerful, these men sweat on the street among Sao Paulo's downtrodden. They're foot soldiers on the front lines of a religious battle that their side seems to be winning.

When Josemar Bento Mendes was born, 50 years ago, more than 90% of Brazilians declared themselves Catholic. But by 2013, at the time that Pope Francis, the first pontiff from the Americas, visited, just 57% of Brazilians claimed allegiance to Rome. About 28% declared a commitment to some kind of evangelical Christian faith.
"I was born and raised Catholic like everyone else. But it's full of false doctrine and tradition which has nothing to do with the word," says Bento Mendes, who is preaching in the harsh cold of a wintry June day. "I come here because everyone in the city comes through the plaza. It's ground zero. It's a river with many fish, and many people suffering."
Mendes and others preach that the Bible is God's authoritative word, which should be spread evangelically, and that the Catholic Church is not necessary to interpret it.
Most of the fish in the river move along quickly, heading into the crowded metro station. But those loitering in the square tend to respect the seriousness of the gathering. After one young man, visibly high, spends a few minutes giggling, his perceived insolence is quickly singled out.
A tough-looking man in a hoodie and gold chains threatens him, instructing, "Respect the word of God!" The youth is soon clapping and praying along with the rest.
Preachers change off every hour or so and switch up styles. But they all rely on their intensity and passion, which could not contrast more sharply with the inside of the Catholic cathedral.
There, a priest's sermon is scarcely audible over the PA as he calmly explains the meaning of the church calendar. The audience for his Mass is barely larger than the circle formed around the preachers outside. Their slight presence in the pews is dwarfed by the ornate and grand structure built to hold thousands.
The world is full of crazy. Move along, nothing to see here...
Thinkandverify91

The format of the lessons outside is also looser, with the preachers reading select passages from the Bible, then expounding on their meaning. They may seem to be closer to adhering to Jesus' message of embracing the poor and sick, but these teachings  and indeed the Gospels themselves  are almost never the main point. Over the course of days and various preachers, a few dominant themes emerge: the imminent apocalypse, the influence of Satan and the evils of homosexuality.
"There are men sleeping with other men! We should see shame in your faces! You are worse than a dog or a pig. I have never seen a pig lie down with another pig," says one. Some in the crowd just listen intently, while others cry out spontaneously, or raise their eyes to the sky and tremble.
The preacher now turns his wrath on Edir Macedo, the media mogul billionaire leader of the evangelical Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, for airing sexually charged shows on his Record TV network. Bento Mendes and preacher Waldo Silvio Santos belong to the competing Assembly of God congregation. "Woe to you who pays his tithes to men who put naked women on TV to make millions. False prophets love money."
The evangelical movement has been criticized for profiting off Brazil's most destitute and sometimes offering a version of Christianity that they consider fundamentalist and reactionary, rejecting much of modern society. Within the complicated rules of Brazil's brutal class system, however, many middle-class liberals have also felt uncomfortable criticizing any movement that is largely working class.
But in the last few months, evangelical figures have risen to top positions of political power, causing liberals to panic. Eduardo Cunha, an evangelical who serves as president of the lower house of Congress, is considered a dangerous, cynical schemer by progressives, and he has said he will bar any vote on liberalizing abortion, which is illegal here.
After evangelical congressmen staged a protest against Sao Paulo's recent Gay Pride Parade, the major Folha de S.Paulo newspaper printed a scathing indictment: "A growing spirit of fundamentalism is manifesting itself ... and Congress seems committed to reflect this trend, intensify it, and use it to demagogic ends."
But the halls of the capitol in Brasilia are very far away from Praca da Se. As a Catholic priest and a Franciscan friar walk slowly, Bento Mendes has no time for focus on matters of politics.
"It is a thousand times better to trust in God than to trust in princes," he booms. "And I tell you this: Christ's return is coming sooner than we imagine. If it doesn't, I'll stop preaching. I'll rip up my Bible, if terrible things don't rain down upon us soon."

        <Description>
	  More than 100 people were killed in airstrikes that hit two markets in Yemen on Monday, according to witnesses and officials, as a Saudi Arabian-led coalition continued aerial attacks against Houthi rebels for a fourth month.
	</Description>
        <MainBody>The second strike happened about 11 p.m. at a market in the area of Joub, north of Sana, and killed more than 60 people, according to the Houthi-run Defense Ministry.
Khalid Mahlah of Sana wondered when the world would call for an end to the airstrikes.
It is a shame on all the international [community] that they have given in and remain silent, Mahlah said in an interview.
More than 3,000 people, half of them civilians, have been killed and 14,000 more wounded since airstrikes began March 25, according to the United Nations, as the conflict has deepened into an alarming humanitarian crisis in the Arab worlds poorest country.
More than 1 million Yemenis have fled their homes, and 13 million have poor access to food, according to the United Nations. The organization has called the conflict a humanitarian catastrophe and is seeking a cease-fire until at least the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in mid-July.
The Shiite Muslim rebels took over Sana in September, and the stated goal of the Saudi-led coalitions airstrikes has been to restore to power exiled President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi.
Previous air bombardments have struck Houthi positions and weapons caches but also residential areas and historic sites. The coalition has not acknowledged the killing of civilians and has accused the Houthis of using civilians as human shields.
Airstrikes on Monday also hit other parts of Yemen, including an area of Aden where seven people were killed, officials said. One strike hit a Houthi political office in a heavily populated area of Sana, injuring several people.
Special correspondent al-Alayaa reported from Sana, and staff writer Pearce from Los Angeles.

European Debt Crisis
Greece raced to come up with bailout proposals palatable to its international lenders Monday before its banks run out of money and the country slides closer to a chaotic default and exit from the Eurozone.
At the same time, officials in various European capitals huddled in their own emergency meetings to forge a common response amid signs of rifts between, and within, countries over how hard a line to take with Athens.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to offer new proposals for funding his cash-starved government to the leaders of the other 18 nations that use the euro currency during a summit Tuesday evening in Brussels. Convincing the Eurozone leaders that there is a basis for an agreement is key to Greeces short- and long-term economic survival.
Greek voters' resounding rejection of international creditors demands may have strengthened the hand of their prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who rose to power promising to halt painful austerity measures imposed in the bailout. But what options are open to the Greek leader when he meets with... ( Don Lee )
If they agree that a deal is possible, then the European Central Bank is likely to maintain the special lifeline it has extended to Greeces ailing banks to keep them functioning.
But if differences between Athens and its lenders appear irreconcilable, the European Central Bank could conclude that Greeces banks are insolvent and cut its emergency aid, and Greek banks would collapse within days, if not hours. Trade would seize up, residents would lose access to their savings and Greeces ability to continue using the euro would fall into serious doubt.
Under major pressure to reach an understanding with his Eurozone counterparts, Tsipras secured support from nearly all of Greeces political parties for his new offer, a show of unity meant to demonstrate his sincerity in negotiating in good faith on behalf of all Greeks. Trust between Tsipras and his European partners is at rock bottom since the previous round of talks broke down and Greek voters, in a referendum Sunday, heeded his call to reject creditor bailout proposals that were heavy on austerity.

On Monday, the European Central Bank avoided inflicting immediate catastrophe on Greece.
But as happened last week, the European Central Bank declined to increase the amount of emergency funds available, meaning that the banks cash supplies are continuing to dwindle. The European bank also upped the value of assets that the banks must provide as collateral to keep receiving aid, putting the banks in an even more precarious position.
The European bank has pumped $98 billion into the Greek financial system in recent months to prevent it from running out of money as depositors scrambled to withdraw their euros while they still could, for moving into accounts abroad or hiding under their mattresses. Greece's banks are reportedly down to their last $555 million  or about $50 per person in this country of 11 million.
Athens announced Monday that its weeklong closure of the banks and its cap on the amount customers can withdraw each day  about $66  would be extended through Wednesday. Officials had previously pledged to reopen the banks Tuesday.
Long lines at ATMs under the hot Aegean sun have been a common sight since capital controls were imposed. But Greeks have mostly taken the situation in stride, and some seem unfazed by the possibility of even worse restrictions if Greeces financial predicament worsens.
There is no fear in our hearts. We dont worship at ATMs, said Katerina Bakaliani, a 35-year-old film director. If I dont have enough to eat, I will pick an apple from a tree.
In Paris, the Eurozones two most important leaders, French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, met to discuss the Greek crisis and to try to damp speculation of a split in attitude toward Greece between Northern and Southern European countries.
@penguinista No. They areI saying the cost out weigh the benefits.

Officials from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands spoke harshly of Athens on Monday, saying that the referendum result had set back relations with the Eurozone and that any bailout deal would now be harder to negotiate, not easier.
A German Finance Ministry spokesman poured cold water on the idea of any discussion of relief of Greeces colossal public debt, something that Greek negotiators insist must be on the table. A report by the International Monetary Fund released last week said that Athens needed loans of $55 billion and massive debt relief to survive through 2018.
Other European officials have been more conciliatory, including the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, who said discussions of Greeces debt were not taboo. Spanish and Italian officials also urged a fair settlement with Greece as soon as possible and expressed their desire to see Athens remain a member of the Eurozone.
There were reports that Hollande had encouraged Tsipras to get the backing of other Greek political parties for his new bailout offer, which would make it easier for France to broker a deal.
Speaking to reporters with Merkel, the French leader said it was incumbent upon Europe to resolve the crisis over one of its own.
Within this Europe, there is room for solidarity, Hollande said.
The door for talks remains open. Time is of the essence, and we hope that this week we will get these proposals, said Merkel, who spoke with Tsipras by phone Monday.
It was unclear what concessions either Greece or its lenders would be willing to make to break their previous impasse and clinch a deal. In fact, with the referendum result backing him, Tsipras might feel emboldened to press for an even greater reduction of austerity measures, whereas some creditor countries might feel inclined to dig in their heels.
The last offer we made was quite a generous one, Merkel said.
Tsipras plan is likely to involve tapping a bailout fund known as the European Stability Mechanism, which was set up after the euro debt crisis erupted in 2009, first in Greece and then in nations such as Ireland and Portugal.
Although Tsipras came to power in January pledging to end austerity, further spending cuts will probably be unavoidable in any deal. That will require the Greek leader to persuade members of his own left-wing Syriza party to stay on his side.
He chaired a six-hour meeting with leaders of the other political parties Monday to thrash out proposals that would garner their support.
Despite rejecting more Europe-ordered austerity in Sundays referendum, in a 61% to 39% vote, the vast majority of Greeks want their country to remain in the Eurozone. Tsipras insists that it will do so, and officials have let slip no indication of contingency plans to introduce a parallel currency or reprint drachmas in the event of a bank system failure or a default by Athens on its debts. Such talk would undoubtedly spook the markets.
Merkel, too, must worry about politics at home.
Any new bailout deal for Greece would need the Bundestags approval. Her grip on power is tight in Germany, Greeces biggest lender, but many of her backbenchers have openly expressed anger with Athens over its perceived irresponsibility and unwillingness to play by the rules.
To improve his chances of getting a deal, Tsipras named a new finance minister Monday, Euclid Tsakalotos, after the surprise resignation of the colorful but controversial Yanis Varoufakis.

In the end, Greek voters preferred ambiguity about their future to the certainty of more economic hardships.
"We don't know what's going to happen now: Maybe it will be worse for a while, but maybe it will get better eventually," said Alexandra Tsalafouta, who, along with her husband and infant son, was among the multitudes strolling Monday along the picturesque harbor-front promenade of this northern port city. "But if we had voted 'yes,' for sure things would have been worse."
A lot of people felt it was all propaganda. It had the opposite effect, making a lot of people vote "no." - George Giorgos, Internet cafe employee
It was a sentiment often heard a day after Greeks overwhelmingly rejected an international bailout plan that would have imposed drastic new austerity measures on a nation where residents are plainly fed up with what many view as cutbacks imposed by a shadowy economic elite. More than 60% voted "no" to the rescue package, a landslide by any measure.
"I don't know who's behind it all: the Germans, the Russians, the Americans  who knows?" asked one pensioner seated with other elderly Greeks on a bench in Aristotle Square, where a bronze bust of the philosopher ponders the tranquil scene. "Someone is doing this to us."
Still, she said she was in the minority that voted "yes" in Sunday's referendum.
"For stability," explained the woman, who gave only her first name, Eugenia, for privacy reasons.
"We are worried; Greece needs stability," she said, as her bench mates nodded in agreement. "The banks? What is going to happen to them?"
8
It was a theme  vote "yes" for stability  that was often heard from "yes" proponents, especially in the media. But the campaign may have backfired: Many seemed to view the intensive pro-"yes" effort as a scare tactic meant to convince Greeks that voting "no" could have catastrophic consequences, especially for pensioners.
Closed banks and long lines at ATMs in recent days fanned the fears. Yet Greeks ultimately didn't buy the doomsday scenario.
"A lot of people felt it was all propaganda," said George Giorgos, 19, an Internet cafe employee studying computer science in Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city and home to a large student population. "It had the opposite effect, making a lot of people vote 'no.'"
He, like others, stressed that Greeks were determined to remain part of the European Union, a bond that many view as historic, cultural and unbreakable. Many seemed confident that a deal more favorable to Greeks will emerge from talks between European leaders, keeping Greece from defaulting on its debt and exiting the Eurozone.
"Of course we will stay with Europe," said Michael Michalis, 18, a physics student.

People in the city talked about a collective fatigue with years of dwindling incomes, vanishing job opportunities and a loss of a sense of security. Many who cast "no" votes Sunday did so as a collective rebuff of forced pauperization, a national declaration that enough is enough. They lamented the pejorative image of Greeks as people who don't want to work.
"We all work hard and want something better for our children," said Tsalafouta, glancing at her 18-month-old son, Gabriel, in the arms of her husband, Evangelous Siomas, whose pest-control business has endured cutbacks. "Everyone is working longer hours and earning less."
On a practical level, many business owners feared that new austerity measures and higher taxes would have been the death knell for already struggling enterprises.
"A 'yes' vote would have killed tourism here," said a hotel owner on the island of Lesbos, a popular vacation spot for European visitors. "Tourism is the best thing Greece has going for it now. Why make it harder for us?"
Among "no" voters, there was a distinct sense that Greece had finally fought back against the banks and oligarchs  and especially against Germany, the economic colossus of the European Union.
"I'm not frightened of Germany's junta," said Anthi Papadopoulou, 73, a pensioner with four grandchildren who was among the jubilant "no" backers celebrating into the early hours of Monday in Athens' Syntagma Square, in front of the Parliament building. "Right now we have a junta without tanks. It is economic war."
Despite the prevalent uncertainty about what will happen next, she said she was not frightened, even if she were to lose her pension of nearly $555 per month.
"Many are not afraid  we will survive," Papadopoulou proclaimed. "We'll live on lentils if we need to.... They can take my pension.... My pride, they will never take."
Others were more somber than exultant as European officials frantically tried to negotiate a solution to the crisis.
"Of course I'm still afraid and biting my nails expecting what's going to happen over the next five days," said Giorgos Kavasakalis, 38, an architect who voted "yes" in the referendum.
"Time is not on our side right now," added Kavasakalis, who has been considering immigrating to the United States. " We really have to hurry. Greece doesn't have time. Something has to happen, and it has to happen real fast."

	  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has long said she wants to see Greece remain in the Eurozone, but "not at any price." And the Sunday vote by Greeks to reject their creditors' formula for repayment of $270 billion in bailout loans sent that price skyrocketing in both political and economic terms.

However, in light of the decision by the Greek citizens, the conditions to start negotiations on a new aid program are not met yet, Seibert said, adding that Berlin would wait and see what the Greek government makes of it.
Seibert said the German government was stressing the principle that solidarity is inseparable from [a country's] own efforts, implying that the attempt by Athens to get a significant write-down on its debts was not in the offing.
Those in the Eurozone who support holding Greece to its previous commitments exuded frustration and showed signs of losing patience after the referendum.
Now [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel and the others must organize a Grexit, with all the cushions and upheavals that will result as a consequence. - Alexander Graf Lambsdorff of Germany's Free Democratic Party
Though Merkel may be reluctant to see the integrity of the Eurozone breached, her conservative colleagues in the grand coalition that governs Germany are of the view that the Greek no vote may well be a prelude to the country's exit from the Eurozone  a Grexit, as it has become known.
The referendum was a clear signal that Athens refuses to be beholden to its creditors, said Markus Ferber, who oversees euro policy for the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.
The country and the government have knocked away the helping hand of their Eurozone colleagues, Ferber said. The only chance for Greece now is to leave the euro.
The Economist Intelligence Unit, an independent forecasting and advisory service of the Economist Group, put the chances of a Greek exit from the Eurozone at 60%.
Opposition political forces in Germany also signaled readiness to interpret the referendum result as a rejection of what is required to stay in the Eurozone, even if many Greeks voted no because their leaders suggested it would compel the creditors to offer a substantial debt write-off and more lenient plan for repaying the rest.
Now Merkel and the others [of the European creditors] must organize a Grexit, with all the cushions and upheavals that will result as a consequence, said Alexander Graf Lambsdorff of the Free Democratic Party, one of the German politicians willing to take no for an answer even if that wasnt what many Greeks meant.

Hundreds of thousands of cheering people welcomed Pope Francis to Guayaquil, Ecuador, on Monday for the first Mass on the Argentine-born pontiffs landmark pilgrimage to Spanish-speaking Latin America.
Enthusiastic crowds thronged Francis as he walked from the airplane that took him from the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, to the coastal city of Guayaquil. Many tried to shake his hand and took selfies with the widely admired pope. Still more lined the route that the popemobile took to the site of the Mass.

Preliminary estimates of attendance at the Mass, in Guayaquils sprawling Parque Samanes, topped half a million. The pope dedicated the service to the traditional family, the promotion of which he believes can stave off many of societys ills, especially in impoverished Latin America.
The family, he said, speaking in his native Spanish, is the nearest hospital ... the first school for the young, the best home for the elderly.
The family constitutes the best social capital, he continued. It cannot be replaced by other institutions. It needs to be helped and strengthened, lest we lose our proper sense of the services that society as a whole provides.

Those services should not be regarded as charity but as part of the social debt owed the institution of family, he said to sustained applause.
Illness, unemployment and other difficult situations can rob families of their warmth and sense of solidarity, he warned.
As expected, the pope departed from his prepared text on several occasions. At one point, as he spoke of how all members of a family are to be valued, he paused to recall an anecdote involving his mother. He said she was asked once which of her five children she loved the most. She responded that the five were like the five fingers on her hand; hurting any one of them would hurt her equally.
The family constitutes the best 'social capital.' It cannot be replaced by other institutions. It needs to be helped and strengthened.... - Pope Francis
The pope is on an eight-day visit to his native continent, deliberately choosing three of its poorest and most marginalized countries to drive home his belief in preaching from the periphery, or among the most disadvantaged. After Ecuador, he will travel to Bolivia and then Paraguay. In addition to meeting with clergy and national officials he will made a point of spending time at so-called places of pain  including a childrens hospital and a notorious prison.
The is Francis second trip to South America since becoming pope. His first, in 2013, was limited to Portuguese-speaking Brazil for World Youth Day.

Earlier Monday and shortly after his arrival in Guayaquil, the pope stopped to pray at the Divine Mercy shrine, where he blessed sick faithful and then chatted with the staff members who care for them. In his typical joviality, he said to the staff: I will bless you, and I wont charge.
Leaders of the Roman Catholic Church credit Francis popularity with stanching an exodus from the faith and attracting people back to the fold. It is too soon, however, to bear that out with numbers.
The countries the pope is visiting are among the most Catholic in South America.
Francis was scheduled to meet later Monday with Ecuadors leftist president, Rafael Correa, who also greeted the pontiff on the tarmac at his arrival in Quito on Sunday.
People began gathering at the Quito cathedral Monday afternoon to hear the pope speak that night.
It is a blessing that the pope has come, a signal of joy, said Angel Tapia, a 44-year-old IT engineer. I think the pope came because he wanted to, not because the president invited him. But political tension will return once the pope is gone.
Though most of the popes public comments at the Mass in Guayaquil were heavily religious and Bible-based, many in Ecuador hope he will stake out a more political position.
The visit of the pope comes at a critical moment for the country, because the division between those who support the government and those who criticize it is at its highest point, said architect Diego Moreano, 35, among those on the streets attempting to get a glimpse of the pope. The pope can serve as a point of balance, of social stability and peace. Lets hope his message lowers tensions.
Fabiola Cruz, a 50-year-old homemaker, said she hoped the pope could revive the spirituality of the people of Ecuador. Unfortunately we live in a moment of little reflection in our country.

	  President Obama acknowledged Monday that the Islamic State terrorists have been "particularly effective" at recruiting volunteers to fight in Iraq and Syria but pledged to stay on track with his current strategy even though it "will not be quick" in bringing about the group's defeat.

But senior administration officials said Monday that the president is committed to his current strategy and that he was not going to the Pentagon to discuss possible changes in it.
There is no situationon the ground that has prompted this, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. The White House is mindful of the many risks in Iraq and Syria, Earnest said, adding that the fact is, our national security professionals are always vigilant.
As Obama prepared to visit the Pentagon on Monday, the White House complained publicly that Senate Republicans are dragging their feet in confirming his nominee to target terrorist funding in a sanctions drive at the Treasury Department.
In his daily briefing, Earnest called for the quick confirmation of of his pick, Adam Szubin, so that he begin efforts to cut off funding for Islamic State and its allies.
Obama described Szubins post as a vital position to our counter-terrorism efforts, adding that, if Congress wants to help, lawmakers will confirm him immediately.
As he spoke, Obama was joined onstage by commanders involved in the ISIL discussion, including Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East.
The air war and the train-and-assist missions have been effective, Obama said.
We have taken out thousands of fighting positions, tanks, vehicles, bomb factories and training camps. We've eliminated thousands of fighters, including senior ISIL commanders, Obama said. And over the past year we've seen that, when we have an effective partner on the ground, ISIL can be pushed back, he added, ticking off Islamic State defeats across Iraq.
Obama, who was flanked by decorated generals, said it would take more than just military might to win the fight against Islamic State.
There's a cause, a coalition that's united countries across the globe, some 60 nations including Arab partners, Obama said. Our comprehensive strategy against ISIL is harnessing all elements of American power across our government -- military, intelligence, diplomatic, economic development and, perhaps most importantly, the power of our values.

Greek voters' resounding rejection of international creditors demands may have strengthened the hand of their prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who rose to power promising to halt painful austerity measures imposed in the bailout. But what options are open to the Greek leader when he meets with European leaders at an emergency summit Tuesday?

Despite the threat of Greece being forced to abandon the euro currency, Tsipras has said he considers that question to be off the table. And the abrupt departure of his confrontational finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, a lightning rod in talks with European counterparts, suggests that Athens will tone down its rhetoric, if not demands, and may look for a compromise.
Analysts say European countries still have good reason to prevent an outright Greek collapse and departure from the euro area, even as the odds of a so-called Grexit, or Greek exit, rose sharply after Sundays vote.

Tomorrow night is going to be very critical to the medium and long-term future for Greece, says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Tsipras needs to use his victory in a smart and deliberate manner  and not overreach.
 If Tsipras walks into Tuesdays summit insisting on debt relief but no pension cuts, tax increases or other reforms, it could be a short meeting. The international bailout for Greece was conditioned on Athens making structural reforms to get its finances in order, and Eurozone leaders arent willing to give Greece a pass on what many in Europe consider years of Athens profligate ways. Eurozone leaders see it as a dangerous precedent that could encourage other insurgent members to follow suit.
 Failure to present a credible bailout proposal, or something that offers hope of a deal, is likely to push the European Central Bank to reconsider whether to keep giving Greek banks emergency funds to stay afloat. Meeting Monday, the ECB board decided to leave the level of its support to Greek banks unchanged, waiting for clearer political signals from European leaders. But the ECB will certainly cut off Greeces life support if Athens misses a $3.46-billion bond payment due to the ECB on July 20.
 If Tsipras offers a proposal acceptable to Germany and other European leaders, Greece could work out a deal that will give it additional debt relief. With Greeces economy in tatters and the human suffering having reached epidemic proportions  unemployment has topped 25% and more than 50% for youth  France and Italy are among those who appear willing to give Athens at least more time to meet fiscal targets.
 Either way, Greek banks, which were closed last week except for limited withdrawals, arent likely to reopen this week. It may be months before they resume normal operations. But a compromise would help stabilize conditions fairly quickly as the ECB opens the emergency spigot and more calm returns to Greek financial markets.

        <title>New sticking point in nuclear talks: Iran wants arms embargo lifted</title>
        <Link>http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-sticking-point-nuclear-talks-iran-20150706-story.html</Link>
        <Description>
	  Iran's desire for a quick lifting of United Nations restrictions on its trade in missiles and other conventional arms has emerged as another potential sticking point in its nuclear negotiations with the United States and five other world powers.
	</Description>
        <MainBody>13
The Iranian official said the negotiators are still weighing the key issue of how they will set up a procedure providing for a snapback of sanctions on Iran if it is found to be breaking rules of the agreement. The official said Iran wants to find a way to restore its leverage over the world powers if they are found to be violating the deal.
Negotiators from the seven countries say they are closer to concluding a landmark deal than they have ever been. But issues remain, including how sanctions will be lifted, how closely U.N. inspectors willbe able to monitor Irans nuclear program, and what restrictions will remain on Irans nuclear research and development after the deals first 10 years. Also to be resolved is the U.N.s incomplete investigation into Irans suspected past research into nuclear weapons.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry have both warned in public comments since last weekend that the other sides intransigence was threatening completion of the deal.
Foreign ministers of all six countries were convening in Vienna on Monday and Tuesday in hopes of making tough policy decisions that their subordinates passed along to them. But some officials are saying that the deal making may not be completed by the latest deadline of midnight Tuesday and could spill over into Wednesday or Thursday.
The Obama administration is trying to complete the deal so that it can send its text, along withsupportingdocuments, to lawmakers by Thursday to meet a congressional deadline. If that deadline isnt met, Congress will extend the period it is taking to review the deal from 30 to 60 days, possibly opening the agreement to new risks.
A former Obama administration official, Ilan Goldenberg, said missing the Thursday congressional deadline might complicate things somewhat, but wont threaten the underlying agreement.
The conservative Fars news agency in Iran quoted Iranian officials saying that the bargaining could continue into Thursday.

Iranian Nuclear Program
The Obama administration began its nuclear negotiations with Iran by insisting that Tehran halt production of all nuclear fuel, dismantle its nuclear infrastructure and roll back its missile program. In two years of bargaining, each of those demands has been dropped.
As the administration and its five major-power negotiating partners close in on a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran  indications are that one could be announced as early as Tuesday, although some issues remain unresolved  they will have to answer a tough question: Did they drive a hard enough bargain?
President Obama and his top advisors contend the deal will achieve several major U.S. goals. Most important, they say, it will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb for 10 to 15 years, and maybe longer  a big victory considering that Tehran has been on the threshold of being able to build a nuclear weapon.
The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency said Saturday he hopes to complete his controversial investigation of Irans past nuclear activities by December, potentially removing a key obstacle to completion of world powers sweeping nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic. ( Paul Richter )
But critics, including some of Obama's former advisors, argue that the group could have gotten a tougher, longer-lasting deal, considering that they began negotiations two years ago, after they had put in place a powerful set of sanctions to squeeze the economically fragile, militarily weak, medium-sized country.
Secretary of State John F. Kerry and his team are "letting this deal erode away as they try to close it," Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and sometimes an administration ally on Iran, said last month.
Administration officials counter that critics' demands for a better deal are unrealistic, given the advances that Iran has made over the last 20 years, its ideological commitment to resisting U.S. pressure, and its status as a sovereign state that has rights under international treaties.

The kind of deal critics are demanding is a "unicorn agreement," one that doesn't exist in the real world, Colin Kahl, national security advisor to Vice President Joe Biden, said recently.
On Sunday, as foreign ministers prepared to arrive in the Austrian capital for what seems likely to be the final days of talks, Kerry insisted that the administration was holding firm on its current demands.
U.S. negotiators would not "shave at the margins to get an agreement," Kerry said. Iran needs to compromise, he said in comments outside the hotel where the talks are underway, because "we are not yet where we need to be on several of the most difficult issues."
Negotiations could still "go either way despite recent progress," Kerry said, adding that President Obama is "prepared to walk" away from the talks if Iran does not agree to acceptable terms.
The debate about whether the final terms were acceptable will intensify in the days ahead if a final deal is reached, as the Obama administration mobilizes to win support. Both the administration and its critics see public opinion as key. Congress could vote to disapprove a deal, but Obama would veto any such resolution. The real test for an agreement, both sides believe, is whether it wins enough public acceptance to survive under the next president.
In one hint of the challenge, five former members of the administration's Iran team said in a letter last month that they wished the deal could have been stronger. The five didn't say they would oppose the emerging deal, but would not commit to supporting it until they see its final terms.
The United States and five other world powers  France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China  are seeking a deal with Tehran that would ease sanctions in exchange for Iran's acceptance of restrictions intended to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear bomb.

The debate has at times taken a personal tone: Critics argue that the Obama administration is too eager for an agreement that could give the president a legacy-burnishing foreign-policy victory and possibly cap Kerry's career with a Nobel Peace Prize.
Opponents of the deal say it will give Iran a huge economic boost as sanctions are eased and its government reclaims up to $150 billion frozen in overseas accounts. A deal will restore Iran's ties to the world economy and give the former pariah state a new legitimacy, even as its military and proxy forces have been gaining influence in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the region, the critics note.
Defenders of the negotiations say that Iran has also given up several major demands. The Iranians at one point insisted on a deal that would last no more than seven years and that would allow them to greatly increase the amount of commercial-grade nuclear fuel they could produce. The Iranians also vowed that they would never send their existing stockpile of nuclear fuel out of the country, which they are now poised to do, and that they would not allow international inspectors access to their nuclear sites.
Moreover, the Obama administration's defenders note, both the George W. Bush and Clinton administrations also backed off a series of "red line" demands on Iran, as its nuclear program advanced, beginning in the 1990s.
The U.S. and allies jettisoned eight such "red lines" between 1995 and 2013, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School pointed out in a paper. Those included demands that Iran never acquire even a civilian nuclear power facility; enrich uranium above a low grade; accumulate enough low-enriched uranium to fuel a single bomb; or build secret nuclear facilities.
A key disagreement involves the deal's provision for international inspections.
Critics of the Obama administration say that because of Iran's history of lying about secret nuclear facilities, the world powers should have the right to conduct "anytime, anywhere" inspections, a concession the George H.W. Bush administration won from Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
But that agreement came only after a military surrender, said Jofi Joseph, a former nonproliferation official in the Obama White House.
"What is forgotten is that Iraq was militarily defeated in a humiliating rout and had little choice but to accept such terms," he said.
Iran would never agree to any deal without three elements of the pending agreement, Joseph said: recognition of Iran's right to produce some amount of nuclear fuel, a lifting of the sanctions, and a time limit on the deal, after which Iran would be treated like any other signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
The current deal "stacks up pretty well" compared with other recent nonproliferation agreements, said Mark Fitzpatrick, a former State Department official now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
The Clinton administration got North Korea to freeze its plutonium program, but without strict verification requirements, he noted. President George W. Bush gave up nuclear trade restrictions on India without gaining much in the way of nonproliferation safeguards, Fitzpatrick said.
Negotiation with Iran is a special challenge because it has a proud, ideological government and a leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who believes his country can get by without a deal, said Cliff Kupchan, an Iran specialist and chairman of the Eurasia Group risk-assessment consulting firm.
In general, it is tough to bend other countries, including allies, to the American will, Kupchan said.
This agreement can't be fully judged until the details are clear about access to Iran's military sites and until it is known how the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency has resolved its long dispute with Iran over suspected past research into nuclear weapons, Kupchan said. The IAEA investigation is aimed at finding out how much Iran knows about nuclear weapons, to make it easier to monitor its future activities.
He predicted that the agreement "will be good, not great."
"Great agreements don't happen," he said.

A music video featuring the rapper Snoop Dogg and an Iranian pop singer has become the subject of a legal battle in India, where members of the Parsi community say it should be banned because it demeans their Zoroastrian religion.
The 3 1/2-minute video for the song King , released on YouTube last month, shows Snoop Dogg smoking weed while sitting on a throne topped by a giant gold Faravahar, the winged disc that is among the most revered symbols of Zoroastrianism.
Squatting on a low wooden stool, Sayed Mehboob adjusts his red turban, gently faded from countless hours in the afternoon sun. On this patch of sidewalk near the busy Grant Road train station in central Mumbai, modern India flies by in its customary hurry. ( Shashank Bengali )
The rest of the video features Iranian-born Amitis Moghaddam -- dressed as an ancient Persian queen, lying beneath a Faravahar and being fanned by two negligibly clothed men -- interspersed with scenes of women pole-dancing.
A Parsi civic organization has filed suit against Snoop Dogg, Moghaddam, YouTube and other defendants in the eastern city of Kolkata, saying the video is insensitive towards the religious beliefs of one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world.
The public-interest lawsuit is also rooted in a sense of deep unease among the Parsi community, one of Indias smallest religious minorities, whose numbers have been declining for decades.
Descendants of Persians who fled religious persecution in Iran more than 1,000 years ago, Parsis have long held outsize influence in Indian cities such as Mumbai, the financial capital, where they built hospitals, universities and the citys first port.
India has the worlds largest population of Parsis, but while they numbered 115,000 in the 1940s, by 2001, the most recent year for which official statistics are available, the community had shrunk to 69,000.
Parsis prohibit conversion to Zoroastrianism, and due to their economic success, many are waiting longer to marry and have children, reducing their fertility rates. The Indian government started a campaign to encourage Parsis to procreate, including ads in Parsi publications with half-joking messages such as: Be responsible. Dont use a condom tonight.

Parsis for the first time have started to feel insecure as none care for their religious beliefs due to their dwindling numbers, Phiroze Edulji, attorney for the plaintiffs in the music video case, wrote in the lawsuit.
The plaintiff, Darayas Jamshed Bapooji, president of the Parsi Zoroastrian Assn. of Kolkata, said in an interview that he was seeking for the video to be pulled from YouTube. The lawsuit also names the Indian government and the music video hosting companies Vevo and Vydia as respondents.
We being such a small community, our heritage should not be looked down upon, Bapooji said in an interview. We are very proud people, we take pride in our religion and we cannot afford for anyone to do such things.
Zoroastrians trace their faith to the Bronze Age prophet Zoroaster and worship fire as a symbol of God. The Faravahar represents the eternal spirit of the human being and features three layers of feathers, two streamers for the duality of good and evil, and the left-facing head of a man, Zoroaster.
Moghaddam, who performs under her first name, Amitis, lives in the Atlanta area but sings most of her songs in Farsi. As a native Iranian, she should have known the video would be offensive, Bapooji said.
It was done on purpose, we feel, Bapooji said. She should be very much aware of what is what, even if Snoop Dogg wasnt.
The video has hardly been a YouTube smash. Since being released June 1, it had less than 82,000 views as of Monday morning. The video for California Roll, by Snoop Dogg with Stevie Wonder and Pharrell Williams, published May 20, has been seen more than 7.3 million times.
A hearing in the case is scheduled for July 17.

Abdussalam Mohammed of the National Emergency Management Agency said 67 other people were wounded in the Sunday attack and were being treated in hospitals.
Witnesses who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals said the explosion at the Yantaya mosque came as a leading cleric who preaches peaceful coexistence was addressing a crowd during the holy month of Ramadan.

Another bomb exploded at Shagalinku, a restaurant patronized by elite politicians.
Jos is located where Nigeria's majority Muslim north and mainly Christian south collide. The city has been targeted in the past by bomb blasts that have killed hundreds of people. Boko Haram Islamic extremists have claimed responsibility for the attacks.
The explosion at the Yantaya mosque came as leading cleric Sani Yahaya of the Jama'atu Izalatul Bidia organization, which preaches peaceful coexistence of all religions, was addressing a crowd during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to survivors who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They said they did not know how many worshipers were killed.
Sunday's attacks are the latest in a string blamed on Boko Haram that have killed more than 200 people over the past week in the group's northeastern stronghold.
The extremists returned Sunday to northeastern villages attacked three days earlier, killing nine villagers and burning down 32 churches and about 300 homes, said Stephen Apagu, chairman of a vigilante self-defense group in Borno state's Askira-Uba local government area.
He said the vigilantes killed three militants.
Boko Haram took over a large swath of northeastern Nigeria last year and stepped up cross-border raids. A multinational army from Nigeria and its neighbors forced the militants out of towns, but bombings and village attacks increased in recent weeks, apparently in response to an Islamic State group order for more mayhem during Ramadan.
Boko Haram became the Islamic State group's West Africa franchise earlier this year.

        <title>In the Persian world of 'ta'arof,' they make offers that will be refused</title>

In Iranian culture, it is customary to offer guests a glass of water or a cup of tea; many Western cultures do the same. But an Iranian guest who's ta'arofing would refuse the beverage at first pass. The host would insist and offer again. Finally, on the third round, the guest would accept the drink. Any other scenario would be considered rude.
Ta'arof is about more than just offering and refusing things, Beeman said. It is about raising others and "self-lowering" oneself. It is often filled with self-deprecation  something he calls "getting the lower hand."
No matter what twist and turns ta'arof might take, the goal is to be respectful, Beeman said.
To that end, it is similar to the Chinese etiquette of fighting over who pays. People tug at the bill, trying to free it from the grips of someone else at the table. They shout. Faces turn crimson. People pretend to walk to the restroom to secretly pay the bill. It's over-the-top, but it's also considered polite.
The practice is much stronger in Iran and among immigrants from that country than it is among their offspring born in America  though younger Iranian Americans are still expected to ta'arof to some degree.
And then there's the matter of explaining the practice to non-Iranian Americans.
Papen, the ice cream shop owner, does his best to bridge cultural divides that might arise. When a Persian woman comes into the store with her parents and non-Persian boyfriend, for example, he makes sure to give the man a brief education on ta'arof.
A guest is not supposed to pay for a meal, he explains to the boyfriends. It's also considered rude if someone pays for his elder, but it's also rude not to offer.
"I tell them, 'Look, you're going to have to figure this out on your own, but you can't pay,'" Papen explained.
The cultural disconnect has led to a few awkward dates for Shams, who was just a toddler when her family moved to the United States.
And if the dates went well, she had to lay down the rules for how to interact with her Iranian family. Even the right way to say hello came up.
"It's a big ta'arof thing to acknowledge each person in the house," Shams said. "I think in a lot of American households you can get away with not saying hi to every person."
She added: "It's also important to be really thankful for food that you get and try to kind of figure out when people are offering something for real or not really."
The culture shock worked both ways, Shams said. She often found herself ta'arofing with Americans who had no idea that she was just trying to be respectful. Sometimes, it backfired.
"I would go to someone's house and they would ask, 'Would you like a glass of water?' And I would say no, no," she recalled. "But then everyone else had water and I was like, 'Well, now what do I do?'"
::
Masud Valipour, owner of Ketabsara bookstore in Westwood, said ta'arof can be strategic or genuine depending on who is offering.
"The heart of ta'arof is good," he said. "Sometimes people take advantage of it. It's just like anything else."
Down the street from his shop, two women sipped tea in a small cafe and caught up on the latest gossip. A round of ta'arof erupted when a waitress brought a slice of cake to their table.
"Here, please have some," one woman said in Farsi.
Americans get in trouble ... because they offer tea and the Iranian says no. Then the American says 'OK,' and they end up without tea when they wanted it. - William Beeman, author of "Language, Status, and Power in Iran"
"No, I already had one, I couldn't possibly," her friend replied.
At first blush, it seems like a universally feminine move. But in Iranian culture, it transcends gender  both men and women refuse food, not because of its effect on their waistlines but because accepting it on the first offer would be rude.
The back-and-forth continued for minutes, until one finally took a bite. Seconds later, the woman who said she was full stuck in her fork.
In less than five minutes, the pastry had vanished.

The resounding rejection of an international bailout deal by voters in Greece raised fears Sunday of the collapse of the countrys banking system, a catastrophic government default, an eventual exit from the euro and potential social unrest.
In a surprising 61% to 39% result, Greeks said no in a referendum on a rescue package that would have kept their debt-ridden country afloat but subjected it to additional austerity measures.
The landslide delivered a sharp rebuke to European Union leaders who had warned that the plebiscite was, in effect, a vote on whether Greece wanted to remain a member of the Eurozone, the group of 19 nations that share the euro currency.
The EU is now confronted with one of the gravest challenges to its mission of ever closer union between member states.
Greece's financial woes are mounting, and the country's current bailout program for repaying $270 billion in debt to major creditors is set to expire Tuesday. Greece and the Eurozone lenders cannot agree on the new bailout terms. The situation is so dire that the country's cash-strapped banks have... ( Kyle Kim )
Jubilant crowds of no voters thronged Athens main square into the early hours of Monday to celebrate what they said was a chance for Greece to reassert itself and achieve a better deal from creditors. Motorists honked their horns, and triumphant chants of Oxi! Oxi! Oxi!  No! No! No! in Greek  rose in the balmy Mediterranean air.
But there were already signs of a backlash from angry European officials that could make any new bailout agreement even more difficult. If a deal is not struck quickly, Athens could find itself broke, forcing it to default on its debts and triggering a slide out of the Eurozone.
The left-wing government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, which campaigned for a no victory, had demolished the last bridge on which Europe and Greece could approach a compromise, Sigmar Gabriel, the German economy minister, told the Tagesspiegel newspaper.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the leader of the Eurozones finance ministers, described the poll result as very regrettable for the future of Greece. For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable.
An emergency summit of Eurozone leaders is to be held Tuesday.
More urgently, officials at the European Central Bank are to meet Monday to review the emergency aid that has propped up Greeces nearly depleted financial system for the last few months.
If the European Central Bank decides to cut off that lifeline or make it costlier, Greek banks are likely to run out of cash within days. Business would grind to a halt, shops could run short of basic supplies and increasingly agitated residents could find it hard to buy fuel and medicine.
Greek banks have been closed since June 29 on order of the government, and customers limited to about $67 a day in ATM withdrawals. Officials insist that the banks will reopen Tuesday, but analysts doubt this can happen unless the European Central Bank maintains or increases its assistance.
Our immediate priority is the rapid restoration of the functioning of our banking system and the restoration of our economic stability, Tsipras said in a nationally televised address Sunday night. I am certain that the ECB fully understands not only the general economic situation but also the humanitarian dimension which the crisis has taken in the country.
Tsipras also said the referendum result had given him a mandate to press international lenders  mostly other Eurozone countries  for a sustainable bailout package for the Greek government that would address its staggering debt load and free the country from the vicious cycle of austerity.
Greece is the now shame of Europe and a rogue state. They are no longer the valiant Achaean warriors like those depicted by Homer; instead, the Greeks at present day are shameless cowards who try to renege on their loans.

The Greek economy has contracted by a breathtaking 25% since Athens began accepting emergency loans in exchange for brutal spending cuts in 2010. Tsipras radical-left Syriza party swept to power in January on an aggressive anti-austerity platform, setting up the current standoff with Greeces creditors.
He said Athens was prepared to return to the negotiating table immediately. But with relations at an all-time low, it was unclear whether any of Greeces European partners would show up and, even if so, whether an agreement could be hashed out before the Greek government runs out of money.
A major debt to the European Central Bank falls due July 20. If Athens fails to pay  as it already did with a loan from the International Monetary Fund last week  and bank coffers are empty, Greece could be forced to introduce a parallel currency and eventually quit the Eurozone.
Financial analysts say that this is not a threat in the next few days, but warn that the probability of a Grexit down the line has increased considerably because of Sundays vote.
Before the ballots were cast, a parade of European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, said they would interpret a win for the no side as an expression of Greeces desire to quit using the euro.
But Tsipras insisted that the vote did not answer the question in or out of the euro. That question must be removed definitively from the discussion.
Polls consistently show that an overwhelming majority of Greeks want their country to remain in the Eurozone and, by extension, the 28-nation European Union.
Merkel and other European leaders must now ponder whether to let Greece go bust and drop out of the Eurozone or whether such a course would inflict irreparable damage to the credibility of the euro and to the project of greater European unity. The Greek debt crisis is the severest test the euro has faced since it was introduced more than a decade ago.
To try to entice his Eurozone partners back to the bargaining table, Tsipras is apparently considering shuffling his negotiating team to include a broader spectrum of members. Several European officials have said openly that they no longer trust Tsipras or his Syriza party; a Greek delegation with some members drawn from other parties could be more palatable.
That will show that Greece does not want a conflict, said political commentator George Papageorgiou. If there is a consensual approach from the Greek part, that could facilitate a consensual approach from the other part.
Dijsselbloem, the Eurozone finance ministers chief, said the first move was Athens. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities, he said.
The size of the victory for the no campaign came as a surprise both inside and outside Greece after a flurry of opinion polls showed voters to be split down the middle. Bitter disagreement over the significance and possible effect of the plebiscite cleaved living rooms and workplaces across the country.
Just over 62% of the countrys 9.9 million voters cast a ballot, easily surpassing the mandatory threshold of 40% for a referendum to be considered valid.
Surveys suggested that young people voted no in droves. Many agreed with Tsipras contention that the bailout proposals on offer from Greeces lenders demanded too much austerity on top of years of brutal spending cuts and would hit the poor and elderly disproportionately hard.
These measures would worsen the situation, said teacher Paula Andriotaki, 33, after casting her vote in a local school on a bright and warm afternoon. We try to see light, but we get worse and worse.
Yes supporters had urged Greeks to join them in order to guarantee Athens continued place in the Eurozone. They said that membership in the wider European Union could also be at risk and that Greece could not afford to be isolated.
A 40-year-old man named Giorgos, who declined to give his surname, blamed Tsipras for passing the buck.

Pope Francis launched the first of two summertime trips to the Americas on Sunday, arriving in Ecuador on a mission to reach and energize some of the hemispheres poorest, most marginalized -- and most Catholic -- populations.
Francis, the first pope born in the Americas, intends for his now-familiar theme of expanding a church for the poor to be made real on his native continent.
I thank God for having allowed me to return to Latin America to be here with you today, Francis said after stepping off the Alitalia jet that brought him from Rome, becoming the first pope in 30 years to set foot in the dramatically beautiful but politically troubled Andean country of Ecuador.

He said he hoped the gospel would lead the way to meeting contemporary challenges, while respecting differences, dialogue and broad participation, so that growth and progress can benefit everyone, with particular concern for the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters.
Departing from his prepared remarks, he said that concern for the most vulnerable "is a debt that all of Latin America has."
Francis was greeted with a hug on the heavily guarded tarmac by Ecuadors leftist President Rafael Correa. A gust of wind knocked the white cap from his head as he walked off the plane.
The pope noted that Ecuador was home to the place on Earth closest to the sun, the peak of the Chimborazo volcano.
Francis sounded tired as he spoke, his voice somewhat strained.
In addition to Ecuador, he will travel to Bolivia and Paraguay over the next eight days.
By choosing impoverished and geopolitically insignificant countries, Francis drives home his belief in preaching from the periphery, as he and others have put it.
8
Similarly, he elected visits to Albania and Bosnia in Europe before larger, wealthier countries such as France and Germany, noted Austen Ivereigh, an expert on the church and author of a biography, "The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope."
The point he wants to make ... is his conviction that often those on the margins are the most receptive to the church, and he wants to give voice to those on the margins, Ivereigh, founder of the Catholic Voices website, said in a telephone interview from near Oxford.
It is an attitude Francis solidified when he cleared the way earlier this year for the beatification of slain archbishop Oscar Romero, of El Salvador, who was revered in much of Latin America and widely seen as a champion for the poor and downtrodden.
Expectations are high for this papal pilgrimage, with predictions that millions will turn out to see Francis, who is extremely popular, even among many non-Catholics.
The Argentine-born pontiff will also be in his element, speaking his native Spanish and evangelizing among people he knows well. As a Jesuit priest in Buenos Aires, he often preached in that citys shanty towns, which were heavily populated by Paraguayan, Ecuadoran and Bolivian immigrants.
As he did in his first trip to Latin America in Brazil in 2013, the pope also hopes to revitalize a church that has lost ground to Protestant groups, secularism and indigenous movements.
The big question is: Will the wild popularity of Pope Francis translate into numbers for the church? Andrew Chesnut, a church studies professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said in a recent broadcast of Latin Pulse. If it doesnt, the Catholic Church will continue to be in trouble.
This is the same script that Obama uses. Find a poor, downtrodden audience, promise, them the world, and move on. Sadly the numbers in the US keep growing and the country continues to decline.

That question is less of an issue in the countries of this voyage, three of the most Catholic countries in South America, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. In Paraguay, a full 89% of residents identify themselves as Roman Catholic, and attendance at Mass is particularly high.
The pope is also expected to make a special appeal to the indigenous, sprinkling his sermons with native languages such as Guarani, Aymara and Quechua -- in part to counter a movement in South America to recover pre-Columbian concepts, but that has sometimes taken on anti-colonial, and anti-clerical, tones, Ivereigh said.
Whether he gets mired in national politics or uses the themes he shares with leftist leaders to navigate the minefields will test Francis considerable diplomatic skills. He would find common cause, for example, on climate change and other environmental ills that he blames in part on Western consumerism, as outlined in the pope's recent historic encyclical on the subject.
In Bolivia, church-state relations were soured after the election in 2005 of leftist President Evo Morales and his push to change the constitution, declaring Bolivia a secular state.
The church had been a privileged institution and Bolivia opted to become a lay state, said Father Steve Judd, an American missionary priest in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba. That caused some mutual suspicion, where the church would go.
But Morales quickly embraced Francis and even traveled to Brazil and to Rome to meet with him.
Some people consider the pope coming to the country as perhaps a favor or a way to improve relations with the current government or because of the friendship [Morales] has with the pope, said Jose Luis Aguirre, spokesman for the papal trips organizing committee in La Paz, the Bolivian capital.
Francis plans to spend just four hours in La Paz and its sprawling neighbor El Alto, because of their altitude of nearly 12,000 feet -- potentially problematic for a pope with just one lung. He will move then to Santa Cruz, in Bolivias lowlands.
In Quito, meanwhile, in the days leading up to the popes arrival, thousands of anti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest tax hikes, turning raucous at the end of last week and inviting an angry rebuke from Correa on Saturday. He accused his foes of attempting to politicize the popes visit.
Enough of so much violence, so much cowardice, Correa said in a weekly, four-hour television address. How sad we have to talk about this before the popes arrival.
In response, opposition leaders critcized Correas government for cherry-picking papal statements to support its own issues, such as the need for redistribution of wealth, and plastering them on fences across the capital.
The pope has scheduled two days of events in each country, including meetings with local bishops, officials, jailed inmates and people from slums.
In September, Francis heads for Cuba and the United States, where he will meet with President Obama, become the first pope to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress and elevate to sainthood Junipero Serra, the controversial Franciscan friar who founded Californias missions.

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, and nations across Asia are marking the event in a variety of ways. Mainland China is planning a massive military parade in early September to commemorate the event, but Taiwan has said it would not send any participantsto those events.
Taiwan staged V-shaped military aircraft flyovers and a first-ever display of homegrown missile systems at its headlineanniversary event Saturday at a military base in the north of the island. Taiwan has upgraded weaponry in recent years mainly to brace against any conflict with mainland China.
During Japans 1931-45 occupation of China, the Nationalist Party headed by Chiang Kai-shek resisted the Japanese and ruled most of the inland areas that did not fall to them. The Chinese Communist Party engaged in separate guerrilla warfare against the Japanese.

The Nationalist Party was forced to retreat to Taiwan after losing China'scivilwar to Mao Tse-tungs Communists in the late 1940s.
Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been separately ruled, though Taiwan has never formally declared independence and Beijing continues to claim sovereignty over the island, straining relations for decades. Taiwan is formallyknown as the Republic of China.
The Chinese Communists will say they were the major force resisting Japan, but thats just a way of cheating public opinion, Taiwan Defense Ministry spokesman Lo Shao-he said. Over eight years of resistance, it was our Republic of China forces who led it.
In a speech after the Saturday show, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou said fighting by Republic of China forces in World War II would not be forgotten, nor can the Republic of Chinas victory in the war be distorted.
Republic of China troops at times had to use simple knives against the militarily superior Japanese, recalled Tao Shih-chun, a 97-year-old veteran at the military show. At least 10 million Chinese people died during the resistance, with some estimates far higher.
cComments
Although I am pro-Taiwan, and my wife is Taiwanese, both Taiwan and China are completely wrong and should not be celebrating as the victors. If I recall correctly, the U.S. and two atomic bombs had a little bit to do with defeating Japan.

Japan formally surrendered in September 1945 after intensive American airstrikes including the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The Taiwan governments assertion of wartime leadership follows years of efforts to avoid being eclipsed internationally by the much larger mainland China as officials in Beijing try to diminishthe islands global profile.
It is of course a concern for the leadership here, said Raymond Wu, managing director of political risk consultancy e-telligence in Taipei. It goes back to the old angle between China and Taiwan about legitimacy.
After years of all but ignoring the Nationalists' contributions to wartime fighting, Beijing has begun to acknowledge their efforts -- but still maintains that Communist forces' contributions were decisive.
Mainland scholars now speak openly about the Republic of Chinas clout in World War II, said Kweibo Huang, associate diplomacy professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei.
At Saturdays military hardware parade, Taiwan brought out modern surface-to-air missiles and attack helicopters, some flying at steep angles above a crowd of thousands at a mountainous military base.
China is not expected to publicly challenge the narrativeTaiwan put on display Saturday. Since Ma, of the Nationalist Party, was elected in 2008, the two sides have set aside political disputes to pursuedialogue after decades of icy relations. 
Beijing prefers a Nationalist Party-ledgovernment in Taiwan, rather than one led by the islands chief opposition party, which advocates more distancefrom China. The island will hold elections next year, and Ma cannot seekoffice again. Early opinion polls show the opposition party with the lead.
China should be happy because the military parade will stimulate everyones understanding of the Republic of China, and its not for the promotion of a separate Taiwan identity, Huang said.

With his weapon in one hand, Ibrahim answered his cellphone with the other. He was hoping the call would bring news of reinforcements for his Afghan Local Police post, which was under siege from hundreds of Taliban insurgents.
But the caller was his brother, and Ibrahim, a 20-year-old member of the U.S.-backed Afghan government militia, broke down in tears in the middle of an hours-long gun battle in the eastern province of Maidan Wardak.
When I heard his voice, I thought to myself, This is the end, Ibrahim said. I started to cry before telling him goodbye and that I was sorry for any wrong I ever did to him.

At least 30 ALP members were killed in the fighting last week as Taliban insurgents launched a coordinated attack on a series of ALP checkpoints in Jalrez district, which lies on a strategically important highway about one hour west of Kabul.
Government forces said they had regained control of the checkpoints, but President Ashraf Ghani called for an investigation after surviving militiamen accused the Interior Ministry of failing to send army or police units to help the ALP, a mostly rural paramilitary force created with heavy U.S. support.
Ibrahim and another ALP member, Ali, 19, said they were outgunned and outnumbered during a 27-hour battle that began late Wednesday evening when Taliban forces rushed a nearby checkpoint. Both men  who like many Afghans have only one name  have refused orders to return to their posts and spoke to The Times on Sunday in Kabul.
Ali said he called the Interior Ministry  which oversees the ALP  several times during the battle to beg for air support and fresh weapons and ammunition. No help arrived.
Seven ALP checkpoints, all manned by members of the Hazara ethnic minority, were overrun by Taliban, raising charges of ethnic bias. All of the dead ALP fighters were Hazaras, and some were reportedly beheaded and dragged from the backs of moving cars. Some officials say the ALP death toll could be as high as 45.
We fought for two days without food, water or sleep and no one said so much as, 'Thank you for your service.' - Ali, a 19-year-old member of the Afghan Local Police
In the last three months, Afghan security forces in the northern provinces of Kunduz and Badakhshan have also accused Kabul of failing to help them in battles against Taliban insurgents who have been waging one of their deadliest offensives in years across parts of northern, eastern and southern Afghanistan.
The reports from Wardak were the first to involve the ALP and Hazaras, who have long felt targeted by the Pashtun-dominated Taliban and complained of discrimination from the central government.
They could be rescued easily but werent. Why? Because of their ethnicityit must become clear, said former Second Vice President Mohammad Karim Khalili.

Arif Rahmani, a lawmaker from the eastern province of Ghazni, said in parliament that three Afghan National Police checkpoints did not respond, despite being located within approximately 500 yards of ALP posts that were under attack.
By Thursday evening, a day after the fighting began, four ALP members at the Sar-e Tapa checkpoint were killed and another was severely injured, leaving Ibrahim and Ali as the only ones able to defend the position. They were stunned at the lack of support because they were less than 10 miles from the provincial capital and 30 miles from Kabul.
Each post had two, three, even four martyrs, Ali said.
When it became clear that Kabul was ignoring their pleas, Ali added, an ALP commander he identified only as Mohammad, who oversaw three of the checkpoints, called his two bodyguards into battle with him. All three were killed, Ali said.
Ali said that at the time of the attack, several of his colleagues had already gone five months without receiving their monthly salary of about $166.
We fought for two days without food, water or sleep and no one said so much as, Thank you for your service, Ali said.
Aref, a friend, said Ali is suffering from post-traumatic stress.
The other night he was talking in his sleep: Go, go, go! Get him, shoot the rocket now! Aref said. None of them have had the time to heal from the mental scars.
Ali said he and his comrades have all been told to return to their posts or risk losing their jobs, but he has refused, he said, until his superiors provide better weapons.
We cant go back if things are just going to continue as they were, he said.
An ALP commander named Zarif, who is based in Jalrez but was on leave last week, said in an interview that the paramilitary force had long felt ignored by the Interior Ministry. He said the areas in which they were stationed were among the most dangerous in the province and that officials have failed to recognize the forces sacrifices.
We still have martyrs there [in Jalrez], lying in the same spot where they were struck by the Taliban, he said.
He said the government cannot continue to ignore the risks the ALP face, especially in Jalrez.
We joined the ALP to be of service to the country, he said, not for the money.

China
When a massive earthquake struck Nepal in April, Chinese nongovernmental organizations rushed in to provide help, making camp on the grounds of the national palace museum and distributing water, food and tents.
A Lions Club chapter in Guangdong province pitched in; so did the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, among others.
But Chinese nonprofits are not just engaging with neighbors during disasters: They have helped build hospitals in Sudan and organized educational exchanges with African lawyers.
The nascent coming-out reflects China's economic and social development, as well as a recognition that such activities are a means to enhance the country's image.
The law basically would prohibit any entity in China from receiving funding or doing partnerships with any non-approved foreign NGOs. - Huang Xuetao, a Chinese attorney who works with grass-roots organizations
But even as Chinese NGOs have started casting their gaze overseas, international nonprofits working in China are feeling a chill. Draft legislation under consideration could, for the first time, put foreign nonprofits under the direct supervision of China's security apparatus and impose a range of restrictions. Among the proposed rules: requiring half of all staff to be Chinese and forbidding direct recruitment of volunteers.
The legislation apparently would cover philanthropic groups such as the Gates Foundation and Doctors Without Borders, environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, educational entities and nonprofit trade associations such as the U.S. Meat Export Federation and the Motion Picture Assn. Overseas entities such as orchestras and museums that want to do tours or other short-term activities in China would need consent from security officials.
8
China says the aim of the legislation is to bring foreign nonprofits out of a legal gray area; many are now essentially registered as businesses on the mainland because China has lacked clear national regulations for foreign NGOs (aside from a few dozen overseas foundations registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs). The draft law "is part of our effort to rule the country according to law, and also part of our effort to align China with the international community," Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in an interview.
Wang said the new law would not create obstacles to NGOs that are "dedicated to promoting exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese people in accordance with Chinese laws." But the proposed legislation comes in wake of the establishment of a new National Security Council, the drafting of a new national security law, and rising government rhetoric warning against the pernicious influence of "Western values."
The legislation says foreign NGOs must not endanger China's "national unity, security or ethnic unity" nor "harm China's national interests" nor "illegally engage in religious activities" and cannot raise money within China.
The proposal has inspired significant anxiety among foreign nonprofits  some of whom say they may be forced to curtail their activities or withdraw from China altogether  as well as many Chinese partner organizations, who worry that their overseas funding and professional support could be cut or criminalized.
Representatives of 10 major foreign nonprofits operating in China, contacted for comment, refused to be quoted by name or organization for fear of antagonizing Chinese authorities. "People are so skittish right now," said Anthony J. Spires, an associate professor of sociology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong whose research focuses on civil society and NGOs in China. "It's really a big deal."
3
But 45 foreign trade groups and professional organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Recording Industry Assn. of America and the American Bar Assn., wrote an unusual letter last month to Chinese authorities, warning that unless revised, the legislation would have a "significant adverse impact on the future of U.S.-China relations."
Foreign industry associations, universities, environmental groups, science and technology groups and other NGOs, the 45 signees said, are key to businesses' research, market development, information sharing, innovation and corporate philanthropy activities. The legislation would even seem to limit Chinese engineers from participating in international professional societies, it said.
As drafted, the law would "negatively impact the ability of companies to do business in China, as well as U.S.-China commercial and people-to-people exchanges," said James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. "This is increasingly important as China globalizes and its companies and NGOs expand overseas."
Exactly how many foreign NGOs operate in China is unclear; Spires put the number at 200 to 300, though some estimates range as high as 6,000. Fewer than 30 foreign foundations are registered with the Civil Affairs Ministry. China has more than 4,000 domestic foundations as well as 600,000 registered domestic NGOs, many of which have significant government participation, despite engaging in NGO-type activities.
The draft legislation calls for foreign entities in China with nonprofit parent organizations abroad to find a Chinese government agency to serve as their "sponsor"; the government is to publish a list of authorized sponsor agencies. But finding a sponsor may prove difficult, experts said, because government officials may be wary of vouching for a foreign entity.
"This would be a political risk, a personal risk" to one's career, Spires said.
But more concerning, Spires said, was the possible "ripple" damage to links between Chinese civil society groups and foreign nonprofits  cutting off funding, inhibiting mentoring and closing off the exchange of ideas.
"The law basically would prohibit any entity in China from receiving funding or doing partnerships with any non-approved foreign NGOs," said Huang Xuetao, a Chinese attorney who works with grass-roots organizations. Huang said she believes Communist Party authorities fear that foreign NGOs are promoting "Western values" and ideology.
"For Chinese authorities, this is a real threat; they view Western influence as undermining their role," she said. "But from a legal point of view, it's hard to regulate value systems. Laws can mostly only regulate actions. So they have drafted this law to take away as much freedom as possible and hand it to police."
A staff member of a foreign nonprofit who has 30 years of experience in China said she believed there were several triggers for the concern among Chinese authorities  including the U.S. surveillance activities revealed by Edward Snowden; the U.S. "pivot" to Asia; and last year's "Occupy Central" pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which some mainland Chinese authorities said were instigated or supported by foreign "black hands."
"All of this has fed a real worsening of bilateral [U.S.-China] relations that is about the worst I've ever seen," she said.
A monthlong comment period on the draft legislation ended in early June, but no Chinese or foreigners working in the sector expressed any optimism that major revisions would be made. Still, several said the real clarity will not come until Public Security authorities begin implementation and enforcement.

To the leaders of the European Union who warn that Greece might soon be expelled from their midst, Lydia Lenossi has an ancient reminder.
Remember where Europe got its name? From the beautiful princess Europa, a popular figure in Greek mythology.
"The god Zeus brought Europa on his back as a bull from Phoenicia to Crete," Lenossi said, adding tartly of EU officials: "They forgot about it. There is no Europe without Greece."
Conversely, Lenossi believes that her country needs, and deserves, to belong to a strong, united Europe. Yet the retired actress is still voting "no" Sunday on a painful cash-for-cuts bailout deal that European partners have offered debt-ridden Greece and that the government decided to put to a snap referendum.

The plebiscite has sown bitter divisions across this sunny, storied land, with surveys showing the race too close to call. The vote is being portrayed, by many news outlets here and abroad and by some EU officials, as a stark choice for or against Europe, pro-euro or anti-euro.
But the reality is more complicated than that. In some ways, many "yes" and "no" voters are closer than their binary election options imply, including in their attitudes toward the European Union.
Polls consistently show that, whatever they feel about the repeated bailouts and austerity cuts their country has suffered in the last five years, about 75% of Greeks want their country to remain one of the 19 nations using the euro and therefore, by extension, a full-fledged member of the European Union.
The single currency is the EU's most important project in promoting greater harmony and integration on a continent ripped apart by two world wars. EU rules dictate that all member states  except Britain and Denmark, which opted out from the start  must eventually adopt the euro to be considered in good standing.

Greece joined the EU in 1981, the 10th of 28 nations to sign up so far. To many Greeks reared in the aftermath of World War II, a bloody civil war and a military dictatorship that ruled from 1967 to 1974, admittance to the club was validation that their country  the cradle of democracy  had stabilized and matured and was no longer a Balkan basket case.
Membership gave the Greeks, still relatively poor, access to badly needed funds to build their laggard economy.
"Wherever you went at the time, there were signs of the European stars, the European flag, in the constructions of buildings, the constructions of roads," said Othon Anastasakis, an expert on Greek history at Oxford University and an advisor to the Greek Foreign Ministry on EU affairs during the 1990s.
"European money was very, very much improving the lives of the Greeks," Anastasakis said. "That was the thing that really defined the popularity of the European Union in the hearts and minds of the Greeks."
Adoption of the euro in 2001 brought in more investment and an even better standard of living, further cementing the perception of the EU as a key provider of prosperity.
But successive governments in Athens went on spending sprees they could not afford  and hid their excesses. The debt crisis that blew open in late 2009 has haunted this country since.
In five years of emergency loans and brutal spending cuts demanded by creditors such as Germany, Greeks have watched their once-growing economy tumble into free fall. Many residents speak incredulously of scenes they thought unimaginable in their proud country  hungry people picking through garbage, despairing pensioners committing suicide  and accuse Greece's lenders of plunging their society into an abyss.

@Bill Comment It's unfortunate that a number of them they allowed themselves to believe that their government would take care of them. But that's what a generation of them were promised and believed. It should be a lesson to all not to solely rely on the government for your well...

The left-wing government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras contends that the new bailout package on the referendum ballot would bring yet more misery, especially for the poor and the elderly. Many Greeks who plan to join him in voting "no" hope to send a message to leaders of the EU: not that they want out, but that the EU should return to its original principles and stop riding roughshod over this nation of 11 million people.
"There were values  solidarity, democracy, freedom of the people.... There is nothing of that now," said Lenossi, the actress, who is 70. "They should not give precedence to money. Money is not the first issue. Humans are the first issue. We are not numbers; we are humans."
Nikos Aspradakis, 48, recalled the promises he felt were made.
"When I was voting in favor of the EU, I was told that my salary would slowly converge with French and German levels, that Greece wouldn't need to spend so much on its military anymore, that my democracy which has been shaken in the past would be secure, that there would be light at the end of the tunnel. I don't see any of that anymore," said Aspradakis, who works in the private sector.
"Now they are saying that I should have a salary like those in Bulgaria. Why? I want Bulgarians' salary to rise, not the opposite."
With his compatriots still heavily in favor of membership in the Eurozone and the EU, Tsipras has repeatedly sought to assure them that a "no" vote would not jeopardize either. That directly contradicts statements by the leaders of Germany, France and Spain, who warn that a win for the "no" camp will be taken as a desire to exit the euro. And quitting or being banished from the euro would mean giving up EU membership as well, the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, has insisted.
Tsipras and his advisors have also tried to reinforce the idea that it is the EU that has let Greece down, with its "threats" and "blackmail," and not the other way around.
"It is a dark hour for Europe, as far as I'm concerned," the outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said in a recent radio interview. "We are looking upon these developments with a great deal of sadness on what has happened to the Europe we signed up to."
Many residents say that an EU without Greece is as unthinkable as Greece without the EU, for reasons of geopolitical stability and because of shared roots and culture stretching back millenniums.
"We are not guests in a system run by others. We are an integral part of it," said a 50-year-old bank worker named Giorgos, who declined to give his surname, at a massive "no" campaign rally Friday evening.
"Yes" supporters agree that Greece belongs at the heart of the Eurozone and the EU, but they insist that a victory for their side is the only way to guarantee it.
Anastasakis at Oxford said the anger fueling "no" voters is understandable, because European officials bear responsibility for some of the missteps that have turned Greece's debt crisis into such an intractable mess.
But in the end, even many "no" voters realize that their future is bound up with the EU.
"They are furious at Europe," Anastasakis said. "But there is no other game in town for them."

The move, which gives the government stepped-up powers to deal with suspected terrorists but also curtails to a degree the rights of ordinary citizens, marks an unhappy juncture in what had perhaps been the only real success story to emerge from the 2011 uprisings that were collectively dubbed the Arab Spring.

Tunisia, whose revolt against a longtime dictator set in motion similar pro-democracy movements across North Africa and the Middle East, had been making steady strides in its transition to democracy. But the June 26 attack on the idyllic seaside town of Sousse, which killed at least 38 people, most of them British vacationers, coupled with Islamic militants assault in March on a landmark museum in the capital, seemingly forced the governments hand.
Poor Tunisia. They were the successful "Arab Spring" country. Guess not.

Emergency law strengthens executive powers, restricts rights such as freedom of assembly, and grants greater authority to the security forces. The declaration was announced by the office of President Beji Caid Essebsi, who later delivered a nationally televised speech.
In his address, Essebsi cited a state of war of a special kind that demanded the harnessing of the states powers.
A constitution agreed upon last year  and touted at the time as a token of Tunisias strengthening of its democratic institutions  does allow for an emergency declaration by the countrys leadership under exceptional circumstances. But for many, it harks back to days when authorities acted with impunity to quell any dissent.
Tunisian officials have been alarmed by evidence that two of the assailants in Marchs museum attack, and also the lone gunman in the Sousse massacre, had been provided with training at militant camps in next-door Libya. In the two attacks, officials see an intensifying bid by Islamist militants to destabilize Tunisia's still-fragile order.
The country's last state of emergency was in 2011, during the revolt against longtime ruler Zine el Abidine ben Ali, who was forced to step down.
In the immediate aftermath of the Sousse attack, the government announced measures including the deployment of troops at tourist sites and the closing of dozens of mosques deemed as wellsprings of hate rhetoric.
The most recent rampage, which targeted foreign tourists as they swam and sunbathed, is expected to cause more than $500 million in losses to Tunisias tourist sector, one of the mainstays of the economy.
The gunman in the resort attack was shot dead, but authorities have rounded up a number of suspected accomplices.

The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency said Saturday he hopes to complete his controversial investigation of Irans past nuclear activities by December, potentially removing a key obstacle to completion of world powers sweeping nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic.
As diplomats rush to reach an agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program, the U.S. military is stockpiling conventional bombs so powerful that strategists say they could cripple Tehran's most heavily fortified nuclear complexes, including one deep underground. ( W.J. Hennigan )
Meanwhile, diplomats said there has also been progress on another disputed issue in the negotiations, the sanctions relief that Iran will receive as part of the deal. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement on the structure and schedule for sanctions relief, though more work and a high-level blessing is needed, officials said.
If and when issues get resolved at an experts level, there will remain some open issues that can only be decided by ministers, a senior Obama administration official said. Negotiators still have a bunch of work to do on the sanctions issue, added the official, who would not be named while the discussions were still in progress.

Diplomats have also reached tentative agreement on a mechanism to restore suspended sanctions if Iran is found to be violating the agreement. U.S. officials consider this snapback essential and have pressed to avoid allowing a small number of countries to block it from happening.
Under the proposed arrangement, a panel made up of the six countries and Iran would examine any assertions that Iran is not living up to it obligations. The U.N.Security Council would periodically adopt a resolution rolling over suspension of the sanctions.
But if a council member believed Iran to be in violation of the rules, it could prevent the rollover and reinstate the sanctions, officials say.

The United States and five other world powers -- France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China -- are seeking a deal that would ease sanctions on Iran if it agrees to steps intended to keep it from obtaining a bomb for 10 to 15 years. Negotiators for the group have been working in Vienna for the past week, toward a self-imposed deadline of Tuesday.
Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters he hopes to complete the IAEAs probe of Irans pastactivities if Iran cooperates in answering outstanding questions on past work, such as research on nuclear bomb related equipment.
With the cooperation from Iran, I think we can issue a report by the end of the year on the assessment of the clarification of the issues related to possible military dimensions, he said.
Amano visited Tehran on Thursday and held meetings that top Iranian officials said had yielded progress toward resolving the long-running investigation.
Kelsey Davenport, of the Arms Control Assn., said the comments were a very significant development for the IAEAs investigation and for completion of the nuclear deal, which may happen in days.
The nuclear agency has been seeking to establish the facts on avariety of suspected past nuclear activities, including experiments with bomb detonators. The IAEA considers the probecrucial because the information will help monitor Irans risky nuclear activities in the future, and to deter other countries from trying to break nuclear rules.
Iran insists that it has never sought a nuclear weapon. And it has been concerned that the agency would continue extending its investigation indefinitely.
Iran could still balk at providing all the information the IAEA is seeking.
But Davenport said Iran now has a strong incentive to cooperate. Doing so will ensure that it receives sanctions relief as part of the broader deal, she said. And since the deal is in view, Iranian officials can have confidence that the major powers wont penalize them in the agreement, she said.
Ray Takeyh, an Iran specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations, who has been skeptical about the negotiations, said Amanos plan may open the way for the agency to wrap up the investigation without getting all the answers it needs.
The issue will not be resolved, but it will be passed over, he predicted.

        <title>Dalai Lama's 80th birthday invites celebration and contemplation</title>
        <Link>http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-tibet-future-20150705-story.html</Link>
        <Description>
	  To hear the Dalai Lama laugh, his face lighting up in a beatific smile, it is easy to forget the cascade of disasters endured by the Tibetan Buddhist movement over the course of his life.
	</Description>
        <MainBody>16
Tibet had been run as a de facto independent country in the chaotic early 20th century, but it had not been formally recognized. In 1949, Chinese Communists claimed power in distant Beijing and proved to be a force that the Himalayan mountain kingdom could not overcome.
For China, the 965,000-square-mile region known as the Tibetan plateau, spread over strategic high ground in the center of Asia, is a crucial buffer from India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Encompassing roughly one-quarter of China's landmass, it is the source of most of Asia's largest rivers, supplying water to nearly half the world's population. It also has the largest reserve of uranium in the world.
The struggle to subdue Tibet has shaped the character of modern China, forcing it to become the kind of brutal imperial power the early communist ideologues once deplored. Beijing devotes inordinate military and diplomatic effort to defend its claim to Tibet, which it calls "an integral part of China since antiquity."
"The Chinese know that historically their empire was weak when control over the western borders lapsed,'' said Sulmaan Wasif Khan, a specialist in Chinese foreign relations at Tufts University.
Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule has been relatively nonviolent compared with ethnic disputes elsewhere, such as those involving Kurds or Chechens.
Robert Barnett, a Tibet scholar at Columbia University in New York, counts only about 20 Han Chinese (the ethnic majority in China) who have been killed by political violence at the hands of Tibetans since the 1980s. The death toll among ethnic Tibetans is higher, in the hundreds including those who have self-immolated with calls for the Dalai Lama to return.
If he dies in exile, though, that could change. "People may feel the Chinese forced him to die outside his country and caused him grief, and they could reap a terrible harvest of suffering,'' Barnett said.
At the heart of the dilemma is the Dalai Lama. Although he abandoned calls for Tibetan independence in 1979, embracing instead a "middle way" in which Tibetans would enjoy autonomy and freedom of religion and speech under Chinese rule, the Chinese Communist Party reviles him as a separatist.
"The Dalai party has never abandoned the use of violence to achieve their ultimate goal of full independence,'' the State Council wrote in a "white paper" on Tibet released in mid-April.
So anathema is the Dalai Lama to the Communist Party that he is treated as the one whose name cannot be mentioned. Tibetans dare not speak of him in public. Walking down the street with a portrait of the Dalai Lama will get one immediately arrested in most parts of China. Tiny medallions are routinely confiscated and destroyed.
That causes a recurring cycle of ill will among Tibetans, whose reverence for their spiritual leader endures. People have crossed the Himalayas in flip-flops seeking a blessing from the Dalai Lama. Gonpo Tso, a 64-year-old Tibetan exile living in Dharamsala, says she could accept Chinese communist rule over Tibet if not for the slander of her spiritual leader.
"It gives such pain to my heart to hear the words they use about the Dalai Lama,'' she said.
+++
Tibetans remain deeply embittered about the horrors inflicted upon their society by the Communist Party from the 1950s through the 1970s: the mass starvation, the desecration of Buddhist monasteries, the arrests and executions. By the time of Mao Tse-tung's demise in 1976, hundreds of thousands of Tibetans had perished. Some exile sources estimate up to 1.2 million deaths.
Nevertheless, many Tibetans are quietly returning home, accepting that to live there they will lose many of the freedoms they enjoy in India.
Consider the case of Lobsang, a Tibetan (like many, he has only one name) who trekked across the Himalayas as a 16-year-old monk to follow the Dalai Lama.
Reincarnation is not the business of the communists. - The Dalai Lama
Last year, Lobsang found himself among the crowd of hundreds of Tibetans outside the barbed wire-topped concrete walls of the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi. It is a place that Tibetans used to go to protest; now they line up starting at 3 a.m for documents that permit them to go home.
"I felt such uneasiness being there,'' said Lobsang, 34, a slightly built man who works as a Tibetan-language teacher and editor. "Here I was, as a Tibetan, asking the Chinese for permission to go back to my own home."
Although the Tibetan exile community here reached a high of 118,000 in the mid-1990s, it dropped to 94,000 as of the most recent census, in 2009. Chinese state media say 80,000 Tibetan exiles have returned to visit or to live in Tibet since the 1980s.
The Chinese are quietly encouraging those who elect to return.

        <title>India's traditional ear de-waxing business is waning</title>
        <Link>http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-ear-cleaner-20150704-story.html</Link>
        <Description>
	  Squatting on a low wooden stool, Sayed Mehboob adjusts his red turban, gently faded from countless hours in the afternoon sun. On this patch of sidewalk near the busy Grant Road train station in central Mumbai, modern India flies by in its customary hurry.
	</Description>
        <MainBody>8
A young man in an orange plaid shirt approaches Mehboob, who motions toward the empty stool. Gaurav, a 21-year-old housekeeper here for his occasional cleaning, sits down stiffly, like a boy in a dentist's chair.
Mehboob props his bag of tools on one leg. He pulls out a steel pin the length of a pencil, swathes the tip in a wad of cotton and guides it toward Gaurav's aural canal.
In Mumbai, a commercial hub of more than 12 million where seemingly no job is too small, many of the last remaining traditional ear cleaners hail from southern India. Some trace the profession to the 18th century, when India was under Mogul rule and much of the southern region belonged to the nizam or monarch, of Hyderabad.
Mehboob, who was born outside Hyderabad, learned the trade when he came to look for work in Mumbai 25 years ago, when it was still known as Bombay. After laboring in construction for a few years, a fellow southerner taught him how to clean ears.
"It was just something to do," he says. In the crowded city, with vehicles and construction sites fouling the air with fumes and dust, he describes getting one's ears professionally cleaned as "a normal practice."
Come on LA TIMES did you REALLY have to remind us of what a 3rd world sewer India is? And with PICTURES? EWWWWW
Another Fine Day in Compton
at 11:09 PM July 04, 2015

Mehboob charges 20 rupees, or about 30 cents, for a standard cleaning of both ears with cotton and hydrogen peroxide. It takes less time than a good shoeshine. The deluxe treatment can include daubs of lotion, coconut oil and a dark liquid that Mehboob described as an ayurvedic tonic, and costs 50 rupees, or 80 cents.
"That's if the ear is inflamed, or if it's really red," he says. "The lotions provide a soothing effect."
His method is to dip the cotton-tipped pin in hydrogen peroxide and scrape the outer ear canal before proceeding to the inner canal. An old pair of tweezers helps pick out stubborn bits of dirt and wax.
A routine day brings about a dozen customers, he says. For long stretches he sits alone in front of a former phone booth, its rusted doors padlocked shut. In the late afternoon, he moves farther down the road, hoping to catch commuters disembarking from a train on their way home.
It is unlikely that most young people who pass him on the street know what he does, or recognize the meaning of the red turban. Most of his regular customers are elderly, he says, although they are loyal, some even summoning him to their apartment for house calls.
"Rich people," he says proudly.
Mumbai's ear cleaners have a checkered reputation. Foreigners tell stories of being accosted along the promenade near the Gateway of India monument by red-turbaned men waving needles. With the advent of cotton swabs and obsessive hygiene, the trade seems destined for extinction.
In a decent month, Mehboob saves the equivalent of $80 after deducting the little he pays for rent. He shares a room nearby with 15 men  day laborers, taxi drivers, security guards  most of them migrants, all Muslims in a staunchly Hindu neighborhood.
They are the unsung of Mumbai, the people who run the basic machinery of the city, and then there is Mehboob, a fading relic in every way.
He owns nothing of value here, not even a cellphone. He deposits his earnings with a broker instead of in a bank, preferring to carry his savings back to his hometown when he returns every few months to visit his family and their tiny plot of farmland.
Yet Mehboob has trained his nephew, so there could be at least one more generation of ear cleaners in Mumbai. He dismisses the word of doctors who advise patients with earaches not to visit men like him, warning of infections and scrapes.
"Of course the doctors say that," he says. "It's good for their business."

Police in a central Philippine city said Saturday that they have filed murder complaints against the owner and the crew of a ferry that capsized shortly after pulling out of port, leaving more than 50 people dead.

The complaints were filed with the local prosecutor late Friday as the 36-ton M/B Kim Nirvana was lifted from the water, said Senior Inspector Rio Tan of the Ormoc City police.
Regional coast guard commander Capt. Pedro Tinampay said at least 59 people died and 145 survived Thursday's disaster, including all 18 crew members.

Tinampay said a maritime casualty investigation that has begun will determine how many people actually were aboard the vessel. The 204 so far known to have been on board are more than the 189 initially reported, Tinampay said, adding that authorities will reconcile different figures for survivors and casualties.
The ferry overturned minutes after pulling out of the port on its voyage to one of the Camotes Islands, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the south.
Tan said murder complaints were filed against ferry owner Joge Bung Zarco, boat captain Warren Oliverio and 17 other crew members.

The local prosecutor will review the complaints to determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges in court.
Tinampay said some passengers reported that the boat suddenly swerved to the right, possibly causing its cargo, including 80 sacks of cement, to shift to one side of the ferry.
It capsized and its right outrigger broke, Tinampay said. The captain suddenly turned the boat to the right, and we have people saying that.
Oliverio denied he made a sudden turn, blaming strong waves for flipping his boat. It was the waves, he told ABS-CBN television. He said that he could not have made any sudden turn because there was another vessel close to the ferry.
Tinampay said eight bodies were recovered from the boat after it was hoisted out of the water. City rescue group head Ciriaco Tolibao said three more bodies were recovered from the sea early Saturday.
The boat remains belly up on the Ormoc wharf and will be turned upright to allow investigators to get a closer look, Tinampay said.

That's how they'll vote in a pivotal referendum Sunday on a financial bailout package for Greece that would entail more of the austerity many people say has brought their economy to its knees.

"They gave us medicine that was worse than the illness," Popy Melliou, 57, said of the international creditors whose loans have kept the Greek government's lights on for the last five years. "It's a shame for them that they cannot save a small country."
She scoffed at warnings from the "yes" campaign  and from a passel of European leaders  that a "no" result could lead to Greece's banishment from the 19-nation Eurozone. And she laughed at the idea that anyone in the cafe might support the other side.
This is Exarchia, a neighborhood long renowned in Athens as a hotbed of radicalism and free thinking.
Anarchists, anti-fascists, environmentalists, feminists and immigrant-rights activists have all cut their teeth here. So did Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, a left-wing firebrand who attended the National Technical University of Athens down the street, site of a famous uprising against Greece's military dictatorship in 1973, the year before he was born.

The political instincts Tsipras honed in Exarchia helped lead him to call Sunday's snap referendum, a bombshell announcement last weekend that blew up his negotiations with Greece's lenders. Tsipras said voters would have to pass judgment on the bailout offer, which he is campaigning against.
Other Eurozone countries have been urging Greeks to accept their proposals to extend the $270-billion package of loans the country received in the last five years, even though the offer technically expired Tuesday after the failure of talks between Athens and its creditors. Only a "yes" vote will open the way for negotiations to a new bailout, they say.
Polls suggest that the race is neck and neck. Beneath pink Athenian skies, both the "yes" and "no" sides held massive rallies Friday evening in a final push before a mandatory day free of campaigning on the eve of the vote.
"Today the whole of Europe has turned its eyes on the Greek people," Tsipras, wearing his trademark open-necked white shirt, told the boisterous "no" crowd in front of Parliament.
He urged them to stand up to threats and "blackmail" emanating from other European capitals and to reject their demand for "dead-end" austerity cuts. He repeated his contention that a victory for the "no" camp would improve his bargaining position.
Barely half a mile away, backers of a "yes" vote cheered speakers who said that the referendum posed a stark choice: Greece remaining a player in a united Europe or being sidelined and left to sink on its own.
They blamed Tsipras and his Syriza party for pushing Greece into a standoff with its lenders so damaging that the government had to order a weeklong bank shutdown to prevent a run on the financial system. The head of the banking association said Friday that Greece's banks had enough cash, about $1.1 billion, to last only until Monday.
Gosh, how terrible that there was a democratic vote and the people of Greece said No to more austerity! They should have left it to the politicians, who have done such a wonderful job! Whatever happens, the people have spoken.

"We have been dragged into a pointless referendum that is dividing the people and hurting the country," Athens Mayor George Kaminis said.
The nail-biting showdown Sunday has sharply divided a nation already reeling from five years of deep budget cuts in exchange for emergency loans. The Greek economy has fallen into a depression as severe as the one the United States experienced in the 1930s.
If the "no" campaign prevails in the end, it will be due in no small part to the anger and activism of left-wing enclaves like Exarchia.
Its cafes nestle between buildings splashed with graffiti like "No racism" and "Athens burns." Bookstores sell Marx; music stores sell vinyl.
There's little evidence of the long lines seen elsewhere in Athens at ATMs, perhaps because local anarchists tend to destroy them.
Conversations reflect the intellectual ferment of college campuses in the neighborhood. A site saved from development by community activists has been turned into a people's park where all types can meet.
"There are places in Exarchia where you can see the professor from Paris next to the anarchist who just got out of jail for armed robbery," said Melliou, the customer at the O Tseligkas cafe, which has been serving customers for at least 30 years.
It was already around when, in the 1990s, Tsipras distinguished himself as a gifted and charismatic student leader at the National Technical University of Athens, building on an activist temperament he had shown in high school during a campus revolt against education reforms.
His skills eventually propelled him to the leadership of Syriza, an acronym for "coalition of the radical left." The party's logo consists of three stacked flags in red, green and purple, signifying its commitment to labor unions, environmentalism, feminism and other social-activist groups.
Its ascent to power in elections in January on an aggressive anti-austerity platform set the stage for Greece's standoff with its international lenders.
From Syriza's stronghold in Exarchia, a main artery leads to the neighborhood of Kolonaki, an exclusive enclave that is almost Exarchia's polar opposite. There, the orange posters for the "no" campaign that are everywhere in Exarchia largely disappear among posh wine bars and boutique shops.
As he shared a cup of coffee with his cousin before attending Friday evening's "yes" rally, civil engineer Andreas Pierrakos said the choice in Sunday's plebiscite boiled down to whether Greece would remain a member in good standing of the group of 19 nations that share the euro currency and of the European Union.
"It's a matter of existence, of our future in the EU," said Pierrakos, 42. "There can be no Europe without Greece. But if Greece won't do what it takes to stay in, what do we do?"
