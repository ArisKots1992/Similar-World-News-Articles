Just hours before a self imposed deadline, Iran and six world powers said they would not extend a deadline but they would keep working toward a deal over Iran's nuclear program for the next few days.
Reporting from Vienna, where the talks are taking place, NPR's Peter Kenyon says both sides are saying they will not be pressured into accepting a bad deal. Peter filed this report for our Newscast unit:
"EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini says Iran and six world powers are not extending the July 7 deadline, just interpreting it with a certain flexibility. Both iran and the U.S. have said getting the right nuclear agreement is more important than any single deadline.
"If they do manage to finish by early Thursday, negotiators could still deliver a deal to congress by their July 9 deadline. If they don't, Congress gets an extra 30 days to weigh in on the agreement. Many members of Congress describe the accord as not strong enough."
Al Jazeera reports that Iranian officials say the two sides are divided by a few thorny issues. Chief among them is whether U.N. sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program should be lifted.
"The Iranians want the ballistic missile sanctions lifted. They say there is no reason to connect it with the nuclear issue, a view that is difficult to accept," an unnamed Western official told Reuters . "There's no appetite for that on our part."
Of course, this cuts to the heart of what's at stake in these negotiations: Western powers are trying to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, while Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program has been used only for peaceful purposes.
The two sides agreed to an interim deal that curbed some parts of Iran's nuclear programs in November 2013. That deal set a July 2014 deadline for a broader deal. That deadline was extended to November. After that deadline was missed, Iran and six world powers announced that they had reached a framework agreement in April.
They then set a June 30 deadline for coming up with a finalized deal. That deadline was extended to July 7.

        <Description>Tunde Wey wanted to share the food of his West African childhood. So he crossed the U.S. by bus, hosting pop-up dinners along the way. But Wey, like many immigrants, found success can unravel quickly.</Description>

Eliza Barclay/NPR
Most aspiring chefs long for the white hat, the gleaming kitchen, the fancy menu.
But Nigeria-born Tunde Wey stumbled into a different version of the (American) chef's dream. He wanted to see the country, and share the food of his West African childhood with friends and strangers along the way.
So a few months ago, he packed up his knives and his spices at his home in Detroit, and started crisscrossing the U.S. by Greyhound bus.
He wowed diners in New Orleans, Chicago and Buffalo with his one-man pop-up dinner events, Lagos , named after his hometown in Nigeria. He cooked his way up and down the East Coast.
Word got around. His one-night cooking gigs began selling out.
But then, like many immigrants to the U.S., Tunde Wey discovered how quickly success can come tumbling down.
I caught up with him the day he was preparing dinner in Washington, D.C., and getting rhapsodic about his ingredients.
"Palm oil is like the sexier, more full-bodied oil to, like, regular cooking oil," he tells me. "It just has soul, you know."
Wey is kind of like a traveling showman. For every dinner party he throws in a new city, he has to scramble to find, and then borrow, a space. Sometimes it's a restaurant, sometimes it's a communal kitchen where food entrepreneurs smoke and bake and boil their wares.
On the day we meet up, he has taken over a restaurant called Toki Underground . Its stove usually has broth and ramen noodles simmering on it, but Wey has replaced them with a huge vat of goat head stew.

"Gonna be some eyeballs in this, and some mandibles  just the jaw of the goat," he says as he stirs. "People are going to eat some teeth today."
Wey has been at it since 9 a.m. It's now mid-afternoon, and he's moving between a blender, four massive pots slick with that sexy palm oil, and his spice bag.
"A doctor has a medicine bag; I have a spice bag," he says.

This bag is Wey's most important prop, and it's filled with things like alligator pepper seeds, calabash nutmeg and uda, a kind of pepper.
"So all of this stuff is in here, and sometimes I'll have stock fish, which smells so bad," he says.
Wey never actually planned to become a chef. His parents dreamed that he would become a doctor, and they sent him to the U.S. when he was 16 to study science. But 15 years later, after a string of college majors and false starts, he realized he wanted to cook. He didn't have any formal training, though.
"I learned how to cook from watching my parents, my aunt, a lot of YouTube videos in between all that," he says. "The benefit that I have is that I grew up with this food, so I know exactly what it's supposed to taste like."
The idea for the Nigerian pop-up came to him after a brief stint at an American restaurant he co-founded in Detroit called Revolver .

As Wey spent more time in the kitchen, he found that he missed his family more and more  he hadn't seen his parents and his eldest brother back in Nigeria for seven years. So as he planned the pop-up, he turned to his parents for help with everything from recipes to music.
"My family was interested in the details of the business, and I had these conversations with them," he says. "And I felt more connected, actually, infinitely more connected."
And he shares that connection when he makes his food for other people.
"When I was younger, my mom used to give me kisses on my cheek, and she would be like, you know, be all sloppy and I would do the same. Just that feeling of being kissed  I get that when I'm eating. So it's evocative; that's how food affects me."
And he hopes his diners will feel it, too.
When I met him in D.C. in December, Wey had been on the road cooking for two months. And he'd pretty much got his rhythm down.
It's 7 p.m., and the show is on. "That spinach dish I am holding in my hand right now is absolutely amazing, and I would kill for the recipe," says Sarah Moulton. "And my mouth has burned off from the goat pepper soup."
One of Wey's staple menu items is Jollof rice, made with rosy palm oil. Eliza Barclay/NPR hide caption

She's here with her friend Tiffany Farchione, who chimes in about the goat pepper soup: "It's hot and it hurts, but you still want more because it's so delicious."
And as for the goat head? Diner Dave Grossman pronounces it "delicious, expertly stewed, really quite thrilling."
That night, Wey was on a roll. He had a string of gigs lined up in several other cities, some seating up to 50 people at $55 a head.
Soon after, he got his biggest break: The celebrity chef Roy Choi invited him to his Los Angeles restaurant on February 5. The New York Times' Sam Sifton told Wey he was flying out to be there.
But Wey never made it.
On the way to LA, when his Greyhound bus stopped outside of El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol agents climbed aboard. They were not impressed with his old Nigerian passport.
As Wey remembers it, "I had this uncontrollable chill, I was so cold. And there was so much adrenaline rushing through my body."
The thing was, back in 2007, while he was figuring out what to do with his life, he'd let his student visa expire.
"I just thought, I'll fix this: I'm going to go back to school, finish school, and adjust my status somehow," he says. "And so it was something I kept putting off."
But instead of cooking in LA, he was locked up in an El Paso detention center in early February for several weeks. Wey said it seemed like everything  from the pop-up to his life in America  he'd built was tumbling down.
But Wey has been lucky.
Almost half the people in the U.S. illegally are like him  they let visas expire. But Wey had a clean record and a network of friends and family. They raised $6,000. And so he wasn't deported, and he's now out on bail.
"I'm sometimes frustrated that it's limiting, but I mean, I'm comfortable with the reality that is my life," he says. "I'm not ashamed of it."
Because there's such a backlog in the immigration courts, Wey has a bit of a reprieve.
His next appointment with an immigration judge isn't until 2017. The judge will decide then whether he's allowed to stay. Or must go.
In the meantime, he's planning more dinners. And he's just opened a Nigerian food stall in the St. Roch Market in New Orleans.

        <MainBody>NPR's Robert Siegel interviews European Commission Vice President for the Euro Valdis Dombrovskis about how Sunday's vote on the Greek referendum complicates negotiations between Greece and Europe.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
Greece still owes its creditors almost 250 billion euros, and yesterday's no vote has sent shockwaves through Brussels, the capital of the European Union. Joining us now on the line is the vice president of the European Commission for the euro and social dialogue - that's his title. He is Valdis Dombrovskis, a Latvian. Welcome to the program, sir.
VALDIS DOMBROVSKIS: Good afternoon.
SIEGEL: You've said that the vote in Greece widens the gap, provides no easy way out and that too much time and too many opportunities have been lost. Bottom line - does that mean, as far as you're concerned, Greece is probably leaving the euro right now?
DOMBROVSKIS: Well, if both sides are working seriously and constructively, there is always a possibility to find a solution. But it's also true that yesterday's referendum had made things more complicated, and the gap we need to breach has become wider.
SIEGEL: Wider - the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras seems to think that with 60 percent of Greeks backing him up, he's in a stronger position negotiating with Europe. Has he got that wrong? Is he in a weaker position?
DOMBROVSKIS: Well, it's certainly emphasized by European Commission, also by president of the Eurogroup already before the referendums that, actually, the no vote would dramatically weaken the negotiating position of the Greek government. And it will be more difficult to found a solution which all 19 - well, 19 including Greece - eurozone countries could support.
SIEGEL: But how do you answer the argument that if Greece adopts the policies that its creditors want it to pursue, it will cut spending, it will raise taxes, it will diminish growth and be even less able to pay back the debts that are saddling the country?
DOMBROVSKIS: Well, that's why institutions are so much stressing the need for a credible strategy out of the crisis because the first thing for Greece is to regain financial stability because without financial stability, there is no economic growth. Banks are worried. They are not lending to the real economy. Citizens are worried. They are not spending. Companies are worried. They are not investing. And if you restore financial stability, banks start lending to the economy, citizens start spending, companies start investing. It's something we saw in other pilgrim countries, like in Ireland, like in Portugal. And those countries which were implementing reforms were actually able to return to economic growth.
SIEGEL: Mr. Dombrovskis, just before you go, I want to ask you what you thought as you saw scenes of crowds of Greeks celebrating the victory of the no vote - the rejection of the terms that had been on the table but had expired. What was your reaction to those scenes of jubilation on behalf of a majority of Greek voters?
DOMBROVSKIS: Well, it's clear that there's not going to be quick and easy solutions to the problem. And I think it's very important that, also, the Greek government is constructive and honest to its citizens and tells the Greek citizens what are the consequences of different decision government is taking.
SIEGEL: Do you think they were less than honest in this case?
DOMBROVSKIS: Well, I'm not entirely convinced that all Greek citizens were explained what implications different decisions may create.
SIEGEL: Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, thank you very much for talking with us today.
DOMBROVSKIS: Thank you. Thank you so much.

President Obama delivers remarks Monday at the Pentagon after a briefing on U.S. efforts against the Islamic State.
Jonathan Ernst/Reuters /Landov
Updated at 5:26 p.m. ET
President Obama has warned that the campaign against the so-called Islamic State "will not be quick" as he cited gains made in Iraq and Syria by the coalition fighting the militant group.
"This will not be quick," Obama said at the Pentagon. "This is a long-term campaign."
He said the coalition against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has hit the group with more than 5,000 airstrikes, destroying thousands of fighting positions, tanks, vehicles, bomb factories and training camps and killing thousands of fighters, including senior commanders. The Islamic State, Obama said, has lost more than a quarter of the populated areas it had seized in Iraq, and parts of Syria that it controlled, too.
"ISIL's recent losses in both Syria and Iraq prove that ISIL can and will be defeated," Obama said.
Obama said the U.S. continues to ramp up the training and support of local forces fighting the Islamic State on the ground in Iraq, and will "do more to train and equip the moderate opposition in Syria."
The Islamic State is one of several factions involved in the civil war in Syria. Obama said the only way for that civil war to end was if President Bashar Assad stepped down; a move, he said, that would unite the remaining factions against the Islamic State.
Obama said the coalition would also continue to target the oil and gas, and financial infrastructure that funds the Islamic State's operations, and to speed up the delivery of military equipment to Iraqi forces battling the organization. But, he added: "No amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless it's matched by a broader effort  political and economic."
Obama said the U.S. was doing a better job of preventing large-scale attacks on the homeland, but that so-called lone-wolf terrorists are harder to detect.
"Here in the United States, we have seen all kinds of home-grown terrorism and tragically recent history reminds us how even a single individual motivated by a hateful ideology with access to dangerous weapons can inflict horrendous harm on Americans," he said. "Our efforts to counter violent extremism must not target any one community because of their faith or background, including patriotic Muslim Americans who are partners in keeping our country safe.
"That said, we also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States. And they are targeting Muslim communities around the world."
Obama said that in order to defeat groups such as the Islamic State, the U.S. must also "discredit their ideology, the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks."
"Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas  a more attractive, more compelling vision," he said.

In 2000 the world's leaders agreed on an ambitious plan for attacking global poverty by 2015. Called the Millennium Development Goals, these time-bound targets spurred an unprecedented aid effort that helped slash the share of people living in extreme poverty in half. Now nations are hammering out an even broader set of goals for 2030, but this time the task is proving highly controversial. The Millennium Development Goals were drafted in a highly casual way and that simple process proved the key to their success.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
The last 15 years have brought unprecedented improvements to the lives of the world's poorest people. A report by the United Nations today highlights the progress. The number of people who live in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half. Many say a catalyst for this was a commitment by world leaders back in 2000. They vowed to a meet an ambitious set of goals to reduce poverty by this year, 2015. NPR's Nurith Aizenman brings us the first of a two-part report on these Millennium Development Goals, as they're called. Today - why the goals proved so surprisingly successful.
NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: For an agreement that's widely credited with bringing millions of people life-saving medications and access to clean drinking water in schools, the Millennium Development Goals had a pretty humdrum beginning. Mark Malloch-Brown was part of a small group of top U.N. officials who largely wrote the Millennium Development Goals. He sums up the process with the word simple.
MARK MALLOCH-BROWN: It's brilliantly simple. It was myself with some chums in a room kind of thing.
AIZENMAN: They came up with a short list of goals to be met by 2015. The process was so casual they almost forgot something.
MALLOCH-BROWN: You know, happily having sent these things to press, I ran into a smiling German colleague in the corridor who was the head of the environment program. I remember my blood falling to my ankles as I said, oh, goodness me, we've forgotten the environment goal.
AIZENMAN: They stopped the presses, added the goal ensure environmental sustainability, bringing the total to eight. Now, a big reason this could all be so low-key was that, at the time, people didn't expect much to come of the goals. Mark Suzman oversees global policy advocacy for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
MARK SUZMAN: It's not as if 2000 was the first time that the U.N. has come out and set lofty global goals.
AIZENMAN: But Suzman, who once worked with Malloch-Brown at the U.N., says the very simplicity of the Millennium Development Goals ended up making them uniquely powerful. International aid to poor countries had gotten kind of chaotic and scattershot during the 1990s. And by reducing the global agenda to eight narrowly defined priorities, the goals helped channel everyone's energies and money.
SUZMAN: What the goals did, by prioritizing and focusing, was actually put together major international donors, civil society partners on the ground, national governments focusing on the same sets of issues. And that allowed for a focusing of both policy change and resources and attention.
AIZENMAN: Countries and donors could track how they were measuring up against the targets. And this often spurred them to try harder. The upshot - 12 million people in poor countries now have access to HIV/AIDS aids drugs. More than 6 million lives have been saved thanks to malaria prevention and treatments. Now, the world hasn't met every single Millennium Development Goal, and a lot of the rise in poor people's incomes was the result of economic growth in China and India. Still, says Suzman...
SUZMAN: The last decade has seen arguably the greatest improvements for the largest number of people on the planet in the most countries than has ever happened in human history.
AIZENMAN: So as people started talking about what should replace these goals when they expire this year, there was one thing everyone agreed on - something this important should no longer be drafted by a bunch of technocrats in a room at the U.N. This time, they've reached out to every member country, local activists. They've polled 7 million people. All those cooks have added a lot of new ingredients. The latest draft has double the number of goals, quadruple the number of sub-goals. Nurith Aizenman, NPR News.
SIEGEL: Tomorrow on this program, we'll hear about fears that this longer, broader list of goals could prove unworkable.

        <MainBody>Germany, France Keep Door Open To Greek Requests For Economic Help
July 06, 2015 4:30 PM ET
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande meet in Paris Monday to discuss their response to the result of Sunday's referendum in Greece.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:
And in Paris, French and German leaders met today to discuss the Greek crisis. They said they're still open to helping Greece solve its debt problem. But a growing number of Germans say there's only one solution they're interested in, and that's getting Greece to give up the euro. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin.
SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: While French President Francois Hollande spoke of European solidarity, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear no new money is heading to Athens.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German).
NELSON: She says conditions needed to start talks for a bailout just aren't there at the moment.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MERKEL: (Speaking German).
NELSON: The chancellor adds to keep this a single currency, we need joint responsibility, not just joint solidarity. That news came as the European Central Bank announced it would not expand its emergency assistance either. The chancellor's ironclad stance is in part because she is under intense pressure at home. There are growing demands from her conservative allies and the German public that Greece be booted out of the eurozone. Many here are irked by the Greek government's snubbing of its creditors - in particular, Germany, whose leaders some Greeks have likened to Nazis. Polls last month showed nearly 3 in 5 Germans in favor of Greece leaving the eurozone. Those feelings only increased after Sunday's resounding no vote in the Greek referendum. Walter Ingenrieth, a 63-year-old from Monchengladbach, who was touring Berlin this afternoon, says his resentment towards Athens has been building over several months.
WALTER INGENRIETH: (Speaking German).
NELSON: He says, "it's time for Greece to give up the euro because I don't see it making a serious effort to share in a joint currency with Germany or other European countries with strong economies." He and many other Germans say they can't understand why five years since its bailout began, Greece has made little progress in ending corruption and tax evasion and failed at delivering enough reforms. Even Apostolos Tsalastras, the treasurer of Oberhausen, which was the most indebted city in Germany some years back, expressed impatience with the Athens government.
APOSTOLOS TSALASTRAS: (Speaking German).
NELSON: The son of Greek immigrants says it's imperative for the Greek government not only to focus on how serious the situation is, but to take responsibility and lead the country out of crisis. That's not going to happen with its constant refusal to engage its eurozone partners, Tsalastras adds. Nevertheless, he hopes Greece will stay in the eurozone.
TSALASTRAS: (Speaking German).
NELSON: Tsalastras, like many financial experts here, says if Greece were to leave, it would set a dangerous precedent for other member countries facing debt issues. That would result not only in financial turmoil within the eurozone, but could mean an end of the currency. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Berlin.

        <MainBody>Despite Uncertainty, Greeks Show Pride In Rejecting Bailout Plan
July 06, 2015 4:30 PM ET
Greeks in Athens react to the resounding no vote on a bailout plan. Many are proud to have poked Europe in the eye after years of austerity, but the banks remain closed, hurting many local businesses.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:
Europe is reacting to yesterday's historic referendum in Greece. Greeks overwhelmingly voted down the latest terms for a bailout by their European creditors, but many Greeks who rejected the offer are eager to see a new deal they like better.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
That will be a tall order if the no vote drives the two sides even farther apart. In a moment, we'll hear from a member of the European leadership on that.
MCEVERS: But first, to Athens - that's where Greece's combative finance minister resigned early this morning, as a concession to EU negotiators. And it's where Greeks are attempting to go about their business, as NPR's Chris Arnold reports.
CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: A loud no - or ohi in Greek - echoed around Europe last night, and Athenians celebrated around their city. But today, people were trying to get back to a regular Monday morning - only it's not a regular Monday. The doors to the banks are still shut here, and many locals are still too nervous to go out and buy much of anything, including meats.
ALEXANDRA DIALYNA: We are at the meat market. It's very loud every day.
ARNOLD: And that guy has a very large knife that he's chopping meat up with.
DIALYNA: Yeah.
ARNOLD: My interpreter, Alexandra Dialyna, and I are walking past sides of lamb hanging on hooks. It is loud here, but the merchants calling out to sell their lamb and beef and pork far outnumber the shoppers. Back behind one of the meat counters, business owner Tsironis Cleanthis is having a snack of fresh cherries. He owns his family business here, and he voted yes.
TSIRONIS CLEANTHIS: (Speaking Greek).
DIALYNA: A lot of people last night were celebrating, but he doesn't understand why because, again today, the market is very slow, and people don't come here as they used to.
ARNOLD: Cleanthis says basically the referendum didn't accomplish anything. It just scared people, angered European leaders and forced the banks to close before panicked people in Greece pulled out all of their money. Now, he says, he's got his family's life savings - half a million euros - locked inside of a Greek bank with a lot of questions hanging in the air.
CLEANTHIS: (Speaking Greek).
DIALYNA: He has children who are doing their studies, so he's worried.
ARNOLD: Oh, to be able to pay for school.
DIALYNA: Yes.
ARNOLD: But many savers were a bit reassured this morning when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the no vote is not a mandate to break with Europe's single currency, the euro. And, of course, unlike Cleanthis, most people voted no, and they're proud of that.
SPIROU CHRISTOS: (Speaking Greek).
DIALYNA: He says that from today, Greece has written a new course in history.
ARNOLD: At a fish market up the street, Spirou Christos is selling gleaming pink squid and octopus that are laid out on a bed of ice. He says he has about 30,000 euros in the bank. But he says even when the bank reopens, he is not pulling out his money.
CHRISTOS: (Speaking Greek).
DIALYNA: No, never - he would never do that.
CHRISTOS: (Speaking Greek).
DIALYNA: He would never put his money outside of Greece because our country needs those type of money. And if everyone did that, then Greece would collapse.
ARNOLD: At the meat and fish market, some merchants can at least do some business in cash, but others aren't so lucky.
MARIA AGGELEPOULOS: (Speaking Greek).
DIALYNA: We cannot do our job and the market has frozen.
ARNOLD: Maria Aggelepoulos runs a wholesale sewing and fabric supply store. She imports big boxes of German-made sewing needles for resale, for example. And all of her business, she says, is done in checks - not cash. And she says right now, she can't deposit any of those checks in her bank.
AGGELEPOULOS: (Speaking Greek).
DIALYNA: No, banks are closed for everything.
ARNOLD: Meanwhile, even with people in Greece limited to just pulling out 60 euros a day from the ATMs, the Greek banks are thought to be almost out of money. In fact, some are out of 20-euro bills and people are only getting a single 50-euro bill. Others are just completely empty for the moment. So with the country's banks on the verge of collapse, Greece is clearly desperate for more emergency assistance from Europe. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Athens.

Transcript
Pope Francis kicks off a three-nation South America tour with a mass in Ecuador on Monday. Aiding the poor is at the center of his mission, which will include stops in Bolivia and Paraguay. It is his second South American trip since becoming pope.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:
Pope Francis is in South America for what's turning out to be a joyous homecoming. Not only does the Argentine-born pope speak Spanish, he loves to break protocol by greeting and hugging average people who've come to see him. That happened this afternoon in the Ecuadorian port city of Guayaquil, where reporter John Otis filed this report.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: (Singing in Spanish).
JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Pilgrims sing church hymns as they make their way to the cavernous Samanes Park in Guayaquil. People are coming for the first outdoor mass of Francis' three-country South America trip. One of them is salesman Harold Andrade.
HAROLD ANDRADE: Yeah, yeah, yeah - really, really happy - really excited, and I believe that I'm going to cry because I'm very excited.
OTIS: For security, many streets have been blocked off, forcing Mass-goers to walk for miles. Still, they come. Hundreds of thousands are making the trek, including these elderly people in wheelchairs.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking in Spanish).
OTIS: Along the way, people hawk pope T-shirts with the smiling image of Francis. Also on sale are baseball caps, buttons, posters, rosaries, wooden crosses and incense. With the huge stage, the towers of speakers and the sea of people, the scene resembles a kind of religious Woodstock. But rather than rain and mud, the faithful bake under the equatorial sun.
HECTOR FREILE: My sister and my mom - they are here since 1 a.m. And they are camping here, so it's crazy. (Laughter).
OTIS: They're camping overnight?
FREILE: Yeah, they're camping overnight. Yeah, it's crazy. I'm kind of lazy, so I came later. (Laughter).
OTIS: That's Hector Freile, who's here with his girlfriend. He calls Francis a great communicator.
FREILE: The Catholic church needed someone like him, and I think this pope, Francisco, is doing a great job explaining, in simple words, what Jesus Christ wants from us.
PATRICIA PLAZA: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: Guayaquil lawyer Patricia Plaza tells me that Francis has taken the bull by the horns by addressing topics like divorce, homosexuality and the church's sex abuse scandal. This trip, for example, comes on the heels of the pope's landmark encyclical on the environment and global warming. In it, he slams a world economic system based on reckless development, overconsumption and the burning of fossil fuels.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Singing in Spanish).
OTIS: But on this trip, which takes the pope to some of South America's poorest countries, Francis is focusing on problems like economic inequality and ethnic strife.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in Spanish).
FRANCIS: (Speaking Spanish).
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in Spanish).
FRANCIS: (Speaking Spanish).
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in Spanish).
OTIS: In his homily, the pope spoke of the strength of families and how the human family is capable of making the world a better place.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
FRANCIS: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: "The good news is that the best wine has yet to be consumed," Francis said. "The deepest and most beautiful things for the family are coming." On Tuesday, the pope will deliver another outdoor Mass in Quito, the Ecuadorian capital, before traveling to Bolivia and Paraguay. For NPR News, I'm John Otis, Guayaquil, Ecuador.

        <MainBody>Hacking Team Breach Reveals Firm Sold Spying Tools To Repressive Regimes
July 06, 2015 4:30 PM ET
What happens when one of the most notorious hacking companies gets hacked? That's the situation unfolding for one Italian company, which sells surveillance software to governments across the globe.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
What happens when one of the world's most notorious hacking companies gets hacked? Well, that's the situation unfolding for an Italian firm. As NPR's Elise Hu explains, it sells software to governments, large and small, with this kind of message.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Rely on us.
ELISE HU, BYLINE: This is a recent advertisement for surveillance software from a company called HackingTeam. The software can track citizens, access text messages, emails and overcome data encryption.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Exactly what we do - the hacking suite for governmental interception.
HU: HackingTeam sells its work as, quote, "stealth and untraceable." But the surveillance company itself just had its secrets spilled out in the form of a 500-gigabyte data dump. Whoever's behind the stolen data hasn't come forward. NPR verified that at least some of the hacked personal passwords do check out. And if the other documents are true, they show HackingTeam sells its software to private companies in at least three dozen countries. That includes the United States and some of the world's most repressive regimes.
CHRISTOPHER SOGHIAN: These documents provide, finally, a smoking gun showing that HackingTeam has, in fact, sold its technology to a number of governments with truly atrocious human rights record.
HU: Christopher Soghian is a privacy activist with the ACLU. He's reviewed 500 gigs and found evidence of hacking teams selling to Russia, Kazakhstan and Sudan the very surveillance-enabling, code-breaking, privacy-intercepting software from that dramatic commercial
SOGHIAN: What this shows us is that surveillance software - advanced surveillance capabilities are now available to the largest and smallest governments in the world. We really need to have a bigger conversation about whether these tools should be used in democracies.
(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Italian).
HU: For now, the person who answered the phone at HackingTeam's Italian headquarters directed questions to an email address. But much of the information that had been a mystery, like the company's client lists and contracts, are now published online. Elise Hu, NPR News.

        <MainBody>Major U.S. Airlines Push Back Against Expansion Of Gulf Carriers
July 06, 2015 4:27 PM ET
The three major U.S. airlines  American, United and Delta  are pressuring the government to stifle competition by carriers from the Persian Gulf.
KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:
There's a fight going on between the U.S. and the Persian Gulf. It's not about terrorism or regional security. This fight involves commercial airlines. The three big U.S. carriers - American, United and Delta - are pushing back against the swift and successful expansion of three Gulf carriers. NPR's Jackie Northam has more.
JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: At any one of 15 cities across the U.S., aircraft from the big Gulf carriers - Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airlines - take off and land daily. Over the years, all three Gulf airlines have seen rapid expansion, buying new planes and competing on lucrative international routes. Now American, Delta and United Airlines are fighting to maintain their share of those markets and are pressuring the U.S. government for help, says Erik Hansen, a senior director at the U.S. Travel Association.
ERIK HANSEN: What they've asked for is a freeze in new routes and capacity from the Gulf carriers in the United States. They want to block all expansion from these three Gulf airlines. They want a protectionist policy. They want a freeze. They want to block out competition.
NORTHAM: Hansen says the move is a direct violation of international agreements that were meant to eliminate government interference in the airline industry. But the U.S. carriers say the Gulf airlines are already violating those agreements by taking billions of dollars in government subsidies. Jeff Smisek is the head of United Airlines.
JEFF SMISEK: Qatar, Etihad and Emirates are not just airlines. They're arms of the state. They are part of state policy to drive tourism and trade through the Middle East, and these three carriers are not stimulating demand.
NORTHAM: The Gulf airlines deny they receive government subsidies. But the U.S. carriers are particularly worried about competition in the fast-growing markets, like the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Asia, for them and their alliance partners. Hansen of the U.S. Travel Association says Etihad, Qatar and Emirates Airlines have benefited greatly from the geographical location of their hubs in Abu Dhabi, Doha, and Dubai and their huge investments in modern fleets and new airports with world-class shopping.
HANSEN: And just by virtue of where they are in the world, they're providing faster connection times, shorter routes to certain parts of the globe. And when you add all that together, you often see customers voting with their wallets and deciding that they're going to fly on a Gulf airline.
NORTHAM: Timothy Clark, the head of Emirates Airlines, says instead of going after the Gulf carriers, the U.S. carriers should provide their customers with more legroom, better food and a higher standard of service.
TIMOTHY CLARK: Investing in product, investing in comfortable seats - it's not difficult, gentlemen, making the consumer enjoy their products.
NORTHAM: The campaign by the U.S. carriers is made more difficult by the news that they're making record profits and by a Justice Department investigation into allegations they colluded to limit seating and raise fares in domestic markets. Jackie Northam, NPR News, Washington.
