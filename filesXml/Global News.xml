SAN FRANCISCO  The latest models of Googles self-driving cars are now cruising the streets near the Internet companys Silicon Valley headquarters as an ambitious project to transform the way people get around shifts into its next phase.
Story continues below
This marks the first time that the pod-like, two-seat vehicles have been allowed on public roads since Google unveiled the next generation of its self-driving fleet more than a year ago. The cars had previously been confined to a private track on a former Air Force base located about 120 miles southeast of San Francisco.
Google announced last month that it would begin testing the curious-looking cars last month , but hadnt specified the timing until Tuesday when it disclosed the vehicles are driving up to 25 miles per hour on the roads around its Mountain View, California, office.

Google had installed its robotic driving technology in Lexus sports utility vehicles and Toyota Priuses during the first few years of testing before developing the smaller prototype. The new models are designed to work without a steering wheel or brake pedal, although the vehicles will be equipped with those features during the initial runs on public roads.
A human will also ride in the cars to take control in emergencies, just as has been the case with the self-driving Lexus vehicles during the past six years.
The debut of the pod-like car will help Google get a better understanding on how well its technology works around other vehicles steered by people.
Last year, Google Inc. told reporters it hoped to have a 100 of the self-driving prototypes in its fleet by now , but the company said it has only built 25 of them so far. All 25 have received permission from Californias Department of Motor Vehicles to drive neighbourhood roads.
If all goes well, Google hopes to gain regulatory clearance to remove the steering wheel, brake pedal and emergency driver from the prototype. Company executives have expressed hope that self-driving cars using its technology will be joining the flow of daily traffic by the end of this decade.

The earlier models of Googles self-driving cars had been involved in 13 minor accidents through more than 1.8 million miles on the roads, according to the company. Google blamed the collisions on other vehicles in every instance except one when the company says one of its own employees was steering.

TORONTO  Astronauts aboard the International Space Station are getting ready to receive more supplies.
SpaceX is scheduled to launch its Dragon spacecraft aboard its Falcon 9 rocket at 10:21 a.m. Sunday morning.
Story continues below
Aside from launching supplies to the space station, this will be SpaceXs third attempt at landing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket back on a floating ocean platform. So far, the rocket has been able to reach the platform, but has been lost twice after tipping over or running out of fuel.
SpaceX is aiming to reduce the cost of launching rockets into space by having reusable rockets.

Tama, Japans railway stationmaster cat, elevated as goddess at funeral

TOKYO  Tama the stationmaster, Japans feline star of a struggling local railway, was mourned by company officials and fans and elevated into a goddess at a funeral Sunday.
The calico cat was appointed stationmaster at the Kishi station in western Japan in 2007. Donning her custom-made stationmasters cap, Tama quietly sat at the ticket gate welcoming and seeing off passengers. The cat quickly attracted tourists and became world-famous, contributing to the railway company and local economy.
Tama, who had turned 16 in April, died of a heart failure on June 22. During Sundays Shinto-style funeral at the station where she served, Tama became a goddess. The Shinto religion, indigenous to Japan and practiced by many Japanese, has a variety of gods including animals.
People pray in front of an altar especially set up for the funeral of Tama, a cat stationmaster, in Kinokawa City, Wakayama Prefecture, western Japan, Sunday, June 28, 2015.

In one of several portraits decorating the altar, Tama posed in a stationmasters hat and a dark blue cape. Sake, as well as watermelon, apples, cabbage and other fruits and vegetables were presented to the cat. A stand outside the station was heaped with bouquets, canned tuna and other gifts left by thousands of Tama fans who came to pray from around the country.
Wakayama Electric Railway President Mitsunobu Kojima thanked the cat for her achievement, and said Tama will be enshrined at a nearby cat shrine next month.
Before Tamas arrival, the local Kishigawa Line was near-bankrupt; and the station was unmanned as it had lost its last staff.
Kojima said appointing Tama as stationmaster was initially an excuse to keep the cat at the station.
But she was really doing her job, he said. The rest was a miracle, and his companys success story also gave hope for dozens of other struggling tiny local train lines, he said.
Tama-chan really emerged like a saviour, a goddess. It was truly my honour to have been able to work with her, Kojima said in his speech.
During her tenure, Tama had contributed an estimated 1.1 billion yen ($8.9 million) to the local economy, Kojima said.
Kojima said that when he visited Tama at an animal hospital the day before she died, the cat woke up and reached out to him with her paws, as if asking for a hug, and looked straight into his eyes. He said he told Tama to get well so they can celebrate the cats upcoming 10th anniversary as a stationmaster, and said the cat responded with a meow.
Tama is a popular name for cats in Japan, where they are considered spiritual animals. The word could translate as treasure, ball or spirit.
The cat had climbed the corporate ladder from stationmaster to ultra-stationmaster and vice-president of the company before receiving the additional title Sunday of honourable eternal stationmaster.
Tama will be succeeded by another calico cat, Nitama, now an apprentice stationmaster.

WINNIPEG  Firefighters used a ladder truck to rescue an elderly man from a St. James apartment block during a blaze Thursday night, a witness says.
Firefighters evacuated the Park West Apartments after they were called to fight a blaze in a seventh-floor suite at about 11 p.m.
Flames shot out of the back windows of the building at 2366 Portage Ave., a resident told Global News.
He saw firefighters use a ladder truck to remove a man in a wheelchair from his suite, said the witness, who didnt give his name. He believes the elderly resident is 93 years old.
Firefighters quickly got the flames under control and no one was seriously injured, although some residents were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, police said.
Fire officials estimate damages at roughly $1 million, including extensive water damage.

        <Description>Utah Jazz select Kentucky forward Trey Lyles, the first Saskatoon-born player to be drafted into the NBA.</Description>
        <MainBody>Saskatoon-born Trey Lyles tops Canadians in March Madness
His playmaking with the ball, his handle  ability to keep his head up and play unselfish basketball is superior, Lindsey said. Trey made some sacrifices not playing as many minutes at the four, which is his natural position. But playing the three, he learned to handle the ball, learned to execute. A big part of our game going forward is bigs that can guard smalls.
Lyles, who was born in Saskatoon but moved to Indianapolis at a young age, is the first Saskatoon-born player to be drafted into the NBA.

The Jazz then took another Canadian, 6-foot-4, 186-pound Boston College guard Olivier Hanlan of Aylmer, Que., with the No. 42 pick. He averaged 19.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists as a junior and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in points per game. Daniel Diez from Spain was selected with the No. 54 pick and traded to the Trail Blazers for cash considerations.
Lyles averaged 8.7 points and 5.2 rebounds for the Wildcats and was named to the Southeastern Conference All-Freshman team after his lone collegiate season. He has a 7-1 wingspan with large hands and Lindsey believes he can get bigger.
I know its a young team and I feel  going to that situation is perfect, Lyles said. Im a guy that can step in and help contribute immediately.
Being able to contribute offensively and defensively, just being a guy that goes out there and if they need a bucket, Ill be able to be a guy that can go get one. And just be a high-character guy thats going to fit in.
The Jazz went into the off-season needing shooting after averaging the fifth-fewest points per game last season. Frontcourt depth became a priority after the team moved Enes Kanter to the Thunder.
Lyles, 19, could fill a stretch-four role one day, though he shot just 13.8 per cent from 3-point range. He worked out with the Jazz on June 13 and said he wasnt able to show all of his game on a Kentucky roster that had four players selected in the first 13 picks. He knocked down 25 of 40 corner 3-point shots during his workout with the Jazz.
Lindsey said Lyles is a better rebounder than his numbers show and called him a good midrange shooter that should be able to improve. He also thinks Lyles can be a very solid corner-3 shooter in time.
Im able to knock it down consistently, Lyles said. Coach and managers for Jazz were able to see that. Its something I have confidence in.
Lyles has the mobility to guard multiple positions and the pick-and-roll while his length is something the Jazz covet. Point guard Trey Burke is the only player projected to be in the top-eight rotation, not including Lyles, that is under 6-foot-6.
More playmaking ability for myself and my teammates, Lyles said when asked what he couldnt show at Kentucky. Being able to score more. Post up a little bit more. I didnt get to play a lot of the four. Just a whole lot of versatility.
The Jazz finished the season with a 38-44 record, a 13-game improvement from the 2013-14 season, and were slotted No. 12 after a tiebreak drawing with the Pacers. The improvement was the second-best in the Western Conference and the sixth-best in the NBA.
Lyles said he can fill any role.
Im a guy whos pretty flexible on the court and pretty much can do whatever the coach asks of me, Lyles said. I feel comfortable in any kind of lineup. It doesnt matter to me. I just know that Ill be able to transform to anything thats needed of me.
The Jazz had the sixth-best win percentage (.655) after the All-Star break and aspires to be in the playoff race next season. The five teams in front of them  Warriors, Clippers, Cavaliers, Spurs and Rockets  were all playoff teams.
Defence was the Jazzs calling card during their post All-Star success. The Jazz ranked No. 1 in the league, holding teams to 89.0 points per game and No. 2 in opponent field goal percentage (42.2) during that period. The emergence of 7-foot-1 shot blocker Rudy Gobert after Kanter was traded solidified the defence.
The offence, however, was the second-worst in the league after the break and where the biggest strides can be made during the off-season.

MALONE, N.Y.  Officers scouring dense and boggy woods for a surviving escaped killer took floodlights into the search area overnight, and others carrying rifles manned checkpoints and examined vehicles, opening trunks and peering into windows.
Franklin County Sheriff Kevin Mulverhill said late Saturday tips continued to pour in and he was optimistic David Sweat would be captured, perhaps within 48 hours.
Its going to be one of those phone calls that turns this case around, he said.
READ MORE: 1 of 2 escaped inmates killed by law enforcement, other on the run
Richard Matt  who once vowed never to be taken alive  was fatally shot Friday during an encounter with border patrol agents about 30 miles west of the prison he escaped from with Sweat on June 6. Sweat remained on the lam early Sunday, and about 1,200 searchers focused intensely on 22 square miles encompassing thick forests and heavy brush around where Matt was killed.
Police hoped the solo escapee would finally succumb to the stress of little sleep, scant food and biting bugs.
Anyone in the woods and on the run from the law so to speak is not getting a full eight hours sleep, theyre not eating well and they have to keep moving, Mulverhill said. Hes fatigued, tired, and hes going to make a mistake.
Sweat could have an even tougher time now without someone to take turns resting with and to watch his back, Clinton County Sheriff David Favro said.
Now its a one-man show and it makes it more difficult for him, Favro said. And Im sure fatigue is setting in for him as well, knowing the guy he was with has already been shot.
The manhunt broke open Friday afternoon when a person towing a camper heard a loud noise and thought a tire had blown. Finding there was no flat, the driver drove eight miles before looking again and finding a bullet hole in the trailer. A tactical team responding to the scene of the shot smelled gunpowder inside a cabin and saw evidence that someone had fled out the back door.
A noise  perhaps a cough  ultimately did Matt in. A border patrol team discovered Matt, who was shot after failing to heed a command to raise his hands.
Matt had a 20-gauge shotgun that was believed to have been taken from another cabin. The pair had apparently been relying on the remote regions many hunting camps and seasonal dwellings for supplies.
Matt, who turned 49 the day before he died, was serving 25 years to life at Clinton Correctional Facility for the killing and dismemberment of his former boss. Local residents were relieved that one killer was no longer roaming the woods, but the constant commotion of speeding police cruisers and helicopters pointed to the continued danger.
Half the threat is taken care of, but obviously David Sweat is on the loose, said Matt Maguire, who was waiting for a police escort to pick up some clothes from his house inside the search area. Maguire and his fiancee decided a week ago to stay with nearby relatives.
Sweat, 35, was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriffs deputy in Broome County in 2002. Mulverhill said investigators believe he may be armed.
Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall, squirmed through pipes and emerged from a manhole outside the prison.
While there have been no confirmed sightings of Sweat, police said investigators saw a second set of tracks near where Matt was shot.
Ultimately, how the chase ends is up to Sweat, Mulverhill said.
If hes willing to surrender to law enforcement then well place him in handcuffs and well bring him back into custody, he said.
If he chooses to resist or he chooses not to comply, then the results are his.

KABUL  An Afghan official says the Islamic State group now has a presence in three provinces but that the government is determined to drive it out.
Zafar Hashimi, the Afghan presidents deputy spokesman, said Sunday that the group  which controls large areas of Iraq and Syria  is active in the eastern Nangarhar, western Farah and southern Helmand provinces.
Hashimi says security forces have launched successful operations against the IS group but gave no further details.
The Taliban, which have been at war with the government for nearly 14 years and are also active in the three provinces, have warned the IS group to stay out of the country. Both groups want Islamic rule but the Taliban do not recognize the IS groups self-styled caliphate.

PARIS  French officials say the main suspect in the beheading of a French transportation company manager has admitted to police he carried out the killing that authorities have called a terror attack.
Yassine Salhi, a deliveryman with a history of ties to Islamic extremists, remained in custody Sunday along with his wife and sister.

Security officials say investigators have found no links to any international terror group in the attack Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.
Salhi, arrested Friday, was to be transferred to counterterrorism police headquarters outside Paris. He allegedly crashed a truck into a U.S.-owned chemical warehouse and hung his employers head on the factorys gate. Officials say he sent a selfie of himself and the victim to a Canadian mobile phone number.
A spokesman for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney confirmsCanadian authorities are involved in the case.

CALGARY  A 53-year-old motorcyclist was killed in a crash in a southeast parking lot on Thursday.
Police say the driver was approaching a pay booth when he lost control of his bike and fell over, crashing into a concrete barrier.
It happened just before 6 p.m. in a lot on the Stampede grounds.
The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.
Investigators dont believe the rider was wearing a helmet, and say excessive speed is believed to be a factor in the collision.

MONTREAL  Large parts of Canada were settled thanks to a government policy of giving out free land to anyone willing to show up and farm it.
And although the federal government largely stopped giving out Crown land in the 1930s, some small towns are continuing the tradition by giving their land away for free.
Story continues below
Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, a 900-resident community about an hour southwest of Quebec City, decided to take a creative approach to increasing its population. The town purchased a large tract of land and subdivided it into 40 lots which they gave away for free, beginning in 2013, to anyone willing to move there and build a house.
The problem faced by towns of our size is devitalization that happens quietly as young people move to cities, Mayor Gilles Marchand said in an interview. We figure this will be an incentive for the young and the less young who want to put their money toward home-building.
The towns policy requires buyers to put a $1,000 down payment on a lot and commit to building a house worth $125,000 within a year. The municipality then refunds the down payment.
Saint-Louis-de-Blandford isnt alone with the idea.
Reston, Man., implemented a similar plan a few years ago to give away land for $10.
Tanis Chalmers, the economic development manager for the Rural Municipality of Pipestone, which includes Reston, says the program has been a success.
Of the 24 available lots, 19 have been given away and the municipality has expanded the program to the neighbouring towns of Pipestone and Sinclair. Chalmers says about 20 homes have been built in the last two years in Reston. This represents a population increase of 50 people  not bad for a town of 500.
Chalmers says small communities have to compete for residents by offering something special.
The towns that surround us are larger centres, she adds. They may not be able to offer the same incentives we can. But they have their size and the services they offer. This is our way of competing with these communities.
Both Chalmers and Marchand believe their towns will profit in the long run by collecting property taxes on the homes. They say a larger population also reduces the cost of services, per capita, and hopefully leads to increased commercial development.
Several small towns in Saskatchewan have experimented with a $1 lot policy in recent years, while Kings Point, N.L., posted on social media earlier this year that it was considering a land giveaway as well.
Each town does things a little differently. Some offer lots that are hooked up to sewer and water, while others are on unserviced land. Some also have conditions on the type of construction.
There is also still a little free Crown land available  mostly in the Yukon for people who are tough enough to develop Arctic lands for agricultural purposes through the territorys Agricultural Lands Program.
Giving away free land may not pay off for small towns in the long run, cautions Concordia University professor Bill Reimer, who specializes in rural issues. He said the property tax revenues generated by new residences often arent enough to cover the costs of roads, city staff and services.
Most research examining the long-term returns for various community land-use strategies indicates that residential land use ends up costing communities more than it provides returns, he said by email.
The key, he said, is to attract businesses as well.
Both Reston and Saint-Louis-de-Blandford offer incentives ranging from tax breaks to cash grants to attract new commerces  something Marchand and Chalmers admit is a little more difficult than luring residents.

Despite the note of caution, they both say their programs have helped their towns as well as residents such as Christian Martin, who recently moved back to the Saint-Louis-de-Blandford region after 10 years away.
He received a free 5,500 square-foot (510 square metres) lot  big enough that he was able to dig a lake on his property in addition to building himself a spacious home.
In a city, just the land would have cost as much as the entire house, said Martin, 51.
Marchand said the program has been an unexpected success. All of his towns original 40 free lots have been spoken for and the town is currently planning another phase of giveaways.
By offering lots big enough for a home with a backyard, hes managed to attract several young families, a prize demographic he hopes will ensure his towns future.
The young population has gone up so much, he says, that the town is looking at bringing in a subsided daycare in the coming months.
We took a guess, a chance that it might work, he said. So far, its exceeded our expectations.

KUWAIT CITY  A deadly explosion ripped through a Shiite mosque in a busy neighbourhood of Kuwaits capital after Friday prayers, witnesses said.
Mohammed al-Faili, 32, told The Associated Press that his 70 year-old father was killed in what appeared to be a bombing attack. Two of his brothers were also wounded by the explosion. Speaking to the AP by telephone, he said he was not at the mosque at the time of the explosion but was heading to the morgue to identify his fathers body.
Story continues below
The official Kuwait News Agency reported that an explosion struck the Imam Sadiq Mosque, which is located in the neighbourhood of al-Sawabir, a residential and shopping district of Kuwait City. The agency confirmed that there were multiple casualties and injuries, but did provide any figures.
Paramedics at the mosque say at least two people were killed. Police formed a cordon around the mosques complex immediately after the explosion, banning people from entering or gathering near the area. Ambulances could be seen ferrying the wounded from the site.
Abdullah al-Saffar, who was at the mosque, said the explosion took place just after midday Friday prayers.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for what appears to be a bombing that targeted the mosque. The extremist Islamic State group, which regards Shiite Muslims as heretics, has claimed responsibility for bombings at two different Shiite mosques in neighbouring Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.
Friday midday prayers are typically the most crowded of the week, and attendance increases during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which started last week.

LONDON  Harry Potter is going to have a new adventure  one that takes him from page and screen to stage.
Author J.K. Rowling announced Friday that a new play called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will open at Londons Palace Theatre about a year from now in the summer of 2016.
Rowling tweeted that the play explores an untold part of Harrys story and is not a prequel.
Story continues below
The first-ever play about the bespectacled boy wizard it is based on a new story by Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany.
The script is by Thorne, a stage and screen writer whose work includes vampire story Let the Right One In. The director is Tiffany, who helmed the critically lauded war play Black Watch and multiple Tony Award-winning musical Once. The production will also feature music by British songwriter Imogen Heap.
Ive had countless offers to extend Harrys story over the years, but Jack, John and (producer) Sonia Friedman are a dream team! Rowling tweeted.
Rowling has long insisted there will be no new Harry Potter novels, but she has kept fans happy with spin-off works including the magical encyclopedia Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which is set to be a film starring Eddie Redmayne.
Rowling said she thought that once audiences saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child they would agree that the stage was the only proper medium for the story.
Rowlings seven Harry Potter novels have sold more than 450 million copies around the world and been made into eight successful films.
Tickets for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will go on sale this fall.

It was hard to ignore British Columbias historic heat wave today.
In total, 36 communities across the province hit record highs for June 27, including a blistering 40.4 degrees Celsius in Osoyoos.
Here are the 36 places in B.C. where record high temperatures were hit today. pic.twitter.com/BTGtkI2JWe
 Global BC (@GlobalBC) June 28, 2015
Were basically on target right now to be the second warmest June in the history of record keeping [in B.C.], which started back in 1937, says Global News weather anchor Kate Gajdosik.
Story continues below
The record highs came on the same day that a campfire ban went into effect for much of the south coast.
It made for a melancholy Friday night for campers at Alice Lake Provincial Park in the north end of Squamish, who knew they were putting out campfires for likely the final time this summer.
I wouldnt be surprised if it was on all summer. Id be shocked. The only way theyre taking it off is if we get any major amounts of precipitation, which doesnt look like its going to [happen], said Matt Vandenraadt.
WATCH: Julia Foy speaks to Vancouverites who found ways to beat the heat on Saturday
The hot, dry weather continues to be a concern for plenty of people , including firefighters.
Squamish to Whistler is an extreme [zone]. Theres a large area expanding just to the east of Chilliwack. With these high temperatures and the dry weather we expect those areas to expand even further, says Marg Drysdale, Fire Information Officer for the South Coast.
More than $62 million has already been spent on fires so far this year  and Drysdale wants people to remember that individuals can be found liable if theyre found responsible for any themselves.
If it cause a wildfire, and contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all the firefighting and associated costs of that wildfire.
