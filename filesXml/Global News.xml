SAN FRANCISCO  The latest models of Googles self-driving cars are now cruising the streets near the Internet companys Silicon Valley headquarters as an ambitious project to transform the way people get around shifts into its next phase.
Story continues below
This marks the first time that the pod-like, two-seat vehicles have been allowed on public roads since Google unveiled the next generation of its self-driving fleet more than a year ago. The cars had previously been confined to a private track on a former Air Force base located about 120 miles southeast of San Francisco.
Google announced last month that it would begin testing the curious-looking cars last month , but hadnt specified the timing until Tuesday when it disclosed the vehicles are driving up to 25 miles per hour on the roads around its Mountain View, California, office.

Google had installed its robotic driving technology in Lexus sports utility vehicles and Toyota Priuses during the first few years of testing before developing the smaller prototype. The new models are designed to work without a steering wheel or brake pedal, although the vehicles will be equipped with those features during the initial runs on public roads.
A human will also ride in the cars to take control in emergencies, just as has been the case with the self-driving Lexus vehicles during the past six years.
The debut of the pod-like car will help Google get a better understanding on how well its technology works around other vehicles steered by people.
Last year, Google Inc. told reporters it hoped to have a 100 of the self-driving prototypes in its fleet by now , but the company said it has only built 25 of them so far. All 25 have received permission from Californias Department of Motor Vehicles to drive neighbourhood roads.
If all goes well, Google hopes to gain regulatory clearance to remove the steering wheel, brake pedal and emergency driver from the prototype. Company executives have expressed hope that self-driving cars using its technology will be joining the flow of daily traffic by the end of this decade.

The earlier models of Googles self-driving cars had been involved in 13 minor accidents through more than 1.8 million miles on the roads, according to the company. Google blamed the collisions on other vehicles in every instance except one when the company says one of its own employees was steering.

WINNIPEG  Firefighters used a ladder truck to rescue an elderly man from a St. James apartment block during a blaze Thursday night, a witness says.
Firefighters evacuated the Park West Apartments after they were called to fight a blaze in a seventh-floor suite at about 11 p.m.
Flames shot out of the back windows of the building at 2366 Portage Ave., a resident told Global News.
He saw firefighters use a ladder truck to remove a man in a wheelchair from his suite, said the witness, who didnt give his name. He believes the elderly resident is 93 years old.
Firefighters quickly got the flames under control and no one was seriously injured, although some residents were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, police said.
Fire officials estimate damages at roughly $1 million, including extensive water damage.

        <title>Trey Lyles first Saskatoon-born player to be drafted into the NBA</title>

        <Description>Utah Jazz select Kentucky forward Trey Lyles, the first Saskatoon-born player to be drafted into the NBA.</Description>
        <MainBody>Saskatoon-born Trey Lyles tops Canadians in March Madness
His playmaking with the ball, his handle  ability to keep his head up and play unselfish basketball is superior, Lindsey said. Trey made some sacrifices not playing as many minutes at the four, which is his natural position. But playing the three, he learned to handle the ball, learned to execute. A big part of our game going forward is bigs that can guard smalls.
Lyles, who was born in Saskatoon but moved to Indianapolis at a young age, is the first Saskatoon-born player to be drafted into the NBA.

The Jazz then took another Canadian, 6-foot-4, 186-pound Boston College guard Olivier Hanlan of Aylmer, Que., with the No. 42 pick. He averaged 19.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists as a junior and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in points per game. Daniel Diez from Spain was selected with the No. 54 pick and traded to the Trail Blazers for cash considerations.
Lyles averaged 8.7 points and 5.2 rebounds for the Wildcats and was named to the Southeastern Conference All-Freshman team after his lone collegiate season. He has a 7-1 wingspan with large hands and Lindsey believes he can get bigger.
I know its a young team and I feel  going to that situation is perfect, Lyles said. Im a guy that can step in and help contribute immediately.
Being able to contribute offensively and defensively, just being a guy that goes out there and if they need a bucket, Ill be able to be a guy that can go get one. And just be a high-character guy thats going to fit in.
The Jazz went into the off-season needing shooting after averaging the fifth-fewest points per game last season. Frontcourt depth became a priority after the team moved Enes Kanter to the Thunder.
Lyles, 19, could fill a stretch-four role one day, though he shot just 13.8 per cent from 3-point range. He worked out with the Jazz on June 13 and said he wasnt able to show all of his game on a Kentucky roster that had four players selected in the first 13 picks. He knocked down 25 of 40 corner 3-point shots during his workout with the Jazz.
Lindsey said Lyles is a better rebounder than his numbers show and called him a good midrange shooter that should be able to improve. He also thinks Lyles can be a very solid corner-3 shooter in time.
Im able to knock it down consistently, Lyles said. Coach and managers for Jazz were able to see that. Its something I have confidence in.
Lyles has the mobility to guard multiple positions and the pick-and-roll while his length is something the Jazz covet. Point guard Trey Burke is the only player projected to be in the top-eight rotation, not including Lyles, that is under 6-foot-6.
More playmaking ability for myself and my teammates, Lyles said when asked what he couldnt show at Kentucky. Being able to score more. Post up a little bit more. I didnt get to play a lot of the four. Just a whole lot of versatility.
The Jazz finished the season with a 38-44 record, a 13-game improvement from the 2013-14 season, and were slotted No. 12 after a tiebreak drawing with the Pacers. The improvement was the second-best in the Western Conference and the sixth-best in the NBA.
Lyles said he can fill any role.
Im a guy whos pretty flexible on the court and pretty much can do whatever the coach asks of me, Lyles said. I feel comfortable in any kind of lineup. It doesnt matter to me. I just know that Ill be able to transform to anything thats needed of me.
The Jazz had the sixth-best win percentage (.655) after the All-Star break and aspires to be in the playoff race next season. The five teams in front of them  Warriors, Clippers, Cavaliers, Spurs and Rockets  were all playoff teams.
Defence was the Jazzs calling card during their post All-Star success. The Jazz ranked No. 1 in the league, holding teams to 89.0 points per game and No. 2 in opponent field goal percentage (42.2) during that period. The emergence of 7-foot-1 shot blocker Rudy Gobert after Kanter was traded solidified the defence.
The offence, however, was the second-worst in the league after the break and where the biggest strides can be made during the off-season.

It happened just before 6 p.m. in a lot on the Stampede grounds.
The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.
Investigators dont believe the rider was wearing a helmet, and say excessive speed is believed to be a factor in the collision.

KUWAIT CITY  A deadly explosion ripped through a Shiite mosque in a busy neighbourhood of Kuwaits capital after Friday prayers, witnesses said.
Mohammed al-Faili, 32, told The Associated Press that his 70 year-old father was killed in what appeared to be a bombing attack. Two of his brothers were also wounded by the explosion. Speaking to the AP by telephone, he said he was not at the mosque at the time of the explosion but was heading to the morgue to identify his fathers body.
Story continues below
The official Kuwait News Agency reported that an explosion struck the Imam Sadiq Mosque, which is located in the neighbourhood of al-Sawabir, a residential and shopping district of Kuwait City. The agency confirmed that there were multiple casualties and injuries, but did provide any figures.
Paramedics at the mosque say at least two people were killed. Police formed a cordon around the mosques complex immediately after the explosion, banning people from entering or gathering near the area. Ambulances could be seen ferrying the wounded from the site.
Abdullah al-Saffar, who was at the mosque, said the explosion took place just after midday Friday prayers.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for what appears to be a bombing that targeted the mosque. The extremist Islamic State group, which regards Shiite Muslims as heretics, has claimed responsibility for bombings at two different Shiite mosques in neighbouring Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.
Friday midday prayers are typically the most crowded of the week, and attendance increases during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which started last week.

LONDON  Harry Potter is going to have a new adventure  one that takes him from page and screen to stage.
Author J.K. Rowling announced Friday that a new play called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will open at Londons Palace Theatre about a year from now in the summer of 2016.
Rowling tweeted that the play explores an untold part of Harrys story and is not a prequel.
Story continues below
The first-ever play about the bespectacled boy wizard it is based on a new story by Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany.
The script is by Thorne, a stage and screen writer whose work includes vampire story Let the Right One In. The director is Tiffany, who helmed the critically lauded war play Black Watch and multiple Tony Award-winning musical Once. The production will also feature music by British songwriter Imogen Heap.
Ive had countless offers to extend Harrys story over the years, but Jack, John and (producer) Sonia Friedman are a dream team! Rowling tweeted.
Rowling has long insisted there will be no new Harry Potter novels, but she has kept fans happy with spin-off works including the magical encyclopedia Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which is set to be a film starring Eddie Redmayne.
Rowling said she thought that once audiences saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child they would agree that the stage was the only proper medium for the story.
Rowlings seven Harry Potter novels have sold more than 450 million copies around the world and been made into eight successful films.
Tickets for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will go on sale this fall.
