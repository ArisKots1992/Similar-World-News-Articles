SAN FRANCISCO  The latest models of Googles self-driving cars are now cruising the streets near the Internet companys Silicon Valley headquarters as an ambitious project to transform the way people get around shifts into its next phase.
Story continues below
This marks the first time that the pod-like, two-seat vehicles have been allowed on public roads since Google unveiled the next generation of its self-driving fleet more than a year ago. The cars had previously been confined to a private track on a former Air Force base located about 120 miles southeast of San Francisco.
Google announced last month that it would begin testing the curious-looking cars last month , but hadnt specified the timing until Tuesday when it disclosed the vehicles are driving up to 25 miles per hour on the roads around its Mountain View, California, office.

Google had installed its robotic driving technology in Lexus sports utility vehicles and Toyota Priuses during the first few years of testing before developing the smaller prototype. The new models are designed to work without a steering wheel or brake pedal, although the vehicles will be equipped with those features during the initial runs on public roads.
A human will also ride in the cars to take control in emergencies, just as has been the case with the self-driving Lexus vehicles during the past six years.
The debut of the pod-like car will help Google get a better understanding on how well its technology works around other vehicles steered by people.
Last year, Google Inc. told reporters it hoped to have a 100 of the self-driving prototypes in its fleet by now , but the company said it has only built 25 of them so far. All 25 have received permission from Californias Department of Motor Vehicles to drive neighbourhood roads.
If all goes well, Google hopes to gain regulatory clearance to remove the steering wheel, brake pedal and emergency driver from the prototype. Company executives have expressed hope that self-driving cars using its technology will be joining the flow of daily traffic by the end of this decade.

The earlier models of Googles self-driving cars had been involved in 13 minor accidents through more than 1.8 million miles on the roads, according to the company. Google blamed the collisions on other vehicles in every instance except one when the company says one of its own employees was steering.

WINNIPEG  Firefighters used a ladder truck to rescue an elderly man from a St. James apartment block during a blaze Thursday night, a witness says.
Firefighters evacuated the Park West Apartments after they were called to fight a blaze in a seventh-floor suite at about 11 p.m.
Flames shot out of the back windows of the building at 2366 Portage Ave., a resident told Global News.
He saw firefighters use a ladder truck to remove a man in a wheelchair from his suite, said the witness, who didnt give his name. He believes the elderly resident is 93 years old.
Firefighters quickly got the flames under control and no one was seriously injured, although some residents were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, police said.
Fire officials estimate damages at roughly $1 million, including extensive water damage.

        <Description>Utah Jazz select Kentucky forward Trey Lyles, the first Saskatoon-born player to be drafted into the NBA.</Description>
        <MainBody>Saskatoon-born Trey Lyles tops Canadians in March Madness
His playmaking with the ball, his handle  ability to keep his head up and play unselfish basketball is superior, Lindsey said. Trey made some sacrifices not playing as many minutes at the four, which is his natural position. But playing the three, he learned to handle the ball, learned to execute. A big part of our game going forward is bigs that can guard smalls.
Lyles, who was born in Saskatoon but moved to Indianapolis at a young age, is the first Saskatoon-born player to be drafted into the NBA.

The Jazz then took another Canadian, 6-foot-4, 186-pound Boston College guard Olivier Hanlan of Aylmer, Que., with the No. 42 pick. He averaged 19.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists as a junior and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in points per game. Daniel Diez from Spain was selected with the No. 54 pick and traded to the Trail Blazers for cash considerations.
Lyles averaged 8.7 points and 5.2 rebounds for the Wildcats and was named to the Southeastern Conference All-Freshman team after his lone collegiate season. He has a 7-1 wingspan with large hands and Lindsey believes he can get bigger.
I know its a young team and I feel  going to that situation is perfect, Lyles said. Im a guy that can step in and help contribute immediately.
Being able to contribute offensively and defensively, just being a guy that goes out there and if they need a bucket, Ill be able to be a guy that can go get one. And just be a high-character guy thats going to fit in.
The Jazz went into the off-season needing shooting after averaging the fifth-fewest points per game last season. Frontcourt depth became a priority after the team moved Enes Kanter to the Thunder.
Lyles, 19, could fill a stretch-four role one day, though he shot just 13.8 per cent from 3-point range. He worked out with the Jazz on June 13 and said he wasnt able to show all of his game on a Kentucky roster that had four players selected in the first 13 picks. He knocked down 25 of 40 corner 3-point shots during his workout with the Jazz.
Lindsey said Lyles is a better rebounder than his numbers show and called him a good midrange shooter that should be able to improve. He also thinks Lyles can be a very solid corner-3 shooter in time.
Im able to knock it down consistently, Lyles said. Coach and managers for Jazz were able to see that. Its something I have confidence in.
Lyles has the mobility to guard multiple positions and the pick-and-roll while his length is something the Jazz covet. Point guard Trey Burke is the only player projected to be in the top-eight rotation, not including Lyles, that is under 6-foot-6.
More playmaking ability for myself and my teammates, Lyles said when asked what he couldnt show at Kentucky. Being able to score more. Post up a little bit more. I didnt get to play a lot of the four. Just a whole lot of versatility.
The Jazz finished the season with a 38-44 record, a 13-game improvement from the 2013-14 season, and were slotted No. 12 after a tiebreak drawing with the Pacers. The improvement was the second-best in the Western Conference and the sixth-best in the NBA.
Lyles said he can fill any role.
Im a guy whos pretty flexible on the court and pretty much can do whatever the coach asks of me, Lyles said. I feel comfortable in any kind of lineup. It doesnt matter to me. I just know that Ill be able to transform to anything thats needed of me.
The Jazz had the sixth-best win percentage (.655) after the All-Star break and aspires to be in the playoff race next season. The five teams in front of them  Warriors, Clippers, Cavaliers, Spurs and Rockets  were all playoff teams.
Defence was the Jazzs calling card during their post All-Star success. The Jazz ranked No. 1 in the league, holding teams to 89.0 points per game and No. 2 in opponent field goal percentage (42.2) during that period. The emergence of 7-foot-1 shot blocker Rudy Gobert after Kanter was traded solidified the defence.
The offence, however, was the second-worst in the league after the break and where the biggest strides can be made during the off-season.

CALGARY  Police are searching for the driver of a silver minivan that crashed into a home in Upper Mount Royal on Tuesday.
The collision took place in the 1000 block of Frontenac Avenue S.W. just before 4:30 a.m.
Officers say the garage suffered most of the damage.
The driver allegedly reversed the vehicle and drove off. He was last seen travelling east on 30th Avenue S.W.
We were sleeping we heard the loud bang and looked out the window and I saw a silver minivan taking off and I knew exactly what happened, said the homeowner. You can see he sped right through the traffic circle and hit the garage.
The Calgary Police Service and the Calgary Fire Department are investigating.

MALONE, N.Y.  Officers scouring dense and boggy woods for a surviving escaped killer took floodlights into the search area overnight, and others carrying rifles manned checkpoints and examined vehicles, opening trunks and peering into windows.
Franklin County Sheriff Kevin Mulverhill said late Saturday tips continued to pour in and he was optimistic David Sweat would be captured, perhaps within 48 hours.
Its going to be one of those phone calls that turns this case around, he said.
READ MORE: 1 of 2 escaped inmates killed by law enforcement, other on the run
Richard Matt  who once vowed never to be taken alive  was fatally shot Friday during an encounter with border patrol agents about 30 miles west of the prison he escaped from with Sweat on June 6. Sweat remained on the lam early Sunday, and about 1,200 searchers focused intensely on 22 square miles encompassing thick forests and heavy brush around where Matt was killed.
Police hoped the solo escapee would finally succumb to the stress of little sleep, scant food and biting bugs.
Anyone in the woods and on the run from the law so to speak is not getting a full eight hours sleep, theyre not eating well and they have to keep moving, Mulverhill said. Hes fatigued, tired, and hes going to make a mistake.
Sweat could have an even tougher time now without someone to take turns resting with and to watch his back, Clinton County Sheriff David Favro said.
Now its a one-man show and it makes it more difficult for him, Favro said. And Im sure fatigue is setting in for him as well, knowing the guy he was with has already been shot.
The manhunt broke open Friday afternoon when a person towing a camper heard a loud noise and thought a tire had blown. Finding there was no flat, the driver drove eight miles before looking again and finding a bullet hole in the trailer. A tactical team responding to the scene of the shot smelled gunpowder inside a cabin and saw evidence that someone had fled out the back door.
A noise  perhaps a cough  ultimately did Matt in. A border patrol team discovered Matt, who was shot after failing to heed a command to raise his hands.
Matt had a 20-gauge shotgun that was believed to have been taken from another cabin. The pair had apparently been relying on the remote regions many hunting camps and seasonal dwellings for supplies.
Matt, who turned 49 the day before he died, was serving 25 years to life at Clinton Correctional Facility for the killing and dismemberment of his former boss. Local residents were relieved that one killer was no longer roaming the woods, but the constant commotion of speeding police cruisers and helicopters pointed to the continued danger.
Half the threat is taken care of, but obviously David Sweat is on the loose, said Matt Maguire, who was waiting for a police escort to pick up some clothes from his house inside the search area. Maguire and his fiancee decided a week ago to stay with nearby relatives.
Sweat, 35, was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriffs deputy in Broome County in 2002. Mulverhill said investigators believe he may be armed.
Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a 2-foot-thick brick wall, squirmed through pipes and emerged from a manhole outside the prison.
While there have been no confirmed sightings of Sweat, police said investigators saw a second set of tracks near where Matt was shot.
Ultimately, how the chase ends is up to Sweat, Mulverhill said.
If hes willing to surrender to law enforcement then well place him in handcuffs and well bring him back into custody, he said.
If he chooses to resist or he chooses not to comply, then the results are his.

Security officials say investigators have found no links to any international terror group in the attack Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.
Salhi, arrested Friday, was to be transferred to counterterrorism police headquarters outside Paris. He allegedly crashed a truck into a U.S.-owned chemical warehouse and hung his employers head on the factorys gate. Officials say he sent a selfie of himself and the victim to a Canadian mobile phone number.
A spokesman for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney confirmsCanadian authorities are involved in the case.

WATCH ABOVE: 500 troops arrive in Prince Albert to battle wildfires. Joelle Tomlinson reports.
PRINCE ALBERT, Sask.  Soldiers started rolling into Saskatchewan on Monday to double firefighting efforts in the north. By 10 p.m., 500 members of the rapid response unit of the Canadian Forces based in Edmonton were in Prince Albert.
About 200 received eight hours of training when they arrived late Monday afternoon and the remainder will likely be trained on Tuesday.
Obviously we are not professional firefighters, but we are getting some great and valuable training tonight (Monday) and into the week to set us up in addition to the other valuable skills we bring to the table, said Lt.-Col. Mason Stalker.
Theyre going to get things like coveralls, goggles, ear protection, hard hats, etc. and once theyre issued those, add that to the training and the basic skill sets they already bring to the table, well get them projected north in support of the Government of Saskatchewan.
Wildfires inch closer to Saskatchewan communities
READ MORE: Situation very critical as crews battle northern Sask. wildfires
Initially, it was reported 1,000 troops would be coming to assist with wildfire fighting efforts. The other 500 troops will be deployed from Shilo, Man. if needed.
Weve deliberately done a phased approach into this zone, because we certainly dont want to overwhelm and we want to bring what is required to assist the people of Saskatchewan, said Stalker.
So if the Government of Saskatchewan, in consultation with the fire centre here, determines that more is needed, there are additional, as I mentioned that other immediate response unit thats based in Shilo, my commander would start the process based on the recommendations from, of course the wildfire centre here and the Government of Saskatchewan if they are needed.
Colin King, with Saskatchewans Emergency Management department, described the fire situation as critical and said people evacuated from more than 50 communities wouldnt be returning soon.
The threat has not been reduced in any of those communities. We are advising all community leadership to remain out until it is safe, he said.

 Thomas Sierzycki (@TSierzycki) July 7, 2015
As of Monday evening, the most significant of 112 fires burning in the province was north of La Ronge, one of the largest communities in north. Mayor Thomas Sierzycki issued a fire update on Twitter about 8 p.m. local time saying the flames were just 1.5 kilometres from residential areas.
Residents were evacuated on the weekend from the town, as well as neighbouring Air Ronge and the Lac La Ronge Indian Band.
READ MORE: Fire evacuation largest in Saskatchewans history
Fires and thick smoke forced others in the north to start leaving their homes 11 days earlier.
Flames have destroyed about a dozen homes, remote cabins and other buildings in Montreal Lake, Weyakwin and Wadin Bay. One building also burned north of La Ronge.
About 300 square kilometres are burning in what officials are calling high-priority fire zones, about 10 times the yearly average.
Scott Wasylenchuk with the Provincial Fire Centre had some good news, however. An area near La Ronge burned in an old forest fire is acting as a natural barrier and wind was expected to shift flames away from the town.
Which means some of the fire lines closest to the community wont be as hot and well be able to get on them and make good progress, he said.
Premier Brad Wall, who visited La Ronge last week, said hes glad soldiers are on hand to help and hes not worried fire will spread into the town.
Right now were in a pretty good spot  Were feeling cautiously optimistic after a difficult weekend.

Nearly 700 evacuees from La Ronge were being housed in Cold Lake, Alta. The Alberta government had said it was preparing to receive up to 5,000 after centres in Saskatoon, Regina, Prince Albert and North Battleford were filling up.
Karri Kempf with Saskatchewans Social Services Ministry said slightly more than 7,000 have registered as evacuees and she estimates another 2,000 others are staying with friends and family.

MONTREAL  Large parts of Canada were settled thanks to a government policy of giving out free land to anyone willing to show up and farm it.
And although the federal government largely stopped giving out Crown land in the 1930s, some small towns are continuing the tradition by giving their land away for free.

Its telling that the Pope is reaching out to mayors as part of his direct-action agenda to tackle climate action and poverty because were on the front lines of it and were committed to dealing with these challenges, Robertson said in an interview.
The Pope recognizes that mayors play a key role in leading communities to a better future  were where the rubber hits the road in taking care of cities and weve largely been left out of the conversation.
Robertson levelled harsh words for the current Canadian government, saying it has been in the bad books globally because of inaction on the environmental front. National governments in general have failed to deliver solutions on climate change, he said.
But at a city level theres serious action and commitment and its important that the rest of the world understands that, Robertson said.
Ill be sharing stories from our work in Vancouver and encouraging global cities and the Vatican to continue pressing for more urgent and aggressive action.
Robertson referenced Vancouvers commitment to converting the city to 100-per-cent renewable energy, the citys calls for binding targets on climate pollution and its ambition at being recognized as the worlds greenest city.
The mayor, who isnt Catholic and doesnt follow any organized religion, said he was humbled to be included on the pontiffs invite list.
Its a responsibility that I dont take lightly.
The invitation comes in the wake of the Popes unprecedented encyclical on climate change, released last month, which blamed climate change on an unequal, fossil fuel-based, structurally perverse economy that favours a culture of consumption at the expense of the worlds poor.
The landmark document was heralded as a call to action in framing climate change as the moral challenge of our era.
Many lauded the Vaticans foray into environmental issues, while critics lambasted the church for stepping outside its area of expertise.
I dont get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my Pope, said U.S. Republican presidential contender and converted Catholic Jeb Bush during a campaign stop in New Hampshire.
Others commended the Pope for his outspoken stance on climate-change action, including Robertson.
I think the Popes leadership is fantastic and much needed from an important religious leader on what is essentially a moral issue and the toughest challenge in human history, he said. Its crucial for political, religious, business and community leaders to be rallying aggressively right now  its so urgent.
World leaders are slated to meet later this year in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference.

NEW YORK  One of the last of the classic Hollywood showmen, Jerry Weintraub built his show business empire on a Rolodex and chutzpah.
The Brooklyn-born son of a Bronx jeweler, Weintraub rose from the mailroom of a talent agency to become a top concert promoter before shifting into a decades-long career as a top Hollywood producer.
Story continues below
Along the way, Weintraub worked with the most famous of stars  Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, George Clooney, Brad Pitt  and was a close friend of former President George H.W. Bush. He relished his insider status, just as they savored the stories that eagerly poured out of him.
Weintraub, the dynamic producer and manager who pushed the career of John Denver and produced such hits movies as Nashville, Karate Kid and Oceans Eleven, died Monday in Santa Barbara, California. He was 77. A publicist for Weintraub said he died of cardiac arrest.
Jerry was an American original who earned his success by the sheer force of his instinct, drive, and larger-than-life personality, said Bush, a longtime friend. He had a passion for life, and throughout the ups and downs of his prolific career, it was clear just how much he loved show business.
Weintraub failed in one of his most ambitious gambits. His attempt to found his own studio, Weintraub Entertainment Group, ended in bankruptcy after only three years. But his long career  very much alive at the time of his passing  was marked by savvy innovation (he was among the first to stage arena tours) and old-school class.
Weintraub had his choice lunch spots in Los Angeles, his desert home in Palm Springs and his favored places to moor his yacht off the French Riviera. A self-made man, he fashioned himself in the mold of old Hollywood showman like Mike Todd, Cecil B. DeMille and P.T. Barnum. He titled his 2011 memoir: When I Stop Talking, Youll Know Im Dead.
At the time, he joked he might write another: Dead, But Still Talking.
In the coming days there will be tributes about our friend Jerry Weintraub, said Clooney, a star of the Oceans movies. Well laugh at his great stories and applaud his accomplishments. And in the years to come, the stories and accomplishments will get better with age, just as Jerry would have wanted it. But not today. Today our friend died.
One of Weintraubs most recent successes was the 2013 Liberace drama Behind the Candelabra. After the studios passed, he took it to HBO, where it won 11 Emmys.
He left numerous projects behind, including the recently debuted HBO series The Brink with Jack Black, and an upcoming big-budget remake of Tarzan.
If asked my philosophy, it would be simply this: Savor life, dont press too hard, dont worry too much. Or as the old-timers say, Enjoy,' he wrote his book. But  I never could live by this philosophy and was, in fact, out working, hustling, trading, scheming, and making a buck as soon as I was old enough to leave my parents house.
Growing up, Weintraub said he father, a successful gem salesman, taught him only two things are important at the end of the week: how much you owe the bank and how much you have in it.
Hired to work in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency, Weintraub then landed a job with Lew Wassermans MCA, where he worked as advance man for the agencys stars.
His career as a promoter took a giant step in 1970 when after a lengthy courtship he persuaded Elvis Presleys manager, Col. Tom Parker, to let him promote Presley concerts. It was at a time when Presley was beginning to do live shows after years of concentrating on movies.
Weintraub and partner Tom Hulett introduced such improvements as a modern sound system for Presley, an experience that propelled Weintraub into the top ranks of promoters.
Around the same time, Weintraub saw Denver at a small Greenwich Village nightclub and was overwhelmed by the mountaineers easy manner. He took on Denver as a client.
He would be a test case for all my theories on selling and packaging, for everything I had learned since I left home, Weintraub said.
After enormous success followed, Denver bought Weintraub a Rolls-Royce as a thank-you gift. Weintraub said, I couldnt help thinking that it wasnt too long ago that neither of us had bus fare.
Weintraub produced a dozen Denver musical specials on television  winning an Emmy for one of them  and the hit 1977 movie Oh, God! It starred George Burns as God and Denver as the young grocer whom God approaches to spread his message.
He also set up successful tours for Sinatra and produced the television special Sinatra  the Main Event, as well as joint appearances with Denver. Among other musicians Weintraub worked with were Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond and the Beach Boys.
After his first marriage (which resulted in a son, Michael), Weintraub married torch singer Jane Morgan in 1965. They had three adopted children: Julie, Jamie and Jordy. The pair separated but never divorced.
Weintraubs emphasis shifted to movies with 1975s Nashville, Robert Altmans acclaimed comedy-drama of American life as seen through the eyes of 24 characters in and around the country music business. It landed five Oscar nominations, including best picture.
In his memoir, Weintraub said he didnt understand the complicated script, but he was eager to produce it because Altman did, and it was Altman who was going to make the movie.
Weintraub went on to produce such notable films as Barry Levinsons Diner, All Night Long, The Karate Kid, and William Friedkins controversial, gay-themed Cruising.
He became chief of United Artists in 1985 but was ousted after just five months amid reports of disagreements with financier Kirk Kerkorian. He later reached a settlement with the company.
In 1987, he attempted to establish his own studio, WEG, but it went belly up in 1990 after a string of flops including My Stepmother Is an Alien.
I had, in a sense, promoted myself out of the job I always wanted, which was telling stories, producing, he wrote in his memoir. (The films) now were being made for me instead of by me.
After the WEG bankruptcy, Weintraub continued producing, putting out such films as Vegas Vacation and Oceans Eleven and its starry sequels. He remade The Karate Kid in 2010, setting the project up in China and starring the young Jaden Smith, Will Smiths son. Weintraub said he questioned it 150,000 times before backing it.
Starting in the 1980s, Weintraub became known as one of the Republican Partys most loyal supporters in Hollywood. He had been close to Bush years before he became president, and in 1991, he hosted a star-studded party for the president at his Malibu home and played golf with Bush and former President Ronald Reagan.

TORONTO  GoPro has unveiled its smallest camera yet  a cube-shaped, waterproof camera that weighs in at just 2.6 ounces.
The Hero4 Session is about the size of a large ice cube and will retail for US$399. According to the company, the Hero4 Session is 50 per cent smaller and 40 per cent lighter than the rest of GoPros high-end Hero4 range.
Unlike GoPros other cameras, the Hero4 Session only has one button to turn it on and start recording  allowing for the smaller design. The camera is also waterproof up to 33 feet thanks to its fully sealed design.
Although its smaller, the camera still packs the same capabilities as other GoPro models.
It can record video at full HD resolution at up to 60 frames per second and features the companys Protune mode, designed for a more cinematic look.
In May, GoPro announced it was getting into the drone and virtual reality business. By 2016 the company plans to come out with a quadcopter drone geared toward consumers.
The Hero4 Session will be available starting July 12.

KUWAIT CITY  A deadly explosion ripped through a Shiite mosque in a busy neighbourhood of Kuwaits capital after Friday prayers, witnesses said.
Mohammed al-Faili, 32, told The Associated Press that his 70 year-old father was killed in what appeared to be a bombing attack. Two of his brothers were also wounded by the explosion. Speaking to the AP by telephone, he said he was not at the mosque at the time of the explosion but was heading to the morgue to identify his fathers body.
Story continues below
The official Kuwait News Agency reported that an explosion struck the Imam Sadiq Mosque, which is located in the neighbourhood of al-Sawabir, a residential and shopping district of Kuwait City. The agency confirmed that there were multiple casualties and injuries, but did provide any figures.
Paramedics at the mosque say at least two people were killed. Police formed a cordon around the mosques complex immediately after the explosion, banning people from entering or gathering near the area. Ambulances could be seen ferrying the wounded from the site.
Abdullah al-Saffar, who was at the mosque, said the explosion took place just after midday Friday prayers.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for what appears to be a bombing that targeted the mosque. The extremist Islamic State group, which regards Shiite Muslims as heretics, has claimed responsibility for bombings at two different Shiite mosques in neighbouring Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.
Friday midday prayers are typically the most crowded of the week, and attendance increases during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, which started last week.

LONDON  Harry Potter is going to have a new adventure  one that takes him from page and screen to stage.
Author J.K. Rowling announced Friday that a new play called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will open at Londons Palace Theatre about a year from now in the summer of 2016.
Rowling tweeted that the play explores an untold part of Harrys story and is not a prequel.

The first-ever play about the bespectacled boy wizard it is based on a new story by Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany.
The script is by Thorne, a stage and screen writer whose work includes vampire story Let the Right One In. The director is Tiffany, who helmed the critically lauded war play Black Watch and multiple Tony Award-winning musical Once. The production will also feature music by British songwriter Imogen Heap.
Ive had countless offers to extend Harrys story over the years, but Jack, John and (producer) Sonia Friedman are a dream team! Rowling tweeted.
Rowling has long insisted there will be no new Harry Potter novels, but she has kept fans happy with spin-off works including the magical encyclopedia Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which is set to be a film starring Eddie Redmayne.
Rowling said she thought that once audiences saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child they would agree that the stage was the only proper medium for the story.
Rowlings seven Harry Potter novels have sold more than 450 million copies around the world and been made into eight successful films.
Tickets for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will go on sale this fall.

Were basically on target right now to be the second warmest June in the history of record keeping [in B.C.], which started back in 1937, says Global News weather anchor Kate Gajdosik.

The record highs came on the same day that a campfire ban went into effect for much of the south coast.
It made for a melancholy Friday night for campers at Alice Lake Provincial Park in the north end of Squamish, who knew they were putting out campfires for likely the final time this summer.
I wouldnt be surprised if it was on all summer. Id be shocked. The only way theyre taking it off is if we get any major amounts of precipitation, which doesnt look like its going to [happen], said Matt Vandenraadt.

The hot, dry weather continues to be a concern for plenty of people , including firefighters.
Squamish to Whistler is an extreme [zone]. Theres a large area expanding just to the east of Chilliwack. With these high temperatures and the dry weather we expect those areas to expand even further, says Marg Drysdale, Fire Information Officer for the South Coast.
More than $62 million has already been spent on fires so far this year  and Drysdale wants people to remember that individuals can be found liable if theyre found responsible for any themselves.
If it cause a wildfire, and contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all the firefighting and associated costs of that wildfire.
