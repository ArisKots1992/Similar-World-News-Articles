Tony Abbott has looked to Singapore's experience in de-radicalisation as Australia monitors fresh terror attacks abroad and threats at home.
The prime minister's visit to Khadijah Mosque's successful program came on his first of two days in the city-state, on a visit aimed at strengthening ties in defence and security, and trade and investment.
Mr Abbott says Singapore has long-term experience in "detoxing" people from radicalism, whereas for Australia, it is early days.
"I was very pleased to see their confidence that it was possible to turn people back from this dreadful, dreadful abyss," he said.
"Because the more people succumb to that, the worse the abyss that all of us could face in the years and decades to come."
Australia has not raised its domestic terror alert level after Friday's attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait, in which more than 60 people were killed.
However the prime minister warned Australians that Islamic State was "coming after us".
The religious rehabilitation group he visited in Singapore was established after a branch of terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiyah was discovered in December 2001, with plans to attack targets including the Australian High Commission.
The centre's volunteers are said to have conducted more than 1500 counselling sessions and de-radicalised more than 60 people.
Mr Abbott was set to meet Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong over an Aussie-style barbecue on Sunday night, ahead of inking a new bilateral agreement.
The comprehensive strategic partnership will draw both countries closer in the fields of the economy, foreign affairs, defence and security, and people-to-people ties.
Mr Abbott said he wanted to boost the existing free trade agreement with Singapore, already Australia's fifth-largest two-way trading partner.
The visit is his first chance to take the northern Australia white paper to Asian investors, vital for making the vision for a new economic powerhouse into a reality.
Trade Minister Andrew Robb, WA Premier Colin Barnett, Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk joined the roundtable talks with Australian CEOs from Lend Lease, Woodside and Hancock Prospecting, among others.
The Singapore investors were told about the promising "next frontier".
"Obviously it's important that we respect our pristine environment, but nevertheless, we do need to make so much more of north Australia than we have up until now," Mr Abbott said.
The visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of the start of diplomatic relations between Australia and Singapore.

A Pakistani official says the devastating week-long heatwave in the southern port city of Karachi has killed 1233 people.
Nazar Mohammad Bozdar, operations director at the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said on Saturday that 65,000 heatstroke patients were treated at the city's hospitals since June 20 when the heat wave struck Sindh province and its capital, Karachi.
He told The Associated Press that 1923 patients with heat-related ailments are still being treated.
Temperatures in Karachi on Saturday came down to 34C after touching 45C a week ago amid chronic power outages.
The heat wave struck Karachi at a time when the city's Muslim majority was observing the dawn-to-dusk fasting month of Ramadan.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott will spend two days in Singapore, strengthening economic, defence and security ties.
Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb and senior business leaders will join Mr Abbott in the city-state from Sunday to promote Australia as "open for business".
They have invited Singapore's leading investors to a roundtable on investment opportunities in Australia's north, following on from the government's Northern Australia white paper.
Singapore is Australia's sixth-largest source of foreign direct investment and fifth-largest trading partner, with total trade of $30 billion.
"In its 50 years as a nation, Singapore has become a dynamic economic and security partner for Australia," the prime minister said in a statement.
Mr Abbott will meet Singapore's President Tony Tan and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and will join Mr Lee at an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the island's independence.
The visit concludes on Monday afternoon with Mr Abbott delivering the prestigious 35th Singapore Lecture, entitled "Our Common Challenges: Strengthening Security in the Region".

At least 82 people have been killed in widespread flooding in the western Indian state of Gujarat, in the past three days alone, officials say.
Thirty-three people have been killed in Amreli, the district worst-affected the state disaster management authority said on Friday.
At least 4500 people have been affected in the district and another 4121 in Rajkot, it added.
Gujarat's Minister of Water Resources, Vijay Rupani said 13 victims in Amreli died when two houses collapsed due to the flood, reported the Indian Express newspaper.
The Indian army and air force troops are involved in relief operations.
Photos released by the Defence Ministry show Air Force helicopters rescuing people trapped on roof-tops or small islets, to escape overflowing rivers.
According to the ministry, helicopters undertook rescue efforts and distributed nearly six tonnes of food - 15,000 food packets in Amreli alone.
Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel in her official Twitter account appealed to the people "not to panic &amp; co-operate with the administration in its rescue and relief efforts."
"Team Gujarat will complete the relief work in coming 4-5 days to bring back life to normalcy in the affected areas," Patel said.
The state government has announced 400,000 rupees ($A8,143.74) to those who lost family members in the disaster.
It will also distribute cash subsidies over the next few days in the most severely affected areas.
"We have asked local administrations of the affected districts to carry out an extensive survey to determine the loss. We will provide financial aid to those who have lost crops, livestock, houses and other properties as per norms," Gujarat's Health Minister Nitin Patel told India Today on Friday.

Indonesian women who date foreign men must be careful they are not used as drug mules, the country's anti-drugs chief warns.
National Narcotics Board (BNN) chief Anang Iskandar claims Indonesian women are highly susceptible to being lured into crime by the offer of a free trip abroad.
"Don't be reckless in relationships with foreigners," he told reporters in Jakarta at commemorations of International Narcotics Day, as quoted by website jpnn.com.
"Especially when they give the gift of a plane ticket, you just got acquainted with them, dating, it's very tempting, (you) must be careful."
President Joko Widodo used the event on Friday to reaffirm his commitment to his war on drugs, which has involved the executions of 14 people this year.
Of those, 12 were foreigners, including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.
Mr Joko says his approach will broaden to include more international co-operation and crackdowns on prisons, where officials are frequently involved in drug rackets.
"Drug crime can be classified as extraordinary crime," he said, as quoted by detik.com.
"With such a destructive power, there is no other option than declaring war on drugs."
A group of prominent Indonesians wrote in leading health journal The Lancet this month that Mr Joko was favouring a punitive approach over strategies proved to reduce drug-related harm.
They questioned the BNN data underpinning the drugs war policy, saying the finding of 40-50 drug-related deaths daily was gathered in an unorthodox and unreliable manner.
Others have pointed out that while Indonesia executes foreigners for drug offences, it lobbies to save its own citizens from death row abroad.

Killer whales from Antarctic are swimming as far as Northland in New Zealand's north, researchers have found.
Scientists from Canterbury University used photo-identification and Antarctic researchers from Italy used satellite transmitters to track the orcas in the 2014-2015 Antarctic summer.
"Subtle differences in colouration patterns, nicks on the dorsal fin, and scars on the whales body uniquely identify each whale, allowing individual killer whales to be recognised wherever they go," scientists say.
Gateway Antarctica scientist Dr Regina Eisert says the whales feed on prey including Antarctic toothfish and they wanted to determine whether the decline in toothfish posed a risk to the whales.
But the teams hit "research gold" with results independently verifying the killer whales were commuting between Scott Base and the waters off Northland in New Zealand - a distance of more than 4500km.
The photo-ID showed the same whale repeatedly in both places and the satellite data showed the whales swam due north towards New Zealand, she said.
"If Antarctic killer whales roam all the way from Scott Base to the North Island of New Zealand, rather than stay in a relatively confined area as some scientists believe, it crucially changes our understanding of the ecology of these key top predators and the potential threats they may face," Dr Eisert said.
It also suggests there is much greater ecological connectivity between Antarctica and New Zealand than previously thought, she said.
The research is part of a wider study on the Ross Sea ecosystem.

The death toll from a heatwave in southern Pakistan has climbed to 1100 despite a drop in temperature in the worse-hit city of Karachi, officials say, as hospitals, morgues and graveyards struggle to keep pace with the unfolding tragedy.
More than 1,000 people have died in Karachi since the start of Ramadan last week, said Ijaz Afzal, a director at the Health Ministry in the province of Sindh.
On Thursday alone some 200 deaths were reported at hospitals despite a dip in temperatures to 36 degrees Celsius from around 45 Celsius earlier in the week, medics said.
A cool breeze from the Arabian Sea helped lower temperatures from Wednesday evening, said Muhammad Hanif, a director at the Pakistan Metrological Office.
Nearly 80 people died this week in Hyderabad city, which is adjacent to Karachi, said Nafees Qureshi, a district administration official.
Afzal said the toll might rise with more reports coming in to the ministry from hospitals in Karachi and other parts of the province.
The fall in temperatures had eased pressure on hospitals, which were overwhelmed by thousands of patients being driven in by relentless queues of ambulances during the week.
Morgues were at full capacity and bodies were being placed on floors to accommodate the maximum number.
The city's gravediggers said they are not able to keep pace with the burials, despite working overtime this week.

According to the state-run China Daily, customs officials have confiscated over 100,000 tonnes (110,000 tons) of chicken wings, beef, and pork, and arrested gangs across 14 Chinese provinces attempting to sell the contraband.
It was smelly. There was a whole truck of it. I nearly threw up when I opened the door, Zhang Tao, an official that helped with the operation in Hunan province told the paper . Some of the meat had begun to thaw and rot, and some of it was stamped with packaging dates as far back as the 1970s, officials said.
Meat smuggled in from foreign countries via Hong Kong and Vietnam is increasingly making its way into Chinese grocery stores, where consumers cant tell the products age easily when it is frozen. The meat, transported in non-refrigerated trucks and cars, is often repeatedly thawed and refrozen. In Hong Kong, imported meat is subject to surveillance but not usually tested if it is for re-export, government officials said.
Ironically, the Chinese publics growing concern about food safety has driven up demand for foreign meat. Shoppers prefer products from Europe, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand over locally raised animals. (Chinas per capita meat consumption has tripled over the past thirty years.)
This demand, coupled with restrictions on meat imports (US beef is banned) has helped fuel meat smuggling in China. In just the past year, Chinese officials have arrested smugglers transporting meat from the US, Brazil, and Finland . In March, officials arrested smugglers attempting to transport $33 million worth of beef from the United States into the country. Last November, another group was detained for smuggling in 300 tonnes of Brazilian beef.

A make-or-break bid by West Papua's independence movement for diplomatic recognition by leaders of Australia's closest neighbours will dominate a meeting in Honiara this week.

The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) comprising Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonias Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS) will also consider a full membership application by Indonesia.
Outright rejection of the West Papuans by MSG could be a crippling political setback for the freedom movement.
West Papuan groups have been seeking independence from Indonesia since its controversial takeover of the former Dutch colony on the western half of New Guinea in the 1960s.
Hundreds of thousands are estimated to have died in the brutal conflict, with Indonesia accused of human rights abuses.
It will test our commitment to the basic principles of human rights and the rule-of-law which are embedded in the United Nations charter, which the MSG member countries subscribe to, Solomon Islands prime minister and MSG host Manasseh Sogavare told leaders at the opening ceremony.
It is a test of our genuineness to solve a problem between two next-door neighbours, in the interest of regional peace and stability, ultimately it is a test to our claim to civilisation and good corporate citizens of planet Earth.

For the United Liberation Movement of West Papua (ULMWP), an umbrella group seeking independence from Indonesia, MSG membership would be the climax of years of lobbying efforts to secure a seat on an international forum to push their cause.
The last 50 years the world ignored our cry for help and justice and peace, West Papuan leader Benny Wenda told SBS.
Without West Papua, Melanesia is not free, thats why were confident that when West Papua becomes part of the MSG, it will bring peace itself.
We are demanding full membership, but if we are given observer status, we will accept that as a starting point.
Benny Wenda, Jacob Rumbiak, other exiled West Papuan leaders and supporters have held colourful marches in Honiara over the past week to keep the pressure up.
Fiji and PNG are not expected to support membership for West Papuans, while Vanuatu and New Caledonias FLNKS have been long-time backers.
Vanuatus position is now uncertain and its leaders will not be at MSG because of a possible no-confidence motion in parliament this week.

The deciding vote could rest with Solomon Islands, the current chair of the MSG.
Last week prime minister Manasseh Sogavare declared he would support observer status for West Papua but not full membership.
At the official opening of the MSG meeting, he went further.
Let us not forget the dreams of our people to be part of a Melanesian family, the desire of our people to be part of an inclusive MSG, an MSG that will stand for what is right in a world where such values are struggling to survive, Mr Sogavare said in a powerful speech at the opening ceremony.
The MSG leaders will have to weigh respecting Indonesias territorial integrity and maintaining extensive economic relations, especially with PNG and Fiji, against their aim of Melanesian solidarity.
New Caledonias FLNKS pro-independence movement full membership of the MSG is the precedent the West Papuans are counting on.
As observers, West Papua would be on an equal footing with Indonesia, which secured the status in 2011, and East Timor (Leste).
MSG leaders will also consider Indonesias application to upgrade to full membership, supported by PNG and Fiji, in the form of five Papuan provincial governors who it says are its Melanesian minority populations true representatives.
MSG leaders have a full meeting agenda including the Melanesian free trade agreement, fisheries, regional policing, disaster relief after Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu earlier this year and the "MSG 2038 Prosperity for All" regional plan.
The MSG meeting officially opens on Wednesday and leaders will issue a communique on the outcome for West Papua, Indonesia and other issues by Friday.

        <Description>The death toll from a heatwave in southern Pakistan has passed 800 as hospitals struggle to cope with thousands more victims of the soaring temperatures.</Description>
        <MainBody>0
At least 780 people have died in Karachi since Friday.About 50 people have died of heatstroke in other parts of the province as temperatures stayed around 45C.
The heat wave has coincided with severe electricity cuts andthe holy month of Ramadan, when most Muslims do not eat or drinkduring daylight hours. Many of the deaths, among the elderly andpoor in the southern city, were caused by dehydration.
"The heat wave death toll has reached close to the 800 markin the last four days," Anwar Kazmi, a senior official of theprivate charity, the Edhi Foundation, told Reuters.
"We are planning to expand the Edhi morgue to cope with asituation like this in future."
Climate change health risk a 'medical emergency', Lancet experts warn
The threat to human health from climate change is so great that it could undermine the last 50 years of gains in development and global health, experts warned on Tuesday.
The charity runs a network of ambulances, clinics andmorgues to bridge the gaps in an overburdened and poorly fundedpublic health system in the city of 20 million people, home toPakistan's main stock market, central bank and biggest port.
Government health officials did not return calls seekingcomment.
Many of Karachi's wealthy have generators to run airconditioners or are gathering in upscale, air-conditioned mallsto beat the heat, which reached 44 degrees Celsius (111Fahrenheit) over the weekend.

A sea breeze slightly cooled parts of the city on Wednesdaybut rains predicted by weather officials did not arrive.
Many residents are furious with the civilian government overthe electricity cuts and the poor state of the public hospitalstreating many of those who have fainted from the heat.
Public services in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation of 190million people, are starved of resources because almost all itswealthy evade taxes. Fewer than 0.5 percent of citizens payincome tax; many legislators are among the tax dodgers.
The military, which receives the lion's share of the budget,has set up 22 health centres, where it also hands out water andrehydration salts.

TOKYO June 23 AP - A strong earthquake has struck off an island chain south of Tokyo, but there is no danger of a tsunami, officials say.
Japan's Meteorological Agency said on Tuesday the earthquake measured a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 and was very deep, about 480km below the ocean's surface.
The US Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.3.
The Japanese agency said the quake was centred west of the Ogasawara island chain in the Pacific Ocean about 1000km south of Tokyo.
Some islands in the chain were shaken strongly by the quake, but it was hardly felt in Tokyo.
The area was also struck by another extremely deep earthquake on May 31, which also did not trigger a tsunami.
Japan sits along the Pacific "Ring of Fire," the arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanoes are common.

Kiwi start-up I Measure U has launched a $US200,000 crowdfunding campaign on Californian-based platform, Indiegogo, to raise funds to help manufacture its first wearable technology consumer product.
The two-year-old company has developed a sensor that measures human body movement through physiologically based mathematical models and it's hoping to release a consumer product, IMU-Run, in the new year for runners.
It works by the runner strapping the sensor to their ankle to transmit data to their smartphone or smartwatch, providing feedback on their technique while they are running to reduce the risk of injury.
Co-founders Mark Finch and Thor Beisier set up the company in 2013 after the two bio-mechanics won Auckland University's annual Spark challenge.
It landed a $A250,000 two-year contract last year with Athletics Australia to develop wearable solutions for its elite athletes that measure training workloads to reduce the risk of injury and give better training techniques.
It has also been working with Harvard University biomechanist Dr Irene Davis, an expert on barefoot running mechanics, in a pilot study of wearable sensors for the US military.
The campaign pitch says up to 75 per cent of runners experience injury each year, with many such injuries preventable with the right feedback.
The IMU-Run product tracks the only metric scientists correlate with the risk of running injury - impact on the lower leg or tibial shock, it said.
The app will work on android and iphones and has been endorsed by the US-based Runkeeper fitness platform which has more than 30 million users worldwide.
Those who pledge money through Indiegogo receive discounted products as the return on investment.

        <MainBody>0
Drug trafficking charges against a New Zealand man in Bali are flimsy and should be dropped, his lawyer says.
Prosecutors have asked for 18 years' jail for Antony de Malmanche, who says he was tricked into carrying crystal methamphetamine into Bali in December via an online romance.
His lawyer Chris Harno told the court on Tuesday the charges should be dropped and his client released.
"They haven't provided a CCTV record that would support the customs officers," he said.
"Other witness statements are only in clips, or in other words, the prosecutors only found pieces of evidence that would support her sentence request."
Mr Harno said de Malmanche cleared three x-rays in Hong Kong airport and was denied legal and consular help on his arrest in Bali.
"There was no explanation at all from the prosecutor on why she refused to bring the CCTV (to court)," he said.
"We ask the judges to state all charges against the defendant are unproven officially and convincingly."
The prosecution will respond on Thursday.
