        <title>Andrew Coyne: Greeceâ€™s culture of victimhood</title>
        <Link>http://www.vancouversun.com/news/world/Andrew+Coyne+Greece+culture+victimhood/11198817/story.html</Link>
        <Description>The notion that Greece has been brought to its present humiliation, not by its own excesses but by the stupidity and cruelty of its lenders, is by now near-universal</Description>
        <MainBody>

There are many issues at play in the Greek tragedy, but the fundamental thesis being tested is this: do states have a budget constraint? Is there a limit to how much a country can spend and borrow or  as the Syriza government and its academic apologists seem to suggest  is there not?
Had either been around when Greece was first running into debt, the line would have been: relax. Governments arent like households, we owe it to ourselves, and so on. Certainly it would have been told, as its debts mounted, that by no means should it cut spending or reduce its deficit  for that would be contractionary, and besides the risks of bankruptcy werent worth the costs of austerity.
And when at length its debts grew wholly unmanageable, well, we know what the answer is: its debts should be forgiven. The obligation, in the apologist case, is entirely on the creditors, whose reluctance to make absolute reductions in debt, rather than merely make it easier for Greece to repay it, is cast as a blind tyranny, from which Greece must be freed  if not by the usual browbeating and rhetoric (terrorism), then by blackmail: Nice little currency union you have there. Pity if anything should happen to it.
So if a state cannot only spend more than it takes in, year after year, but more than it can ever hope to fund out of its own resources  more, even, than others would willingly lend it  then there really are no limits. Should Greece exit from the euro, at least while Syriza remains in power, I suppose we will see the furthest extension of this, in which it will cover any shortfall simply by printing the money.
The Greek approach has repeatedly been contrasted in media accounts with that of Germany, its largest lender and one of Europes most prosperous states  though not, as you might imagine, to Germanys favour. Germanys insistence that Greece mend its ways, its unwillingness to make new loans, still less forgive the old, without some assurance that Greece will be any more likely to repay the former than it has the latter, is presented as a kind of bizarre fetish, an obtuse cult-worship of balanced budgets.
From which we must conclude that it is Greece, impoverished and indebted as it is, that has pursued the right economic policy and Germany, and others like it, that have it wrong.
The notion that Greece has been brought to its present humiliation, not by its own excesses but by the stupidity and cruelty of its lenders, is by now near-universal. It reflects a peculiarly simplistic view of the economy as merely the sum of its parts  consumption, investment, government spending, the trade balance  with no interplay between them: if government spending goes up, it must add to the gross domestic product; if it goes down, it must subtract. This reductionist focus on aggregates  how much is spent, not how well it is spent  would be misleading enough in itself, but the hydraulic imagery with which it is usually expressed leaves out a rather important element: for governments to inject money into the economy, they must, one way or the other, siphon it out of it.
But never mind. Greeces economy has been contracting, and Greece has been going through austerity. Ergo, it must be because of the austerity. That Greece, like Europes other debtor states, was in scarcely less trouble when it was running massive primary deficits  the fiscal stimulus that, it was widely agreed, was what was required to revive Europes economy after the financial crisis  never seems to come up.
Was there ever an ideology less furnished with actual, real-life examples of success than Keynesianism? Against the multiple examples of its failure  the U.S. in the 1960s, the United Kingdom in the 1970s, France in the 1980s, Japan in the 1990s  its proponents cite but one: the U.S. in the Second World War. Give them that: if the government is prepared to hire every unemployed person to do one thing  fight a war  and the public are willing to do without all the other things those people might have made or done, you can certainly gin up full employment, for the duration. Its just not a particularly useful model in peacetime.
The same objection applies in reverse. Germanys unwillingness to forgive Greek debts  what with its obsession with balanced budgets, and all  has lately been contrasted with Germanys own experience of debt forgiveness, in the 1950s. Well, yes. The rest of Europe was willing to forgive debts that had been incurred building a war machine that had since been entirely dismantled. They were, moreover, willing to forgive the debts of a Germany that was then in the middle of an economic miracle, the product of the currency reform and radical liberalization program overseen by its economic minister, Ludwig Erhard.
That is rather a different situation, I might suggest, than todays Greece: run by Marxists, steeped in a culture of tax evasion and wrapped in the kind of excessive regulation that forbids the selling of bread in convenience stores

One of Quebecs 10 most wanted peoplewas arrested in San Francisco, seven and a half years after a warrant was issued by Canada.
Harinder Singh Cheema from Montreal was wanted in thedeath of his 29-year-oldwife Gurpreet Kaur on Christmas Eve in 2007. He is accused of second-degree murder.
News of his arrest came in a noticeby Montreal police on Wednesday.
Police learned that Cheema, 36, could be in the San Francisco area on June 26 and had been working with the bureau of external affairs from the Directeur des poursuites criminelles et pnales to have him arrested by American authorities.
On Christmas day in 2007, police found Kaursbody beaten, strangled and wrapped in bedsheets on the balcony outside the coupleshome on Deguire St. in St-Laurent. They lived with their small children, who were only threeweeks and 18 months oldat the time.
In the investigation, police discovered that Cheema had been seen leaving the apartmentthe morning of Dec. 24. He dropped off his children dressed in only undershirts under their snowsuits at the home ofKaurs bestfriend.
From there, police said he fled to Toronto, where he stayed with his lover before flying to Vancouver with a ticket she bought for him. Police also said he arrived in Canada ona fake passport while carrying a Russian drivers licence.
On Jan. 10, 2008, a nationwide warrant was issued for his arrest. Interpol issued a worldwide red notice for his arrest. The investigation was even featured that year on Americas Most Wanted, the now-defunct reality crime show.The case appeared on the Fox television show after an appeal by a Montreal detective.
The victim, Kaur, had beenliving in Canadafor four years and was a permanent resident when she was killed. Cheema, an Indian citizen,does not have permanent resident status inCanada.
Kaurhad leftIndia after she was raped by police, who accused her of associating with Sikh terrorists.After Kaursbody was found, herchildren were placed in foster care by child protection services.
Cheema will be extradited to Quebec.

        <title>A man without qualities: Jared Fogle was, and still might be, the perfect Subway spokesman</title>

        <MainBody>A man without qualities: Jared Fogle was, and still might be, the perfect Subway spokesman

By Washington Post July 8, 2015 4:51 PM


Analysis
A man without qualities. A Forrest Gump who goes wherever the day takes him. A Walter Mitty who dreams only of eating Subway sandwiches with no mayonnaise.
There is no shortage of literary and cinematic archetypes that seem a lot like Jared Fogle  until Tuesdays FBI raid at his home, Subways brand-making, drama-free, regular-guy spokesman. Even after the raid  believed to be related to the arrest of a former employee of Fogles foundation on child pornography charges  Fogle, who was not arrested or charged with a crime, stepped aside with no fuss.
Making no fuss, after all, is Fogles trademark.
Subway and Jared Fogle have mutually agreed to suspend their relationship due to the current investigation, a Subway spokesman said in a statement late Tuesday, as The Washington Posts Sarah Larimer and Abby Ohlheiser reported. Jared continues to cooperate with authorities and he expects no actions to be forthcoming. Both Jared and Subway agree that this was the appropriate step to take.
Fogles representatives stressed that Jared has quite an appetite for cooperation.
Jared has been cooperating, and continues to cooperate, with law enforcement in their investigation of unspecified charges, Fogles attorney, Ron Elberger, said in an e-mailed statement to The Post. He has not been detained, arrested or charged with any crime or offense.
Somehow, the FBIs interest in Fogle  why not just call him Jared?  only highlighted the (for now) suspended brand ambassadors fundamental appeal: He is a blank slate. If this pitchman is leading a sordid double life  if he is a Bill Cosby, a Lance Armstrong, a Jerry Sandusky  it wont just be unexpected. It will be a complete shock.
Fogle is comparatively bland, which may be his secret, Will Higgins of the Indianapolis Star wrote in 2008. His persona is friendly, not funny; kindly, not abrasive. His charm is a kind of Johnny Carson-like insipidity that may not excite but wears well over time.
Higgins saw Jareds remarkable unremarkability as key to his success.
Charmins milquetoast Mr. Whipple, remember, hung on for two decades, he wrote.
Jared hasnt hung on quite that long, but he is getting there. Introduced by Subway to the public in 2000, Jared, then a student at the University of Indiana at Bloomington, came to the fast-food chain fully formed: Once tipping the scales at 425 pounds, he lost 245 pounds in 11 months on a self-devised diet that he told virtually no one he was on until his sagging jeans made it obvious. Instead of braying his intention to lose weight to the skies, he took the nobler road of quiet struggle.
I ate a 6-inch turkey sub for lunch and a 12-inch Veggie Delite for dinner, and I had diet soda and a small bag of baked chips or pretzels with each meal, Jared wrote in a 2006 memoir called, appropriately, Jared, the Subway Guy. I never put cheese, mayo, or oil on my sandwiches, just mustard, and I never snacked between meals.
Were Jareds experiment part of a peer-reviewed scientific study, it would be suspect. Jareds results were self-reported; there was no control group; unless Jared tragically regained his weight, nearly tripling his girth, the experiment could not be repeated. Also, as has been pointed out, Jareds success wasnt necessarily related to the healthfulness of Subway meals, but to calorie restriction: He went from eating more than 10,000 calories a day, he wrote, to eating a little over 1,000 calories a day.
But sandwich sellers have no need for scientific studies.
That story played a huge role in (Subways)growth, Mary Chapman, the senior director of product innovation at Technomic, a market research firm, told the Associated Press. The New York Daily News summed up the Jared factor in 2013: After his first national commercial  he has since filmed more than 300  Subways sales shot up 20 percent. Overall, sales more than tripled to $11.5 billion in 2011, from around $3 billion in 1998.
Chapman added: Its not just Jared the man, its what it represents.
Yet Jared the man cant easily be differentiated from Subway. While other brand ambassadors can be hard to manage  Tiger Woods shilled for Hero MotoCorp, but is a former golf superstar who enjoyed the occasional extramarital affair  Jared brings no such baggage to the table. His book and the medias coverage of him before the raid tell a simple story: He was fat as a child, he got thin while eating at Subway in his early 20s, and he has been a Subway spokesman and health advocate ever since. Those who dig will learn a little more: He is Jewish, he has been (quietly) divorced, and he likes Dave Matthews. Even with the failed marriage, there is no O.J. Simpson here.
In a telling moment in his memoir, Jared, a young man still in college getting ready for his first big-time commercial, is sent to wardrobe.
I needed the wardrobe department to supply me with regular guy clothes, which looked pretty much like what I wore all the time, he wrote.
Do not mistake Jareds unrelenting vanilla style or totally unremarkable Twitter account for a lack of intelligence, business acumen or competence. He is reportedly worth $15 million; South Park episodes are written about him; he can work a crowd like Montel Williams or Oprah Winfrey.
But if Jared wants to parlay the fame he stumbled into 15 years ago into something else  an acting career, a talk show, a sponsorship deal with a higher-end brand that didnt once use a weird shoe-elasticity chemical in its bread  that move doesnt seem to be coming. Other food addicts  the late John Candy and Chris Farley, for example  were brilliant artists or performers. Jared is a brilliant . . . brand ambassador.
If Jared was going to transcend his (role as) spokesman at Subway, it would have happened by now, Robert Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, told the Indianapolis Star in 2008.

        <Description>Her lawyer said it sends a message to companies that it&amp;#8217;s necessary to pay attention to human beings, even when technology is used to make repeated calls</Description>
        <MainBody>

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan ordered Time Warner Cable Inc. to make the $229,500 payment to Araceli King of Irving, Texas, citing the New York-based companys particularly egregious behaviour as it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.
NEW YORK  A federal judge sent a message on Tuesday when he awarded nearly US$230,000 to a Texas woman, finding that a cable company crossed the line when it harassed her with 153 robocalls even after she complained about the wrong numbers.
U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan ordered Time Warner Cable Inc. to make the US$229,500 payment to Araceli King of Irving, Texas, citing the New York-based companys particularly egregious behaviour as it violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.
King sued last year, saying she had repeatedly asked the company to stop making the calls.
Susan Leepson, a Time Warner spokeswoman, said the company is reviewing its options and determining how to proceed.
Hellerstein said he tripled the US$1,500 penalty for each call because Time Warners actions were particularly egregious since it continued making the calls even after King complained in a seven-minute phone conversation in October 2013 with a company representative that the calls to her phone were apparently meant for a customer she did not know. The judge noted that 74 of the calls were made after Time Warner received a copy of Kings lawsuit in March 2014.
The companys recurring theme in its legal arguments was that it was an unwitting victim of an unpredictable federal law that was not intended to turn an innocuous call to a wrong number into large damages, the judge said.
The responsible company will reduce its exposure dramatically by taking proactive steps to mitigate damages, while its competitor, who unthinkingly robo-dials the same person hundreds of time over many months without pausing to wonder why it cannot reach him, cannot complain about much higher liability, the judge wrote.
Kings lawyer, Sergei Lemberg, said his client is delighted. He said the decision sends a message to consumers to stop taking it on the chin when robocalls dont stop and a message to companies that its necessary to pay attention to human beings, even when technology is used to make repeated calls.
Millions of U.S. consumers get robocalls. Only a few of them take it a step forward and get a lawyer, the Stamford, Connecticut, attorney said.

        <MainBody>Glavin: In Canada, an embarrassing foreign policy debate

By Terry Glavin, Ottawa Citizen July 8, 2015



OTTAWA - May 30, 2013 - (L-R) Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, prime minister Stephen Harper and NDP leader Tom Mulcair debate each other in the House of Commons during the week of May 27, 2013. For 0531-col-Den-Tandt ORG XMIT: POS1305301530472063
With voter support for the New Democratic Party surging to heights not seen since the 1980s and the prospect of a tight three-way race in Octobers elections emerging as something wholly new to the alchemy of campaign strategies, the one thing thats showing no signs of any change at all is the pathetic unseriousness of this countrys debates about foreign policy.
The histrionics over that lurid Conservative Party electioneering advertisement  the one that targeted Liberal leader Justin Trudeau against a backdrop of stills from a jihadist snuff video  is a particularlyembarrassing case in point. Even a profound rupture in global security and an unfolding human tragedy of colossal, historic proportions will get reduced, in Canadian federal politics, to a low contest of cartoonishlyobtuse and parochial talking points.
First, heres whats happening in the real world.
The mass atrocities that continue to be inflicted upon the people of Iraq and Syria beggar the imagination. The response of the United Nations, the United States and the NATO countries, Canada included, has been to deliberately and consistently replicatethe alibis that gave succour to the mass murderers of the 1990s in Kosovo and Bosnia  where help came too late for at least 100,000 innocents  and in Rwanda, where a genocide carried off 800,000 people and rescue never came at all.
In Iraq, about 40,000 people have been killed since December of 2011, when President Barack Obama formally declared victory and ended the American military mission in that country. Thats nearly twice the Iraqi death toll from Obamas first four years in office. The primary butchers are the human-abattoir pornographers of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), headquartered in their Syrian redoubt at Raqqa. Iraqsbarbaric Iranian-aligned Shia militias come in a very close second.
In Syria, at least 300,000 people have been killed since 2011, when the tyrant Bashar al-Assad responded to a democratic uprising by waging war on his own people and seeing to it that ISIL was free to carry out massacres in any pockets of Syrian resistance beyond his immediate grasp, and free as well to spread its mayhem into Iraq. More than three million Syrians are refugees. Another 12 million  more than half the countrys remaining population  are in dire need of humanitarian help.
Assad and his Iranian Quds Force and Hezbollah allies are the guiltiest culprits in all this, by far.Almost every day, entire neighbourhoods, towns and villages are being blasted into oblivion as Assads air force rains down crude barrel bombs,packed with gasoline, dynamite, nails, scrap iron and chlorine gas. Syriasancient city of Aleppo now looks just like London during the blitz.
What everybody knows full well is that to stop the war, first you have to stop Assads bombing. Everybody also knows that to impose and enforce a no-fly zone, with or without the consent of the Russian and Chinese veto holders on the UN Security Council,is also the right thing to do. Its the only effective anti-war remedy.But in Canada, to even admit this out loud is to stand accused of being pro-war, whichbrings us to the funhouse mirror in which the real world is reflected back upon Canadas federal politics.
While Stephen Harpers Conservatives insist that their foreign policy is distinguished by a principled refusal to simply go along to get along, going along to get along has ended up being the only thing the Conservatives can claim for Canadas contribution to the U.S.-led coalition carrying out bombing runs on ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq. Were standing with our allies. Were going along to get along.
In the real world, everybody knows that U.S. PresidentBarack Obama isnt interested in stopping thewar, because to do so would require an effort that would unavoidably complicate his nuclear rapprochement with Tehran, Assads primary sponsor. So Canada goes along to get along by providing the American-run effort in Syria and Iraq with a half-dozen F-18s and a few dozen special operations troops. At the moment, this may well be all Canada can do to stop at least some of the slaughter. So long as ISIL targets are getting hit hard from the air, at least the Kurds of Iraq and Syria are benefitting from a bit of breathing space.
But even after Kosovo, Bosnia and Rwanda, the minor contribution the Conservatives are making still goes too far for a great many Canadians, and Thomas Mulcair is savvy enough to know how to pander to Quebecs rednecks and reactionary isolationists in a way that requires only a slight repackaging to appearas though hes forwarding a presentably progressive and anti-war policy to more delicate anglophone voters.
Mulcair is too clever by half to allow his cynicism to be easily exposed, butJustin Trudeau is another thing altogether. So there was Trudeau on CBCs Power and Politics, unable to explain against whom, if not even the savage marauders of ISIL, he might ever deploy the Canadian Forces, and calling CBC veteran Terry Milewskis perfectly sensible question nonsensical. Trudeau referred to CanadasCF-15 bombing mission (the aircraft are known as CF-18s) and referred to the Canadian Forces troops in Kurdistan as JTF, by which he appears to have meant Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2), when in the real world those soldiers are in any case from the Canadian Special Operations Regiment.
Some deft editing to make Trudeau sound even sillier, some gruesome background imagery and jihadist mood music and hey presto, a Conservative Hes Just Not Ready campaign ad. Then the CBC demands that YouTube and Facebook pull the video on the basis of a transparently lame copyright argument. Then the Conservatives make themselves look ridiculous with the defence that their advertisement was more truthful than the news medias reporting of ISIL. Before you know it, the spin has bent itself into a debate about whether the Conservatives have violated their own anti-terror law by using ISIL footage for propaganda purposes.
This is not the way a serious country should address itself to deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents, the agonies of millions of Arabs, Kurds, Yazidis, and Assyrians, the abdication of the United Nations from every solemn convention it has ever adopted on the subject of war crimes and crimes against humanity and the most promiscuous use of poison gas since the First World War.
But its the way its done in Canadian politics, and its probably going to keep getting worse until polls close October 19.

In his final instruction to the U.S. Armed Forces, retiring Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey has advised Americans to prepare for some very long wars against real and potential adversaries that may not be fought on conventional battlefields.
The message was couched as an update to the National Military Strategy and does not contain a lot that is new to seasoned Pentagon-watchers, but it is a hard-headed appraisal that the world is entering a period of prolonged violent instability for which the U.S. has to adjust its focus to seriously increased complexity and to comparatively decreased freedom of action.
As farewell testaments go, this may not have quite the same ring to it as either President Dwight D. Eisenhowers warning against the military-industrial complex, or Augustuss final advice to Tiberius not to further expand the Roman Empire, but it might have a better chance of being listened to.
Dempsey is neither emperor nor president, but he does seem to have had a conversion on the road to Damascus in the year since ISIL swarmed into Iraq, when he was musing about a major ground commitment. Thankfully, that hasnt happened.
ISIL is still there and still a threat, though not as invincible as purported; in its heartland of Northern Mesopotamia, it is making advances but also suffering setbacks. Its ability to withstand the air campaign is due at least as much to the coalitions reticence over collateral damage as to any effective countermeasures of its own, though in the past week there have been increasingly heavy airstrikes around strategic (and populated) locations in Syria.
Media reports tend to inflate ISIL achievements; about two weeks ago, it threw a small force into Kobane which the Kurds eradicated. It (deliberately) inflicted heavy civilian casualties, but if ISIL had been able to hold Kobane, they would have held it. It was a flashy diversion from a far more serious three-way battle further east around al-Hasakah.
The activities of the assorted ISIL franchises elsewhere are another conversation, but its worth noting that a Caliphate is not a hamburger franchise. Brand is something, but command-and-control is everything, and there is little evidence that Raqqa has it. What they do have is a template: religion, kinetics and stupefying brutality.Politicized terror does work (as Stalin knew very well); it can also be horribly seductive. And everybody loves a bandwagon.
One snapshot of the chaos in Mesopotamia will serve to illustrate why Dempsey is right about avoiding involvement on the ground in strength. In mid-May, Ramadi in Anbar Province was captured by a comparatively small ISIL force. It was another military embarrassment for Baghdad, but Iraqi troops fled only after substantial elements of their elite forces had taken the brunt of fighting for more than a year and were worn out.
However that may be, Baghdad is now faced with a simple but difficult proposition: They have Ramadi surrounded on three sides, but they are not able to attack at the moment. When they do attack, they cannot do it without Shia militias (Anbar is Sunni) and coalition airpower. As seen in Tikrit, those two forces do not play well together, face-saving devices to the contrary notwithstanding.
But theres a far worse problem. Ramadi was a city of about half a million. An estimated 250,000 civilians remain there, while Tikrit was nearly empty. Any attempt to retake Ramadi by siege or by assault will almost certainly result in a bloodbath that will trivialize any collateral damage that Westerners can possibly imagine inflicting.
Now, imagine it with our ground troops involved.

        <title>In Greeceâ€™s new economic order, Chanel is more valuable than cash</title>
        <Link>http://www.vancouversun.com/news/world/Greece+economic+order+Chanel+more+valuable+than+cash/11197467/story.html</Link>
        <Description>For one woman, the previously unthinkable luxury of a designer handbag is now an investment, a tangible possession that the government cannot take away</Description>
        <MainBody>

A designer handbag is a luxury one woman never would have allowed herself before the banks shut down. But now she considers it an investment, a tangible possession that the government cannot take away.
ATHENS  In Greeces new economic order, Chanel is becoming more valuable than cash.
Banks in this Mediterranean nation have been shut down for more than a week and are just days away from running out of money. Many Greeks worry that at least some of their hard-earned deposits could vanish even under the best outcome of renewed negotiations between the countrys leaders and its creditors over a bailout package.
Even those who have hoarded cash fear that the value of the euro will plummet, or that a return to the drachma could leave them stranded with the wrong currency.
And so 48-year-old Sophia Marcoulakis is considering converting her cash into something more stable: a designer handbag.
Its a luxury the mother of two never would have allowed herself before the banks shut down. But now she considers it an investment, a tangible possession that the government cannot take away.
You have a feeling that money has lost its value, said Marcoulakis, a corporate lawyer. Its just a number.
Such is the level of distrust among Greeks of their own banking system, a crisis of confidence that only further weakens financial institutions already on life support. It exemplifies the challenge that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras faces in restoring credibility, not only with skeptical European creditors but also among a deeply divided public traumatized by years of austerity.
Residents began pulling their money out of Greek banks in January after the leftist political party Syriza won parliamentary elections and swept into office with promises to stand firm against the harsh spending cuts demanded by Greeces creditors in return for fresh aid. The showdown between Athens and the rest of Europe intensified at the end of last month, and banks enacted strict limits on withdrawals and transfers abroad to prevent any more money from leaving the country.
Electronic debit transactions are still allowed, but some stores have stopped accepting them. Credit card purchases on Amazon and iTunes are prohibited. Greeks can withdraw only 60 euros a day in cash from banks, the equivalent of about $84.
Many residents worry that its only a matter of time  perhaps just days  before Greece turns into Cyprus circa 2013. Then, the debt-laden island forced residents and businesses to give up 47.5 percent of deposits above 100,000 euros held in local banks in exchange for funding from Europe. To prevent a run on the financial system, Cypriots were allowed to access only 300 euros a day and to charge up to 5,000 euros on their credit cards each month.
The question for many Greeks these days becomes whether to spend money now or watch it vanish into thin air later.
If they want to take some of my money, let me spend it first
For Chris Dako the answer is simple: Buy now. Since the bank closures, the 25-year-old waiter is paid in cash daily. And on Tuesday, he planned to turn that money into a new pair of shoes.
What shoes? he asked with a smile. The best.
Specifically, sneakers that will set him back 185 euros. He intends to spend up to 500 euros as a hedge against his funds that are now trapped inside his bank account.
If they want to take some of my money, let me spend it first, Dako said.
Of course, many Greeks have little money  in the bank or elsewhere. Estimates for the percentage of the population living in poverty range as high as 44 percent. Greek media reported that between 40,000 and 50,000 workers were fired or suspended after the banks shut down. Many are unable to pay their bills and are using their cash for necessities such as food.
Wealthier Greeks, meanwhile, are storing their money in more traditional safe havens. Kostas Theodoropoulos, former head of investment at Eurobank Asset Management, estimated that 40 percent of withdrawals were simply transferred to foreign bank accounts. Another 10 percent or so were invested in mutual funds domiciled in Luxembourg, he said, and the remaining 50 percent of withdrawals were stuffed under the mattress.
Several Greeks said they were using that mattress money to pay off debt or other bills ahead of time to avoid a cash crunch later. And though having a secret money stash at home is common in Greece, many said the amount has increased. One family hid theirs in the freezer, next to the steaks.
Car sales in Greece, including sales of luxury vehicles, surged this spring even as the nation marched toward defaulting on its loans. Though official data attributes the rise to turnover in rental car fleets, some commentators suggested that Greeks would rather buy cars than hold money in the banks. Similar spikes in car sales were reported in the months before Cyprus and Russia instituted banking restrictions.
Before the financial freeze, customers lined up at Nikias in the wealthy Kolonaki neighborhood of Athens to sell their jewels and Rolex watches in return for cash. But over the past week, the shops owner said he has had 20 to 30 calls interested in the opposite exchange.
The owner, who declined to give his name, said the callers wanted to buy gold coins and kilo bars  the most expensive items his store carries. But he no longer accepts electronic bank transfers because he is worried about a potential loss on deposits himself.
Then we would be the ones to have the problem, he said.
So his shop is stuck in a Catch-22: He will take only cash, but none of his customers can access enough to purchase his goods.
Everyone is on hold, he said.

Composite image of girl found in trash bag on a beach viewed a staggering 45 million times on Facebook

By The Associated Press July 8, 2015



This flyer released Thursday, July 2, 2015, by the Suffolk County Massachusetts District Attorney includes a computer-generated composite image depicting the possible likeness of a young girl, whose body was found on the shore of Deer Island in Boston Harbor on June 25, inside a bag that also contained a black and white zebra-print blanket.
In her computer-generated image, she is the picture of innocence: a 4-year-old girl with long brown hair, chubby cheeks and expressive brown eyes. The image has attracted a staggering 45 million views on Facebook as investigators try to identity the child whose remains were found on a Boston Harbor beach nearly two weeks ago.
The mystery of Baby Doe began on June 25, when a woman walking her dog on the western shore of Deer Island called 911 and reported finding a trash bag containing the girls body. The child was wearing white leggings with black polka dots. Inside the bag with her remains was a zebra-print blanket.
Police immediately appealed to the public for help in identifying the girl. Using photos of her remains, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a composite image of what the girl may have looked like when she was alive.
After that image and photos of the leggings and blanket were posted on the Massachusetts State Police Facebook page, investigators were astonished by the number of views and shares the posting received. As of late Tuesday, more than 45.4 million people had viewed the image.
But authorities still havent identified the girl.
It has by far shattered our previous record for Facebook views, said Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley, whose office is overseeing the investigation.
Adding to the mystery is that investigators still havent been able to figure out how she died. There were no obvious signs of trauma to her body, and an autopsy performed by the state medical examiners office did not determine the manner or cause of her death.
Conley said Tuesday that authorities are awaiting the results of toxicology tests to determine if the girl was poisoned or ingested drugs.
She weighed 30 pounds and was about 3 feet tall. Her body was reasonably intact, but had a modest amount of decomposition. Authorities wont say how long they believe she had been dead by the time her remains were discovered.
They also dont know if the girl lived in Massachusetts or came from another state. They will not say whether the trash bag containing her body washed up on shore or was left on the beach by someone.
Investigators have received dozens and dozens of tips from the public, and those leads have prompted police to check on the well-being of 20 girls in the same age range. All of those girls were found safe and sound.
Conley said the outpouring of support by people who have shared the girls image on social media is gratifying and gives him confidence that her identity eventually will be determined.
During a news conference Tuesday, Conley spoke directly to the girls parents or caretakers: Please step forward, clear your conscience and help us identify this young child.
Conley would not elaborate on whether the childs parents or caretakers are a focus of the investigation and said authorities dont know if the girls death was an accident or a crime.
Her death and the mystery surrounding her identity has touched a chord in many people. State police say their Facebook posting on the girl has received more than 10 times the views of their previous highest post. People from Maine to California, Canada and Puerto Rico have shared the posting, with many of them expressing sorrow or anger over the girls death.
How can someone just throw a child away? wrote one woman from Arizona.
This is just horrible, no one is missing this little angel! wrote another woman from Clovis, California.
Barbara Smith, 67, of Missoula, Montana, said she has shared the girls image three times and plans to share it again and again until investigators figure out who she was and how she died.
Im about to become a great-grandmother, so it just touches you, she said in a telephone interview. Its sad that there was a little girl out there of her age that was found by herself and nobody has claimed her.
State police spokesman David Procopio said investigators are grateful to the public for caring about this little innocent.
But we continue our request for leads, he said.
We need people to continue to look at her and think about her and let us know if anything in their memory clicks.

Questions are being raised over why the Conservative government waited until the last week of the FIFA Womens World Cup to sanction a Russian gas company that was one of the soccer tournaments largest sponsors.
State-controlled Gazprom was among 14 Russian organizations added to Canadas sanctions list on June 29 in retaliation for Russias annexation of Crimea and support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The list also included a Russian separatist group, a motorcycle club and a number of weapons manufacturers.
The move came as Gazproms logo was being splashed across stadiums in Edmonton, Moncton, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg and Vancouver as one of the Womens World Cup tournaments five largest top-tier sponsors. The others were Coca-Cola, Adidas, Hyundai and Visa.
It also came more than nine months after the U.S. added Gazprom to its own sanctions list. The European Union, with which Canada and the U.S. have been co-ordinating sanctions against Russia, has targeted some of Gazproms subsidiaries, but not the main company itself.
Asked about the timing of the sanctions, Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholsons spokeswoman Julie Di Mambro said: We make foreign policy decisions when the government believes it is the right time to act.
Di Mambro did not respond when asked whether the government would be investigating to see if the sanctions had been broken during the World Cup. She referred further questions, including whether FIFA was consulted or notified before the sanctions were imposed, to the world soccer body.
Trade lawyer John Boscariol, an expert on Canadas sanctions regime at McCarthy Tetrault, said its unlikely any rules were broken as the measures against Gazprom are about as soft as you can get. Unlike those that forbid all financial transactions, the sanctions against Gazprom ban only certain loans to and from the company.
So in some ways, I guess what youre saying is we dont want you to support Gazprom through financing, Boscariol said. But otherwise you can deal with them.
The government has been extremely secretive with how and why it adds certain individuals, companies and groups to its sanctions list. Boscariol described it as a bit of a black hole, with officials citing national security and other reasons not to divulge any information on the process.
The Conservative government has been extremely critical of Russia over Ukraine, and Boscariol said Canada has been aggressive when it comes to sanctions. But he suggested theres also some politicking involved, as the government has largely failed to highlight the different types of sanctions.
The Russian Embassy in Ottawa has described the latest sanctions as counterproductive, and called on Canada to reverse this confrontational course that leads nowhere and bring back common sense, pragmatism and diplomacy.
NDP foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar questioned why the government didnt sanction Gazprom along with the U.S. last year, and said it missed an opportunity to really put some pressure on Russia by refusing to take any action until the FIFA womens soccer tournament was almost over.
It shows chaos, confusion, a lack of comprehension about what their policy is, said Dewar, who saw Gazproms logo while attending several World Cup games in Ottawa. If their plan was to wait until FIFA was over, they didnt do that. If their plan was to have an effect, they would have announced it long before FIFA.
Dewar said he finds it hard to believe the government and FIFA didnt have some type of discussions before the tournament, and concededthe pushback the government may have felt from the soccer body.
But he noted the government also said it wouldnt let business interests interfere in Canadas response to Ukraine, before sparing several Russian officials with ties to Bombardier and the oil sands who had been sanctioned by the U.S.
It continues to be a policy that is more about hot rhetoric than an effective, clear strategy when it comes to targeted sanctions, Dewar said.

        <Description>Nedzad Avdic felt the blood of the previous victims sticking to his bare feet as he walked with his hands tied behind his back toward the exit of a school to be shot</Description>
        <MainBody>

In this photo taken. Saturday, June 27, 2015, Srebrenica massacre survivor Nedzad Avdic, 37, walks through the graves of those killed in the massacre and buried at the Memorial Center in the Srebrenica suburb of Potocari, 150 kilometers northeast of Sarajevo.
Nedzad Avdic felt the blood of the previous victims sticking to his bare feet as he walked with his hands tied behind his back toward the exit of a school to be shot.
The voices of hundreds of other male Muslim Bosnians from Srebrenica echoed from the classrooms as the soldiers demanded that the prisoners chant Srebrenica was and always will be Serb! as gunfire killed them one by one outside.
It was 17-year-old Avdics turn to become one of the 8,000 men and boys killed after the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica fell to Serb forces. As the 20th anniversary of the carnage of July 11-13, 1995, approached, Avdic decided he needed to speak out publicly.
I just wanted it to be quick, Avdic, now 37, told The Associated Press at the school in the village of Petkovci, where Serb troops brought him and other men caught as they tried to flee Srebrenica.
From the 15,000 men and boys who headed over the mountains toward government-held territory, the Serbs hunted down 6,000 and detained 2,000 others who had surrendered immediately. They were then shot at various sites around the town. The slaughter was the worst massacre in Europe since World War II.
As Avdic stepped out of the school and waited for his turn to face the firing squad, he said he saw piles of bodies lying in the heat.
Suddenly the soldiers changed their minds and loaded him and others onto a truck and took them to another site to be shot. As they were taking the men off in groups of five and lined them up in front of the firing squad, Avdic hid behind other men on the back of the truck just to live for a few seconds more, he remembers.
I just wanted it to be quick
It was his turn again. He felt the sharp stones under his feet as he jumped out and lined up.
The rattle of gunfire started up again, and he fell face down on the stones, but still felt the pain. He was shot. But not dead.
For hours, Avdic lay motionless among a pile of bodies, listening to killings deep into the night. I was bleeding and waiting to die, he said.
When another truck left and it became silent, he lifted his head. Something was moving a few rows of bodies in front of him. The other survivor spotted him too and asked him to come and untie him. Avdic couldnt walk but rolled himself over and the two men chewed on each others ropes to free their hands.
Covered by darkness, they sneaked over the bodies into a nearby forest before the next truck arrived. The other survivor, who Avdic says doesnt want to be identified, tore his shirt and bandaged Avdics wounds. In the morning, the two crawled up the hill and took another look down on the killing field. Backhoes were loading the dead bodies on trucks which then drove away.
For four days and nights the two men kept moving, looking for government-held territory. Avdic was crawling and his companion was moving ahead of him and clearing the path to make it easier. He begged the survivor to leave him to die but the man begged him back to keep going. The man brought him water in his shoe.
On a Serb graveyard the two found an open bottle of Coca-Cola near a freshly dug grave. They drank it together with the ants in it.
The two never noticed when they crossed the front line, but they eventually reached a Muslim village and emerged from the woods, bloody and exhausted.
He passed out again as a bunch of people were giving him water. But he knew: He survived.

Hello and welcome to montrealgazette.com and welcome to Midday. Heres the rundown on some of the stories were following for you today.
Greece made a request for aid from Europes bailout fund Wednesday as it rushed to deliver details of its proposed economic reforms in time to secure the countrys future in the euro and avoid a descent into financial chaos.The government has asked for a three-year loan program and insisted the rescue will be accompanied by major economic reforms. No amount was mentioned.According to the letter sent to the European Stability Mechanism, Athens said it would immediately implement a set of measures as early as the beginning of next week.Those include tax and pension reforms, details of which will be presented Thursday at the latest. Those are two of the issues that divided the Greek government and creditors over the past few months of protracted discussions.
Quebecs anti-corruption squad is conducting searches and talking to individuals at four locations in Montreal, Sherbrooke and communities around Sherbrooke on Wednesday morning.The searches, which are being carried out by 60 investigatorsat businesses and residences, are related to an ongoing investigation by the Unit permanente anticorruption, or UPAC, into the city of Montreals canceled $355.8-million water-management contract, which an audit report in 2009 confirmedirregularitiesin the tendering process.The report, by city auditor-general Jacques Bergeron,led city hall to terminate the deal with the consortium GNIeau.The target of the searches on Wednesday is the company Le GroupeS.M. Inc., a source told the Montreal Gazette.
The renovated Cabot Square will officially open Wednesday at a ceremony attended by Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre.The park has been closed since last June while it underwent  a $6.3-millionrenovation as part of downtown Ville-Marie boroughs plan to redevelop Ste-Catherine St.between Concordia University and Atwater Ave.The renovations include wider sidewalks, better lighting, new benches, and a renovated vespasienne, as well as space for cultural activities.
Anew group that says it will use the courts to defend the environment in Canada plans to fire its opening salvo at the city of Montreal and its projectto allow high-densityresidential development on a vast natural space in western Pierrefonds. Montreal lawyer Campbell Stuart said hewillfile an injunction against the city, the Montreal Metropolitan Community and a developerin Quebec Superior Court on Wednesday morning on behalf of the new organization, which is called Legacy Project (or Projetgnration in French), and a Pierrefonds resident.The object of the injunction request is to have a judge recognize the protected agricultural zoning of a nearly 20-hectare parcel of land that slices through a 180-hectare area of natural space where the administration of Mayor Denis Coderrehas declared its intention to allow the development of 5,000 to 6,000 homes. The zone is besideanother 180-hectare areaof natural space further west and close to the border between Pierrefonds and Senneville thatthe administration says it willconserve as an eco-territory.
And finally, when English poet John Milton wrote of Time, the subtle thief of youth in the 17th century, he probably wasnt thinking of a high school reunion. But if youve ever been to such an event, Miltons words may have crossed your mind as you walked around the room shaking hands with classmates who had become bald and fat before their time and those who looked like they hadnt aged a day since you last saw them.A team of researchers led by Duke University assistant professor Daniel Belsky believes that some of the secrets to the aging process may lie in understanding the phenomenon of why people grow old at such differing rates. By slowing down the aging process we could prevent not just one disease but many simultaneously, Belsky, a researcher at Dukes Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development , said.

        <title>â€˜The new vestige of racism': Republicans fight for Confederate flag at South Carolina House</title>
        <Link>http://www.vancouversun.com/news/world/vestige+racism+Republicans+fight+Confederate+flag+South/11197410/story.html</Link>
        <Description>Rep. Mike Pitts said banishing all Confederate flags at the South Carolina House would be equal to erasing history</Description>
        <MainBody>

COLUMBIA, S.C. The Confederate flag that flies at the South Carolina Capitol could soon be making its last stand.
The South Carolina House will begin debating the flags fate Wednesday. If House members back a Senate bill to take the flag down, Gov. Nikki Haley could sign it into law before the end of the week and the flag would be removed and taken to the Confederate Relic Room.
But some House Republicans are saying not so fast, and plan to offer amendments that would preserve some kind of symbol in front of the Statehouse to honour their Southern ancestors.
One of them, Rep. Mike Pitts, said to banish all flags from the site would be akin to erasing history, including that of his family members in Laurens County and the mountains of North Carolina and Virginia.
I guess my plan for tomorrow is to be a lot like my ancestors were at the Bloody Angle, Pitts said, referring to part of a Virginia battlefield where fighting raged for nearly 24 hours in 1864, leaving Confederate dead stacked four deep behind their fortifications. And fight until I have nothing left to fight with.
I guess my plan for tomorrow is to be a lot like my ancestors were at the Bloody Angle. And fight until I have nothing left to fight with.
Pitts said his favourite amendment proposes flying the flag of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers regiment, a blue banner similar to the state flag with its Palmetto tree and crescent moon but with a wreath around the tree. Similar art is etched on a wall inside the Statehouse, Pitts said.
Pitts didnt share all his amendments Tuesday, but The Associated Press was able to obtain copies of the more than two dozen proposals.
One would allow a popular vote to determine the flags future. Another would allow the rebel banner to fly only on Confederate Memorial Day in May, and a third proposal would replace the Confederate battle flag with a different banner.
Other amendments appear more like parodies than serious alternatives to the Senate bill: One would fly the United States flag upside down above the Statehouse dome, and another would remove all of the monuments at the Statehouse, regardless of whether they honour Confederates.
Any change to the Senate bill is unacceptable to the 46 Democrats in the 124-member House  a critical number because some Democrats will have to support any bill to take down the flag to reach the two-thirds threshold required by law, Minority Leader Todd Rutherford said.
Rutherford said any flag that goes up beside the monument to Confederate soldiers will be the new vestige of racism.
If the House amends the Senate bill, the Senate will have to agree with the changes or lawmakers will have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, possibly delaying action for weeks. Several senators said the lopsided 36-3 final vote on the flag shows they do not want their bill to change.
As strong as the support was, it would be absolutely foolish to attempt to amend the Senate bill, Republican Sen. Larry Martin said.
If the two sides cant reach an agreement, or the House rejects the Senate bill, the flag debate would likely be dead for this year.
To stress the Senates unity after Tuesdays vote, senators invited the widow of their slain colleague, Clementa Pinckney, to the floor. She stood just inside the door in a black dress, only a few feet from her husbands desk, which was draped in black cloth with a single white rose on top. Every member stood as she entered and later walked up to her, offering condolences.
She wanted to show her gratitude, state Sen. Gerald Malloy said. As you can see, Clementa shined on her as well. His grace is contagious. It is contagious throughout this state.
In addition to being a state senator, Clementa Pinckney was the pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. He and eight parishioners were fatally shot during a Bible study in the church on June 17. The suspect appeared in photos brandishing the Confederate flag as a symbol of hate.
Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard contributed to this report.

        <MainBody>Ukranian military pilot Nadia Savchenko now stands accused of murder of two Russian journalists

By The Telegraph July 8, 2015



Ukrainian airforce officer Nadezhda (Nadia) Savchenko reacts inside a defendants' cage as she attends a hearing at the Basmanny district court in Moscow on March 4, 2015. Savchenko, 34, now stands accused of the murder of two Russian journalists, investigators in Moscow have said.
Russian investigators have upgraded the charges against Nadia Savchenko, the Ukrainian helicopter pilot jailed in Russia, as her lawyers said they expected her trial to begin this summer.
Savchenko, 34, now stands accused of the murder of two Russian journalists, investigators in Moscow have said.
She was previously charged with complicity in the deaths of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin, two employees of Russias state owned VGTRK television holding who died while covering the war in Ukraine last year.
They have toughened the charges  the prosecutors have changed their concept, Ilya Novikov, one of Savchenkos defence lawyers, said on Tuesday.
Savchenko, a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army and the countrys first female combat pilot, was captured by pro-Russian separatists while fighting alongside the Aidar volunteer battalion near the city of Luhansk on June 18 last year. Russian prosecutors say she subsequently voluntarily crossed the border and attempted to seek asylum in Russia, where she was arrested and charged with acting as a spotter for a mortar attack that killed Kornelyuk and Voloshin on the same day.
The new charges were announced as investigators moved to bring the case to trial after a year of pre-trial detention. Russias chief investigator said on Monday that the investigation had been completed and had been sent to prosecutors for confirmation of the indictment before submission to a court for consideration.
Vladimir Markin, the head of Russias powerful Investigative Committee, said Savchenkos case had been made part of a broader criminal investigation into acts of genocide and use of illegal weapons and methods of warfare by the Ukrainian armed forces.
No date has yet been set for the trial, but Mark Feygin, another of Savchenkos defence team, said on he believed prosecutors were under pressure from the Kremlin.
Savchenko maintains that she had nothing to do with the deaths of the journalists, was captured a full hour before the mortar strike that killed them, and that she was transported across the border against her will by Russian intelligence officers.
The case has made Savchenko a cause celebre in Ukraine, where she was elected as an MP in absentia at parliamentary elections in November.
In March Petro Poroshenko, the president, made her a Hero of Ukraine  the countrys highest honour.

Buddhist monks attend a conference about the religious violence that has shaken the country at a monastery on the outskirts of Yangon on June 13, 2013.  Buddhist monks from across Myanmar gathered to explore ways to ease religious tensions, after some of them  were implicated in attacks on Muslims. Deadly unrest -- mostly targeting Muslims -- has laid bare deep divides in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and clouded major political reforms since military rule ended two years ago.

In an opinion piece published June 17 ( Its not fair to blame violence on religion ), Paul Allen, an associate professor of theological studies at Concordia University, seeks to refute what he calls the mythof religious violence.
I learned of Allens articleafter speaking at a conference held on June 16 on Religion, Violence and the Ethics of Biblical and Religious Studies at Concordia University. The event, organized by Andr Gagn, also an associate professor of theological studies at the same institution, was co-sponsored by the departments of Religion and Theological Studies.The conferencewas meant to highlight new scholarship on the issue.
I was invited to be the keynote speaker because of my book, Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence (2005) and many other publications in this area of research. In my work, I repeatedly have addressed the claim that the role of religion in violence is mostly illusory.
In my view, Allenis wrong in suggestingthatnew scholarship has established the mythical nature of religious violence.
Allen cites as examples the work of William T. Cavanaugh and Karen Armstrong.
In The Myth of Religious Violence (2009) Cavanaugh argues that religion should not be blamed for violence because it is too entwined with politics, economics and other cultural components. Cavanaugh claims that the modern secularizing state is mainly responsible for artificially separating religion from other aspects of the culture.
But some ancient texts show that separating out religion as a motive for violence preceded the modern state. For example, one ancient report (hadith) of the teachings of Muhammad remarks:   a person who participates in (holy battles) in Allahs Cause and nothing causes him to do so except belief in Allah and in His Messenger  will be recompensed by Allah  (Book of Belief, 26; Shahih Al-Bukhari; Darrussalam edition).
Indeed, Islamic scholars had thought carefully about how to separate religious motives from other motives when engaging in holy war. Religious motives for violence are those that derive from belief in the will of the god or gods.
To cite another case, some, including Cavanaugh, havesuggestedthe motives behind theSt. Bartholomews Day Massacre, wherein Catholics massacred thousands of Protestants in Paris in 1572, werepolitical rather than religious. However, a closer examination of historical primary sources revealssubstantial evidence that indicatesotherwise, includingimportant Vatican correspondence, the celebration of the slaughter by Pope Gregory XIII andthe murals celebrating it in the Sala Regia of the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican.
Or heres a contemporaryexample of religious violence: Today there are thosewho thinkgay people should be killed, and some act on this belief.The only or main reason they may offer is their viewthat God thinks homosexuality is a sin. It is difficult to deny that the motive is religious belief, rather than some political or economic threat posed by gay people, in such cases.
As forKaren Armstrong, Allen says she reaches her conclusions based on exhaustivetextual and cultural analysis. While Armstrongs work is highlypopular, this description overstates her research.For example, the chapter on The Hebrew Dilemma in her Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence (2014) relies mostly on secondary sources (the work of other scholars, as opposed to her own study of the original documents). She pays little or no heed toscholarship opposing her claim that biblical genocides were just a literary trope.
Religious violence is not a myth, and its important to educate the public on what may become the defining issue of our age.

        <title>â€˜Pieces started falling out of the sky': Small Cessna destroyed when F16 fighter jet broadsides it mid-air</title>

        <Description>Federal investigators are trying to determine what caused an F16 fighter jet to slam into a small plane over South Carolina, killing the plane's pilot and passenger</Description>
        <MainBody>

Debris from a F-16 fighter jet and plane collision scatter the ground near Moncks Corner, S.C., Tuesday, July 7, 2015. People aboard the smaller Cessna were killed, and the plane was completely destroyed, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson said.
MONCKS CORNER, S.C.  Federal investigators and local authorities have been combing through a wide swath of rural, sparsely populated land as they try to determine what caused an F16 fighter jet to slam into a small plane over South Carolina, killing the planes pilot and passenger.
Debris from the collision, which happened near Moncks Corner, was scattered over a broad area about 20 miles northwest of Charleston, but there were no reports of any residents hurt or homes damaged, Berkeley County spokesman Michael Mule said.
An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board was joining the investigation and the NTSB planned to hold a news conference Wednesday to announce its initial findings, spokesman Peter Knudson said.
Two people aboard the Cessna 150 were killed and the plane was completely destroyed. County Coroner Bill Salisbury planned to announce the names of the victims on Wednesday, government officials tweeted late Tuesday.
The jets pilot, Maj. Aaron Johnson from the 55th Fighter Squadron, ejected from his aircraft safely and was taken to Joint Base Charlestons medical clinic for observation, officials from Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter said in a news release.
The jet crashed into woods around the privately owned Lewisfield Plantation, an estate dating to 1750.
We heard the plane crash, said Leo Ramsey, who has worked at the plantation for about 30 years. And then we took off from where I was at, I guess I was about a half-mile from it, when we saw a cloud of smoke.
Ramsey and two other workers found burning metal, splintered trees and a flaming crater where the jet had crash-landed, he said.
Col. Stephen Jost, commander of the 20th Fighter Squadron at Shaw Air Force Base, said Maj. Johnson parachuted to the ground and was taken by plantation workers to Berkeley County EMS personnel, who then took him to the Charleston base.
Johnson was flying solo, practicing instrument approaches to a military base and was communicating with Charleston air traffic controllers, military officials said.
Jost said he thought it was overcast at the time of the collision, but he was not aware of any weather-related problems.
It wasnt clear if a flight plan had been filed, but Berkeley County officials say the civilian pilot had indicated he was traveling to Myrtle Beach.
Wayne Ware told The Post and Courier of Charleston he was going for a walk when he heard the crash happen. He did not see the initial impact, but heard it.
I turned around, and I saw the jet. Pieces started falling out of the sky, Ware said, telling the paper the jets engine landed at a campground.
The Air Force has flown F16s since the 1970s, though very few active-duty squadrons still fly them. F16s from Shaw Air Force Base, about 35 miles east of Columbia, routinely fly training missions over eastern South Carolina and the Atlantic.
The Cessna 150 is a two-seat plane that debuted in 1959 and remains one of the most common single-engine planes in the U.S. The Cessnas maximum altitude is about 15,000 feet, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Most models weigh about 1,500 pounds when fully fueled.
By comparison, an F16 is about 50 feet long and weighs nearly 10 tons, not counting fuel or weapons. Jost said the F16 was not carrying any live munitions at the time of the collision.

        <MainBody>Churches, community groups across Canada rally to resettle Syrian refugees

By Douglas Quan July 7, 2015



Two years ago Yaser Al Mtawa, above left, a Queens University PhD student, visited his nieces and their parents in Jordans Zaatari refugee camp. He has since been working  to relocate the family to Canada and, with the help of Save a Family in Syria, a multifaith group that helps refugees settle in Ontario, the family of five arrived last week.
Across Canada, churches and community groups are appealing to members to open their hearts  and wallets  to help bring refugees from war-ravaged Syria to this country.
The pressure is on after the federal government agreed to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next three years and said it would lean heavily on private sponsors to reach that goal.
While many religious and community groups are heeding the call  holding movie nights, bake sales, wine parties and concerts to raise money  they are also miffed Ottawa isnt shouldering more of the responsibility.
Usually the government takes the leap first and then our cases filter from that, said Alexandra Kotyk, treasurer of the Canadian Refugee Sponsorship Agreement Holders Association. Its a bit of a backwards system were doing now.
The conflict in Syria has driven nearly four million people to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. With these host countries dangerously overstretched, Antonio Guterres, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, has appealed to industrialized nations to help resettle 130,000 of the refugees by the end of 2016.
Without massive international support almost two million Syrian refugees under 18 risk becoming a lost generation, he said in February.
Tens of thousands of desperate Syrian asylum-seekers have paid smugglers to get themacross the Mediterranean Sea to southern Europe, contributing to a maritime refugee crisis of historic proportions, the UN refugee agency said last week. Yet members of the European Union remain deeply divided over how to accommodate the influx.
Chris Alexander, the federal immigration minister, promised this year Canada would take 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next three years, on top of the 1,300 the government had committed to bring in (and who have since arrived). Private sponsors would support about 60 per cent of them and the government would help the rest.
Canadas private sponsorship program was created in 1979 in response to the refugee crisis in Southeast Asia. Under the program, community groups help refugees for one year after their arrival with housing, food and clothing, as well as enrolment in schools and language training.
In Victoria, residents are working with the Anglican diocese of British Columbia to raise $38,000 to resettle a Syrian couple and their three children, currently in Turkey. You are invited to an evening of wine and appetizers to raise funds to sponsor a Syrian refugee family, read a poster for an event this spring.
The Canyon Heights Church in North Vancouver and the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada hope to raise $50,000 to bring over a family of five that fled to Cairo.
We are a family of women, me, my two daughters and two grandchildren, reads a message fromthe family on the Canyon Heights churchs website.
It is extremely difficult to integrate in Egyptian society when we are not welcomed in the first place.  we truly have run out of solutions.
In Brampton, Ont., five churches affiliated with the Anglican United Refugee Alliance are holding concerts and movie nights to raise $15,000 to help sponsor a refugee family.
One of the most ambitious efforts is in Winnipeg, where community groups are working with the United Church of Canada to raise $120,000 to resettle three families who fled to Lebanon.
I called everyone I knew, said Rev. Loraine MacKenzie Shepherd of Westworth United Church. People were galvanized by it.
When you think about the dire situation, its hard not to act, said Barbara Wynes, the churchs outreach coordinator. Its difficult to imagine the conditions and the horror of what their children are experiencing.
All asylum-seekers must undergo security checks and medical examinationsfirst.As community groups await their arrival, theres more than a little grumbling about the federal governments limited help.
Traditionally, refugee advocates say, Ottawa sets a target of how many refugees it will sponsor, then private sponsors take on cases over and above the governments figure.
The government now says earlier statements private sponsors would take on 60per cent of cases were merely notional.
Thats little comfort to the sponsors, who say the government needs to stop being so vague.
Critics also say it has not adequately addressed concerns it is discriminating against Muslim refugees by giving priority to members of religious minorities.
In December, Conservative MP Costas Menegakis, parliamentary secretary of the immigration minister, told the House of Commons, We will prioritize persecuted ethnic and religious minorities, those at demonstrated risk, and we will make no apologies for that.
Federal New Democratic Party critic Paul Dewar said the governments stance smacks of meddling and prejudice and circumvents criteria established by the UN refugee agency for prioritizing cases. Those deemed most vulnerable include women and girls at risk, survivors of violence and torture, and those facing threats to their physical safety because of gender or sexual identity.
Canada continues to focus on vulnerable refugees in need, some of whom are being persecuted based on their religious beliefs, an immigration department spokeswoman said. But nobody is excluded.
Some observers worry all the attention on Syrian refugees could come at the expense of people from other places.
We are thinking in particular of refugees in Africa, who have long been neglected, Loly Rico, president of the Canadian Council for Refugees, wrote to the government this year.
But immigration officials insist the planned intake from Syria is on top of previous commitments. In 2015, Canada will accept 260,000-285,000 new permanent residents  about 10 per cent of these will be admitted on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, a spokeswomansaid.
Canada has one of the most generous refugee policies in the world.

With the worlds eyes on Greece, Nicolas Sigalas, the consul general of Greece in Montreal, spoke to the Montreal Gazette about the debt crisis gripping his country. (Some answers were condensedfor space reasons.)
Q: What message do you have for Greek Montrealers and Greek citizens about whats happening in their country at the moment?
A: The general message from Prime Minister Tsipras and the Greek government  was loud and clear in saying that the question of the referendum was over a proposal  He received and understood the message of the Greek people saying no to the proposal, but he doesnt have a mandate for a break with Europe, nor a mandate to leave the euro. This is quite clear. At the same time  the Greek government wants to continue negotiations in order to find a common agreeable solution.
Q: Are you hopeful a bailout strategy for Greece can be re-negotiated?
A:My first reading of what is happening now is that there is genuine will to go for an agreement.
Q: Will Greece leave the European Union if these talks break down?
A: Listen, I think this is exactly what Europe is all about. Europe is about making deals. European existence is through agreements, negotiations and compromises. I still believe there is room for compromise from both the Greek side and European side on giving this project a life again.
Q: What are some of the concerns being brought to your attention at the consul level?
A:Lets say the questions, emails and phone calls started not just after the announcement of the referendum  The Greeks here in Montreal, as you know, are very connected to what is happening in Greece. They were asking about what is going on  We immediately informed them  (about the fact) capital control is for owners of bank accounts in Greek banks. This limitation is not in any way applied to people visiting Greece, for example, or their own savings, money or capital in any other account.
Q: Is this a good time to visit Greece?
A:We would say firmly, up to now, nothing has happened from a security point of view. Definitely, I did not receive a single phone call (about Quebecers having) security or other issues.
Q: Should tourists bring their own money?
A: Exactly, thats the advice we give. Its certainly not Do not travel. On the contrary, we are still a very welcoming, secure country, but we wish to advise our visitors it would be, for them, more convenient to bring some cash with them.
Q: What type of currency should tourists bring, euros or American dollars?
A:There is no difference.
Q: How can stability be restored in Greece?
A:Its a complex question  In one word, confidence. Restoring economic confidence and getting the country back on track.
Q: Can Greeks swallow more austerity measures?
A:(laughing) I think this is something they expressed in the referendum. That doesnt mean  a refusal to reforms.
Q: How resilient are the Greek people?
A:There is a narrative on how the Greeks are resilient  The Greeks have shown maturity, they acted exactly as a group that can endure. On the other side, this is something that is taking (many) years of sacrifice.

        <Description>Witnesses testified that a 3-year-old saw them. The Bradenton Herald reported the woman said she &amp;#8216;had been dancing on Caballero or 'nudging' him to wake him&amp;#8217;</Description>

A beach in Manatee County
BRADENTON, Fla.  A man convicted of having sex on a Florida beach in front of families was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on Monday.
Jose Caballero, 40, and Elissa Alvarez, 21, were convicted in May of two counts of lewd and lascivious behaviour in a case that drew international attention for the couples brazen act. They were videotaped having sex on a Manatee County beach last summer in broad daylight. Witnesses testified that a 3-year-old girl saw them.
Caballero told jurors that he and Alvarez were not having sex and that witnesses were mistaken. The Bradenton Herald reported Alvarez said she had been dancing on Caballero or nudging him to wake him up.
Jurors listened to graphic testimony from witnesses and saw a video of Alvarez moving on top of Caballero in a sexual manner in the middle of the day while others watched.
We are grateful that the state has offered 2 1/2 years, said Ronald Kurpiers, defence attorney for Caballero.
He said Caballero planned to appeal his case. Alvarez, who was recently sentenced to time served, filed an appeal in her case in June.
Prosecutors say they were tougher on Caballero because he previously served eight years for cocaine trafficking. Both must now register as sex offenders. The Bradenton Herald reports the jury found them guilty after deliberating only 15 minutes. The couple had faced 15 years in prison.
If you think about 2:30 in the afternoon on a crowded beach. It takes a certain type of person to do that in front of children a few feet away, said Assistant State Attorney Anthony Dafonseca.
Prosecutors said it was important that the community knew what wouldnt be tolerated on public beaches.

        <title>Iraq veteran and combat dog helping each other heal from PTSD: â€˜He needs me just as much as I need himâ€™</title>
        <Link>http://www.vancouversun.com/news/world/Iraq+veteran+combat+helping+each+other+heal+from+PTSD+needs/11194663/story.html</Link>
        <Description>Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Bessler and a Belgian Malinois named Mike served multiple tours together. Now, they're helping each other cope with life after war</Description>
        <MainBody>

Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Bessler and his brown Belgian Malinois Mike take a walk in Cody, Wyoming. Both suffer from PTSD since serving in Iraq, but now Mike is a service dog and they are helping each other heal.
They flew home from Iraq together on a spring day in 2010 on a C-17 cargo plane, the dog in a metal kennel on the floor at the soldiers feet. When they reached the United States, the soldier went home to his farm in Fountain, Colo., and the dog was transported to the Armys military kennels at Fort Carson, about 12 miles north.
Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Bessler and the Belgian Malinois named Mike had been part of a canine tactical team with the 10th Special Forces Group based at Fort Carson. On the ground in Iraq, their work had been phenomenal, earning Bessler two Bronze Stars. During their second tour as part of an elite Special Operations group in a particularly deadly phase of the war, the pair spent every day and night together for eight months.
At home, the days were never longer than when they were apart. It was as if ones existence was proof of the others survival.
The soldier and the dog had come home with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Mike was retiring as a combat dog, although his PTSD would get worse before it got better. And although Bessler had suppressed it for as long as he could, he would soon admit that his PTSD had worsened too much for him to return to war.
Bessler had already planned to adopt Mike, but in time he would wind up training him for a new job  this time as a service dog to help protect Bessler from the unpredictable menace of PTSD.
Michael is a brother, said Bessler, who served more than half of his 20-year military career in Special Operations, with an expertise in engineering and intelligence-gathering. He needs me just as much as I need him.
For his service, including the detection of thousands of pounds of explosives and bomb-making materials that probably no human or machine could have located, Mike had been promoted to the rank of major. That was part of the Armys long tradition of bestowing ranks upon war dogs; the dogs rank was usually at least one above the soldiers to encourage respect and discourage abuse.
To Bessler, Mike was a soldier, and their bond was as strong or stronger than the love that can grow between soldiers during combat. Bessler would lose touch with many of his battle brothers over time, but Mike would become a constant in a world spinning with chaos.
Post-traumatic stress disorder was not a new diagnosis for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan at that time. But PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and the physical and mental needs of the 2.1 million veterans of those long wars would soon become part of a crisis for America.
It was no surprise that Bessler, a highly decorated Army Ranger who fought for long stretches in some of the most violent of Americas recent wars and conflicts  Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq  could return home damaged.
But canine PTSD was a diagnosis only then emerging as a possible explanation for some of the troubling behaviors some veteran combat dogs exhibit.
A key to diagnosing a war dog with post-traumatic stress is noting whether the dogs behavior has changed in the same setting, according to Walter F. Burghardt Jr., the chief of behavioral medicine at the Daniel E. Holland Military Working Dog Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
So if a dog consistently searches for bombs, for example, and suddenly stops in the midst of working, with no change in his environment, that would be a clear sign of trauma. It usually involves a situation where the dog is not working as we expect it to, Burghardt said.
An estimated 5 to 10 percent of the 650 military dogs who served in combat are expected to show symptoms of canine PTSD, he said.
After Bessler and Mike returned from Iraq, Bessler put in the papers to adopt his wartime companion, whose official military name was K-9 Mike 5 #07-257.
While the adoption was pending, Bessler would get up at dawn and drive to Fort Carson, near Colorado Springs, to see Mike at the kennel, inside a shabby beige structure called Building 6001.
The dog was refusing to eat unless Bessler was there with him. So first, Mike would eat from a bowl of dry food, then Bessler would let the 52-pound Belgian Malinois out of his barren steel cage.
Mike would be elated as soon as he spied Bessler. The dogs lean and muscular body would shake with anticipation  his ears perking up, his long tail wagging furiously, his giant pink tongue hanging out.
And Mike would know what was coming next: chasing and chewing on his cherished tennis balls.
The Belgian Malinois, nicknamed the malligator, is known for its propensity to chew and the incredible strength of its bite. Mike was trained with the ball reward system, and tennis balls were his prize for doing his duty in Iraq.
During Besslers early morning visits to the kennel, the two would go around the side of the building to an old basketball court where Mike could chase the ball. Bessler would return to the kennel in the middle of the day to play ball, come back at night and think of Mike during the hours in between.
The dog trainers at Fort Carson told Bessler that Mike was refusing to work with any other handler. In effect, the dog was insisting that he stay with his human brother.
One day, a trainer called Bessler.
He wont work with anyone else, the trainer said. Hes waiting for you to come back. Come pick up your dog.
The adoption was official, three weeks after they had arrived home from Iraq.
On Besslers farm, Mike was surrounded by other dogs, cats, horses, chickens, a billy goat  and all the tennis balls he wanted. He was out of that grim cage at Fort Carson and enveloped by love.
But soon after Mike settled in, he began anxiously chewing on rocks instead of tennis balls, crushing his teeth and destroying his gums and a chunk of his lip. He was hyper and hypervigilant, unable to focus and easily spooked by loud noises. He was having accidents in the house.
Mikes gum and lip injuries got so bad that Bessler took him to the emergency room several times. A veterinarian helped perform a series of successful surgeries to essentially reconstruct his nose and mouth.
Mikes veterinarian in Colorado, Carin Ramsel, said that Mikes condition met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, and she prescribed 20 milligrams of Prozac a day for anxiety.
Looking back, Bessler believes he can pinpoint the exact moment that pushed Mike over the edge.
Although now worse than ever, Mike had started showing signs of PTSD about six months into their last tour together.
Bessler and Mike had been posted at a small, makeshift base in the swamplands of Basra Province, in southeastern Iraq. Bessler had received intel about a pocket of insurgent activity about two miles from the post. To get there, he and Mike, along with an Iraqi intelligence officer and two other members of the 10th Special Forces Group, had to cross a river in a small inflatable boat at night.
The soldiers loaded all their gear into the boat. They had gotten about halfway across the river when the boat started taking on water. It was near the point of capsizing when the soldiers began throwing their rucksacks, rifles, ammo and other gear overboard.
The Iraqi intelligence officer shouted to the other soldiers that he couldnt swim. Bessler told him not to panic. He grabbed Mikes 15-foot leash, and he and the dog went overboard, sinking down into the river, which was filled with muck and kelp.
Bessler jumped into the water and swam toward them. He got hold of Mike first and then tried to grip the intelligence officers right arm and pull him and the dog toward the shore. But the arm slipped, and the man went under.
Bessler realized then that Mike, who was trained to rappel from an airplane and had mastered other advanced tasks, had no training in the water and was on the verge of drowning. Bessler was holding onto Mike for dear life, gasping for air and pushing his way upward through the morass of kelp.
The boat was floating away. The two other soldiers had made it to shore and the Iraqi intelligence officer was dead under the water as Bessler and Mike made their way to the riverbank. Bessler followed the faint glare of a light that was flashing friendly code.
The feeling of the Iraqi intelligence officers arm slipping from his fingers was as haunting as any of the deaths Bessler had witnessed or tried to stop. But this time Mikes life had been at stake. It had felt beyond terrifying.
Soon after that, Mike stopped searching for bombs. Instead, he was jumpy, on high alert, looking around to try and keep Bessler safe but no longer sniffing for explosives, a key requirement of his job.
So Bessler took Mike to the 10th Special Forces Groups lead dog trainer in Baghdad, who spent some time with the dog and then told Bessler: Hes done working.
In Colorado, once Mike had been on Prozac for six months or so, he became calmer, more focused, more trusting, said Ramsel, Mikes veterinarian. Still, like many returning veterans, Mike needed a purpose. He was a rock star in Iraq until he stopped searching for bombs. Now, he was an unemployed Type A dog.
At that point, Bessler was slowly coming to terms with his own disabling trauma and the fact that he would not be able to return to war. He knew what service dogs could do for struggling veterans and decided to learn everything he could about training one. Mike has been his service dog for three years now.
Facing a recent painful and legally messy divorce, Bessler moved from Colorado to his home town of Powell, Wyoming, where he was a star wrestler in high school and where his father and other relatives live.
The connection between dog and soldier began so long ago that its no stretch to say that Mike can read Besslers mind  only he does it with his nose, picking up on the scents of his moods.
Now when Bessler goes to Wal-Mart, where it can feel like a minefield of overstimulation is waiting for him in every aisle, if he starts to panic, hell walk with Mike into a corner. And Mike will stand on his feet. The physical pressure is recognized as one of many ways service dogs can help reduce anxiety.
There is also a science to Mikes ability to help Bessler with his anxiety and fear: The hormone oxytocin, which creates feelings of safety and calm, is stimulated in dogs and humans when they interact with each other.
Besides PTSD, Bessler also has chronic headaches and migraines, and shoulder and back pain  most likely from years of carrying a 60-to-70-pound rucksack  and tinnitus, a continuous, distracting and often painful ringing in the ears. He has other hearing difficulties, memory and speech problems, and blurred vision.
You wouldnt know Bessler has so many medical and mental health issues from looking at him. Thats why experts say the signature wounds of these wars are mostly invisible.
Thick with muscle, heavily tattooed but demure in his manner, Bessler could simply be the likable guy in a baseball cap riding around in his pickup truck with a cool dog and a really cute puppy in the front seat. The puppy, Ziva (a Hebrew name that means brilliance and splendor) is a black Lab who was a present from a neighbor for Valentines Day.
But Besslers moods change day to day, sometimes hour by hour. Sometimes medications work, sometimes they dont. Out of nowhere, he will be overcome by a flashback. He will get so fed up with the nightmares and sleepless nights Why even bother to nap or sleep? he said by telephone one night  he will think the only thing that can stop all the physical and psychic pain is death.
Then Mike will pick up on Besslers depressive state, and, as well-trained service dogs do, interrupt him and stop the demons from taking over. The dog will climb on top of Bessler as if to make sure his master cannot go anywhere and hurt himself. Or, he will drop a tennis ball or stuffed toy in Besslers lap and refuse to leave until he gets to chase one of them.
And Bessler will consider that taking his life would mean leaving Mike behind. A credo in the military is to leave no soldier behind.
Thats not being fair to the dog, not being fair to that partner whos stood beside me forever, he said, crying. When you can escape yourself for a minute, and stop being selfish and think about the things you have, in my world, its that dog.
