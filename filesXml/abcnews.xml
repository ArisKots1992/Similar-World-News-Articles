Its been just more than two months since a Saudi Arabia -led coalition began its airstrike campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen , and the country has since become a humanitarian catastrophe, experts said Thursday.
I am shocked about what I have seen, said Medecins Sans Frontieres Middle East Operations Manager Pablo Marco, who spent 50 days inside the country recently. The biggest problem is the fact both parties in the conflict are not respecting the civilians and, specifically, they are not respecting medical facilities and medical staff.
Marco was one in a panel of three experts in Washington who took a hard line against attacks by the Houthis as well as the 10-country coalition engaged in a bombing campaign against them for the past 10 weeks. The U.S. provides intelligence and material support to that Arab-led coalition.
The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that more than 2,000 people have been killed and more than 8,000 injured in the conflict since airstrikes began, and that 8.6 million people are in urgent need of medical help.
Heavy Saudi-Led Airstrikes Target Shiite Rebels in Yemen
In the past, Saudi Arabia has pushed back against reports of civilians being targeted by its airstrikes and said the coalition has "exercised restraint."
Last week, U.S. State Department press director Jeff Rathke said the only solution to Yemen's crisis is "to get back to the political dialogue process," adding, "the Houthis have to cease unilateral aggressive actions inside Yemen in order for that to have a chance.
Rathke added that the U.S. has urged "Saudi and other authorities to continue to allow commercial shipments of fuel and food to avert a humanitarian crisis for the 16 million Yemenis in need of assistance. And we also understand that humanitarian aid organizations and the United Nations will continue to try to deliver aid as conditions permit.
However, the panel said dozens of hospitals have had to shut down inside the country, and nearly all that are still operating are powered by generators.
We are witnessing how the whole health system in the country is literally coming to a halt, Marco said. In a matter of 15 days or two weeks there will be hundreds of people who will be dying from this.
Philippe Bolopion, a crisis advocacy director for Human Rights Watch (HRW), said his teams have documented cases where coalition airstrikes have caused disproportionate damage to the civilian population.
He said HRW has called on the U.S. to exercise pressure on the coalition.
They have made the case that they are supportive to the coalition but are not a party to the conflict, Bolopion said. We are trying to challenge that a little bit, because according to publicly available information the U.S. has been refueling war planes in the air, providing intelligence possibly on some targets, helping with coordination. And if they are in some cases they are a party to the conflict, they could be found to be complicit to some of the violations that have occurred.
The panel said the Houthis share some of the blame for lack of access to those in need of medical assistance, citing sniper attacks and bombings around hospitals.
One of the more shocking things is that they reacted to the start of the military operation by recruiting even more children in their ranks, Bolopion said.
The panel said that the coalition could provide some relief to the health crisis by easing the tight control of Yemens border and ports. Bolopion called it a blockade, and said it hindered efforts to provide aid to the population during the five-day humanitarian ceasefire earlier this month.
Bolopion said Yemen receives almost 80 percent of its food supply from international shipments.
Its hugely dependent on the outside, and the same thing for fuel, Bolopion said.
Many have classified the conflict in Yemen since Saudi intervention as a proxy war, citing the Houthis alignment with Iran.
Robert Blecher, deputy director of the International Crisis Group, said the poor execution of the airstrike campaign has exacerbated a more domestic conflict into a regional powder-keg.
The longer this goes on, the more and more the Houthis will be forced to have an external patron, Blecher said. The highest probability of a direct Iranian-Saudi clash is in Yemen right now.
With the coalition focusing on the Houthis and the U.S. counterterrorism operations in the country severely hindered, Blecher said it has afforded al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula more territory than it has ever held before.
So far, the biggest winner politically of the fighting probably has been al Qaeda, Blecher said. Weve seen around the region -- look at Syria, look at Iraq , look at whats happening in Libya -- the longer these conflicts go on, the more ribbed these extremists become.

        <Description>As the new China of high speed trains, highways and unbridled construction encroaches on this remote corner of the country, ziplines are quickly disappearing.</Description>
        <MainBody>China Detains Artist Who Posted Humorous Photo of President
The communities that live along the Nujiang are mostly members of the Lisu ethnic minorities, a hill tribe that have ziplining in their blood.
When asked about using the ziplines now, villagers of the Lisu ethnic minority pointed to the government-built bridges that are quickly replacing their traditional form of mode of transportation. Decades earlier the local provincial government had helped upgrade ziplines from bamboo-made cables to steel but today many of the harnesses are homemade.
In one village called Boa, locals zipped back and forth as they took their kids to school. Others were heading to jobs or to pick up supplies. For the time being, the ziplines remain the fastest way to get across the river from Boa.

In one village called Boa, locals zipped back and forth as they took their kids to school. Others were heading to jobs or to pick up supplies.
The Chinese government have plans to build at least four new hydro-electric dams on the untouched river, although environmental advocates are pushing back. Although the plan has yet to be full approval, preparation for dams has already started as earth-moving machinery dot the winding road that runs along the Nujiang.
A 90-year-old grandmother named Qiu Maqian told "Nightline" that she grew up in Boa and has used the ziplines since the 1930s, back when the lines were made of bamboo. Metal lines replaced the bamboo in the 1970s. She said she will not be around to watch the changes, and that ziplining has been a big part of her life but she said she knows that will not last much longer.
A 17-year-old Boa villager named Pu Shaheng may be the last generation of Nujiang zipliners, but he told "Nightline" that he feels life will be easier when bridges and highways come into town.
Pu then paused and added the idea of the ziplines going away made him sad because its a lifestyle his kids and generations to come will never know.

A freighter carrying fertilizer -- a potentially explosive substance -- was abandoned by its crew off the coast of Germany after the vessel caught on fire, German officials told ABC News.
But after more than two days of smoldering, and a failed attempt to extinguish the flames, the ship is no longer at risk of exploding, German officials said.
Dozens of residents from Bremerhaven and nearby towns called Germany's Central Command for Maritime Emergencies on Monday asking about a large cloud of smoke emanating from a ship sailing off the coast, authorities said.

The 630-foot long cargo named Purple Beach was headed for the German port of Brake and had been travelling from the United Kingdom, authorities said.
The fire was initially put out, but it picked up again on Tuesday prompting the crew to evacuate, officials said. Residents were told to keep windows and doors shut as a risk of explosion was reported.

On Wednesday, authorities managed to pour massive streams of water onto the smoking ship and firefighters were able to board the vessel, a spokesman from the Central Command said.
All of the 26 crew members who had been sent to hospital for monitoring have now been released, the spokesman added.
Rescue boats are still monitoring the situation, making sure that the temperature of the boat remains stable. In the next few hours, officials will decide whether and how to tow the ship and clear the area.

Wearing only his underpants, Gao Bingguo set a new Guinness World Record after he covered himself with almost 1.1 million bees, collectively weighing 240 pounds.
The 55-year-old beekeeper accomplished the feat Monday morning in Tai'an, China .
Bingguo was stung more than 2,000 times and his body temperature rose to a burning 140 degrees at one point.

Fellow beekeepers started by first placing a number of queen bees on his body to help attract worker bees. Boxes of bees were later dumped at his feet in increasingly large numbers as the bees crawled on his entire body -- except his mouth.
Binguo smoked a cigarette to prevent the bees from swarming his lips.

The eruption of a mile-high volcano on one of the Galapagos Islands this week has triggered concerns for the fragile and world-renowned ecosystem on the remote islands. But volcanic activity isnt the biggest threat to the region made famous by Charles Darwins studies on evolution, according to wildlife experts.
WATCH: Galapagos Island Volcano Erupts
Volcanism and eruptions are a normal part of the evolutionary ecology on the Galapagos Islands, Steve Walsh, the director of the Center for Galapagos Studies at the University of North Carolina, told ABC News. We seem to be excited about a volcano, but the Galapagos are under siege by a lot of different things.
"There are far more human-induced threats to the species of the Galapagos," said Hugo Arnal, the World Wildlife Fund's director for Ecuador .
Experts list invasive species , overfishing, pollution, overpopulation and unsustainable tourism as more significant threats.

The Galapagos consist of 13 major islands formed by volcanic eruptions that occurred millions of years ago. Since Charles Darwins arrival in 1835, the Galapagos have been called a living laboratory of evolution because of wildlife found only on these islands. Giant tortoises, pink iguanas, red-footed boobies, and thousands of other unique species can only be found there.
For the first time in 33 years, Isabela Islands Wolf Volcano erupted on Monday, shooting rivers of lava down its slopes and filling the night sky with a red glare. Technicians at the Galapagos National Park determined the lava is flowing southeast and seems to be sparing the northern section of the island where the worlds only population of pink iguanas lives.
The population of the pink iguanas, yellow iguanas and land turtles are in the northeast and are out of danger, said Danny Reuda, director of ecosystems at the Galapagos National Park Service , the Ecuadorian agency responsible for managing the Galapagos.

There is no human population near the volcano. Puerto Villamil, the nearest town, is located 115 kilometers to the south.
There is some loss of vegetation, but its an opportunity for other species to grow, Reuda said, calling the eruption a natural process. He added that officials would not interfere with the lava flow, which is beginning to freeze.

People may be a bigger threat than lava, experts say. Census data shows more than 26,000 people live on the islands, a UNESCO world heritage site. Unbeknownst to many tourists, the islands do not have widespread public sewage systems, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Sewage is left to seep into the ground and the sea. With the spike in tourism, the Galapagos' pristine landscape is in danger of being transformed.
"There has been an explosion in the number of hotels and restaurants," said WWF's Arnal, who argued that the increase in tourism is the main driver for expanding trade between the archipelago and the continent, creating more chances for invasive species to reach the pristine islands.

Introduced plants and animals, ranging from cats to avocados, represent a huge threat to native species, which lack natural predators and are defenseless to invasive predators, according to the Galapagos National Park Service. At one point, an estimated 100,000 feral goats lived on Isabela Island and devastated the ecosystem through overgrazing. The park service eventually was forced to adopt a radical eradication plan involving helicopter-mounted machine guns and radio collared Judas goats used to locate herds. The plan was deemed a success in 2005 when the last feral goat was removed from Isabela Island, though some 266 Judas goes remain for monitoring purposes.

A volcano atop one of the Galapagos Islands has erupted for the first time in 33 years, spewing fire, smoke and lava into the night sky  and threatening a fragile ecosystem that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.
Ecuador 's Galapagos National Park administration said the mile-high Wolf volcano erupted before dawn Monday. The eruption could be seen for miles.

The volcano lies on the northern tip of Isabela Island, the archipelago's largest.
Authorities said no tourist activity was affected  and for now, lava flowing in the southwest direction poses no risk to the world's only population of pink iguanas, which live on the island's northwest tip.
Darwin visited the eastern Pacific island chain in 1835, and the trip influenced his findings presented in the book The origin of Species.

        <MainBody>Fighter Jets Scramble Following at Least 6 Reports of Threats to Passenger Planes, Officials Say

Officials search an Air France plane after it lands at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City on May 25, 2015.
WABC
At least six flights were impacted by threats at airports in New York, New Jersey and Boston today, according to airlines and law enforcement.
JFK Airport:
An Air France plane was escorted to JFK Airport in New York City this morning after an anonymous threat was made against the flight, law enforcement officials told ABC News. The FBI said the plane has since been checked and cleared with "no incidents or hazards reported on board the flight by either the passengers or its crew."
Authorities said that the decision to have the plane escorted by two fighter jets was done "out of an abundance of caution" after the Maryland State Police McHenry Barrack, in Garrett County, received an anonymous call of a chemical weapons threat aboard Air France Flight 22, which was en route from Paris to the New York City airport.

The tip was called in at 6:45 a.m. on an untraceable line and the caller did not identify himself, a senior federal official told ABC News. Two F-15 planes were scrambled and followed the plane into U.S. airspace, but they flew in a way so that the passengers and crew would not be able to see the military planes, sources said.
The Airbus A-330 has since landed and was taken between two runways and locked down while the threat is investigated. A police dispatch that was sent out after the jets were scrambled noted that the area where the plane was taken is generally known as the "hijack site" because it is the area used in such scenarios. During an initial investigation, nothing dangerous has been found on board, the federal official told ABC News.
A Saudi Airlines flight from Saudi Arabia was also escorted to a remote area at JFK. It was cleared and passengers were brought back to the terminal, officials said.
For an American Airlines flight from Birmingham, England, to JFK, the pilot was initially instructed to taxi to a remote area, but the threat was determined not credible and the plane was cleared to go to the terminal.
Newark Airport:
Two flights to Newark, New Jersey, were also affected -- a Delta Air Lines flight from London and a United Airlines flight from Madrid, authorities said.
Logan Airport:
A threat also turned up negative for a Delta flight from Paris to Logan Airport in Boston, authorities said.

At least 13 people were killed today when a tornado struck the town of Ciudad Acuna, Mexico , near the Texas border, causing widespread damage that includes destroyed homes and cars flipped sideways at 90-degree angles.
The town is just two miles from Texas' Laughlin Air Force base, the largest pilot training base in the United States.
No injuries or damage were reported at the Air Force base, according to an official.
About 300 homes were affected, according to a press statement from the Coahuila Government.

        <MainBody>Volcano Erupts on Southern Japanese Island
TOKYO  May 28, 2015, 9:56 PM ET
A volcano erupted on a small island in southern Japan on Friday, and authorities ordered residents to evacuate the island.
Mount Shindake erupted about 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) in spectacular fashion, spewing towering black-gray clouds into the sky.
No injuries had been reported, although the Japan Meteorological Agency reported that pyroclastic flows from the volcano had reached the shore to the northwest.
The government was surveying the island by helicopter to assess damage.
The national broadcaster NHK cited local officials as saying that 80 residents had taken refuge in a shelter on the island.
About 140 people live on Kuchinoerabu island in the Ryukyu archipelago, 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of the main southern island of Kyushu. Tourism and fishing are the main activities on the heavily forested, mountainous island, which is a national park.
The Japan Meterological Agency raised the volcano alert level to five, the highest on its scale. Shindake also erupted in August last year for the first time since 1980.
Kuchinoerabu island can be reached only by a once-a-day ferry from Yakushima island, 12 kilometers (about 7 miles) to the east, which has an airport and a population of more than 13,000 people.

        <MainBody>Railroad Bridge Fire and Collapse Ruled Accidental
INTERNATIONAL FALLS, Minn.  May 28, 2015, 9:17 PM ET
A fire that caused the collapse of a busy wooden railroad bridge near Minnesota's northern border has been ruled an accident.
Koochiching County Sheriff Perryn Hedlund tells Minnesota Public Radio ( http://bit.ly/1FR18vP ) that fire marshals found no evidence of foul play and believe the fire was started by a mechanical failure. He didn't want to speculate on what went wrong.
A Canadian National Railway engineer spotted the blaze early Wednesday. The collapse blocked a CN line from Prince Rupert, British Columbia , to Chicago . It crosses the border at Ranier, Minnesota, near International Falls. It's one of the busiest rail crossings on the border.
Railroad spokesman Brent Kossey says CN hopes to restore service in the coming days. In the meantime, it's rerouting traffic to maintain service to its customers.

        <MainBody>Japan CPI Weak at 0.6 Percent, as Jobless Rate at 18-Yr Low
TOKYO  May 28, 2015, 9:12 PM ET
Japan's jobless rate dropped to an 18-year low in April, but industrial production, inflation and household spending were muted as consumers kept purse strings tight.
The government said Friday that the unemployment rate was 3.3 percent in April, the lowest since April 1997, as firms stepped up hiring.
However, the rising competition for labor has had a limited impact on wages, with any income increases coming in the form of bonuses and other incentive pay.
The core consumer price index , excluding volatile food prices, rose 0.4 percent, partly due to a fall in energy costs thanks to cheaper crude oil. That is well below the 2 percent inflation target set by the central bank and government two years ago.
Aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, combined with pressures pushing the U.S. dollar higher have pulled the Japanese yen to its weakest level against the dollar since 2002.
Share prices have meanwhile surged to 15-year highs.
Japan's economy emerged from recession late last year, growing at a faster-than-expected 2.4 percent annual rate in January-March. But economists say weak factory output will likely keep growth flat in this quarter.

        <MainBody>Asian Nations Meet to Discuss Rohingya Migrant Crisis
BANGKOK  May 28, 2015, 9:09 PM ET
By JOCLEYN GECKER Associated Press
Senior officials from across Asia will meet Friday in Bangkok to tackle the growing problem of desperate people landing on the shores of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand , as Rohingya Muslims flee persecution in Myanmar and poor Bangladeshis crowd onto boats in the hope of finding jobs in other countries.
In the past month, more than 3,000 of them have landed in the three countries, sparking concerns about how to help them and how to stop the flow.
Friday's meeting will include representatives from 17 countries directly and indirectly affected by crisis, as well as others such as the United States and Japan, and officials from international organizations such as the U.N. refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration.
The director-general of the IOM, William Lacy Swing, said on the eve of the meeting that one important result was already achieved in getting the countries to agree to talk.
"The other thing that from my perspective would be good, if it's going to be meaningful, is to have some kind of a follow-on mechanism to make sure the conversation, the dialogue continues on all these questions, including the root causes," he said.
The main root cause is seen as the massive discrimination against minority Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The government denies the Rohingya citizenship, making them effectively stateless. It views the estimated 1.3 million Rohingya living in dire conditions in western Rakhine state as illegal migrants from Bangladesh .
The Rohingya have fled predominantly Buddhist Myanmar and for years, Southeast Asia has quietly ignored the issue, but the problem erupted more into the open as Thailand launched a crackdown on human trafficking earlier this month. That prompted smugglers to abandon their boats, leaving what aid groups estimated were thousands of migrants stranded at sea. Survivors, including women and children, came ashore with first-hand accounts of beatings, ransom kidnappings by traffickers and near-starvation.
Human rights groups have urged those involved in the talks to find a better way of saving the people still stranded at sea, and to put pressure on Myanmar to end its repressive policies that drive Rohingya to flee.
Swing said a long-term, comprehensive policy has to be put together, and that no single element by itself is going to solve the issue. But he said Myanmar was a key.
"I think Myanmar has to be engaged in any solution involving any of the groups, absolutely," he said.
Malaysia and Indonesia agreed last week to provide the migrants with one-year shelter. Indonesia says Rohingya can stay for a year while Bangladeshis will be repatriated. It is unclear what happens after a year, and both countries have called on the international community to help with resettlement options.
Thailand has offered humanitarian help but not shelter. More than 100,000 refugees, mostly from Myanmar's other ethnic groups, have been living in border camps for decades, and Thailand says it cannot afford any more.

        <MainBody>Chile Customs Workers End Strike That Disrupted Exports
SANTIAGO, Chile  May 28, 2015, 7:58 PM ET
Chilean customs workers are returning to work after reaching a deal to end a nationwide strike that halted shipments causing losses for the fruit and salmon industries.
Customs workers began the stoppage May 20, demanding improvements in infrastructure and more staff over the next three years. Unions representing the workers reached a deal with the government Thursday.
The SalmonChile group said earlier this week that the strike had blocked exports of about 11 metric tons of salmon and caused more than $30 million in losses for the industry.
Chile's ASOEX fruit exporting association estimated $16 million in losses in fresh fruit due to shipping problems since the beginning of the strike.
Chile is the world's top copper producer and a major global exporter of wine, salmon and fruit.

        <MainBody>Alleged Nazi War Criminal Wanted by Russia Dies in Quebec
MONTREAL  May 28, 2015, 7:37 PM ET
Vladimir Katriuk, the man who held the No. 2 spot on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of most wanted Nazi war criminals, has died, his lawyer said Thursday. He was 93.
Katriuk passed away last week after a long illness, Orest Rudzik said.
News of Katriuk's death emerged several hours after the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said Ottawa should take the necessary steps to ensure that he be held accountable if he were found guilty of war crimes committed in collaboration with the Nazis.
Russia charged Katriuk earlier this month with genocide in connection with the 1943 killing of civilians in Khatyn, now part of Belarus . According to war reports, Katriuk was a member of a Ukrainian battalion of the SS, the elite Nazi storm troops, between 1942 and 1944. He had denied the accusations against him.
The Russian Embassy in Ottawa called on the Harper government a few weeks ago to support a criminal case against Katriuk. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, a law-enforcement body that reports only to Putin, called on Canada to deliver Katriuk to Moscow so he can be tried for alleged war crimes.
Harper's Conservative government ignored the request, saying it will never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine .
A study three years ago alleged Katriuk was a key participant in a village massacre during the Second World War in what is now known as Belarus.
The article said a man with Katriuk's name lay in wait in March 1943 outside a barn that had been set ablaze, operating a machine-gun and firing on civilians as they tried to flee the burning building.
"One witness stated that Volodymyr Katriuk was a particularly active participant in the atrocity: he reportedly lay behind the stationary machine-gun, firing rounds on anyone attempting to escape the flames," said the article, authored by Lund University historian Per Anders Rudling.
Rudling, whose research was published in the spring 2012 issue of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, attributed these details to KGB interrogations released for the first time in 2008.
Katriuk allegedly deserted his SS unit when it moved to France from eastern Europe in 1944. He lived in Paris before immigrating to Canada in 1951, according to court documents.
He later became a Canadian citizen and lived with his French-born wife in Ontario, working as a bee-keeper.
In 1999, Canada's Federal Court ruled Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not telling authorities about his collaboration with the Nazis but could find no evidence he committed atrocities. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke his citizenship.

Two former Guantanamo Bay detainees are planning to tie the knot with women from their adopted home of Uruguay .
Imam Samir Selim told The Associated Press on Thursday that he would officiate at the ceremony for both men June 6 at the Egyptian Islamic Center in Montevideo.
"This is great. It's beautiful," Selim said during a phone interview. "These men want to make their lives here in Uruguay. They want to work and live like other men, and that means getting married."
Selim said Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi of Tunisia and Omar Abdelhadi Faraj of Syria are marrying Uruguayan women who have converted to Islam. He said the men met the women at the center, but declined to provide more details.
Calls to El Ouerghi and Faraj were not answered.
Mauricio Pigola, a lawyer who represents the men in Uruguay, said the two had requested marriage licenses. He said that as refugees, their permanent residence status permits them to marry like any other Uruguayan.
The men are part of a group of six former detainees  four Syrians, one Tunisian and one Palestinian  who were resettled in Uruguay in December, invited by then President Jose Mujica as a humanitarian gesture. All were detained in Afghanistan in 2002 for alleged ties to al-Qaida.
By their own admission, they have struggled to adapt in this small, poor South American nation of 3.3 million people. They have frequently complained that the Uruguayan government hasn't helped them enough financially.
Four of them, including the husbands-to-be, recently ended a nearly monthlong protest in front of the U.S. Embassy to demand that America compensate them for nearly 13 years in Guantanamo.
Problems aside, since their arrival, several of the men have spoken about their hopes of starting families. In February, El Ouerghi, 50, told the AP that he had been married to a Pakistani woman when he was detained by American forces in Afghanistan in 2002. During his time in Guantanamo, she divorced him, he said.
Faraj, 34, also expressed a desire to wed and have children, saying the demands for more financial help were in large part to make having a family possible.

Associated Press writer Leonardo Haberkorn reported this story in Montevideo and Peter Prengaman reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

        <MainBody>Kenyan Pleads Guilty in US Terrorism Support Case
MIAMI  May 28, 2015, 6:29 PM ET
By CURT ANDERSON AP Legal Affairs Writer
A Kenyan man pleaded guilty in the U.S. on Thursday to terrorism support charges in a case that involved Internet chat room and other online communications with undercover FBI operatives.
Mohamed Said pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations. A factual statement signed by Said identifies those groups as al-Shabaab in Africa and extremist organizations operating in Syria , including al-Qaida.
Said, 27, faces a maximum 15-year prison term when he is sentenced Aug. 14 by U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro. A co-defendant, Gufran Mohammed, is already serving that same 15-year sentence after pleading guilty last year.
The case evolved from FBI monitoring of Internet chat rooms frequented by Muslim extremists, according to court documents. FBI undercover employees posed as online terrorism recruiters and fundraisers in communications with both Mohammed and Said, who were both overseas.
Said admitted in the factual statement that in 2011 he received more than $11,600 in wire transfers from Mohammed for al-Shabaab and that he had told Mohammed later, "I sent it and it was distributed among the mujahedeen."
"I am sending more this week (Allah willing)," Mohammed wrote back.
Said's defense had centered on claims that prosecutors could not prove he was the person typing on a computer in Africa when the incriminating communications were sent. But according to authorities, Said admitted his involvement in terrorism in conversations with inmates at a Miami detention center.
Said and Mohammed were arrested in August 2013 in Saudi Arabia , where Mohammed was based at the time. According to the statement, Said thought he was traveling there from Africa to pick up more money for the terrorist organizations.
Before his arrest, Said admitted discussing travel routes, training and possible terrorist operations with an FBI confidential source posing as an al-Shabaab recruit. In such conversations, the recruits were called "tomatoes" or "dogs," according to the statement.
Mohammed is a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from India who has a master's degree in computer science from California State University in Los Angeles. He had been living in Saudi Arabia since 2011. Said was living in Mombasa, Kenya, and had never been to the U.S. before his arrest.

Transcript for FIFA Officials Charged With Corruption
Breaking right now six top ranking fifa officials arrested in Zurich Switzerland. During a night at their five star hotel this. At the US and that's a total of fourteen individuals on conspiracy and corruption charges but the FBI raiding offices in Miami as well. The unsealed court documents allege he officials and other sports executives that more than 150 million dollars in bribes and kickbacks over 24 years. Hello tie Hernandez in New York US attorney general Loretta lynch just now wrapping up a news conference. On the unsealing in the indictment today its investigation growing out of allegations that the officials were paid off when it came to choosing. The next two World Cup host country when he eighteen and 20/20 two with the US. Runnerup to Qatar in 20/20 TO. Let's break it in sports business reporters there right now and the world if he thought has been rocked Daryn what can you tell us about. All the indictments and the corruption charges that we're seeing. Well I obviously you know this is been going on for a long time there's been many reporters who have alleged that bribes have been taken by. Members of soccer's organizing body fifa. But. I guess what happens here is when your now indicting for wire fraud and racketeering there's obviously. The paperwork that is there that hasn't been there before. On a federal level. That the money in in the banks carried out by US banks. And that kind of stuff and as we you said there are fourteen officials here nine fifa officials. And up the rest sports marketing executives. Some of those sports marketing executives actually. Pled guilty including Jose we low with who is a sports marketing executive at Avaya a firm called traffic. And he alone has agreed. Two to give up a 150 million dollars. From the press conference. Just a couple minutes ago. Things that just stood out. They said that they found a 110. Million dollars in bribes alone. On Copa America on the Copa America event which is going to be played in the US next year. Which is unbelievable because that's not even the World Cup. So you you've come out of this saying how much money is has been giving in bribes. If we know that single B tale alone. And then you you wonder what is next. Thief is obviously meeting in a big meeting right now. Sepp Blatter. Who's ahead of fifa his presidency is on the line and what they did say was. This is the beginning not the end see you kind of wonder. Whether the big fish here is set Blatter. The head of fifa who is not mentioned in any of this paperwork. Against Sepp Blatter that big fish and we do have some indications that people are willing to top people are looking for pleading no deals here. And as he said this is the beginning not the end so some signs that this could keep ticking upward. Yeah and in obviously these are when you when you talk about the bit that counts over forty counts and when you're alleging. A wire fraud and racketeering and this type of corruption. When you mention those types of of names of those types of crimes you're talking about major major jail time. And you'll also have what we already know. There are people that have cooperated. That had not only been indicted but have pled guilty so there are people talking. So the willingness of people to talk the willingness of people will forfeit money right away. Does this indictment gets announced. You don't means that. The the FBI in the attorney general it is. Is clearer believes that there is going to be further cooperation which would then lead to more information. Now the US lost out to cutter for the 20/20. Two World Cup allegedly under rate conditions. Any chance at those decisions could be revisited and is this how the US really became tipped off to the process of dealing with heat and all the rides that. That are required in many cases. Well kayak I I think that you know they they say that this case goes back two generations of soccer officials. 24 years. You know there there is always been this subtext. Things don't make sense and certainly for the 20/20 two games in cutter. The fact that they were awarded the games just did not make any sense a country that is a 105. Degrees in the summer. A country that had virtually no infrastructure. All of sports soccer stadiums. This just made absolutely no sense for them to win the bid sometimes there's been Olympic decision to roll cut decisions that. Snell a little fishy but this certainly went the full extent. Neighbor ready started building they are very far along in terms of their soccer stadiums there's been a lot of questions about. Human rights there are people who have died building these stadiums. It might be hard to back up but I don't think anything is out of the question right now as part fifa they are in as much trouble as anti. Forget about sports organization any organization. Has ever beating and when you just if you think that this is the beginning so I don't think you know 20/20 two still law a long way off. And perhaps. This is something that they viewed it to clean up they on do this deal even though things are far along in cutter. What about because major corporate sponsors out of this investigation affect them and really. He puts finances in the future if it's so many of their dealings Ers are suspect. Yet certainly makes it an uncomfortable day for the big sponsors like it devious like Coca-Cola like McDonald's. Makes it a good day for those companies that decided last year to end their association. Whether it would be continental tires Johnson &amp; Johnson Sony emirates airlines cast parole. All those guys decided and you happ did you think it was under some of this. Subtext under what were so talked about under the that the fact that this could happen it that these one of the reasons why these companies lap. But. It's it's very uncomfortable Levy's sponsored a makes a little bit more comfortable. That he has been sitting out press releases regarding these allegations with the sponsor's names on the bottom I think it's. Probably dated the sponsors would appreciate not having your name on the bottom of these notes. Absolutely is against Darren about their and I want to thank you so much for joining us. As the charges against fifa continue to pound. Breakfast take place in keep up with this story in real time by downloading the ABC news happened starting this story for exclusive updates on ago.

Transcript for International Hotspot: Fighting ISIS in Iraq
Fighting back Shiite militia in ramadi defending their turf from ice it's even though the terrorist group now controls that. Important city like county. Hot spot Iraq high every. New York the fall of ramadi has Iraqi soldiers taking up arms and launching an offensive to try and liberal Anbar Province from MySpace. The BBC's frank partner is in Jordan which borders to handle bar province. And sent this report. A to the barracks until two patrol. Part of Jordan's recently formed as a brigade. That tossed by the king to secure this lonely border with Iraq to keep drug smugglers and the jihadist. We've just about to take a vote or with Iraq's neighboring Anbar Province. Jordan's desert border with Iraq here is the clay says that the forces of Islamic states have come so far to getting into the stable pro western kingdom. But long term Jordan is definitely in that sites. That's why the lost yep the Jordanian police and on the patrols have been redoubled we'll just here on the Iraqi border. But farther to the roles on the Syrian border with Jordan faces three different on groups. We remove the would this put you through fleas or the tomb. Content of his own that should lose or lifted its. Capital Amman does not look I feel like a city in the country at war yet technically it is with the Islamic state favoring Syria. Jordanian port Maine still carry out as strikes. The jihadist use the Internet to promised revenge. Sue -- safe to Jordan's public field. Have been showed some of it I went this cafe and I'm on. To a loss of random groups for snapshot of their opinions and there's brokers around us but it's Doug and attempted don't have an appropriate moments but is it. But what I Allston about Jordan's extremist sympathizers and supporters should be out right. Prices aren't. But this tranquil scene is deceptive. In this volatile region Jordan faces and a mystery inside and out. Even its western allies fear it could keep the jihadist next week target. I've gotten it keeps news Jordan. The BBC's John Simpson went to another part of the Anbar Province where a group of militia is training volunteers. To fight anxious. And Bob Providence Boston emptied basically desert and it's not neutral territory fully Islamic state. It's been a battleground for years. The Americans build fortifications. When they would he. Now as then the enemy's weapon of choice is the rates side home. We reached Gama as the government forces of firing Islamic states last few positions in the town of corporate. IS has been forced out of the rest of it yeah. Ramo pocket Fifth Amendment. We will those so called popular mobilization. Unit a militia mostly composed of Shia Muslims. Until Monday by Sheikh Ali did finish at that could carry in the uniform with his own devising. The militias so the only government troops who seem able to resist Islamic states ferocity. But Anbar Province his sonar use. And sewage Dane showed that the sheik's men will find to sectarian war here. Made a riot that about and the fitted out out couldn't. I carried the flag or for Iraq because I don't just represents Xia our Sony are to present the whole rack she. This is what they called the front line in the sense that it's that places. Let the Iraqi forces get to the last remaining Islamic state positions. Just on the other side of that reads that. Nicely the fire is out getting there aren't that many Islamic state fighters left. But they've just told the so we've got to get out in case all the fire and the excitement -- attract incoming mortar fire. And the Islamic stakes by no means finished in Anbar Province. Another BBC team traveling with the Iraqi Army came under fire from IS and the battle started. It's one of the characteristics. Of fighting a war in Anbar that he's guess the other get a look at your enemy. It's a matter of life and death of the Iraqi Government should drive Islamic state out of band. The government believes can be done and by the end of the year. Western diplomats here are inclined to greet. But it'll be an immense talks could. Don't Simpson BBC news I'm Bob. Province.
