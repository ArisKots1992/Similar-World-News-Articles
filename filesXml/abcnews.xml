There are still 30 people unaccounted for in Hays County, according to the latest figures from a Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson.
"We have a thousand properties that have been visually inspected. We believe that there are as many as 4,000 with significant damage," Parker said this afternoon.
Overall the storms and flooding were blamed for 15 deaths since Friday, including four people who were killed in Oklahoma. Another 13 were killed in a tornado that touched down Monday in Ciudad Acuna, a Mexican town on the border with Texas.
Among the dead was Alyssa Ramirez, a homecoming queen and student council president who was driving home Saturday night from her prom in the small town of Devine southwest of San Antonio when she got stranded in high water. She called 911 and even called her father, but the flood waters rose too fast for her to be rescued.
Some of the underpasses in Houston that flood in normal rainfalls were the first areas affected when 6 to 11 inches of rain fell by early this morning. Parker said there have been more than 2,500 cars left stranded on highways and roadways.
Parker explained the rain created two problems: the first being that the ground was largely saturated and couldn't absorb all of the evening's rainfall because of "several weeks of really heavy rainfall." On top of that, the small rivers that surround and run through Houston began overflowing their banks and flooding neighborhoods.
"It's still a dangerous situation along the bayous, they're flowing very, very rapidly," Parker said.
A city official noted that they responded to 968 incidents overnight, 531 of which were water-related.
As a result of the rainfall and flooded roadways, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency for the Texas counties of Harris and Fort Bend.

Texas Department of Transportation spokesman Danny Perez encourages area commuters to take the day off.
"We're just asking folks to, if you're at home, stay put," Perez said. "If you need to be on the roadway, make sure you're checking in with supervisors or whoever you need to check in with. It's not worth it if you can stay home."
The high water shut down the Katy Freeway eastbound and westbound at the 610 West loop.

Hundreds of homes are currently impacted by the flooding, Harris County Emergency management said.
The White Oak Bayou in Houston is rapidly rising and spilling over highways, currently at major flood stage and expected to rise to more than 40 feet, according to the National Weather Service. The last time the bayou crested to this level was during Hurricane Ike in 2008.
The Brays Bayou is expected to expand to 45 feet before receding, while the Keegans Bayor, which feeds into Brays Bayou, has reached record levels.

Those conditions caused some fans at Houston's Toyota Center to remain in their seats following Monday's Western Conference Finals basketball game between the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors .
Fans and players were asked not to leave the arena following the Rockets' 128-115 Game 4 victory.
When someone's phone beeped loudly with a flash flood warning during Rockets center Dwight Howard's postgame press conference he shook his head and said: "It's bad outside."
Howard stayed at the arena, hoping to wait out the storm.

The flash flooding follows a series of deadly, powerful storms across the southern Great Plains. Earlier Monday, a tornado ripped through Ciudad Acuna, Mexico , a city on the U.S. Mexico border, killing at least 13 people.
The deadly tornado was one of at least 15 reported Monday. It tore a baby from its mother's arms, ripped apart buildings, tossed cars and trucks around, in some cases leaving them standing on end.

In weekend flooding that hit parts of Texas, one driver had to be rescued as the surge of water swept away his SUV outside San Antonio. At least five people were killed over the weekend as a result of flash floods along the Blanco River between Austin and San Antonio, officials said Monday.
Among the dead was 14-year-old Damien Blade, who was found with his dog in a suburban Dallas storm drain. Investigators said they apparently had drowned but their investigation continues. According to police , Damien's family reported him missing about 10 p.m. Sunday after one of his two dogs showed up alone at the house, wet and extremely muddy.

In the town of Wimberley alone, as many as 400 homes have been destroyed.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott added 24 counties Monday to the list of those where he has declared a state of emergency, and he said with more rain in the forecast, he could add additional counties.
The weekend storms were blamed for three deaths, including two in Oklahoma and one in Texas, where a man's body was recovered from a flooded area along the Blanco River.

        <MainBody>Ramadi Fell to ISIS Fighters Even Though They Were 'Vastly Outnumbered' by Iraqi Troops

The city of Ramadi is controlled by hundreds of ISIS fighters who were able to seize the city after Iraqi military commanders ordered the withdrawal of several thousand Iraqi troops from the city.
Thats according to a U.S. official who also confirmed that the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Ramadi may have been prompted by the unexplained pullout of the elite Iraqi counterterrorism force based in the city.
The pullout of the Iraqi counterterrorism unit from Ramadi first appeared in the Kurdish news agency Rudaw .
The departure of that elite unit led other Iraqi military commanders in the city to order the departure of their troops even though they held a significant numerical superiority, the U.S. official said.
White House Offers No Apology for Ash Carter's Comment That Iraqis Lack Will to Fight
Over the weekend, Defense Secretary Ash Carter criticized the will to fight of Iraqi forces in Ramadi because they withdrew from the city even though they vastly outnumbered the opposing force.
The motivations for the elite units departure remain unknown, the U.S. official said, but it was another reason provided by American officials as to why thousands of Iraqi security forces left the city.
Taken together, it appears the fall of Ramadi was due to a domino effect of circumstances.
Officials said last week that ISIS fighters launched more than 30 car bombs inside Ramadi in an effort to take over the city where fighting has been raging for more than a year and a half.
The attacks came at the same time as a sandstorm that affected ground operations. The storm also led the Iraqi commander on the ground to mistakenly believe that the sandstorm would prevent coalition airstrikes from supporting his troops, according to U.S. officials. American officials have said that the deteriorating weather conditions would not have affected the ability to conduct airstrikes.
The Iraqi security forces did not feel that they were supported as they could have been. They did not feel they had the resources, they did not feel they were in a position to win, said Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, speaking broadly about the Iraqi troop pullout from Ramadi.
Iraqi State Television announced today the start of an operation to drive ISIS out of Anbar Province and retake the provincial capital of Ramadi, though no details were provided.
We welcome the news from Prime Minister al Abadi that they will begin a counteroffensive to retake Ramadi and we will continue to support them, Warren said.
American officials said the Iraqi offensive to retake Ramadi had not yet begun. One U.S. official said the expectation is that it will begin in a matter of days.
The Iraqi offensive will include a mix of Iraqi military forces serving alongside 3,000 militia forces, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, that have gathered in Habbaniyah outside of Ramadi.
Warren described shaping operations by the Iraqi military to secure lines of communications, secure key road junctures and intersections and secure terrain prior to a full-on offensive.
While the offensive had not yet begun, he said there had been clashes outside the city between forward elements of ISIS and Iraqi military forces, who are both moving forward to conduct reconnaissance and probe each others positions.

        <title>Woman Pulled Plug on Fiance's Kayak, DA Says</title>
        <Link>http://abcnews.go.com/US/hudson-river-kayak-mystery-vincent-viafores-body-idd/story?id=31307061</Link>
        <Description>Prosecutors charged Graswald with murder about 2 weeks after the incident.</Description>
        <MainBody>PHOTO: Vincent Viafore is shown in this still image.
Prosecutors originally announced a second-degree murder charge against Graswald about two weeks after the incident.
The second-degree murder charge in the indictment -- made public today -- carries a potential penalty of as many as 25 years to life, Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler said.
New York State Police said Saturday a body was pulled from the river near West Point and was taken to the Orange County Medical Examiner for an autopsy and identification. Police did not identify the body at the time.
Deputies were on a boat to provide security for the West Point graduation last Saturday when they got a report about a possible human body at around 10 a.m., officials said. State police responded and the body was retrieved near the middle of the river.
Officials did not comment today on the condition of the body or the cause of death, adding that the investigation is ongoing.
New York State Police
PHOTO: Angelika Graswald, 35, has been charged with second-degree murder.
New York State Police originally said rough water and strong winds caused Viafore's kayak to overturn on April 19.
Graswald, a Latvian national, initially said she fell out of her kayak while trying to help her fiance, then was found by a boater and rescued, police said. She called 911 to report the accident, officials added. Police noted at the time of the incident that Graswald was treated for hypothermia at a local hospital and released.
Then, prosecutors said last month that Graswald admitted to investigators that she tampered with Viafore's kayak so that it would take on water. Prosecutors said Graswald also told police that she watched Viafore struggle in the Hudson's icy waters for several minutes before he went under.
Prosecutors said Graswald admitted to New York State Police that it "felt good knowing that he was going to die," and implied that "this was her only way out."
"I don't think she said that," Graswald's attorney Richard Portale told ABC News today. "I think if she said it, it would be memorialized. They would have it on video, but I don't think she said it."
And while the District Attorney alleges Graswald removed a plug from her fiancee's kayak, Portale said the plug wasn't in the kayak in the first place.
"Vince knew that it wasn't in the kayak. He had taken several kayaking trips without it," Portale said.
Portale said Graswald is thankful the District Attorney has filed the indictment.
"She's looking forward to clearing her name," Portale said. "This is a terrible rush to judgment, and now I think that... the government's trying to backfill the evidence."
Portale said the couple had an "amazing relationship."
"I can say I have not spoken to anyone who has said that they had a rocky relationship, that they would fight," Portale said.
"She's pretty torn up," Portale added.

After charging Graswald with second-degree murder, prosecutors said her motive was two life insurance policies that could benefit her for a total of about $250,000. Graswald even "talked about what she could possibly do with the money," prosecutors said. But Portale said today he cannot confirm that.
Portale said Graswald plans to plead not guilty. Her bail has been set at $3 million.
Graswald is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Orange County Court in Goshen, New York.

Thieves used an online service provided by the IRS to gain access to information from more than 100,000 taxpayers, the agency said Tuesday. The information included tax returns and other tax information on file with the IRS. The IRS said the thieves accessed a system called "Get Transcript."

Sophisticated criminals used an online service run by the IRS to access personal tax information from more than 100,000 taxpayers, part of an elaborate scheme to steal identities and claim fraudulent tax refunds, the IRS said Tuesday.
The thieves accessed a system called "Get Transcript," where taxpayers can get tax returns and other filings from previous years. In order to access the information, the thieves cleared a security screen that required knowledge about the taxpayer, including Social Security number, date of birth, tax filing status and street address, the IRS said.
"We're confident that these are not amateurs," said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. "These actually are organized crime syndicates that not only we but everybody in the financial industry are dealing with."
Koskinen wouldn't say whether investigators believe the criminals are based overseas  or where they obtained enough personal information about the taxpayers to access their returns. The IRS has launched a criminal investigation. The agency's inspector general is also investigating.
Identity thieves, both foreign and domestic, have stepped up their efforts in recent years to claim fraudulent tax refunds. The agency estimates it paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent refunds to identity thieves in 2013.
"Eighty percent of the of the identity theft we're dealing with and refund fraud is related to organized crime here and around the world," Koskinen said. "These are extremely sophisticated criminals with access to a tremendous amount of data."
Congress is already pressing the IRS for information about the breach.
"That the IRS  home to highly sensitive information on every single American and every single company doing business here at home  was vulnerable to this attack is simply unacceptable," said Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "What's more, this agency has been repeatedly warned by top government watchdogs that its data security systems are inadequate against the growing threat of international hackers and data thieves."
Koskinen said the agency was alerted to the thieves when technicians noticed an increase in the number of taxpayers seeking transcripts.
The IRS said they targeted the system from February to mid-May. The service has been temporarily shut down.
Taxpayers sometimes need copies of old tax returns to apply for mortgages or college aid. While the system is shut down, taxpayers can still apply for transcripts by mail.
The IRS said its main computer system, which handles tax filing submissions, remains secure.
"In all, about 200,000 attempts were made from questionable email domains, with more than 100,000 of those attempts successfully clearing authentication hurdles," the agency said. "During this filing season, taxpayers successfully and safely downloaded a total of approximately 23 million transcripts."
The agency is still determining how many fraudulent tax refunds were claimed this year using information from the stolen transcripts. Koskinen provided a preliminary estimate, saying less than $50 million was successfully claimed.
Thieves can also use the information to claim fraudulent tax refunds in the future. As identity theft has exploded, the agency has added filters to its computer system to identify suspicious returns. These filters look for anomalies in the information provided by the taxpayer.

The White House is not disputing Defense Secretary Ash Carter's contention that the Iraqi Army lacks the will to fight.
Well, that certainly has been a problem weve seen in the past; that's what allowed ISIL to make such significant gains last summer, Press Secretary Josh Earnest told ABC News in todays press briefing when pressed on whether the White House agreed with Carter's assessment about why Ramadi , the capital city of Iraqs largest province, fell to ISIS .
Carter said Sunday in an interview on CNNs State of the Union, What apparently happened was that the Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight. They were not out-numbered but in fact they vastly outnumbered the opposing force, and yet they failed to fight.
It initially appeared Monday that Vice President Joe Biden was patching up Carter's remark by placing a call to Iraq s prime minister to reaffirm U.S. support and recognize the enormous sacrifice and bravery of Iraqi forces. But there was no hint of an apology in todays briefing.
What the Iraqi government has acknowledged is that the setback that they experienced in Ramadi was at least in part attributable to a breakdown in some military command and planning, Earnest told reporters today.
Earnest did not directly answer the question when asked whether the president agreed with Carter and instead listed a variety of factors that he said contributed to a weak security situation in Ramadi.
The first is that the Iraqi security forces who were fighting in Ramadi and had been fighting in Ramadi didnt have benefit of the training of the US and our coalition partners, Earnest said. There were clearly, as the Iraqis have indicated, some military command and planning problems that occurred. And we saw a pretty effective tactic used by ISIL, and all of that led to a not unsubstantial setback in Ramadi.
The White House press secretary went on to praise the offensive launched by Iraq this morning to reclaim western Anbar province but reiterated the administrations intention to stay the course with its supporting role.
This is not something the United States is willing to do for the Iraqi people, Earnest said. And the Iraqi central government, Prime Minister Abadi has made crystal clear on a number of occasions, he doesn't want anybody to step in and do this for them.

BURLINGTON, Vermont  May 26, 2015, 8:31 PM ET
Senator Bernie Sanders officially announces his run for president during an event at Waterfront Park in Burlington, Vt., May 26, 2015.
ABC News

The longest-serving Independent senator in U.S. history, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, kicked-off his presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination today with a colorful and lively event in Burlington.
With blue-grass music, tie-dye and free ice cream, the afternoon event felt half like a summer festival and half like a political rally.
Sen. Bernie Sanders Says America Needs 'Political Revolution' in 2016
A self-identified "Democratic Socialist," Sanders is known on Capitol Hill for speaking about income inequality and higher tax rates for corporations and the nations top earners. Sanders wasted little time getting to his favorite issues.
Today, we say clearly enough is enough, he said. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not just a handful of billionaires.
There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much as wealth as the bottom 90 percent. This has got to change and, as your president, together we will change it," Sanders said.
In addition to campaign finance reform , Sanders made sure to hit on other hot-button progressive issues too, including equal pay for women and climate change .
When asked why they like him, many of the more than 5,000 Sanders fans gathered were quick to point to trustworthiness. Some said they feel like they know him. One of the senators first -- and most fun -- endorsements came from Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerrys, the popular Vermont-based ice cream company.
Speaking at the event, Cohen reiterated this idea of authenticity.
Unlike some other Johnny-come-latelys, Bernie is the real thing. He has been saying the same thing and doing the same thing for 30 years, Cohen said.
Kathy Granai, who works in Burlington, where Sanders was mayor for four terms, agreed. He is speaking the truth, she said. He is the only one willing to say whats what and what matters.
Another Burlington local, Jacob Albee, said the question of trustworthiness was the reason he preferred Sanders to Hillary Clinton , the former secretary of state.
He is willing to speak the truth when others are unwilling, Albee said. I dont think she speaks the truth."
During the rally, Sanders said his campaign was not about him, Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush , but the needs of the American people.
As someone who has never ran a never negative political ad in my life. My campaign will not be run by political gossip. These are serious times, we need serious debates," he said.
While Sanders might be the best known politician here, he is relatively unknown in other parts of the country. He is polling in single digits nationwide. The Sanders team said its strategy for breaking through will focus on small, town hall-style events.
For supporters of Sanders, its about the rest of the country meeting the Bernie they know and love.
For those of us that have been sitting on the sidelines, finally a candidate worth voting for, Cohen said. Sometimes the underdog wins.

Just days after protests over a police shooting verdict rocked Cleveland, the Justice Department said it has reached a settlement with the city to overhaul a police department that has shown a pattern and practice of unnecessary force. The settlement comes after a Cleveland patrolman was acquitted Friday for his role in the fatal shootings of two unarmed black people in 2012.
Hundreds of Protestors Take to the Streets After Cleveland Police Officer Gets Not Guilty Verdict
In announcing the agreement today, Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta said, Today, Cleveland demonstrates to the rest of the country that people can come together across perceived differences to realize a common vision of a safer, more just city.
Gupta said the DOJ investigation of the Cleveland Police revealed that many officers have not been properly trained in the use of force, or community policing.
The agreement will now require the Cleveland Police to provide improved training and guidance on when and how officers may use force. Officers will be trained to use de-escalation techniques, rather than force, whenever possible. In addition, if force is used, officers will immediately provide emergency first aid as necessary, Gupta said.
In addition, officers will receive training related to bias-free policing. In an effort to address the distrust between the police and the community, the agreement sets up a new Community Police Commission, representing faith-based organizations, civil rights advocates, police unions, the business/philanthropic community and youth organizations, to work with the Police to improve community policing, bias-free policing and transparency.
The agreement also calls for the placement of a civilian at the head of Internal Affairs to help ensure that internal investigations of misconduct are reliable. That could cause controversy with rank-and-file officers, but Police Chief Calvin Williams said he was OK with having a civilian head up internal affairs.
This just adds another layer of accountability," Williams said.
Mayor Frank Jackson said, This is really a defining moment for the city of Cleveland. It will define who we are as a people, who we are as a city.
The agreement contains 105 pages of reforms, including:
-- Reforms in the way that CDP recruits, selects, guides, trains, supervises, investigates and disciplines officers to ensure that officers are practicing constitutional, community-oriented policing, and that officers who fall short of this standard are held accountable.
-- CDP will develop an Equipment and Resource Plan for necessary equipment, including computers and safe vehicles, to submit to the independent monitor.
-- CDP will implement an effective employee assistance program that provides officers ready access to the mental health and support resources necessary to facilitate effective and constitutional policing.
-- The Division of Police must also create a Mental Health Response Advisory Committee that will foster relationships and build support between police, the community and mental health providers. The Division of Police will ensure all officers receive core training in responding to individuals in crisis, and Specialized Crisis Intervention Trained officers will receive advanced training.
In light of the work that has already been done," Gupta said. "I feel confident that transformation is coming to Cleveland."
The protests in Cleveland over the Memorial Day weekend were triggered by the acquittal of Officer Michael Brelo on manslaughter charges in the deaths of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams in 2012. Russell and Williams were killed after they allegedly led police on a long car chase across Cleveland that eventually grew to more than 60 police cars.
Prosecutors charged that once the car was finally stopped, more than a dozen officers fired more than 100 rounds into the vehicle. Officer Brelo was accused of climbing in the hood of the car and shooting 15 rounds through the windshield, striking Russell and Williams.
The Justice Department said it is continuing its investigation of that shooting, despite Brelos acquittal, and it could bring federal civil rights charges against the officer.

The eruption of a mile-high volcano on one of the Galapagos Islands this week has triggered concerns for the fragile and world-renowned ecosystem on the remote islands. But volcanic activity isnt the biggest threat to the region made famous by Charles Darwins studies on evolution, according to wildlife experts.
WATCH: Galapagos Island Volcano Erupts
Volcanism and eruptions are a normal part of the evolutionary ecology on the Galapagos Islands, Steve Walsh, the director of the Center for Galapagos Studies at the University of North Carolina, told ABC News. We seem to be excited about a volcano, but the Galapagos are under siege by a lot of different things.
"There are far more human-induced threats to the species of the Galapagos," said Hugo Arnal, the World Wildlife Fund's director for Ecuador .
Experts list invasive species , overfishing, pollution, overpopulation and unsustainable tourism as more significant threats.

Since Charles Darwins arrival in 1835, the Galapagos have been called a living laboratory of evolution because of wildlife found only on these islands. Giant tortoises, pink iguanas, red-footed boobies, and thousands of other unique species can only be found there.
For the first time in 33 years, Isabela Islands Wolf Volcano erupted on Monday, shooting rivers of lava down its slopes and filling the night sky with a red glare. Technicians at the Galapagos National Park determined the lava is flowing southeast and seems to be sparing the northern section of the island where the worlds only population of pink iguanas lives.
The population of the pink iguanas, yellow iguanas and land turtles are in the northeast and are out of danger, said Danny Reuda, director of ecosystems at the Galapagos National Park Service , the Ecuadorian agency responsible for managing the Galapagos.

There is no human population near the volcano. Puerto Villamil, the nearest town, is located 115 kilometers to the south.
There is some loss of vegetation, but its an opportunity for other species to grow, Reuda said, calling the eruption a natural process. He added that officials would not interfere with the lava flow, which is beginning to freeze.

People may be a bigger threat than lava, experts say. Census data shows more than 26,000 people live on the islands, a UNESCO world heritage site. Unbeknownst to many tourists, the islands do not have widespread public sewage systems, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Sewage is left to seep into the ground and the sea. With the spike in tourism, the Galapagos' pristine landscape is in danger of being transformed.
"There has been an explosion in the number of hotels and restaurants," said WWF's Arnal, who argued that the increase in tourism is the main driver for expanding trade across the archipelago, creating more chances for invasive species to reach the pristine islands.

Introduced plants and animals, ranging from cats to avocados, represent a huge threat to native species, which lack natural predators and are defenseless to invasive predators, according to the Galapagos National Park Service. At one point, an estimated 100,000 feral goats lived on Isabela Island and devastated the ecosystem through overgrazing. The park service eventually was forced to adopt a radical eradication plan involving helicopter-mounted machine guns and radio collared Judas goats used to locate herds. The plan was deemed a success in 2005 when the last feral goat was removed from Isabela Island, though some 266 Judas goes remain for monitoring purposes.

His fellow New Orleans police officers responded to the shooting and found that Bennett's car had rolled forward and struck a curb, police said.
A HANO officer "investigates complaints, maintains order, aids individuals, and identifies criminal offenders," according to a summary of the position on hano.org. HANO officers also perform "unplanned physical tasks which include the restraining of violent individuals, running, climbing fences and responding to EMS and rescue emergencies. Officers must handle gun belts," the summary said.
New Orleans Coroner Jeffrey C. Rouse said in a statement: "May God bless both the Bennett family and the entire family of law enforcement officers who keep civilization going with their sacrifices, great and small."
New Orleans police said today the shooting remains under investigation and no additional information is available.

Tragedies that involve our men and women in uniform affect our entire city and touch every member of our law enforcement community. We are deeply saddened by this loss, and our hearts and prayers are with the officer's friends and family and with the entire HANO family during this very difficult time.

Fort Lauderdale City Manager called Memorial Day 's beach bounce house incident "a freak act of nature that no one could have prepared for or predicted."
"The change in weather was sudden and severe," the statement from City Manager Lee Feldman said. "An intense water spout came ashore rapidly and without warning bringing forceful winds that meteorologists have estimated were between 65 and 85 miles per hour. Its powerful unpredictable path knocked down street lights and destroyed a cement basketball support structure."
After a waterspout came ashore on the Florida beach, it hit an inflated bouncy castle, tossing it into the air and injuring three children.

The video, provided to ABC News by Brandon Burchett, shows the swirling column of wind and ocean water head straight towards the amusement ride. The bouncy castle then got caught in the wind and flipped over repeatedly before it was swept even further up in the air.
The Fort Lauderdale Police Department said three children, whose identities would not be released, were injured. One was held overnight for observation and two were treated for minor fractures and released, police said.
Feldman's statement added: "Under the circumstances, our Police, Public Safety and Fire-Rescue personal responded quickly and appropriately to minimize injuries and damage. While our thoughts and prayers remain with the injured children and their families for a speedy recovery, we are grateful that this act of god did not cause any more serious harm given the large number of people who were enjoying the beach on Memorial Day."
The city said it has already put the bounce house vendor, All Star Events, on notice of their responsibility as "we continue to investigate the incident."
All Star Events declined to comment to ABC News.

        <MainBody>Receding Texas Floodwaters Can Leave Behind Health Hazards

Despite receding floodwaters in Texas and Oklahoma, dangers can persist as residents begin the process of cleaning up the mess left behind.
At least three people were killed in Texas and many more injured as floodwaters hit the state Monday night.
Bristel Minsker, spokeswoman for American Red Cross , said a big risk for residents is that remaining floodwater can be toxic after washing over roads and even bringing cars and other debris along.
"The Blanco River overflowed and its been running through the state and pushing all this debris down through the state," said Minsker, who called the water extremely toxic.

Minsker said it's important to keep young children and pets away from the water so they don't ingest any of it. For people who had to wade through dirty water to get to safety, Minsker recommends immediately showering and washing clothes to get out any toxins that were washed into the water during the flood.
Minsker said residents should only return home after officials have given the all-clear and always check for downed power lines, foundation cracks or broken gas lines before entering the home.
She also said any food that comes into contact with floodwaters, even bottled water or canned goods, needs to be thrown out.
Another unexpected hazard for those returning home: wildlife.
"Were hearing a lot of reports of snakes getting washed on to peoples property," said Minsker, who warned that people should stay far away because the animals might be panicked or aggressive.
"Theyve been driven from their natural rural home. Its an area they are not comfortable with," she said.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said as residents are able to clean up more and more, there will be other issues they face including mold or dust that can exacerbate asthma or breathing problems.
"You can get mold growing up on things that youre then trying to clear out," Schaffner said.

Minsker of the Red Cross said it's key for residents with a flooded home to add fans or dehumidifiers to try and keep the mold from growing and causing health problems.
Also, as mud dries it can turn into dust that affects the lungs, said Dr. Schaffner, who recommends wearing a surgical mask.
Schaffner said anyone who had a wound exposed to floodwaters should seek medical attention to see whether they should get a tetanus booster shot.
In addition to short-term problems, Schaffner said, there's another hazard that could last long after the floodwaters recede. He said he's concerned that standing water could mean in increase in the West Nile virus carried by mosquitoes, especially as summer approaches.
"All this floodwater is going to leave puddles and pockets of water that will be great breeding grounds of mosquitoes," Schaffner said. "If there are a lot of mosquitoes, more mosquitoes will bit birds and then bite people," spreading the virus.
The Texas Department of Health has a full list of recommendations on flood safety here .

GRAND FORKS, N.D.  May 26, 2015, 6:06 PM ET
By JAMES MacPHERSON and BLAKE NICHOLSON Associated Press

The Associated Press
A U.S. airman "with no apparent motive" walked into a Wal-Mart Supercenter in North Dakota early Tuesday and opened fire with a handgun, killing one worker and injuring a second before turning the gun on himself, police said.
Grand Forks police said the shooting a few minutes after 1 a.m. may have been random, with no link yet found between Marcell Willis, 21, and either the store or the employees. Willis was stationed at Grand Forks Air Force Base, about a dozen miles west of the city.
"We've not been able to find any linkage to him and any of the victims," police Lt. Derik Zimmel said at an afternoon news conference. "There's no apparent motive that jumps out at this time."
Authorities didn't immediately identify the two workers who were shot or a third worker they say Willis shot at but missed. The injured person was taken to Altru Hospital in Grand Forks with a gunshot wound that was not believed life-threatening, Zimmel said. An Altru spokeswoman said the person was in satisfactory condition Tuesday afternoon.
Willis was given medical treatment at the scene and taken to Altru, where he was pronounced dead, Zimmel said.
Willis was the only person with a gun and no police officers fired a weapon, according to Zimmel. A handgun was recovered near Willis' body, Zimmel said.
Zimmel said police believe the airman fired only three shots before shooting himself. Police did not identify the type of handgun or its caliber.
Andy Legg, who was in the store at the time of the shooting, told WDAZ-TV he heard "popping sounds" shortly before authorities herded him and other customers to a safe section of the store.
"I saw people running. At that time, we heard people screaming, one yelling for help," he said.
When police later escorted them from the building, they passed a Wal-Mart employee lying on the ground, covered in blood.
"It's just something you don't see every day and really don't want to see," Legg said. "I had goose bumps for probably two hours after that."
Amy Mehs, Willis' girlfriend who lives in Hatton, North Dakota, about 35 miles southwest of Grand Forks, was in tears when contacted by The Associated Press Tuesday afternoon.
"I really can't say anything right now because it's still under investigation," she said. "You guys will find out everything eventually."
Sean Willis of Nashville , Tennessee , said only that his son had been in the military for about three years and was originally from Springfield, Tennessee.
Sgt. David Dobrydney, a base spokesman, said he couldn't yet release any information about Willis due to Air Force regulations.
The Wal-Mart is one of two in the northeastern North Dakota city of about 55,000 people. The store is open 24 hours, though it was closed Tuesday while authorities investigated the shooting. The company said it did not know when the store would reopen.
Wal-Mart spokesman Brian Nick said in a statement that there were about 30 employees and 20 customers in the store at the time of the shooting.
"There weren't a lot due to the early morning hour," Nick said.
The company said it was "deeply saddened" by the attack.
About 1,500 airmen are assigned to the Grand Forks Air Force Base, the military said. The base was home to air refueling tankers for 50 years until a round of military base closings and realignments took that away. The last tankers left in 2011 and the base has taken on an unmanned aircraft mission.

        <MainBody>12 People Fatally Shot in Chicago Over Memorial Day Weekend
CHICAGO  May 26, 2015, 1:56 PM ET
Twelve people were killed and more than 40 more were wounded in shootings in Chicago during the Memorial Day long weekend.
The Cook County Medical Examiner's office on Tuesday confirmed the 12 deaths. Police say the spate of gunfire injured dozens more, including a 4-year-old girl who was shot in the head at about 8 p.m. Friday on the city's South Side.
Chicago has seen similar spikes of violence on previous Memorial Day weekends. It is also the start of a season when the numbers of homicides typically climb. Police have in recent years responded by flooding the streets with officers working overtime to combat the violence.
Department statistics show that as of mid-May there were 133 homicides in Chicago  19 more than in the same period last year.

A cherry picker accident that left a man and his nephew dead and injured three other children happened as the man was giving neighborhood kids a demonstration of the elevated lift, authorities said.
The cherry picker carrying the group toppled over from a strong gust of wind Sunday afternoon, fell on a power line and crashed about 50 feet to the ground, police said. All five were thrown from the lift.
Police on Tuesday identified the man as Ken Raschick, 56. His 12-year-old nephew also died after what police described as a tragic accident.
Police spokeswoman Celina Espinoza said Raschick's 10-year-old son was in stable condition and his 7-year-old son was in critical condition. A 10-year-old neighbor also was in critical condition.
Espinoza said no charges are pending and the department's crimes against children unit is investigating.
"Investigators believe the crane's stabilizing legs were not deployed and the equipment was perched on top of a flatbed truck as the occupants took a ride in the bucket. Both factors, along with weather, likely contributed to the incident," she said.
The equipment belonged to Raschick's tree cutting service.

Earlier this year, Jones snapped a picture of her daughter with another young cancer patient as they looked out on the Pittsburgh skyline, reportedly at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Jones told WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh that Maliyah had met her new friend that day and was just excited to hang out.
"We just met that day. Maliyah ran up to her," Jones told WPXI-TV. "They were hugging and looking out the window and I asked, 'Can I take a picture of them.' And I took the picture and that was it."
Jones said on Facebook that Maliyah is now getting further treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, after having a relapse this year.
Jones, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

ABC News
Lilly Pulitzer is again stirring up controversy along with it's colorful cocktail-and-dress culture, but it has nothing to do with it's Black-Friday-style team-up with Target last month.
The brand's King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, headquarters was the subject of an online story and slideshow Tuesday on New York magazine's The Cut. Among the photos of pink-and-green clad and perfectly coiffed employees there's one photo that stands out.
In what appear to be hand-drawn illustrations, an overweight woman is captioned with the saying, "Just another day of fat, white and hideous. You should probably just kill yourself." Another depicts a similarly shaped woman in a bikini with the saying, "Put it down carb face."
WATCH: Lilly Pulitzer Collection Causes Frenzy for Target
In a slide prior to the one causing controversy, an employee is quoted as saying Lilly herself was "ultrainclusive." But social media has labeled the image as fat shaming.

The image in the slideshow was originally run with no information in the caption. The site later added: "(This image shows the personal illustrations of an employee not pictured in this story.)"
These illustrations were the work of one individual and were posted in her personal work area," Jane Schoenborn, vice president of creative communications at Lilly Pulitzer, told ABC News in an emailed statement. "While we are an employer that does encourage people to decorate their own space, we are a female-dominated company and these images do not reflect our values. We apologize for any harm this may have caused.
New York Media would not comment except to say the photo was taken in a Lilly Pulitzer employee's office. The photographer did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the circumstances surrounding the photo.
The Target-Lilly Pulitzer collaboration was an overall hit with consumers, but some potential customers were upset when Target announced in January they would only sell up to size 18 in the stores. Larger sizes would be available online only.

        <MainBody>Actor Sam Shepard Arrested for Drunken Driving in Santa Fe
SANTA FE, N.M.  May 26, 2015, 6:53 PM ET

Actor and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sam Shepard was arrested Monday on suspicion of drunken driving after a Santa Fe restaurant's security complained about a possibly intoxicated driver.
The 71-year-old Shepard told a police officer that he had two tequila drinks and was planning to drive home, Santa Fe police Lt. Andrea Dobyns said Tuesday. "Our officer could smell alcohol on his breath, and he had bloodshot, watery eyes," she said.
Shepard was arrested on a charge of aggravated driving while intoxicated outside La Choza restaurant in downtown.
The restaurant's security called police about 7:45 p.m. Monday concerned about an intoxicated driver, Dobyns said. The man was trying to leave in the pickup, but the vehicle's emergency brake was engaged.
Shepherd declined to take a breath test, but he did perform a field sobriety test, which he failed, Dobyns said.
It wasn't immediately clear if Shepard had an attorney. Santa Fe jail records show that Shepard was released Tuesday afternoon after posting bail.
The office of Shepard's agent said Tuesday that it had no comment.
Shepard won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for his play "Buried Child." His film credits, among others, include "Country," ''Baby Boom," ''Steel Magnolias," ''Thunderheart," ''Black Hawk Down," ''The Notebook," and "Walker Payne."
Playing Chuck Yeager in a drama about the birth of America's space program, "The Right Stuff" earned Shepard an Academy Award nomination. His play "True West," depicting a rivalry between two estranged brothers, has been revived numerous times and starred high-profile actors over the years.
The Sante Fe Institute, a transdisciplinary research community, lists the actor as a Miller Scholar.
Monday's arrest appears to be Shepard's second on charges of drunken driving. In January 2009, he was arrested on charges of speeding and drunken driving in the central Illinois town of Normal. Shepard was driving 16 mph over the 30 mph speed limit, police said. A breath test then indicated his blood-alcohol level was double the legal limit. The actor told police then that he had been at a tavern in nearby Bloomington and was heading to a hotel.
Shepard pleaded guilty and was fined $600 and court costs and placed on 24 months of supervision. He also had to finish an alcohol treatment program and perform 100 hours of community service.

"Im not going to lie. Working out sucks," she told the June issue . "Which is why I love taking classes, because Im surrounded by other people and that keeps me motivated and accountable."
The 34-year-old actress-turned-entrepreneur said she likes to mix up her workout.
Jessica Alba Now 'Confident in My Sexuality'
"I have to break a sweat or I dont feel like Ive gotten anything done," she said. "These days, I do power yoga with light weights in a 105 degree room, so its a mix of hot yoga and strength training. I also spin. The key for me is good music, like 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne , Rihanna , Jay-Z, Beyonc."
If she only has 30 minutes, Alba said, "I'll do a series of burpees, mountain climbers, squat jumps, planks, and a few sun salutations."
Alba's road to fitness began more than a decade ago, while filming the "Dark Angel" series.
"I attribute my athletic body to the martial arts, gymnastics, dance, and strength training I did while filming 'Dark Angel,'" she told Shape. "Thats made me strong and really set the bar."
But it wasn't until having her children that she felt comfortable with her body.
"I wasnt truly confident about my body until I had my daughters, Honor, 7, and Haven, 3. I felt more comfortable in my own skin after they were born," she said. "Plus, if I want them to be happy with their bodies, I need to walk the walk."
But this active mom and Honest Company founder has also found ways to be still.
"When I need to zone out and quiet my mind, I listen to a meditation podcast from the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center [marc.ucla.edu]," she said. "Each one is literally just three minutes long, so I can go into a bathroom stall or do it in my car. But Im really intrigued by Transcendental Meditation. Everyone I know who does TM has this inner peace and a glow. I want that."

Taylor Swift has a confession: Being a pop star may look like a lot of work but it isn't.
"It's not that hard, I'm telling you now it's really not," the 25-year-old Grammy winner told British radio host Nick Grimshaw, according to the BBC . "Sometimes I really don't think it's that hard at all."
The "Style" singer admits that it's gotten easier as her star has risen.
Taylor Swift's Mom Misheard 'Starbucks Lovers' Too
"When I was starting out I'd go on tour for three months and I was gone for three months," she told Grimshaw. "Now almost 10 years in I thank God we get to play bigger shows so I don't have to play as many."
She explained: "If we're playing stadiums, I'll do two or three a week, not five shows a week, then I get to fly home in between. It's not that bad. It's not that hard. It's made out to be harder than it is."
There is one thing that's hard.
"I do have to leave the cats behind when I leave the country, which is the hardest part," she said of her furry friends, Olivia and Meredith.
The pop star, who is in the midst of a world tour for her latest album, "1989," is the first to say she's not afraid of a little hard work.
"When you walk off stage and you're drenched in sweat and you're tired and your legs hurt... It feels like you're really working for the job," she said about her favorite part of touring. "It's nice to feel tired after a show. I'm like 'Oh my God, I'm finally doing something.' I really like the feeling of: 'You know what? I've been busy. I deserve this watching two hours of TV at the end of the night.'"
And what does she like to watch?
"I like Friends because I've seen every episode, so it's like switching my brain off," she told Grimshaw. "I know exactly what they're about to say."

Lena Dunham celebrated a different kind of freedom on Memorial Day -- by posting a photo of herself in her lingerie.
"Love my @lonelylingerie and I think I will wear it to dinner with some boots &amp; a smile because we are all very lucky to be free," she joked on Instagram.
Lena Dunham Shares Her Struggles with Body Image and OCD
Though the "Girls" creator and star tries to promote a body-positive image, she has admitted to her own personal struggles.
"I spend a lot of my career trying to break down the negative forces that the media exerts on women in trying to control their body image, so for me its all very sort of anathema to who I am to admit that I too have struggled with the concept of perfection," Dunham told ABC News' " Good Morning America " last fall.
For their Memorial Day dinner, Dunham's boyfriend, Jack Antonoff, appeared more covered up.
Dunham, 29, posted a snap of the musician wearing black pants and a shirt with a maroon blazer and gold medal. She captioned it, "Holiday Swagger."

It's been more than 30 years since Arnold Schwarzenegger graced the screen as Conan the Barbarian, but "The Legend of Conan," a follow-up to his 1982 and 1984 cult classics, is coming!
The film's writer, Chris Morgan, spoke to a Schwarzenegger fan site and spilled details of the movie that has die-hard fans full of excitement.
Read: Arnold Schwarzenegger Reveals How He Fought to Change 'I'll Be Back'
"Our tone is a logical extension of the character established in the 82 film ... but 30 years later. When we meet him again, Conan has been many things over the course of his life -- a thief, a warrior, a pirate, a king, a legend -- and is now an older man. Think 'Unforgiven' ... with a sword-wielding barbarian," Morgan told TheArnoldFans.com .
Morgan also spoke about following in the footsteps of the original director, John Milius.
"The goal, the dream, is to live up to his world. To make it worthy. And to expand on it in a truthful way that audiences will embrace. ... We plan nothing more than to immerse ourselves in the world Milius envisioned from Robert E. Howards unforgettable stories and Frank Frazettas stunning artwork. I cant give specifics (nobody likes a spoiler!), but know we are honoring the locales, the religions and the traditions of the 82 film," he said.
He added that "at least three" big names from original cast are coming back for this one.
Schwarzenegger, himself, shared a message with the site, saying, "It is the greatest honor to be 67 years old and to still be asked to come back into all those franchises."
"Whether it is the Terminator movie or it is now Conan, it is fantastic! As a matter of fact, when I get back to Los Angeles, I'll be getting the final script and then I will see it for the first time," he said. "But with Universal Pictures, I've tried to convince them now for 20 years to go back and continue with the Conan series and they were not as enthusiastic as I was. But then later, new management came in at Universal and they saw it entirely differently. They came to me right away and said they want to pick up the Conan series and to look at some writers and let's get going on that. So we've been working on Conan and I'm really excited to be working on this -- to do another Conan movie and hopefully it will be soon!"

Police in Benbrook, Texas, the victim's home city, said the suspect, 24-year-old Jessie Nicholas Williams, was killed.
The FBI would not confirm the death.
The gunfire erupted Tuesday afternoon at a Days Inn in Bossier City, Louisiana. Agents from the Shreveport FBI office were there looking for the girl, who was the subject of an Amber Alert .
Benbrook is about 220 miles west of Bossier City, near Fort Worth, Texas.

Floodwaters deepened across much of Texas on Tuesday as storms dumped almost another foot of rain on the Houston area, stranding hundreds of motorists and inundating the famously congested highways that serve the nation's fourth-largest city.
Meanwhile, the search went on for at least 13 people who were still missing, including a group that disappeared after a vacation home was swept down a river and slammed into a bridge.
Several more fatalities were reported  four in Houston and one more in Central Texas. That brought to 14 the number of people killed by the holiday weekend storms in Texas and Oklahoma .
Similar search efforts unfolded just south of the Texas-Mexico border, where crews tried to track down the missing and assessed damage in the city of Ciudad Acuna after a tornado killed 13 people Monday.
In Houston, the water rose sharply overnight as about 11 more inches of rain fell, much of it in a six-hour period. By Tuesday evening, most rivers had receded back within their banks.
The floodwaters affected virtually every part of the city and paralyzed some areas. Firefighters carried out more than 500 water rescues, most involving stranded motorists. At least 2,500 vehicles were abandoned by drivers seeking higher ground, officials said.
"Given the magnitude and how quickly it happened, in such a short period of time, I've never seen this before," said Rick Flanagan, Houston's emergency management coordinator.
The drenching weather threatened to linger. Forecasts called for a 20 to 40 percent chance of thunderstorms through the rest of the week in Houston.
The flooding closed several highways, and the ones that stayed open became a gridlocked mess.
Interstate 45 near downtown was backed up for miles on Tuesday morning, and a handful of motorists traveled the wrong way on the highway to retreat from high water.
The small cars weaved between massive 18-wheelers as other drivers stared at them in disbelief. With no end to the backup in sight, some drivers got off the freeway, only to be held up again by water covering nearby access roads.
In the Heights neighborhood about 5 miles from downtown, groups of people roamed the streets after escaping their stalled cars, and police cruisers blocked some dangerous roads.
Some motorists were stuck on I-45 all night, sleeping in their cars until the backup was cleared about 8 a.m.
NBA fans at the Toyota Center, where the Rockets hosted a Western Conference finals game against Golden State on Monday, were asked with about two minutes left in the game not to leave the arena because of the weather.
The game ended before 11 p.m., but about 400 people remained in their seats at 1:30 a.m., choosing to stay in the building rather than brave the flooded roads that awaited them outside. Up to 150 people stayed all right, according to arena officials.
A spokeswoman for the flood district of Harris County, which includes Houston, said up to 700 homes sustained some level of damage.
Yesenia Lopez and husband, Armando, waded through knee-deep water, carrying bags of possessions over their heads. During the night, a nearby bayou overflowed and flooded their apartment complex.
"We tried to do as much as we could, saved the family portraits and stuff like that, but everything else is destroyed," she said.
The two planned to stay with her mother-in-law.

7:30 p.m. CDT
A deadly tornado that touched down a northern Mexico border city destroyed 200 homes and damaged about 800.
Officials in Ciudad Acuna have corrected earlier numbers that indicated 800 homes were destroyed by Monday's tornado.
The sudden catastrophic storm killed 13 people.
Some affected homes were reduced to mounds of cinderblock and rubble.

7:15 p.m. CDT
Weather forecasters say Memorial Day weekend storms that dumped rain across two-thirds of Texas were epic not only in the area affected but in the intensity they maintained.
Meteorologist Kurt Van Speybroeck (SPY'-bruk) is an emergency response specialist for the National Weather Service Southern Regional Headquarters in Fort Worth. He says the storms that formed from the Texas Panhandle to the Edwards Plateau on Saturday unleashed what was, in some places, record flooding when it met rich Gulf moisture.
The Blanco River had a record flood that registered more than 40 feet before the gauge became inoperable. Flooding along the Red River and its tributaries was the worst for that basin since at least 2007 and perhaps since the mid-1980s. The flooding in the Houston area was the worst since Tropical Storm Allison in 2001.
Van Speybroeck says there won't be another broad rainstorm for several days, with only scattered thunderstorms expected. That should allow flooded basins to dry out.

6:30 p.m. CDT
Houston officials have confirmed another fatality from flash flooding.
A city statement says the latest fatality from flooding late Monday and early Tuesday is an Asian man whose body was found in Braes Bayou. They say he's likely a man who was lost during an attempted water rescue early Tuesday that led to the rescue boat capsizing. An elderly couple, ages 85 and 87, are still missing.
A total of four people have been killed in flooding in Houston.

6:15 p.m. CDT
Authorities say all streams in Harris County except one have returned to their banks.
The Harris County Flood Control District says waters were receding across the county except for the West Fork of the San Jacinto River in Humble. The district said that river will remain above its banks into the weekend.
The county is home to Houston. It was inundated by rain from storms during the Memorial Day weekend, causing flooding that affected almost every part of the city.

6 p.m. CDT
A man bicycling in Houston came across a casket that was apparently swept from a nearby cemetery into a roadway.
Authorities suspect floodwaters in southwestern Houston early Tuesday apparently carried the casket containing a woman's body from nearby Riceville Cemetery down Keegans Bayou onto South Braeswood Boulevard. That's where Walter Rubio found it.
Rubio told KTRK-TV ( http://abc13.co/1FVOIEM ) in Houston that he "got a little scared," so he went to find police.
Police spokeswoman Jodi Silva says officers opened the casket and found a body inside.
Authorities are still trying to establish the identity of the woman but suspect she died eight years ago.
Riceville Cemetery was founded in the 1850s and had its last burial in 2011.

5:12 p.m. CDT
Houston Mayor Annise Parker says three people who were on a boat are missing.
Parker said at a news conference Tuesday that the three people were with a group of six  including two firefighters  helping with rescue efforts in Houston overnight.

        <MainBody>Oregon Proposal Would Outlaw Sneak Photos up Women's Skirts
SALEM, Ore.  May 26, 2015, 8:38 PM ET
By SHEILA V KUMAR Associated Press
Oregon lawmakers on Tuesday advanced a proposal aimed at closing a loophole in state privacy laws that recently let a man go unpunished after he took photographs up a teenager's skirt.
The state Senate unanimously passed the bill, which would make it a misdemeanor to surreptitiously take photos up women's dresses without their consent. A teachers union proposed the measure after a student took so-called upskirt cellphone photos of an educator and shared them online.
The Senate vote came three months after an Oregon judge ruled a 61-year-old man did nothing illegal when he snapped photos up a teen's skirt in a Target store.
"You've probably seen in the news reports that currently the tactic of what's known as upskirting is not covered for various reasons," said Sen. Floyd Prozanksi, a Eugene Democrat. "This bill will, in fact, cover the infractions, the conduct and hold people accountable for that."
The judge in the Target case said that while the act was lewd and appalling, it didn't violate the state's existing voyeurism laws because the girl was clothed and in a public place.
Laurie Wimmer, an Oregon Education Association lobbyist, has said her organization proposed the bill in response to an incident a year ago involving teacher Dana Lovejoy.
In February, Lovejoy testified in favor of the measure before a House committee. She wore the same long, black dress she had on when the incident happened.
Lovejoy told lawmakers that during one of her classes last May, a middle school student stuck a camera phone under her skirt as she leaned over to help other students.
The student who took the images then disseminated them to classmates over various social media networks.
"Upon learning what happened I felt immediately in shock and violated. Not only was I photographed without my consent, not only was it of my genital area, but the majority of the school had seen it before I was even aware it existed," Lovejoy told the House Committee on Judiciary.
"Our laws have not kept up with technology," she added.
Several other states  including Kentucky , Florida, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania  have passed measures outlawing clandestine upskirt photos, though a similar bill in Wisconsin has stalled in the Senate.
The Massachusetts legislation also was aimed at closing a gap in privacy laws. It was passed two days after the state's highest court ruled a man who took cellphone photos up the skirts of female subway passengers in Boston was not violating state laws as written.
The Oregon proposal heads back to the House for consensus.

        <MainBody>Ducks Ds Causing Problems for Blackhawks
CHICAGO  May 26, 2015, 8:35 PM ET
By JAY COHEN AP Sports Writer
Anaheim stars Corey Perry, Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler are drawing a lot of attention in the Western Conference finals. When the Ducks' defensemen join the attack, it presents a big problem for the Chicago Blackhawks .
The Ducks got four points from their defensemen in Monday night's 5-4 overtime win that moved them within one victory of the Stanley Cup finals. It was their best total since their defensemen accounted for six points in a 6-1 victory over Calgary in Game 1 of their second-round series on April 30, according to STATS.
"The main thing that we've had throughout the playoffs is we've had scoring from all four lines and we've also had people on the back end who can pitch in every once in a while," defenseman Cam Fowler said Tuesday before the Ducks departed Southern California for Game 6 in Chicago.
"I think it puts more pressure on other teams defensively when they know there's not just going to be three forwards they have to worry about; they have to worry about the second wave coming in, which might be a fourth defenseman. That changes things a little bit."
Fowler and Sami Vatanen scored during Anaheim's fast start in Game 5. Vatanen also had an assist on Patrick Maroon's goal in the third. Anaheim leads the NHL with 42 points from defensemen in 14 playoff games, compared to 31 for Chicago in 15 games, according to STATS.
"It's been really essential. But it's happened all year," coach Bruce Boudreau said. "No one knew about it all year because nobody knew who Sami Vatanen or Hampus Lindholm were. They had an inkling of who Cam Fowler was. None of these guys were really on the radar as far offensive defensemen.
"But they're good puck-moving guys and they create offense. If you look at their numbers, they're all up there. Five out of the six, anyway, are always up there in the scoring for defensemen."
The performance in Game 5 ran their total for the series to 13 points. If Anaheim's defensemen fill up the scoresheet again on Wednesday night, that could spell the end for Chicago. But the seasoned Blackhawks are promising a fight to the finish.
"There's a lot of history here that we've collected over seven years. A lot of positive things," coach Joel Quenneville said. "I think we all came out of last night's game with an anger and a real sour taste in our mouth. Sometimes that can be better than a history lesson."
The Blackhawks trailed the Kings 3-1 in the Western Conference finals a year ago, and came all the way back to force a memorable Game 7 that ended on a deflected overtime goal by Los Angeles defenseman Alec Martinez. Chicago rallied from a 3-1 deficit against Detroit on its way to the 2013 Stanley Cup title.
"It's something we know we've done before," forward Brandon Saad said. "When we're in tight situations like this, we have a veteran group that has been through it and we know how to win games. We got to take care of tomorrow."
While the series has included three overtime games and alternating victories for each side, a big key on Wednesday night could be the start. The team that scored first has won each of the first five games.
The Ducks outscored the Blackhawks 3-0 in a dominant first period in Game 5. Chicago captain Jonathan Toews forced overtime with a pair of dramatic goals in the final two minutes of regulation, but Matt Beleskey got the win for Anaheim with his seventh goal of the playoffs just 45 seconds into the extra session.
The Blackhawks felt they had the Ducks on the run at the end of regulation, but overtime was over before they were able to get another crack at Frederik Andersen in a shaky stretch for the young goaltender.
"It seemed like, I don't know what it was, but like we were sleeping there at the start," Saad said. "Their goals piled on. Mistake after mistake. They capitalized on it. That's what a good team is going to do. We know we got to start better tomorrow."
