        <MainBody>Bill Cosby admitted to drugging women to have sex, rape accusers say they are vindicated

Several women who accused Bill Cosby of drugging and raping them are saying newly unsealed testimony by the comedian in a 2005 case corroborates their claims.
Cosby admitted to acquiring quaaludes with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with, and giving the drug to several women, in testimony for a sexual-abuse case filed by former Temple University employee Andrea Constand.
In documents obtained by The Associated Press, Cosby said he obtained seven quaalude prescriptions in the 1970s. Constand's lawyer asked if he had kept the sedatives through the 1990s, after they were banned, but was frustrated by objections from Cosby's attorney.
"When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?" Troiani asked.
"Yes," Cosby answered.
"Did you ever give any of these young women the quaaludes without their knowledge?" Troiani asked.

Cosby jokes about allegations
Cosby's lawyer again objected, leading Troiani to petition the federal judge to force Cosby to cooperate.
Cosby's lawyers insisted that two of the accusers knew they were taking quaaludes from the comedian, according to the unsealed documents.

Attorneys for some of the women now suing Cosby seized on the testimony as powerful evidence that what they have been saying all along is true: the comedian drugged and raped women.
Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing several women, said she hopes to use the admission in court cases against the comedian.
"This confirms the allegations of numerous victims who have said that he has used drugs in order to sexually assault them," Allred told FOX411. "This admission is one that Mr. Cosby has attempted to hide from the public for many years and we are very gratified that it is now being made public." 
Meanwhile, a lawyer for one woman, who says Bill Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 19, says the unsealing of portions of his 2005 testimony is a "significant and positive step." Therese Serignese went public with the allegations last November. She says Cosby assaulted her after a show in Las Vegas around 1976.
Lisa Bloom, attorney for model Janice Dickinson, who says she was drugged and raped, said: "If today's report is true, Mr. Cosby admitted under oath 10 years ago sedating women for sexual purposes. Given that, how dare he publicly vilify Ms. Dickinson and accuse her of lying when she tells a very similar story?"
Three women in Massachusetts are suing Cosby for defamation. The women say his representatives branded them liars when the representatives denied accusations that Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted them.
Lawyer Joe Cammarata represents one of the Massachusetts accusers. He says the use of drugs during sex has been a "recurring theme of the women's allegations." He says the documents unsealed appear to support their claims.
Cosby, 77, has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct in episodes dating back more than four decades. Cosby has never been charged with a crime, and the statute of limitations on most of the accusations has expired.
The AP had gone to court to compel the release of the 2004 deposition. Cosby's lawyers had objected to the release of the material, arguing it would embarrass him. Ultimately, a judge unsealed just a small portion of the deposition.
"The stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct is a matter as to which the AP -- and by extension the public -- has a significant interest," U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno wrote.
Cosby, with his oft-espoused views on topics including childrearing, family life, education and crime "has voluntarily narrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim," the judge wrote.
Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on "The Cosby Show" from 1984 to 1992, settled Constand's lawsuit under confidential terms in 2006. His lawyers in the Philadelphia case did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment on Monday. Constand consented to be identified but did not want to comment, her lawyer said.
"This evidence shows a pattern in which defendant 'mentored' naive young women and introduced drugs into the relationship, with and without the woman's knowledge, in order for him to achieve sexual satisfaction," Constand's lawyer, Dolores M. Troiani, argued in court papers.
Cosby later said he gave Constand three half-pills of Benadryl, although Troiani in the documents voices doubt that was the drug involved.
Cosby had fought the AP's efforts to unseal the testimony, with his lawyer arguing that the deposition could reveal details of Cosby's marriage, sex life and prescription drug use.
It would be terribly embarrassing for this material to come out," lawyer George M. Gowen III argued in June.
He also said the material would "prejudice him in eyes of the jury pool in Massachusetts," where Cosby is fighting defamation lawsuits brought by women who say his representatives smeared them by accusing them of lying.
Robreno asked last month why Cosby was fighting the release of his sworn testimony, given that the accusations in the Constand lawsuit were already public.
"Why would he be embarrassed by his own version of the facts?" the judge said.
Cosby resigned in December from the board of trustees at Temple University, where he was the popular face of the Philadelphia school in advertisements, fundraising campaigns and commencement speeches.
Lawyer Gayle Sproul, representing the AP, in court last month called the married Cosby "an icon" who "held himself out as someone who would guide the public in ways of morality."
Troiani, summarizing her evidence, painted a starkly different picture.
Cosby "has evidenced a predilection for sexual contact with women who are unconscious or drugged. His victims are young, 'star struck' and totally trusting of his public persona," Troiani argued.
Cosby's lawyers have not returned messages seeking comment.

        <MainBody>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras To Present New Proposals At Emergency Euro Zone Summit
Reuters | By                                                                      Paul Taylor and Costas Pitas

BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis  Tsipras had a final chance to present credible reform proposals  to an emergency euro zone summit on Tuesday to persuade  skeptical creditors to reopen aid talks before his country's  banks run out of money.
With Greek lenders down to their last few days of cash and  the European Central Bank tightening the noose on their funding,  Tsipras must convince the bloc's other 18 leaders, many of whom  are exasperated with five years of crisis, to authorize  negotiations fast on a new loan to rescue Greece.
But Greek officials said the leftist premier's proposals  would not go far beyond a plan he sent to the euro zone last  week before Greek voters overwhelmingly rejected the austerity  terms of a bailout in a referendum on Sunday.
The leaders of Germany and France, the currency area's two  main powers, said after conferring on Monday that the door was  still open to a deal to save Greece from plunging into economic  turmoil and ditching the euro.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, under pressure in Germany to cut  Greece loose, made clear it was up to Tsipras to come up with  convincing proposals after Athens spurned the tax rises,  spending cuts and pension and labor reforms that were on the  table before its 240 billion euro bailout expired last week.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, under  suspicion from both sides for trying to broker a last-minute  deal, told the European Parliament: "There are some in the  European Union who openly or secretly are working to exclude  Greece from the euro zone."
He did not name names but may have been referring to German  Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who has made no secret of  his skepticism about Greece's fitness to stay in the euro and  last week suggested a possible "temporary" exit.
From the Greek side, the key to making any deal politically  acceptable will be to win a stronger commitment from Merkel and  other lenders to reschedule Greece's giant debt burden, which  the International Monetary Fund says is unsustainable.
Without some firmer pledge of debt relief, neither Greece  nor the IMF is likely to accept a deal. But that may be more  than Germany and its northern allies can swallow.
Schaeuble said on arrivial for a preparatory meeting of  finance ministers that anyone who had read the EU treaty knew  debt write-offs were forbidden in the euro zone. He did not rule  out other forms of restructuring.
Asked about reports that Greece was seeking an immediate  bridging loan of several billion euros, Italian Finance Minister  Pier Carlo Padoan the creditors would listen to Greek requests.
"The door is open to negotiations, but there isn't much time  left and the situation is urgent both for Greece and for  Europe," French President Francois Hollande said in a joint  media appearance with Merkel in Paris on Monday.
At stake at the emergency summit beginning at 6 p.m. (1600  GMT) in Brussels is more than just the future of Greece, a  nation of 11 million that makes up just 2 percent of the euro  zone's economic output and population.
If Greek banks run out of money and the country has to print  its own currency, it could mean a state leaving the euro for the  first time since it was launched in 1999, creating a precedent  and fueling doubts about the long-term viability of an  incomplete European monetary union.
"Even if it did not trigger a short-term domino effect, the  integrity of the euro zone would come under fresh threat with  each episode of political uncertainty within member countries,"  said Thibault Mercier, an analyst at BNP Paribas.
Even in France, the euro zone country most sympathetic to  Athens, an opinion poll published on Tuesday showed one in two  people want Greece to leave the euro zone.

CONCESSIONS UNCLEAR
Strengthened by the overwhelming 61.3 percent 'No' vote in  Sunday's referendum, the leftist Tsipras won the unprecedented  support of all other Greek party leaders on Monday and replaced  his abrasive Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis with the  soft-spoken negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos.
Tsakalotos entered the euro zone finance ministers' meeting  without comment. Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said it  was up to Greece to show a credible way forward.
"The pressure is especially on the Greeks, the banks are  closed and the situation is difficult. I guess the Greek  government has an interest in coming up with serious and  credible solutions soon," Dijsselbloem told reporters.
In an intensive round of telephone diplomacy, Tsipras spoke  to the heads of the ECB, the IMF and the European Commission, as  well as Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
The United States, China and Japan all called for a solution  in which Greece stays in the euro zone.
Tsipras gave little clue of what reform concessions he would  make to try to convince deeply skeptical European leaders to  lend Athens more money after five months of acrimonious and  fruitless negotiations with his leftist administration.
Even with the country on the brink of economic collapse,  Greek officials said the government was still seeking exceptions  from its reform pledges for special interests.
Athens wants to keep a 30 percent discount on value added  tax on Greek islands and delay defense spending from cuts, which  rightist junior coalition partners the Independent Greeks have  called "red lines." It is also resisting raising VAT on  restaurants to 23 percent, and wants to wait until 2019 to phase  out an income supplement for poorer pensioners, officials said.
Juncker told EU lawmakers he was working night and day to  get negotiations reopened and chided the Greeks for their  aggressive approach, saying it was unacceptable to accuse the EU  of behaving like "terrorists," as Varoufakis did last week.
"Throwing Greece out of the monetary union or indeed the  European Union is not something we want or indeed should want,"  the EU's chief executive said.
European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny suggested  the bank might be able to provide some sort of bridge funding  while Greece negotiated a longer-term conditional loan to see it  over a crucial July 20 bond redemption to the ECB.
Greek newspapers dramatized the make-or-break nature of the  Brussels showdown.
Centrist daily Ethnos headlined: "Time has run out for a  solution before catastrophe," while the center-right Eleftheros  Typos said: "Tsipras' games finish at today's council: Time of  crisis: deal or Grexit."
A clear majority of Greece's 18 partners favor a hard line  at the summit, arguing that they too are democracies and that  Greeks should not get easier money because they had rejected the  austerity terms, casting further doubt on whether they would  implement any reforms agreed now.
The ECB left unchanged its emergency liquidity lifeline for  Greek banks but raised the discount it charges on collateral  they present for funds - a measure banking sources said was  largely symbolic since the total they could borrow was capped.
A bank closure in force since the talks collapsed was  prolonged until Thursday at least, and cash withdrawals remain  limited to 60 euros a day, with 20 euro notes running out.
The Athens stock exchange was also ordered closed for two  days in Tuesday and Wednesday to throttle speculation.

        <MainBody>World powers, Iran struggling to meet nuclear deadline 01:18
Story highlights
The State Department announced that Iran nuclear talks have extended their deadline to Friday
Secretary of State John Kerry will remain in Vienna, where the latest round of negotiations are taking place.
Washington (CNN)
Negotiators working to broker a deal to rein in Iran's nuclear program on Tuesday extended the talks until the end of the week.
State Department spokeswoman Mari Harf said Tuesday morning in a statement that U.S. officials have "made substantial progress in every area" and will continue negotiating with their Iranian counterparts through Friday. This is the second time negotiators have extended the deadline, which was originally set for June 30.
Secretary of State John Kerry will remain in Vienna, where the latest round of negotiations are taking place.
"This work is highly technical and high stakes for all of the countries involved. We're frankly more concerned about the quality of the deal than we are about the clock, though we also know that difficult decisions won't get any easier with time -- that is why we are continuing to negotiate," said Harf, who is the State Department's Senior Advisor for Strategic Communications.
RELATED: Netanyahu warns of 'worse and worse' deal with Iran
Officials on both the U.S. and Iranian sides have expressed in recent days that they are negotiating in earnest and making progress, and have downplayed concerns over reaching a specific deadline.
If the Obama administration does not submit a nuclear deal to Congress before Thursday, the amount of time Congress will have to review a deal will double, to 60 days from 30 days. That could set up a long and drawn-out fight to sway public opinion in favor or against the deal, with many Republicans already labeling the deal negotiators are crafting as one that would give Iran a path to a nuclear weapon.
Obama administration officials have insisted though that they will not waver on certain key points that could make or break a deal, most crucial of which is putting in place a rigorous inspections and verification mechanism that would allow international monitors to inspect any and all suspicious facilities throughout Iran.

LONDONAs Britain commemorates the 10th anniversary of the nations most deadly domestic terror attack, U.K. authorities say that the country needs to strengthen its counterterrorism and surveillance capabilities to keep pace with a rapidly changing extremist threat.
On Tuesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron joined survivors and families of those who died when four homegrown Islamic suicide bombers attacked Londons public transport during the morning rush hour on July 7, 2005. The bombings killed 52 people and...

In the past year, several warning signs have been posted to alert hikers to the danger, Tracy O'Toole, a Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest spokeswoman, told the Daily Herald of Everett.
According to the Washington Trail Association, there is always a certain level of danger in ice caves, even when no official warning has been issued.
Regardless of weather, temperature, or snow pack, ice caves in Washington pose a very real threat to anyone venturing in or near them, the WTAs website warns. It is never safe to enter an ice cave, but the caves at Big Four pose a particular danger if you venture beyond the viewing platform at the end of the trail.
Still, the Big Four Ice Caves remain a popular destination for hikers. Several others were present during Mondays collapse, including 18-year-old Chloe Jakubowski, who told the Seattle Times she drove with three friends about 15 miles to a pay phone to call emergency services.

"Everybody there, we grabbed everybody out and helped as best we could," she said.
Another Big Four collapse occurred the day before, which a hiker caught on film. Several tourists had been inside the cave when it collapsed, but no injuries were reported.

        <MainBody>Grizzly bear shatters barrier at Minnesota Zoo
Published July 07, 2015

APPLE VALLEY, Minn.  A grizzly bear exhibit at the Minnesota Zoo is temporarily closed after one of the bears picked up a basketball-sized rock and shattered a barrier.
Startled visitors stood on the other side as the bear repeatedly slammed the rock into a pane of glass Monday morning.
Zoo animal collections manager Tony Fisher tells the Minneapolis Star Tribune (http://strib.mn/1JQshzo ) the five-layer pane stayed in place "like a windshield." No one was hurt.
The grizzlies were called back inside. The area will be closed until a temporary fix can be made ahead of a permanent pane being installed.
Fisher isn't sure which of the three bears is responsible for busting one of pane's five layers. But he suspects it was Kenai, a nearly full-grown male who is "usually the clown out there."

Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney in 2012. (Charles Dharapak, AP)
It seems like Mitt Romney has become the Republican Partys most popular member, at least among the presidential candidates.
Jeb Bush had lunch Monday with Romney, following a holiday weekend in which the 2012 GOP presidential nominee hosted Chris Christie and Marco Rubio at his home in New Hampshire.
The Romney lunch took place at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, and included former president George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush.
Jeb Bush and wife, Columba, were grateful for the opportunity to host Governor and Mrs. Romney for lunch, said a statement from the Bush presidential campaign.
Some are casting all these meetings as a Romney primary, although the 2012 nominee  who passed on another race in 2016  has said he doesnt plan to endorse anybody this time around.
Im going to be as loyal to them as they were to me, Romney told reporters last weekend in New Hampshire.
Though many of the candidates frequently call on Romney for counsel, he declined to offer his advice  at least publicly  on how they should conduct their campaigns.
These guys will make their own mistakes, he quipped to reporters. Hopefully they wont follow mine.'
