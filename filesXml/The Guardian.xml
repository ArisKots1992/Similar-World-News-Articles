Eurozone calls on Athens to get serious over Greece debt crisis
Appeal made as Greek banks stay shut and 19 leaders convene in Brussels for what many see as last chance to avoid leaving eurozone

The Greek government has been told by its eurozone partners not to expect debt relief any time soon, amid fading hopes of decisive action to stop the country tumbling out of the currency union.
Eurozone finance ministers arriving for emergency talks in Brussels made it clear they were waiting on Athens to sign up to further reforms and were in no hurry to discuss debt relief.
Finance ministers are preparing the way for a summit of eurozone leaders that gets underway on Tuesday evening. The summit, called after Greeks rejected the eurozone-drafted bailout plan in a referemdum on Sunday, is seen as one of the last real chances to secure a deal to stop Greece crashing out of the euro.
Greek banks are on the brink of running out of cash, but senior European figures are already dampening hopes of any breakthrough. What we are going to do today is to talk to each other and restore order, said the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, adding that there would be no overnight solution.
In a coordinated press statement, the leaders of France and Germany called on Greece to come up with serious and credible proposals at Tuesdays summit which are consistent with its wish to stay in the eurozone.
The demand was echoed by finance ministers, who stressed they wanted to see the Greek government sign up to reforms. Several made it clear they would not support any write-off of Greek debt.
We are not in the business of renegotiating debt, said Finlands finance minister, Alexander Stubb. That was already done in 2011 and 2012, referring to re-structuring of Greek debts that imposed heavy losses on private creditors.
Stubb said Finlands commitments to Greece had proved to be more than anyone ever expected, totalling 10% of the Finnish government budget.
The European commission, the guardian of EU law, was openly split. Valdis Dombrovskis, the Latvian commissioner in charge of the euro, said a Greek exit from the eurozone could not be excluded. Pierre Moscovici, the French commissioner in charge of the economic policy, struck a different note, saying that Grexit would be a terrible collective failure.
Juncker blamed the Greeks for walking out of talks and said it was up to Athens to come up with proposals that would allow Europe to get out of this situation.
The depths of mistrust were highlighted by Latvias finance minister, Jnis Reirs, who said his compatriots were surprised at the referendum result. Latvian people do not understand Greek people, he said.
As talks in Brussels grind on, Greek banks remain closed with it far from clear they will be able to reopen on Thursday, once the latest bank holiday comes to an end.
The European Central Bank raised the pressure on Greek banks on Monday night by tightening access to emergency credit. The Frankfurt-based institution has pumped 89bn (63bn) into the Greek financial system in recent months, but Greek banks can only tap this emergency aid by putting up collateral, such as Greek government bonds.
The bank said on Monday it was adjust[ing] the haircuts accepted on collateral, meaning that Greek assets are now deemed more risky, to secure smaller amounts of emergency funds.
The level of emergency funding remains unchanged at 89bn, despite a plea from the central bank in Athens for an extra 3bn. The request was first reported by Bloomberg.
The ECB said its governing council was closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area.
The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, pressed for capital controls to be lifted when he spoke to the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, on Monday. After a hectic day of meetings with Greek party leaders, Tsipras also spoke to Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. She told him the IMF was no longer able to provide money to Greece until it clears its arrears, following last weeks default on a 1.6bn loan repayment.
Tsipras is expected to table fresh proposals to the eurozone summit to secure desperately needed financial aid. These new proposals are likely to be based on a plan Tsipras submitted last week, when he called for a two-year loan of 29bn from the eurozones permanent bailout fund and promised to sign up to economic reforms, including further austerity.
Despite the departure of Greeces finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis , reaching a deal will not be easy. Germanys finance minister, Wolfgang Schuble, who clashed often with Varoufakis, indicated the path ahead would be no easier for his successor.
Euclid Tsakalotos, an Oxford-educated economics professor, was sworn in as Greek finance minister on Monday night, having already served as chief negotiator on the debt crisis for the Syriza-led government. He arrived at Tuesdays meeting without talking to reporters.

Angelique Chrisafis gauges the immediate political reaction in Paris.
The French political class, still reeling from the bloody terrorist attacks on the magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Paris Kosher supermarket nearly six months ago, has for months been engaged in heated debate on surveillance powers and national security.
Both the right and left had been stressing the ongoing terrorist threat and the countrys security services had been on high-alert. Todays attack on the factory in Isre brought immediate political reaction, with all parties stressing France should not give in to fear.
On the right, Alain Jupp, a former prime minister from Nicolas Sarkozys right-wing Les Rpublicains, who is challenging Sarkozy to be 2017 presidential candidate, tweeted The terrorist threat is at maximum. The Isere attacks is alas a reminder. The state must do everything to protect its citizens.
 Alain Jupp (@alainjuppe) June 26, 2015
La menace terroriste est maximum. L'attentat en Isre nous le rappelle hlas! L'Etat doit tout mettre en uvre pour protger ses citoyens.
Sarkozy later issued a statement saying The Republic will never give in to terrorist barbarism.
The Socialist party leader Jean-Christophe Cambadlis tweeted his great emotion after the attack and the way in which it happened. He said Lets stay united, We must not play on fears.

        <title>Mediterranean migrants: EU leaders agree voluntary intake after heated talks</title>

The national leaders of Europe have engaged in one of their most bitter rows in years over how to respond to the influx of refugees from across the Mediterranean after they scrapped plans for a quota system to share out the resettlement.
The meeting descended into name-calling and recrimination as the leaders fought over a modest scheme to share the intake of 60,000 Syrian and Eritrean asylum seekers between their countries over two years.
A summit that also had to grapple with the Greek debt crisis and the British referendum on whether to stay in the EU was almost entirely consumed until 3am on Friday by the blazing row over a scheme criticised by humanitarian agencies as risibly inadequate for the scale of the problem.
Italy and Lithuania traded barbed insults, while two EU presidents  Donald Tusk, chairing the summit, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European commission  fought for hours over the wording of the summit statement, which could not be agreed.

The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaite, told Matteo Renzi, the prime minister of Italy, which is on the frontline of the refugee crisis, that she had no intention of contributing to any solution. Renzi accused government chiefs of wasting time and was said to reply: If this is your idea of Europe , you can keep it.
Friday mornings Italian newspapers spoke of a savage battle between the two countries.
Juncker emerged bleary eyed shortly after 3am to attack Tusk, saying: I protest against this working method. Its a modest effort, lets be honest.
His proposal for a system of mandatory quotas for countries to take in migrants had come under sustained assault for hours. I dont give a damn, he said.
If there was a conflict between us, it would never be presented as a conflict, he said of the row with Tusk.
Angela Merkel of Germany, which takes in far more asylum seekers than any other country, described the immigration crisis as the biggest challenge I have seen in European affairs in my time as chancellor.
During those 10 years, Merkel has been the key figure in five years of eurozone crisis and is the lead European trying to deal with Russias military partition of Ukraine.
Britain stayed on the sidelines of the dispute since it is not part of the EUs passport-free Schengen zone, has opted out of EU asylum policy and has said it will not take part in the proposed refugee-sharing scheme.
The bad-tempered exchanges are certain to be repeated as EU interior ministers attempt over the next month to agree on how to share out the resettlement of the 60,000 asylum seekers.
Effectively telling Brussels to mind its own business on the politically toxic issue of immigration, the summit buried calls for a more equitable system across the 28 countries.
We have no consensus among member states on mandatory quotas for migrants, Tusk said. It will take much time to build a new European consensus on migration.
Instead of discussing measures for a more organised and equitable system of taking people in, the leaders focused on how to keep people out and deport those who get in.
First and foremost, we need to contain illegal migration and this should be our priority. All those who are not legitimate asylum seekers will have no guarantee that they will stay in Europe, Tusk said.
Faced with an influx of migrants through the Balkans, Hungary has started building a four-metre-high wire fence along its border with Serbia, while Italy is struggling to cope with the the tens of thousands reaching its southern shores after risking their lives in unseaworthy vessels to cross the Mediterranean from Libya.
Of the proposed quota system, a senior EU official said: The idea that Brussels imposes quotas is not going to fly. It will never gather the support of the member states.
But Juncker refused to accept the rejection and fought on for hours. The argument focused on the form of words used to describe the decisions taken by the summit, with Tusk adding the word voluntary to the text and seeking to change the decision-taking basis for the policy from one of majority voting to unanimity, meaning that any country would have a veto on the issue.
The decision to distribute 40,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece and to take in 20,000 Syrians and Eritreans who have fled their countries but not reached the EU was a token gesture to Italy.
The summit defined the 40,000 scheme as temporary and exceptional, to be spread over two years. It will have little impact on the overall numbers, given that more than 600,000 people sought asylum in the EU last year. The figures for new arrivals this year are much higher.
According to the latest figures from Frontex, the EUs border agency, the number of migrants arriving at the EUs external borders has risen by a factor of 2.5 this year compared with 2014, from 61,500 to 153,000. The numbers coming through the Balkans were nearly nine times higher than last year.
Mediterranean crossings last month were 29% up on April, and there has been a five-fold increase so far this year in those using the eastern Mediterranean route compared with the same period in 2014.
The number of first-time asylum seekers in the EU in the first quarter of 2015 almost doubled compared with the first three months of 2014, according to Eurostat, the EU statistics agency. About 40% of the claims were lodged in Germany compared with only 4% in Britain.
The summit decided on a number of measures aimed at speeding up asylum processing and expelling those whose claims are turned down.
EU development funds, trade agreements and diplomatic pressure would be deployed as leverage on the migrants countries of origin to encourage them to sign readmission agreements with the EU.
All tools shall be mobilised to promote readmission, the summit decided.
Structured border zones or hotspots would be established in southern Italy to quarantine those arriving, fingerprint and register them and expedite the deportation of those deemed to have entered illegally or to be economic migrants.
European police and border agencies would be granted new powers for implementing policies that until now have been the sole remit of national authorities.
Syrians and Eritreans arriving in the EU in high numbers can seldom be repatriated because of the risk to their lives at home. Their treatment in the asylum regime would remain unchanged and their cases would remain in the relevant national systems as before.
Britains refusal to take part has been widely criticised. Peter Sutherland, the UN secretary generals special representative for international migration, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that Britains decision had forced countries such as Greece and Italy to take on an unfair burden of responsibility.
All member states, incidentally, should participate in the voluntary settlement, including Britain, Ireland and Denmark. There is absolutely no reason, if this is not compulsory, why they should feel they can opt out, he said.
This is a question, basically, of European solidarity. Why should Greece and Italy in particular take this unfair burden of responsibility for people who are refugees escaping from persecution?
Sutherland acknowledged that Britain had been playing a role by rescuing some of the refugees in the Mediterranean. Asked if that was not enough, he said: Absolutely not, sure. There is a massive degree of support from other countries in regard to helping people in the Mediterranean and saving lives. This is a separate issue. It is the issue of the fair distribution amongst the EU on the basis of solidarity of people who are refugees.
He said EU leaders should have agreed a compulsory programme on the resettlement of migrants, and that the overnight deal was
a mistake.
It could have been more ambitious. There is no doubt that it reflects limited progress nonetheless. We can only judge it when we see what countries come up with.

        <title>Greece's rich: insulated against an EU exit</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/25/greeces-rich-insulated-against-an-eu-exit</Link>

The security guard wrinkled his brow at the sight of an unfamiliar face. But when he found the name of the Guardians correspondent, left at the gate by a member, his demeanour changed.
Parakalo, he said with a warm smile, handing over a card to open the turnstile. Either side, the walls were thick and high.
The country club, on the outskirts of Athens, was laid out with an extravagance in the use of space that you seldom find outside the Americas. In the clubhouse, set amid towering pines, there were corridors as wide as rooms, and rooms the size of basketball courts. But perhaps the most striking thing about the club was that it was opened after the onset of Greeces never-ending financial emergency.
Since then, Greece has become notorious for deprivation. According to EU figures , 23% of Greeks were poor or at risk of poverty in 2012, the last year for which comparative statistics were available. It was the highest proportion in the EU and has almost certainly risen since.
Yet the Hellenic world has also been famed throughout history for the wealth of individuals: from Croesus, the semi-legendary king of Lydia, to the Golden Greeks, the shipping magnates Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis.
This is the first time that Greeks of all classes are really worried that it could end badly
The statistics indicate that income distribution is more unequal in Greece than in any EU country except Spain. But, said Andreas Paterakis, the idea that it is packed with plutocrats is mistaken.
Its a myth coming from the days of Onassis and the other shipping billionaires, said Paterakis, the regional president for south-eastern Europe of the security firm G4S. There are 10 or 15 families who control the media, banks and insurance. There are things that could improve, notably the relations of these people with the tax authorities. But I really dont think they are a priority for the Greek government.

Paterakis said his company provided physical and property protection for some high net worth individuals. But, he said, it is only a small part of our business.
The latest annual list of the worlds richest men and women produced by the magazine Forbes seems to bear out this view. It contains just three Greeks  one fewer than in 2008 before the onset of the crisis. The highest placed is Philip Niarchos, Stavross son, and with a fortune of $2.5bn, he only ranks 737th.
But earlier this year Bloomberg estimated that at least four more Greek citizens  all shipping owners  had assets of more than a billion.
Crisis-stricken Greece still has the worlds largest merchant fleet and shipping has long been the prime source of its super-rich. What makes them especially controversial is that, under rules incorporated in the constitution, they pay no tax on international earnings brought into Greece .
On Monday, several captains of industry and finance were spotted at a demonstration in Athenss main square to call for continued membership of the euro.
I recognised several CEOs there, said Vagelis Tsogkas, a corporate communications consultant. There was a mix of young, well-educated Greeks and members of the financial elite. I think that this is the first time since the start of the crisis that Greeks of all classes are really worried that it could end badly.
Membership Event: Guardian Newsroom: Can Greece be saved?
But, while the CEOs who improbably rallied in Syntagma Square dread the prospect of their firms being shut out of the single currency zone if the talks fail, the ship owners could see their businesses jeopardised if the negotiations succeed. A leaked draft of the proposals tabled by Greeces creditors includes a demand that the government phase out special tax treatments of the shipping industry.
At a personal level, Grexit would hit the finances of even the wealthiest. Reintroduction of the drachma could mean that overnight their property and other assets in Greece were reduced in value by as much as 50%. But they long ago took steps to ensure that those Greek-based assets were reduced to a minimum.
A senior banker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that after 2008 when the collapse of Lehman Brothers threatened to spark a global financial meltdown, large numbers of wealthy Greeks withdrew money from the private banking arms of global banks and paid it into the Greek system.
But as the crisis focused increasingly on Greece, the flow reversed. And it did so long before the panic withdrawals that were last week draining the banks of around 1bn a day.
Between 2010 and 2012, we lost deposits to the tune of 80bn, said the banker. We estimate that, of that, 20bn was high net worth individuals sending their money abroad. The smart money was the first to leave the country.

        <title>Japan joins with former foes to flex its muscles as it eyes China's rise</title>

It was American soldiers held captive by Japanese troops during the second world war who first dug through the thick, damp mud to build an airstrip on the Philippine island of Palawan.
Now, in 2015, two spy planes, one Japanese and one American, stand side by side on that same runway.
Conducting joint training activities with the US-supported Philippine Navy this month, the Japanese have finally made it back  this time with smiles and handshakes  to join up with their former enemies and resist a common foe: China .

All three countries contest Beijings land reclamation on islands in the disputed South China Sea, where it has built military installations to help bolster its claim. The Philippines argues it owns some of these islands while Tokyo and Washington fear Chinas expanding influence in the region  and the potential for it to block a key sea route for roughly 3.17tn in trade.
These fears have brought 21 sweating Japanese pilots and engineers in grass-green jumpsuits back to Palawan this week, where they mingled and posed for selfies on the runway with their Filipino counterparts, in darker, greyer attire at Antonio Bautista air base.
It was first time the Japanese military had conducted training operations in the south-east Asian country since Imperial Japan surrendered in 1945 following a three-year occupation of the Philippines. Their troops were pushed out by Americans allied with guerrilla Filipino resistance forces.
A joint-mission in a Japanese P3-C Orion surveillance plane with a smaller Philippine Navy Islander aircraft over the South China Sea on Tuesday was sold by Philippines Lieutenant Commander Lued Lincuna as practice for potential humanitarian coordination, not to resist China.
But the message to Beijing is clear  a symbolic and historic partnership against Chinas role in waters 80 miles off the west coast of Palawan, an island state in the Philippines on the edge of the South China Sea.
We are conducting this exercise to enhance our interoperability, which means once we are joined, we go together, Lincuna said at the air base, surrounded by dense tropical forrest. It is the first time we fly together, he said, adding that the exercise was conducted outside territorial waters west of Palawan. That means the South China Sea.

China is furious and the state news agency Xinhua this week ran an editorial piece calling Japans arrival in the Philippines as the latest sequel to Tokyos meddling in the South China Sea.
By muddying the waters in the South China Sea, Tokyo also aims to divert increasingly intensive global attention on Japans lack of remorse over its atrocities during World War II, nearly 70 years after its surrender, it said.
Japan, which is not a party to the disputes in South China Sea, should abandon all attempts to stir waves in the area.
But in the Philippines, where the older generation remembers hiding in the jungle from passing battalions of Japanese troops and vine-covered stone plaques honour those killed in massacres, the presence of Japanese boots has, interestingly, not stirred similar outrage.
We Filipinos have very short memories, joked one woman in Puerto Princesa, the town where the air base is located. Some also have Japanese blood  the children of Filipino women and Japanese soldiers who were based here.
As the Allies retook the Philippines, isolated Japanese soldiers fled into the dense, mountainous jungle and only emerged years later. On Palawan island, locals joke there might still be some hiding, waiting for the world to move on while unaware of the the fact that it has.
And with the military complaining that it is one of the weakest in Asia, the Philippines feels it needs Tokyo as a buffer against China, two months before the 70th anniversary of Japans surrender.
In Puerto Princesa, locals wear t-shirts stating The Spratlys will never be conquered, referring to the band of islands closest to the Philippines where Chinese warships now patrol.

Jennifer Berto, who works in a clothes and jewellery shop, says her graphic design artist made Spratly t-shirts following high demand from locals and American tourists.
This is our new design, she said at her shop in Puerto Princesa, holding a t-shirt with Spratly belongs to us written on it.
People on Palawan support the navy because the islands are in the west Philippine sea, she said.
She had not heard of the Japanese operation but was pleased they were here. How nice, she said, smiling.
The Philippine defence secretary, Voltaire Gazmin, said this week that Japan should become further involved with Manilas military, arguing for a visiting forces agreement which would allow Japanese troops to be stationed in the Philippines, similar to a deal with Washington, which has naval ships in Filipino ports.
It would be ironic if we cannot do exercises with Japanese forces when Japan is one of the only two countries  the other one being the United States  which are strategic partners of the Philippines, Gazmin said on Wednesday.
An end to Japanese pacifism
For Japan, its militarised return to the world stage is a cautious one. After its defeat, Japans 1947 constitution  which was largely written by US occupation officials  forbade the formation of a traditional military force. The country has a self defence force which is restricted to protecting the mainland. This has been used only when conflicts abroad are considered a potential threat at home and Japan has deployed troops to Afghanistan and Iraq.
The push to restart its military after so many years of pacifism is down to one man: Japans prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who defied public opinion a year ago to overturn the countrys defence policy and make it easier for troops to fight overseas .
Abe and his supporters want to go even further, arguing for a more active military in the wake of Chinas assertiveness . China and Japan have their own dispute over the Senkakus  known in China as the Diaoyu Islands  in the East China Sea. And although Japan does not claim any islands in the South China Sea it wants to make sure the area is not controlled by Beijing.
Ian Storey, from Singapores Institute of South East Asian Studies, says roughly 85% to 90% of Japans energy supplies come through the South China Sea which Tokyo fears could be blocked by Beijing.
Any threat to the maritime trade through the South China Sea seems existential to the Japanese, he said on the phone from Singapore.
Well see a continuation of this trend. This dispute is a long way from being resolved. Japan will continue to step up its support for the Philippines and Vietnam and maybe some other countries in south-east Asia.

Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan also claim islands in the South China Sea, while China claims most. The naval corridor is thought to have oil and gas reserves. And Tokyo has also promised patrol boats to Vietnam, which itself is looking to pump up its military hardware to deter China.
The Japanese can honestly say this is not about the South China Sea, this about south-east Asian nations improving their maritime security. But of course, its really about improving their capacity to be able to know whats going on, Storey says.
A New War of Bravado
Japans return to the South China Sea, where the carcasses of world war two ships lie in its reefs, has compounded a crisis that has led to the militarisation of all countries involved.
The risk of conflict is significant. Seventy Vietnamese soldiers were killed in a 1988 naval battle with China over the Johnson South Reef. And in 2001, a Chinese F-8 fighter collided with a US Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane. In May this year, Chinese and Vietnamese ships collided as Beijing tried to set up an oil rig.
Oil survey ships operating in Reed Bank, close to the Philippines, have increasingly been harassed by Chinese vessels and Manila is beefing up its military in the area, increasing the threat of conflict.
At the forefront of this is Oyster Bay, a naturally protected cove with a deep harbour capable of hosting large warships. On the western side of Palawan, the bays biggest selling point is that it opens directly into the South China Sea. President Benigno Aquino has called the area the frontline of our territorial defence operations.

Philippine officials say the bay, which is protected from the monsoons by its high mountains, will be used to host the countrys two large warships and act as a strategic base for the United States to rotate troops and ships, who are presently stuck on the other side of the island.
A new security pact signed during a visit by the US president, Barack Obama, last year should also allow a greater American military presence on Filipino soil, including on expanded bases.
Oyster Bay is only accessible by sea but once a connecting road is complete, officials say the major work can be done.
Fishermen who live deep in a mangrove-lined inlet took the Guardian out into Ulugan Bay, which leads to Oyster Bay. They did this in small pump boats, a 15-foot canoe with two stabilising bamboo stalk, fish in the area which is full of coral reefs and protected waters.
The fishermen say the navy has warned them not to approach the inlet, although several still anchor nearby to catch fish living in the cove. Two Philippine Navy patrol boats cruised in the area during the trip.
Inside Oyster Bay, a concrete jetty and landing platform stretches out into the deepest waters in order for bigger ships to dock. A boathouse and a water tank are all that have been built until the road is finished and construction can begin. A snake hung from a overhanging tree and birds skimmed the calm water.

Further back in the dense jungle the Guardian found a number of workmen.
Cement trucks roared down the roughly three miles of paved road, and labourers, wiping their faces with dusty t-shirts, mixed concrete while furiously pushing ahead to complete the road so Oyster Bay naval base can be built.
This appears to be a race against time.
A hundred miles out to sea, China is working fast, dredging thousands of tonnes of sand from the seabed to create islands.
The Philippines and its allies have been showing their strength this week, flying over the South China Sea and conducting military exercises. Many hope that is remains just a show but the militarisation of the area is a tinder box.
If we see more Japanese aircraft and ships operating in the area, says Yoel Sano, Head of Political Risk at BMI Research, then there will  mainly by law of numbers  be a greater likelihood of some sort of incident or clash between them and their Chinese counterparts.

Funerals for Charleston shooting victims begin with 'message of love'
We are stronger because we are together as a community, said Emanuel AME interim pastor Norvell Goff at the service for Ethel Lance in North Charleston
Services take place on Thursday for two of the nine victims of a massacre at a historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina
Thursday 25 June 2015 20.33BST
Last modified on Friday 26 June 2015 00.16BST
The first funerals for victims of the Charleston shooting were held on Thursday, as the community honored the nine people who were gunned down at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church by an alleged white supremacist.
Funerals are scheduled into next week.
I am here to tell you that we are stronger because we are together as a community, Norvell Goff, Emanuel AMEs interim pastor, said at the service for Ethel Lance at Royal Missionary Baptist church in North Charleston.
On Wednesday night, Goff led the weekly Bible study class where Lance and eight others were killed exactly a week before. Hundreds gathered in the churchs basement.
Many of our hearts our broken, but only God can fix a broken heart, Goff said at the gathering. Thats my testimony.

Marjorie McIver, whose sister Myra Thompson died in the attack, attended Bible study, according to the Post and Courier . Thompsons funeral will be held on Monday at the church.
God loves us, McIver said. Hes forgiven us of our sins. It behooves us to forgive others. That message of love, even for your enemies, even for those who use you, who despise you  thats a powerful message.
Later on Thursday, the funeral for Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, a mother of three, was held at Mt Moriah Missionary Baptist church in North Charleston. Charlestons mayor, Joe Riley, said Singleton was one of those extraordinary people, a coach who taught life lessons.
On Wednesday, thousands visited the state house rotunda, where Clementa Pinckney lay in state. Lawmakers paid their respects to the state senator and Emanuel AME pastor, as did his wife, Jennifer, and two daughters, Eliana and Malana.
A large, black curtain hung in front of a window in the state house lobby, blocking from sight the Confederate flag that flies over a monument on the grounds. The push to take down the flag, and stop states from allowing it on license plates or flying it on government land, has gathered momentum since the shooting, which police say was racially motivated.
Apple has removed war games with the Confederate flag from its app store, and the National Park Service said on Thursday it would remove all items that depict only the Confederate flag from its stores.
Many of the lawmakers who worked with Pinckney have said they want the flag taken down, but to do so would require a two-thirds majority vote from the legislature. Governor Nikki Haley has said she supports taking down the flag. Haley said on Twitter earlier this week : July 4th is just around the corner. It will be fitting that our state Capitol will soon fly the flags of our country &amp; state, and no other.
President Barack Obama, who said the flag belongs in a museum, is scheduled to deliver the eulogy at the funeral for Pinckney on Friday. The ceremony will take place at the College of Charleston, which can hold 5,400 people. The first lady, Michelle Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, are also set to attend.
Funerals for the other victims are scheduled into next week at Emanuel AME and in the state capital, Columbia, where the funeral of Daniel Simmons will be held. Funerals for Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders and his great aunt Susie Jackson will be held at Emanuel AME on Saturday.
On Thursday, the Charleston County council voted to rename the library Hurd managed in her honor. All 16 branches of the Charleston library will close for her funeral, so workers can attend the service.
The funeral for DePayne Middleton-Doctor, who was known for her talents as a singer and preacher, will be held at Emanuel AME on Sunday.

Obamacare upheld by US supreme court as conservative justices rescue law
Six-to-three decision on federal subsidies all but guarantees Obamacare will survive intact until at least the 2016 election in major victory for Barack Obama

Barack Obama celebrated a decisive victory for his healthcare reforms after the US supreme court threw out a Republican-led legal challenge that could have gutted the legislation and stripped millions of Americans of their health insurance.
This was a good day for America, the president said at the White House, marking a decisive turning point in his administrations battle to reduce the number of uninsured Americans.
The Affordable Care Act is here to stay, he added, claiming that as the dust has settled, there can be no doubt that this law is working.

The decision in the high-stakes case of King v Burwell all but guarantees that the law, more commonly known as Obamacare, will survive intact until at least the 2016 election, giving its supporters hope that the reforms will become impossible to reverse  even if a Republican is elected to the White House.
The case, which turned on the meaning of four words  established by the state  was brought by Virginia limousine driver David King, who sued the health secretary, Sylvia Burwell, on the grounds that insurance subsidies erroneously paid to those on low to middle incomes forced him to take out cover against his will by pushing him above an affordability threshold.
Kings lawyer argued that states like Virginia, which chose not to set up their own Obamacare exchanges and rely on a federal system instead, were not meant to receive such subsidies under a precise reading of the legislation which suggested it only applied in states that had their own exchanges.
But six of the nine justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, sided with the government in agreeing that other parts of the legislation made the broader meaning clear and allowed subsidies to be paid to exchanges run by states or the federal government.
Given that the text is ambiguous, we must turn to the broader structure of the act to determine the meaning, wrote Roberts in a passage that represents a huge victory for the Obama administration .
The decision prompted a withering response from conservative justice Antonin Scalia , who wrote a dissent on behalf of the three who opposed the decision.
This court, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest of the Act from working as well as hoped, wrote Scalia. So it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUScare.
The ruling is the second time that Roberts, appointed by President George W Bush and usually known as a conservative, has supported the presidents flagship healthcare reforms against legal assault.
In 2012, the chief justice was the swing vote in supporting the governments ability to levy fines against those who can afford health insurance but refused to take it out.
This time, Roberts argued that under the narrow reading of the legislation urged by lawyers for Burwell, the system of insurance exchanges would have had to change unrecognisably and would again represent a constitutional challenge to the power of the legislature.
In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the people, Roberts said.
Our role is more confined  to say what the law is, he added, quoting from a case dating back to 1803.
Though not completely unexpected given the sceptical reception from a number of justices to initial arguments made in the case , the language in Roberts opinion gives a very clear rebuttal to those who have used the loose language to unpick the whole law.
In every case we must respect the role of the legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done. A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan, wrote the chief justice.
Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter. [The disputed] Section 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congresss plan, and that is the reading we adopt.
As well as all four of the traditionally liberal justices, Roberts was also supported by Anthony Kennedy, who is often the swing vote in contentious cases, so the ruling was not as close as some healthcare supporters had feared.
Nevertheless, the emphatic endorsement of the chief justice adds to the scale of the victory for Obama, who would have struggled to shepherd a fix to the legislation through the Republican-controlled House and Senate.
It also capped a strong week for a presidency that had begun to look dangerously beleaguered in the face of a Democratic party rebellion on trade that was successfully quelled on Tuesday .
Critics of Obamacare, which has been a rallying point for Republicans since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2009, were quick to jump on the decision.
I disagree with the courts ruling and believe they have once again erred in trying to correct the mistakes made by President Obama and Congress in forcing Obamacare on the American people, said presidential candidate Marco Rubio.
Despite the courts decision, Obamacare is still a bad law that is having a negative impact on our country and on millions of Americans. I remain committed to repealing this bad law, he added.
Former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee took an even stronger stance, blasting the decision as an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny.
Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton however praised the courts decision, tweeting : SCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts &amp; under the law: Health insurance should be affordable &amp; available to all.
Fellow presidential candidate and leftwing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders praised the court for recognizing the common-sense reading of the Affordable Care Act, but went on to call for replacing Obamacare with a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system.

Islamic State militants killed dozens of people in and around the Syrian border town of Kobani on Thursday after launching a counter-offensive under the cover of darkness.
The militants - disguised as fighters from the Free Syrian Army - drove five vehicles into the town in the early hours of Thursday and used a suicide bomber to blow up a border crossing with Turkey. A civilian inside Kobani said: No one can go out of their home, the streets are not safe  Isis fighters are getting inside houses and killing everyone [they find].
At least 35 civilians and Kurdish fighters were killed along with eight IS militants, monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A further 23 Syrian Kurds , among them women and children, were shot dead in the nearby village of Barkh Butan, the group said.
Isis withdrew from the village after US-led coalition strikes on its outskirts of the village and the arrival of Kurdish forces, but fighting continued in Kobani through Thursday.
Around the same time as the Kobani attack, the group launched an assault on the north-eastern city of Hasakah, aided by militias previously aligned with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Western districts were seized and the Syrian army pushed into the city centre.
The surprise, two-pronged offensive came as Isis reels from several high-profile defeats near Raqqa , the capital of its self-declared caliphate and its seat of power in Syria.

The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) militia and an alliance of rebels known as the Euphrates Volcano  backed US-led coalition air strikes  have seized swaths of territory from Isis, including the strategic border town of Tal Abyad . In recent days they also wrested control of Brigade 93, a strategic base seized by Isis from the Syrian regime, and the town of Ain Issa, bringing them within 30 miles of Raqqa itself.
Islamic States morale has collapsed after the advance in the Raqqa countryside, said Redur Xelil, the YPG spokesman who provided the accounts of the latest Isis offensive. They are trying to raise the morale of their fighters and supporters, and show that they still have strength and can strike out elsewhere.
He also said that another goal of the Isis offensive may be to draw Kurdish troops away from the frontline to defend other territories.
Xelil said the militants who entered Kobani numbered between 30 and 40, and were holed up in buildings in the city after killing dozens of people. The YPG, backed by the Kurdish Asayish security forces, were combing the area and he was confident they would defeat the militants.
We will destroy this group that entered the city, he said.

Late last year, Isis was on the verge of conquering Kobani, an enclave on the Turkish border, but Kurdish fighters backed by the US-led coalition ultimately succeeded in reversing the militants advance and liberating the city , killing over a thousand Isis fighters in a months-long battle that emerged as a symbol of the Kurds defiance.
Many refugees who fled the city have since returned to their homes, many of which had been levelled during the fighting.
The joint Kurdish-rebel advance in recent weeks has provided a glimmer of hope in the fight against Isis. Last month, Isis seized the historic city of Palmyra in Homs province and Ramadi , the provincial capital of Anbar in Iraq, casting doubt on the entire strategy to contain the group.

The more serious threat is the Isis assault  its fourth  on Hasakah, a city divided between the Assad regime and the Kurds. Around midnight, Isis launched an offensive that has so far claimed the lives of 30 pro-regime troops and 20 militants, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group with a wide range of contacts inside Syria .
The attack triggered the flight of civilians from the area, and the regime has responded with a series of air strikes on militant positions south of the city. Isis used suicide bombers to soften up regime positions.
In a statement circulated on social media, Isis said it took control of western neighbourhoods and forced the regimes troops to retreat to the city centre, seemingly in shock at what the militants described as a daring operation.
Xelil, who said the Kurds were not yet involved in the battle for Hasakah, said Isis had succeeded in winning the allegiance of members of the pro-Assad National Defence Forces  local militias that support the regime  allowing them to prepare the ground for the assault on the city.
The tactic is in keeping with the traditional Isis modus operandi of infiltrating areas prior to launching major assaults.
In a separate, major offensive in Syrias south on Thursday, about 51 rebel groups joined together to attack regime-held areas of Deraa city, where insurgents have dealt Assads forces significant blows in recent months.
The southern rebels, including the al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front and groups that do not share its jihadi ideology, have long said they aim to expel Syrian government forces from Deraa. Syrian state TV said the army had repelled attacks against a number of military positions in the south of the country.

After four days combing through the rain-drenched jungle and swollen rivers, the rescue party was on the verge of calling off the search.
They had discovered the remains of the small plane which had smashed into a remote mountainside in north-west Colombia . They had found the body of the pilot  and a few tantalising clues suggesting that at least one person had survived the devastating impact.
But there was no trace of the missing passengers, and the emergency workers were starting to discuss ending their mission.
They decided to push on and a few minutes later, just 500 metres from the crash site but hidden by a dense wall of vegetation, they discovered a crude shelter.
Inside was the young mother who with her baby son had walked away from the plane wreck and survived for days in the one of the most inhospitable corners of the earth.
Authorities in Colombia have described the survival of 18-year-old Mara Nelly Murillo and her eight-month-old son Yudier Moreno as a miracle, after their Cessna 303 plane crashed into trees in the north-west of the country.
It is a very wild area and it was a catastrophic accident, Colonel Hctor Carrascal of the Colombian air force told AFP.
Murillo was pictured on Thursday looking exhausted, with burns on her arms, and clinging to a rescue worker after she was lifted from a rescue helicopter.
Mother and baby are now in hospital, with Murillo suffering minor burns, a fractured ankle and dehydration. Her son is in good health, the air force said in a statement. His mothers spirit must have given him strength to survive, Carrascal said.
The body of the planes pilot, Captain Carlos Mario Ceballos, was found three days ago in the ruined aircraft in the Serrana del Baud mountain range.
The plane had been flying from the Pacific coastal town of Nuqu to Quibd, the capital of Choc region in the west of the country. Just 20 minutes into the flight, the plane disappeared from the radar of civil aviation authorities. The cause of the crash is not yet known.
It took rescuers two days to locate the crash site, in an area teeming with both poisonous snakes and armed groups battling for control of coca plantations, illegal gold mines and lucrative drug smuggling routes to the Pacific ocean.
Threaded by rivers and drenched with rain throughout the year, the region is one of the wettest on Earth. It is also one of the poorest and least-developed parts of Colombia.

When rescuers found the plane, the doors of the plane were open, said Carrascal. There was no sign of Murillo and her baby, both of whom had been on the passenger list. We started to worry  we had no idea what could have happened to them. They could be lost in the jungle and trying to survive or could have died already, he told the news magazine Semana.
But they also saw a reason for hope in the open door. The door had been opened from the inside, suggesting one of two things: either it had opened on impact or someone had opened it to get out, said Carrascal.
There were other clues suggesting Murillo and her baby had survived the crash, said Rafael Caviedes of the Colombian air force. We found the remains of food at the site, a few peeled coconuts as if they had been used for water and food. And we didnt see her body anywhere or any traces of blood, he told El Tiempo.
As the formal search and rescue operation got under way, rescuers continued to find clues left behind by Murillo, from a discarded flip-flop to the babys birth certificate sitting next to a tree in the jungle.
As coconut shells turned up and even mobile phones that someone had apparently tried to use, rescue workers began to assume Murillo was leaving a trail so that she could be located in the impenetrable jungle and tangle of rivers that make up the area.
Meanwhile aviation experts studied the plane wreckage and noted that, while the pilots cabin had been destroyed, the rest of the plane was in decent shape. The planes cargo of coconuts and fish had helped cushion part of the plane from the shock of the crash.
A 14-man team scoured the dense jungle for two days without finding the mother and child, before finally resorting to using loudspeakers to broadcast their presence and instruct Murillo to stay as close to the plane wreckage as possible.
Meanwhile, said Caviedes, Murillo had made her way about 500 metres from the site of the crash to the banks of a creek where she fashioned a shelter for her and her son, and survived on unripe coconuts.
Speaking to local media from her hospital bed in Quibd, Murillo said she and her son also drank rainwater. When it rained, Id get up and gather water from the few leaves that had water on them and Id drink it with the boy, she said.
Red Cross volunteer Acisclo Rentera told Blu Radio that after failing to find the missing passengers, the rescue party had been debating whether to call off the search for the day. They decided to push on for a few more minutes, and a few minutes later, he spotted a swarm of flies circling above something on the ground.
As he approached, he realised it was Murillo, who began shouting and trying to get to her feet, Rentera told the Associated Press. She was in a state of near-starvation and apparent shock, but not seriously injured.
Rescuers gave Murillo first aid, and spent the next four hours feeding her water and crackers while waiting for an airlift. Meanwhile, Rentera comforted the baby.
The 38-year-old rescuer, who is unemployed and displaced from his hometown by Colombias five-decade civil war, described the rescue as a blessing
I thanked my God for allowing me to save these two people, he said.
The moment he spotted Murillo, he said, he was overcome with emotion. Its tremendous. Its a feeling that cant be explained.

David Attenborough and Barack Obama face-to-face in TV interview
In unexpected turn of events, US president interviewed naturalist during visit to White House in May  though Attenborough asks toughest questions
US president Barack Obama discusses climate change and the future of life on Earth with Sir David Attenborough

It sounds like a scenario from a fantasy dinner party: the most powerful man on the planet interviewing one of the worlds most beloved naturalists about his life story, about climate change and the future of life on Earth.
But in May, it has emerged, this encounter did happen, when Barack Obama invited Sir David Attenborough to the White House for a televised discussion  in which he, the US president, was to ask the questions of the broadcaster, not the other way round.
In the interview, to be broadcast simultaneously in the UK and US on BBC1 and BBC America on Sunday, Obama tells Attenborough: Ive been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time  youve been a great educator as well as a great naturalist.
But it is Attenborough, on the day in which he marked his 89th birthday, who poses the most probing questions of their encounter, asking the president why he cannot show a commitment to tackling climate change in the same way previous presidents had strived to put people on the moon.
Challenged by the naturalist, Obama says: Were not moving as fast as we need to and part of what I know from watching your programmes, and all the great work youve done, is that these ecosystems are all interconnected. If just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not, then were not going to solve the problem, were going to have to have a global solution to this.
What were seeing are global trends that depends on the entire world working together, and sadly we havent made as much progress as we need to on climate change.
Attenborough says that being invited to meet the president on his 89th birthday  the first time in his long career he had ever visited the White House  had been a considerable surprise. He says he found the president friendly, hospitable and genuine.
The president tells Attenborough that he grew up watching his programmes. Attenborough presented his first natural history programme for the BBC in 1954. The pair discuss the broadcasters career, his recent trip to dive in the Great Barrier Reef, ( which he has called the most magical thing he has ever seen ), and what he believes needs to be done about pressing issues such as the rising population, climate change and renewable energy.
I believe [if] we find ways of generating and storing power from renewable resources we will make the problem with oil and coal disappear, Attenborough tells the president, because economically, well wish to use these other methods. If we do that, a huge step will be taken in solving the problems of the Earth. I think whats required is an understanding and a gut feeling that the natural world is part of your inheritance. This is the only planet weve got and weve got to protect it. And people do feel that, deeply and instinctively, it is after all where you go in moments of celebration and in moments of grief.
Obama, in turn, talks about his paternal roots in Kenya as well as his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, and how travelling across the world throughout his life had shaped his thoughts on the environment.
Related: Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal
Attenborough has previously said he believed Obama was very much in favour of tackling climate change  [but] of course, as we also know, he is coming to the end of his last presidency.
The broadcaster recently helped launch the Global Apollo Programme , which aims to double the amount of money being spent on research and development of renewable energy, calling on world leaders to spend 0.02% of GDP on developing clean-energy technologies.

The director of the board of trustees of Spains Alhambra palace is under investigation for alleged embezzlement of public funds at the top tourist site.
Interior ministry official Santiago Lopez said Alhambra director Maria del Mar Villafranca was detained on Thursday and brought in for questioning. She was later released, but remains under investigation.
Villafranca and four other board officials are said to be suspected of misappropriating public money assigned for contracting visitor audio guide systems for the palace, which is in the mountains on the outskirts of the southern city of Granada.
Villafranca told reporters she would immediately resign from her position if she ended up being named as an official suspect in the investigation.
The board has acted with absolute integrity, transparency and a sense of responsibility, she said, before refusing to answer any further questions on the case.
Considered a gem of Muslim architecture, the royal residence of Alhambra (the name means the red in Arabic) was completed in the 14th century and is enclosed by huge, fortified walls. Now a Unesco world heritage site, it is Spains most visited tourist attraction, receiving thousands of visitors every day.

The world could see the HIV epidemic rebound dramatically if countries fail to increase funding and expand access to drugs in the next five years, according to a major report.
The analysis, by the UNAids and Lancet Commission , highlights a fragile window of opportunity for maintaining progress on curbing deaths and infections and suggests that progress made during the past decade could easily be reversed.
We must face hard truths  if the current rate of new HIV infections continues, merely sustaining the major efforts we already have in place will not be enough to stop deaths from Aids increasing within five years in many countries, said Prof Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and lead author of the report.
Child mortality has fallen dramatically since the UN set a the goal of reducing under-fives deaths worldwide by two-thirds, and the spread of HIV infections has fallen by 44% in the last decade. However, the report highlights instances of complacency and even the reversal of progress in some countries.
In Indonesia , the incidence of HIV rose by 50% between 2005 and 2013, while in Uganda, new infections rose from 90,000 in 1999 to 170,000 in 2011  a return to levels seen two decades previously.
Recent studies have also found clear evidence of resurgent HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men in western Europe, North America, and Asia, caused by risky sexual behaviour.
Expanding sustainable access to treatment is essential, but we will not treat ourselves out of the Aids epidemic, said Piot. We must also reinvigorate HIV prevention efforts, particularly among populations at highest risk, while removing legal and societal discrimination.
Elsewhere, the rate of new HIV infections is not falling fast enough and this, combined with rapid population growth in some of the most affected countries, is increasing the number of people living with HIV who will need antiretroviral therapy to stay alive.
We have to act now. The next five years provide a fragile window of opportunity to fast-track the response and end the Aids epidemic by 2030, said Michel Sidib, executive director of UNAIDS. If we dont, the human and financial consequences will be catastrophic.
Sustaining current HIV treatment and prevention efforts would require investments of up to 2% of GDP, and at least a third of total government health expenditure, in the most affected African countries to fund HIV programmes until 2030. The report calls for international funding to be urgently ramped up to support Aids efforts in low-income countries with a high rates of HIV.
At present, the high level of efforts costs $19bn annually, whereas it will take $36bn annually to achieve the UN goal to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, concludes the report, published in the Lancet .
Dr Eric Goosby, special envoy on malaria and former US global Aids coordinator, said: If we do not continue to invest, three decades of remarkable progress in the fight against Aids will be in jeopardy. And that will have a resounding effect across the global health spectrum.

How Egyptian media has become a mouthpiece for the military state
With imprisonment of journalists at an all-time high, Nour Youssef speaks to leading journalists about their inability to criticise the government

Nour Youssef in Cairo
When Tahrir Square was flooded with Egyptians calling for former president Hosni Mubaraks downfall , journalists were divided: jump ship, or defend the president?
Some, like Ibrahim Eissa, joined the calls of the protesters, co-founding the daily newspaper El-Tahrir (The Liberation). Others, like then-state TV presenter Khairy Ramadan, turned on demonstrators, suggesting they were funded by foreign conspirators.
But today even Eissa , among many others, is a defender of the new military government run by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi . Having shed any pretence of revolutionary fervour or objectivity, Egypts journalists are reluctant to even suggest that more than 36 people died in the 2011 uprising, when independent estimates say more than 900 were killed .

I would say anything the military tells me
Today, many of Egypts top TV presenters and journalists are remarkably candid about their willingness to act as government mouthpieces.
I would say anything the military tells me to say out of duty and respect for the institution, says Ahmed Moussa, one of the most popular TV presenters in Egypt .
Moussa has no qualms admitting on air his relationship with the authorities  and his vocation to serve them. He claims he would also extend the same courtesy to the police, he said but he might stop and think a little first.
Sharing Moussas sense of duty towards the military is the veteran talk show host Mahmoud Saad, from Al-Nahar TV. The military should never, ever, ever be covered, he says, shaking his head. You have to let them decide what to say and when to say it. You dont know what will hurt national security.
But its also the power to influence people that appeals to him, he says. Its a beautiful feeling knowing that when you swing right, he says as he swivels his upper body right, the people will swing right. And when you swing left, he goes on, swivelling in the opposite direction the people will swing left.

The official story makes people feel better
Before 2011, there was an unspoken rule among broadcasters and newspapers: criticise everyone except the president and his immediate family. To some, this silence extended to the defence and interior ministers.
El-Watan reporter Ahmed Ghoniem says owning media outlets comes in handy if you get into any kind of trouble and have to pressure the government. But no owner completely unleashes his journalists on the government, he says.
But after Mubaraks fall from power, the media exploded in congratulations, apologies and promises to never return to the days of humiliation that were Mubaraks reign, as popular TV host Amr Adeeb tearfully declared on ONtv.
We [talk show hosts] were cowards... The authorities used to call all the shows to dictate content, said Adeeb, who had once claimed that Mubarak had personally protected his freedom of expression  and indeed that of all journalists.
The media is not free, but better be controlled by Sisi and not the west
Ahmed Abdullah
Television presenters continue to be the undisputed leaders of public opinion in Egypt, where over a quarter of the population is illiterate . But where once they openly criticised the military and the government  most notably for killing protesters during the months of revolution in early 2011  now their role in public debate is much less clear.
Given this climate of well-known government pressure, many younger Egyptians are deeply cynical about the media, but older viewers have a softer view. So what if they paid respect to Mubarak? Everyone did, says 63-year-old retired teacher, Amal el-Tahry.
Ahmed Abdullah, who owns a shop in the capital, is also ambivalent: The media is not free, but better be controlled by Sisi and not the west, says the 55-year-old.
The government sanctioned narrative offers a sweeter pill, claims TV producer Sherief Badie el-Nour: People believe the official story because it makes them feel better, he says. It requires less work from them as individuals.
What can the viewer do about it? Change the channel? He will find another host saying the same thing, he says.

Self-censorship
This pervasive pressure from government has prompted journalists to police themselves more rigorously.
Dot Masr reporter Mohamed Abu Asay says in the past he could never report on the budget deficit in Egypt and the Saudi-Egyptian military operation in Yemen in the same piece. I cant tie the idea that the government doesnt have money, but is abandoning its war on terror to go fight in Yemen, in the readers mind, he says. It might stir public opinion and that is not good for the regime or the funders. Abu Asay knows that if he doesnt self-censor, his editors simply wont run it.
At Al Masry Al Youm, reporters also say they know which topics to avoid. No one can question how [well] trained the soldiers we have thrown to face the insurgency in Sinai, says website editor Ahmed Ragab.
Even when the newspaper published a report on police abuse partly showing the authorities in positive light and showcasing their heroism in the war on terrorism , its journalists were still referred to the public prosecutor after the Ministry of Interior issued a statement promising to sue the paper for what it claimed was an unprofessional report.
The viewer is tired
Mahmoud Saad
No one has ever made me say something I didnt want to say, but they have made me not say what I wanted to say, says the TV presenter Mahmoud Saad.
Lighting a cigarette, Saad reflects on the many phone conversations he says he had with Mubaraks minister of information, Anas el-Fiqqi, arguing about the topics he was allowed to discuss, whom to interview, and for how long. He called me to tell me to say that the 25 January protests in 2011 were [organised by the rival] Muslim Brotherhood. I refused and I didnt go on air, he recalls.
Saad no longer has that fighting spirit. I am an old man, he says. I just want to spend my time here in quiet  of which there is plenty in his brightly lit villa in a gated community in Giza.
I dont want to ruin anyones day, he says. The viewer is tired. He doesnt want to hear about corruption and theft. This desire to please is clear on Saads show, where all he had to say on the day a court dropped charges of killing protesters against Mubarak was : Is it really important that we get into details? I think not.

Claims of oppression are just a trend
Despite many journalists first hand experience of censorship and corruption in the countrys media, many stop short of holding president the government directly responsible.
Claims of oppression are just a trend, CBCs Khairy Ramadan says. Anyone who says they are under pressure is a liar.
ONtvs Youssef el-Husseiny goes further, claiming that the authorities would like the press to be balanced , but its journalists themselves who are the ones resisting. Sisi, el-Husseiny claims, personally asked him where his governments opposition is: Where are the other voices? Is everyone a supporter [of mine]?
We are tools, not journalists. The media owners use us to attack the regime when they want and support it when they want
Ahmed Amir, journalist
But frustration amongst journalists is also growing, and not everyone is resigned to become beholden to the governments narrative. Some have some have quit their jobs, but many also keep their head down to make ends meet.
Give me a nine to five job and I will quit tomorrow, says young journalist Ahmed Amir. Amir works on Ahmed Moussas TV talk show on Sada el-Balad TV.
We are tools, not journalists. The media owners use us to attack the regime when they want and support it when they want, he says. This is the profession of those with no conscience.

A French woman accused of suffocating eight of her newborn babies told investigators she feared they were the children of an incestuous relationship with her father.
Dominique Cottrez is on trial charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder of minors. She faces life in prison if found guilty by a jury in the northern city of Douai.
The infanticide case stunned the country when the bodies were discovered in and around her home in 2010 .
Cottrez, 51, who has two adult daughters, told investigators that over more than a decade, she carried several babies to term and then killed them. Cottrezs obesity appeared to hide the pregnancies, which went unnoticed by her husband, children, neighbours, colleagues and even doctors at a nearby hospital.
Dozens of forensic and psychiatric experts, police investigators and witnesses, including her husband, daughters and siblings, are scheduled to testify in the trial, which started on Thursday.
Cottrez told investigators she was raped by her father, first when she was eight and repeatedly through her childhood and teenage years, according to judicial documents. She later entered a long, incestuous relationship with him as an adult, including after she married. She said it became consenting, and she was in love with her father more than with her husband. Her father died in 2007.
One of the first witnesses called to the stand on Thursday was Leonard Meriaux, who bought the Cottrez family house and discovered the first corpse in the garden in 2010. He called police, who found another in the garden and six more in the garage of the house.
Investigators soon turned their suspicions to Cottrez, who quickly confessed. She told the investigating judge that she had never used contraception or had an abortion because of a phobia of doctors. She also said she did not keep the babies because she was afraid that they were the results of her incestuous relations with her father. She said the killing had become a means of contraception, according to the judicial documents.
The verdict is expected next Thursday.

Burmas parliament has voted against proposed constitutional amendments, ensuring that the militarys veto power remains intact and that opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi cannot become president in an election this year.
The legislature ended a three-day debate on Thursday on proposed changes to the 2008 constitution.
The constitution bars the Nobel peace prize winner from seeking the presidency and gives the military an effective veto over constitutional amendments. Changes to both those clauses were rejected on Thursday.
Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy (NLD) is expected to make large gains against the ruling Union Solidarity and Development party in the polls.
The NLD swept the last free general election in 1990 but the then-ruling military junta ignored the results and kept her under house arrest for years.

South Africas deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has been cleared of responsibility for the police massacre of 34 striking mineworkers at the Marikana mine by a judicial commission of inquiry.
Other ministers do not have a case to answer either, according to the long-awaited report. But it says inquiries should be held into the fitness of the national police chief, Riah Phiyega, to hold office, and into ascertaining the criminal liability of all police involved in the tragedy.
The killings at the British-owned Lonmin mine in the platinum belt on 16 August 2012 marked the bloodiest massacre by South African security forces since the end of racial apartheid.
On Thursday the South African president, Jacob Zuma, read a summary of the 600-page report on television, saying: The Marikana incident was a horrendous tragedy that has no place in a democracy.
His deputy, Ramaphosa, a stalwart of the liberation struggle, was a Lonmin board member at the time and has been accused of encouraging the violent police action. But the report said: The commission has found that it cannot be said Mr Ramaphosa was the cause of the massacre, and the accusations against him are groundless.
In another finding likely to disappoint many families and campaigners, it also cleared Nathi Mthethwa, the police minister at the time. The commission found that the executive played no role in the decision of the police to implement the tactical option on 16 August 2012.
The commission was far more critical of the police, however, noting that a plan to encircle the strikers with barbed wire was abandoned and replaced with a tactical option which was defective in a number of respects.
It said: The tactical option was implemented at about 15.40 that day, resulting in the deaths of strikers at scene 1 and scene 2. The commission found the police operation should not have taken place on 16 August because of the defects of the plan. It would have been impossible to disarm and disperse the strikers without significant bloodshed on the afternoon of 16 August. The police should have waited until the following day when the original ensettlement plan, which was substantially risk free, could have been implemented.
The report continued: The commission also found that the operation should have been stopped after the shooting at scene 1 and there was also a complete lack of command and control at scene 2.
The commission has also questioned the conduct of the police management during the inquiry. The police leadership did not initially disclose to the commission the fact the original plan was not capable of being implemented on the first date and had been abandoned, it said. In addition police leadership did not inform the commission that the decision to go ahead with the tactical option  was taken at the national management forum on 15 August. Instead they informed the commission the decision was taken on 16 August and only after the situation had escalated.
The report added: The commission has also raised serious concerns that there was a delay of about an hour in getting medical assistance to the strikers who were injured at scene 1 and accepts that at least one striker might have survived if he had been treated timeously.
Phiyegas position as national police commissioner appears untenable after the commission recommended an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. Zuma said: I have written to the national commissioner to inform her of the recommendations pertaining to her.
The massacre was captured on multiple TV cameras and shown around the world. Many were shocked to see the police of a black majority government opening fire on black mineworkers, apparently to defend the interests of London-based mining company.
The tragedy also highlighted the squalid living conditions of mineworkers who had been pleading with wealthy executives for decent pay.
The commission criticised the conduct of two trade unions that were engaged in a turf war at the mine but was also scathing about Lonmin saying: The commission has found that Lonmin did not use its best endeavours to resolve the disputes that arose between itself and its workers who participated in the unprotected strike on the one hand, and between the strikers and those workers who did not participate in the strike.
It also did not respond appropriately to the threat of, and the outbreak of, violence. Lonmin also failed to employ sufficient safeguards and measures to ensure the safety of its employees. Lonmin also insisted that its employees who were not striking should come to work despite the fact it knew that it was not in a position to protect them from attacks by strikers.
South African news media reported a mood of profound disappointment in Marikana itself over what they saw as the commissions failure to hold senior politicians to account. Some were critical of the abrupt timing of the reports release at 7pm with little notice for them to prepare.
James Nichol, a British lawyer who represented the families of dead mineworkers during the commission hearings, said: Its outrageous really the fact we are nearly three years on and we are no closer to understanding why hundreds of police officers fired machine guns at miners that day.
The report suggests it was a bungled job and they should have known better  thats just not good enough. Why did those police officers open fire? We dont know that.
Nichol added: It was a whitewash for the government and ministers including Cyril Ramaphosa. Not even one of them is held responsible.
As far as Lonmin is concerned, its they should have done better but theres no suggestion of them paying compensation. All in all, its a shambles.
Rehad Desai, a member of the Marikana Support Campaign, said: Shockingly bad is an understatement. Its terrible that it only recommends an inquiry into the national police commissioners fitness for office rather than her dismissal.
Lonmin welcomed the report but declined to tackle specific criticisms. Ben Magara, its chief executive, said: Lonmin gave its full support to the commission. Its findings will need our detailed consideration before we take further action and before we provide our considered responses.
We as a company have already moved a long way towards building a more open, transparent and mutually trusting environment. I cannot say that we have fully achieved this yet, but I can say that we have made progress, and we will continue to do so in conjunction with other stakeholders.
He added: While the report will generate painful memories for many people, it is all of our responsibility not to lose sight of our common humanity, not to destroy the good work already done, to conduct ourselves respectfully and with due restraint and empathy, and to provide support to those who need it.
The report was fiercely attacked by an opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which expressed deep sadness, disappointment and shock. Based on the summary, it said, the report has basically declared this cold winter evening the saddest since the dawn of democracy in 1994.
The party said: In essence, 34 mineworkers were massacred in full view of the world and there is no recommendation of prosecution and someone to be held accountable.
The report has not put any blame on anyone; it has not called on anyone to apologise and it has not recommended reparations for any of the lives lost. One is left to wonder if the Farlam Commission was actually investigating the same Marikana Massacre we all witnessed on 16 August 2012.
The EFF said it had assembled legal experts to study the report and its leaders would soon meet to establish a way forward. We can guarantee all South Africans that EFF will never rest until those responsible, particularly the political elite that presided over the police, including Cyril Ramaphosa, are prosecuted and sent to jail.
Mmusi Maimaine, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said: The DA will call for nothing less than the dismissal of national police commissioner Riah Phiyega, who is clearly unfit for office.
The report has plainly found that Riah Phiyega and the SAPS [police] leadership took a decision that they knew would result in bloodshed. They never stopped the operation when the shootings began, and they left miners to die in the dust for a full hour before medical help was called in.
We are deeply disappointed that the then police minister, Nathi Mthethwa, was absolved from any wrongdoing whereas, as the political head of the police service, he needed to accept due responsibility as would have been the case in any normal democracy.

About 100 university students in Burundi are in the US embassys parking lot seeking refuge amid the countrys political turmoil, an embassy statement confirmed Thursday.
The students had been camping at a construction site adjacent to the embassy grounds after their university was closed on 30 April due to political turmoil. Police persuaded them to leave the site and some went to the embassys parking lot, the statement said. Four people received minor injuries during the incident, the embassy said.
The students said they fear aggression after violent demonstrations against President Pierre Nkurunzizas efforts to run for a third term in elections in July.
Landry Ndikuriyo, a history major at the National University of Burundi , said the police threatened the use of force to evict them from the building site causing a melee as students scampered for safety.
In Washington, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said some of the students were starting to leave and that all the embassy workers were safe.
There was no violent action against the embassy. This wasnt directed at the United States, Kirby told reporters. There was never any penetration of the actual embassy compound, and none of our State Department employees were under any physical threat whatsoever.
At least 77 people have died in street protests against Nkurunzizas bid for a third term in the 15 July presidential elections, according to rights activists.
Burundis second vice president said on Thursday he fled the country fearing for his life after opposing the presidents controversial effort to extend his time in power that sparked off violent protests in the capital in recent weeks.
Gervais Rufyikiri, who went to Belgium last week, said in an interview on Radio France International that he has not officially resigned. He is the most senior government official to publicly oppose Nkurunzizas efforts to stay in power. Dozens of opposition and civil society activists, government officials and journalists have gone into exile after opposing the presidents candidacy for another term.
Critics say Nkurunzizas push for another term violates the two-term limit for presidents set by the constitution.
The street protests started 26 April, after the announcement of Nkurunzizas candidacy. The demonstrations triggered an attempted coup in mid-May that was quickly put down.

BB Kings longtime business manager has been named sole executor of his estate Thursday despite objections from a lawyer for four of the late blues musicians daughters.
Clark county District Judge Gloria Sturman first refused to let attorneys Benjamin Crump and Jose Baez contest Kings will on behalf of daughters Karen Williams, Patty King, Rita Washington and Barbara Winfree.
The will, filed in January 2007, puts Laverne Toney alone in charge of administering Kings assets, his property and his trust. The trust documents have not been filed publicly.
The judge then rejected efforts by Las Vegas attorney Larissa Drohobyczer to cast Toney as having misused her power of attorney while BB King was alive to move about $1m from personal to joint bank accounts to which she had access, and to block relatives from visiting King in his dying days.
A million dollars is a big deal, Sturman said, but she left the argument for another day.
Im not saying there may not be other issues or that we may not need outside assistance, she said. But he had a plan. I dont see anything before me at this point in time that he wanted that changed.
Attorney Brent Bryson, lawyer for the estate and Toney, said claims by the daughters that Toney stole from their father, isolated him and poisoned him before his 14 May death at age 89 had no basis in fact. The family members had provided no evidence that a competing will existed, he said.
There has to be more to the objections than hollow allegations and innuendo, Bryson said.
Sturman said several times she admired that BB King continued to play hundreds of concerts a year until October when he collapsed during a concert in Chicago.
He worked his entire life to provide for his family, the judge told the daughters as she named Toney as executor. The thing he left for you is his amazing body of work. Somebody has got to make sure that his legacy is protected.
King has 11 surviving adult children, and family members count 35 grandchildren.
The will was filed on 20 May under Kings birth name, Riley B King. It leaves everything to the estate and Toney, who managed Kings road show business for 39 years.
It lists one daughter, Riletta Mitchell, as second to Toney as executor, but Mitchell died in September. Her son, Eric Mitchell II, was represented in court on Thursday by Las Vegas attorney Bradley Richardson, who asked the judge to protect Kings intellectual property and royalty rights for his heirs.
Its far past time to pull this out of the public eye, Mitchell said by telephone from Chicago. The concern is that my grandfather was a private person and wouldnt have wanted this. Its time for the wild accusations to stop.
Bryson and Toney declined outside court to estimate the value of Kings estate. Drohobyczer has said she thinks the estate is worth between $5m and $10m.
Crump and Baez said on Thursday they would continue investigating whether King was properly cared for before he died.

China has uncovered widespread misappropriation of 16.9bn yuan (1.7bn) of funds from its state lottery programme, underscoring the extent of official corruption, which the government is trying to root out.
Funds were misappropriated through the buying and building of office buildings and hotels or embezzled, Chinas national audit office said in a report on its website.
The state auditor said the irregularities accounted for a quarter of the total of lottery funds received in its 2012-14 investigation, which spanned 18 provinces. It said 17 provinces had flouted the law by engaging in lottery sales over the internet without approval from the finance ministry.
In another case, 32 lottery shops had used 3.1bn yuan to construct office buildings, training centres and hotels, the report said.
Spurred by rising disposable income, a strong appetite for gambling and more sophisticated games, Chinas lottery market has boomed, with customers splurging billions of dollars. China is expected to overtake the United States as the worlds biggest lottery market this year.
The government has so far contained casino gambling to Macau, in part because of social concerns. Experts say officials consider the lottery system more sanitised, with fewer negative effects on citizens.
The review comes as President Xi Jinpings government wages a fight against corruption, warning that the problem is so bad it could affect the Communist partys grip on power.
Lottery products are typically sold in the form of paper tickets from authorised outlets throughout the country. These range from dedicated lottery stores to counters in supermarkets, post offices and petrol stations.
Unlike the US and Europe, where prizes can climb into the hundreds of millions of dollars, China caps jackpots at 10m yuan. Tickets sell for 2 yuan to 200 yuan, with proceeds supporting sports and welfare charities.

        <MainBody>Whitney Houstons daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown has been moved to hospice care after months in hospital, and a lawsuit has been brought against her partner.
In a statement on Wednesday, her aunt Pat Houston said Browns condition had worsened.
Despite the great medical care at numerous facilities, Bobbi Kristina Browns condition has continued to deteriorate, the statement read. As of today, she has been moved into hospice care.
Brown, 22, was found face down and unresponsive in the bath at her home in the Atlanta area on 31 January.
We thank everyone for their support and prayers. She is in Gods hands now, the statement read.
A lawsuit brought on Wednesday against Browns partner, Nick Gordon, accuses him of being physically and emotionally abusive, misrepresenting the nature of their relationship and taking money from her without authorisation.
Bedilia Hargrove, a court-appointed conservator for Brown, is seeking at least $10m (6.4m) in damages. Gordon is accused of assault, battery, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, unjust enrichment and conversion.
The complaint says after that Brown was placed in a medically induced coma, he stole more than $11,000 from her bank account. Calls to Gordons lawyer were not returned.
Brown is also the daughter of the singer Bobby Brown. He, along with Pat Houston, were appointed her co-guardians last month.
Whitney Houston was found unresponsive in a hotel bath on in February 2012 and died shortly after. Pat Houston, her sister-in-law and manager, was appointed administrator of the trust fund she had set up for her daughter.

        <title>The solidarity fridge: Spanish town's cool way to cut food waste</title>

The large white fridge sits prominently on a pavement in Galdakao, a small city on the outskirts of Bilbao.
A wooden fence has been built around it, in the hope of conveying the idea that this is not an abandoned appliance, but a pioneering project aimed at tackling food wastage.
For the past seven weeks, Galdakao, population 29,000, has been home to Spains first solidarity fridge, in which residents and restaurants can drop off leftover or unused food otherwise destined for the bin. Anything left in the fridge can be picked up by anyone who wants it. I would guess weve saved between 200 and 300kg from the rubbish bin, said organiser lvaro Saiz. A typical day might see leftover lentils, a few sandwiches and unopened milk cartons left in the fridge.

The idea came about as Saiz and other members of the citys volunteer association were reflecting on the sheer amount of food being thrown out by supermarkets. We started to think that if even just one of their rubbish bins was replaced with a fridge, people could take advantage of these items. After an online search revealed a network of shared fridges in Berlin, he said. We realised we could do this  so we did.
It took about a month to wade through the paperwork needed for the project, including securing a permit from the city to use public space and obtaining the right legal documents to ensure organisers wouldnt be held liable should anything go wrong with food taken from the fridge.

As his group pushed forward with the idea, they heard all sorts of opinions from city residents, said the 36-year-old. I realised that the people who dont support it, its because they dont understand what were doing.
The goal, according to Saiz, isnt to feed people in need. This isnt charity. Its about making use of food that would otherwise end up in the bin, he said. It doesnt matter who takes it  Julio Iglesias could stop by and take the food  at the end of the day its about recovering the value of food products and fighting against waste.
There are strict rules for anyone leaving food in the fridge: no raw fish, meat or eggs, packaged or canned goods cannot be past their use-by date and anything prepared at home must include a label detailing when it was made.

Volunteers keep an eye on the fridge to throw out anything past its use-by date or homemade dishes that are more than four days old. But thats in theory: so far all food has been taken on a daily basis.
All sorts of people have dropped by so far, said Saiz, including those in need who make a special trip to the fridge from nearby towns and a construction worker who took an ice-cream bar  dropped off with just a few days left before its best-before date  during his lunch break.
Last week the city of Murcia, some 400 miles away in the the south of Spain , copied the idea and became the second Spanish city to host a solidarity fridge. Saiz has received calls from communities across the country  and from as far as Bolivia  from people interested in setting up similar operations.
The fridge has also allowed local restaurants to alleviate guilt over their food wastage, said lvaro Llonin of Topa restaurant. Before we used to throw away a lot of food  and it was food that was fine to eat.
He and the staff at the busy restaurant in the centre of Galdakaonow regularly make time to drop off their leftovers in the fridge. You know someone is enjoying it, he said. Its like giving our food a second chance to end up in someones stomach.

Paraguay deploys anti-narco top guns to combat economic need for weed
Led by a man whose Danger Zone ringtone belies his background as a hardened military campaigner, Paraguay has adopted slash and burn tactics to tackle cannabis growers. But there is a growing realisation that measures are required to help smallholder farmers find better ways to support themselves

Nstor was 14 when a local drug trafficker first hired him to help bring in the harvest. They need 20 to 30 people, because you have to harvest an entire hectare in two or three days while theres a gap in the rains, he says. When the marijuanas ready, you cant leave it for long.
Growing up on the outskirts of Pedro Juan Caballero, a lawless town on Paraguays north-eastern border with Brazil, wasnt easy. His father, a ranch manager, was away from home for three months at a time. His mother washed clothes to put food on the table.
Then they approach you, and say theyre going to pay you 80,000 guaranes [9.56; $15] a day, with an advance. You know how much your family is in need, so youre forced to take it. And then youre committed. Thats why everyone gets corrupted and goes to work there.
Thirty years later, Nstor  not his real name  is still in the business. He has his own plantation up in the mountains, the low fists of red sandstone that punch through the jungle of Amambay department. He employs a clutch of workers to live there, growing, guarding, and harvesting the crop. They are farmers who sold their small plots of land out of economic desperation, according to Nstor. They jump on the offer of any work, even if it means cultivating illegal crops.
Nstors small house in Pedro Juan is dotted with souvenirs from his plantation. A feral baby jaguarundi scurries out from underneath a wardrobe to snatch chunks of meat from his wifes hand. A pair of parrots sit on a tree out back, and watch as he brings out six bricks of pressed hashish  the potent, THC-heavy resin of the cannabis plant  weighing a kilo each.

It is a fraction of what Nstor can produce from Paraguays fertile red soil in two harvests a year. The landlocked nation of 7 million inhabitants is Latin Americas biggest producer of the narcotic after Mexico, and 80% of the countrys marijuana ends up in the megacities of Brazil, transported by criminal enterprises like Rios Red Command . Paraguay also increasingly serves as a corridor for Colombian, Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine bound for Brazil, Africa and Europe.
The marijuana and cocaine trades are fuelled by the underdevelopment that has dogged Paraguay since independence. Over the past 10 years, successive modernising administrations have produced a GDP boom by supplying Brazil with beef, wheat and soybean. But mechanised agribusiness has left many of Paraguays rural communities behind.
Paraguay is a rich country, but full of poor people, says Eladio Flecha, general secretary of the Partido Paraguay Pyahura (PPP; Party for a New Paraguay), a new political movement made up of several leftwing groups. The distribution of wealth is very unequal: 80% of land is held by 2.5% of the population, and 161 people control 90% of the wealth of our country. Sure, the economy is growing fast, but it doesnt reach the most vulnerable groups.
His partys name is a mix of Spanish and Guaran, the indigenous language spoken by more than 90% of the population, and as a first language by many. Lack of Spanish, the formal language of politics and business, joins other obstacles  such as low levels of education, poor communications and dirt roads that quickly turn to mud in the rain  to isolate rural communities.
Flecha says small-scale farmers scarcely earn 8,000 guaranes for a 70kg sack of the Paraguayan staple manioc. Over the past decade, more than 1 million small farmers and their families have migrated to informal jobs on the edges of towns, easy prey to the temptation offered by traffickers.
Stemming the flow of marijuana
Eradication operations are the only real way of diminishing the supply of drugs and financially hitting the plantation owners. Here, in a single day, I can take up to 150,000kg of marijuana out of circulation, says Captain Oscar Chamorro, from Paraguays overstretched National Anti-Drugs Secretariat ( Senad ), as 60 special forces troops line up in a hangar on the edge of Pedro Juan at dawn.
They check their weapons, pile into cars, trucks and helicopters, and make their way out to a rendezvous in the mountains. On the way, Chamorro  who has 21 years of military experience, with 10 in Senad  dismisses the notion that Paraguayans are turning to pot to escape poverty.
They dont do it to survive, they do it to earn money. Marijuana producers will tell you, No, I dont have anything else I can do. But in reality, if the campesino cultivated his 10 hectares of land well, or put 10 cows on it, hes going to earn enough to live on, Chamorro says.
Theyre just looking to boost their income. Theres not a single small farmer who doesnt have his cell phone, his motorbike. They can earn more with narcotrafficking, but I dont believe this is a valid excuse.
It is day three of a nine-day operation. Reconnaissance flights have already identified the marijuana plantations, dotted among private forest reserves. The helicopters drop off teams of six among the green stalks, where they work until the midday heat becomes too oppressive. Major Aldo Pintos jumps out and heads for a camp in the trees. A couple of tarpaulins cover a sleeping area, filled with colorful duvets and sacks of marijuana. A few toothbrushes are in a jar tied to a tree, and a pot sits over some glowing embers.

They hide when they hear the rotors. Theyre probably still nearby, says Pintos, cradling his assault rifle in one hand. With the other, he pours cooking oil over the tents and touches a match to the plastic. In the next valley, the soldiers burn presses used to make the bricks of marijuana. Then, they form a loose line and take out their machetes, walking forward and hacking the plants to the ground.
Chamorros men are highly motivated and disciplined: one of his officers was trained at Sandhurst, others by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which paid for the base in Pedro Juan. As they zoom around the hills, a casual observer might dismiss them as cowboys  Chamorros ringtone is Danger Zone from the movie Top Gun  but Senad put in the most hours of all of Paraguays public employees. It is, says Chamorro, a vocation.
You feel very proud knowing that youre preventing these drugs going out on the streets. We all have a friend, a relative whos living with the problem of drugs, and we know how much damage it does to society, says Chamorro. But we have a more modern drugs policy than many developed countries: we dont lock up the user, but treat it as a health problem.
Eradication eats into the traffickers profits, he explains, and prevents them from moving into the cocaine trade: a trend borne out by Nstor, who has spent time behind bars in Uruguay and Brazil for transporting the powder. Senad agents periodically swoop on hidden airstrips, light aircraft and makeshift laboratories used to bulk up Andean cocaine paste and export it across the invisible border.
The rivalry this lucrative business creates plays out to gory effect in Pedro Juan, says Cndido Figueredo, who has two decades experience reporting for the national daily ABC Color from his home town. Here, a life is worth absolutely nothing, he says. The police sometimes find a body near the border in the morning, and they dump it on the other side. Its less paperwork.
According to police figures, an annual average of 105 homicides occured in Pedro Juan between 2009 and 2014.
Drug trafficking was a familiar feature under the military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. Drug money has further infected national politics since the return to democracy, contributing to endemic corruption and a culture of silence.
Loads of politicians, especially ones from the border, are 100% contaminated by the mafia and receive mafia support for their campaigns. In this country, if you have money, you can buy anyone: from a journalist to a minister, Figueredo laments.
The few independent journalists who speak out do so at their peril: disgruntled narcos have twice riddled Figueredos bungalow in Pedro Juan with machine-gun fire, forcing him to accept round-the-clock police protection. He also carries a 9mm pistol whenever he leaves the house with his guards.
The mafia has killed four journalists since May 2014, including two within metres of the border between Pedro Juan and Brazils Ponta Por. In October, when gunmen shot Pablo Medina , Figueredos colleague, national soul-searching gave rise to a new term: narcopolitica. It emerged that a marijuana-trafficking local mayor, allegedly protected by a congresswoman, had given the order.
Before Pablo Medina died, we believed we were on the right track. We ignored the fact that the marijuana business had grown, and occupied political space, says Senad minister Luis Rojas in his office in Asuncin, Paraguays capital.

We realised that we couldnt just continue with the strategy of cutting and burning marijuana. We had to investigate the structures behind it, just like with cocaine  And we had to realise that we dont know how much marijuana there is in Paraguay . We dont know about its economic and social impact. We dont know anything.
Senad has since paid more attention to capturing and getting information from the kingpins. Rojas is creating a centre for research into marijuana trafficking, and is boosting rehabilitation and education efforts. The next challenge is to pass laws on campaign finance and property forfeiture, preventing drug bosses from controlling politicians and operating from jail. Its painful to admit the reality, but its the only way to build intelligent public policies. The rest is bullshit, says Rojas.
For the PPPs Flecha, the changes  if delivered  will not come a moment too soon. But he disagrees with the claim that poor farmers turning to drug cultivation for survival is a thing of the past, and with the militarisation of the countryside.
The Paraguayan campesinos form of subsistence is under attack from the big latifundistas [landowners] and agricultural exporters, says Flecha. Theres no escape, and so he falls under the control of the mafia. To genuinely combat the narcotraffickers, the government should have a policy for small producers, and strengthen traditional production.
Supporting smallholder farmers
The southern department of Alto Paran represents the problem in microcosm. While international agricultural firms show off gleaming rows of tractors and pesticide sprayers at a local trade fair , Francisco Pereira drives around the backroads, engaged in a tireless struggle to encourage local communities to hold on to their lands and forests and resist what he calls the soybean-isation of the countryside.
Pereira, policy director of the World Wildlife Funds Paraguayan chapter , points out the fields of the stunted crop, creeping up on both sides of the road and planted within two metres of a local schools windows, liberally sprayed with pesticides thanks to minimal restrictions by the state. From the production perspective, soy brings greater earnings for Paraguay, he agrees. But from the point of view of the schools, of the families who are left with the soil, its a problem. Theres a real risk of the misuse of agrotoxins having a severe effect on campesino and indigenous communities.
The health concerns and economic pressures prove too much for many farmers, who sell up and move to the towns.

But Pereira and a handful of local NGOs are helping communities diversify into small-scale production for local sale and export. Farmers can secure significant returns from medicinal plants, and crops like watermelon and yerba mate  the bitter leaf drunk nationwide. And such products provide employment for the whole community, planting the seedlings in the village nursery, transferring them to the fields, and eventually harvesting them.
Four years of encouragement from the WWF has turned things around in the village of Tavapy, says resident Simeon Luis. All these trees that are here now are proof, and the houses too. Before there wasnt anything. Were thinking about moving into floriculture, and weve planted over 200,000 yerba plants. Within three or four years, theyll begin making money. And then well be able to breathe.
Restoring optimism and technical knowhow to Paraguays small farming communities so they can support themselves is the missing component in tackling marijuana cultivation, Chamorro admits. The government is already investing more in schools, but improvements will take time. And for some, changing the habits of a lifetime will be hard.
Nstor is just getting started again after leaving jail. I know a guy who owns a favela in Rio. There, a kilogram of marijuana gets 1,000 reais ($300; 191), so a thousand kilograms will earn me a million reais. Then Ill be back in business, he says.
 This article was amended on 26 June to clarify that hashish is made using the resin of the cannabis plant rather than the sap, as originally stated.

Barack Obama had a heckler thrown out of a gay pride reception at the White House on Wednesday evening, telling her shame on you for interrupting him. Jennicet Gutirrez, a transgender woman, disrupted the US presidents speech by shouting , saying his administration should release lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender immigrants from detention.
President Obama, stop the torture and abuse of trans women in detention centres, cried Gutirrez, one of the founders of the Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement , who is supported by the LGBT advocacy group GetEqual .
Obama, who was giving a speech about civil rights for lesbian, gay and transsexual Americans, responded by shaking his head, wagging his finger, and repeatedly saying no. Then, pointing to Gutirrez, he said: Hey. Listen. Youre in my house  You know what? Its not respectful when you get invited to somebodys 
Before asking security guards to escort Gutirrez outside, he said: Youre not going to get a good response from me by interrupting me like this. Im sorry. Im sorry  Shame on you, you shouldnt be doing this.
Gutirrez has said she is an undocumented immigrant. Campaigners have expressed alarm at the conditions transgender people face in immigration detention following reports of sexual assault and a lack of medical care.
Familia said that as a transgender woman who was undocumented in the US, Gutirrez felt she could not celebrate Gay Pride Month while 75 transgender detainees were still being exposed to assault and abuse. The group said she went to the US from Mexico, seeking safety and economic opportunities.
After the incident Gutirrez said: There is no pride in how LGBTQ and transgender immigrants are treated in this country. If the president wants to celebrate with us, he should release the LGBTQ immigrants locked up in detention centres immediately. LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (or queer).
In his address, Obama said that regardless of how the supreme court would rule on same-sex marriage, there had been an undeniable shift in attitudes across the country. He said he was watching for the courts decisions in the coming days, including one concerning a case that could affirm the right of same-sex couples nationwide to marry. The president singled out discrimination against transgender Americans as an area where more progress was needed.

        <title>Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: 'I am guilty and I am sorry'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/24/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-boston-marathon-bombing-survivors-speak</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
Convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has given his first public statement since carrying out the April 2013 terrorist attack.
I would like to now apologize to the victims, to the survivors, he told a Boston court shortly before being formally sentenced to death for the bombing. I want to ask forgiveness of Allah and his creation.
He added: I am sorry for the lives I have taken, for the suffering that I have caused you, for the damage I have done  irreparable damage.
In case there is any doubt, I am guilty of this attack, along with my brother, Tsarnaev said, standing at the defense table, referring to his older brother Tamerlan, killed during the manhunt that followed the bombing.
To the victims attending the hearing at the US district court, he said: I pray for your relief, for your healing.
Tsarnaevs voice occasionally faltered as he spoke, and he left meaningful pauses after each apology to the victims of the 2013 bombing and manhunt, which left four dead and more than 260 injured.
He also thanked nearly everyone who had been involved in the trial: his attorneys, his family, everyone who testified with dignity about their unbearable hardships.
He also touched on the accusation that he showed no remorse during the trial, saying: I learned [victims] stories, their names and that he learned more faces with every hearing. His attorney, Judy Clarke, also mentioned the accusations of lacking remorse, saying her client had offered to resolve the case without trial in 2014. US attorney Carmen Ortiz cast doubt on the statement. Clarkes statement as it was made in court was not completely accurate and it was not complete, Ortiz said.
Quoting the prophet Muhammad, Tsarnaev said there would be no mercy for those who showed none.
Judge George OToole invoked Shakespeare to Tsarnaev: When your name is mentioned all that will be remembered is the evil you have done.
Tsarnaevs statement came after an emotional morning of testimony during which survivors and family members of the victims faced the bomber and made a series of defiant and moving speeches to the court.

Tsarnaev met their anger and anguish with the same implacable blankness that he wore throughout his long trial. Dressed in a black suit, the 21-year-old sat impassive next to his lawyers.
He folded and refolded his hands, rested his chin on a fist, and occasionally scratched his beard or head. He tilted his gaze to the ground, and only rarely looked at the speakers as they described injuries, nightmares and lost loved ones.
In contrast, many of the survivors and victims families and friends made direct remarks to Tsarnaev, often in voices shaking with emotion.
Jennifer Rogers, the sister of Sean Collier, an MIT police officer killed by the Tsarnaev brothers after the bombing, vented years of anger at Tsarnaev.
I will never have a complete family ever again, Rogers said before describing her brother as a gregarious, generous man, whose love of the small moments was stolen by Tsarnaev. She said there was at least some solace in knowing Tsarnaev would not know the joy of those moments.
He is a coward and a liar, she said. He is a leech abusing the privileges of American freedom.
OToole was required to uphold the jurys May recommendation that Tsarnaev be sentenced to death, but Rogers urged him to place exceptional restrictions on Tsarnaevs incarceration wherever possible.

Elizabeth Bourgault, a runner who survived the blasts with injuries, also called Tsarnaev a coward.
Whatever God that the defendant believes in is not going to welcome his actions, she said. The defendants God will condemn him to an eternity of suffering.
Intense sadness mingled with the anger. Bill Richard, who lost his eight-year-old son Martin to the bombing, said: Theres nothing we can say that will change anything for us.
Tsarnaev could have stopped his brother, he could have changed his mind, Richard said. He chose hate, he chose destruction, he chose death.
But Richard said of he and his wife Denise: We choose love, and reiterated their opposition to the death penalty.
We prefer he have a lifetime to reconcile himself with what he did that day, [but] he will not live that long, said Richard.
The bombing killed three people, Krystle Marie Campbell, 29, Lu Lingzi, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard.
Days later Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan killed Collier as federal and state law enforcement hunted them down in the Boston area.
This was an extraordinary case, OToole said. We will never forget the victims of these crimes and their stories.
You had to forget your own humanity, the common humanity you shared with your brother Martin, your sister Lingzi Lu, he continued. It is tragic, for your victims and now for you.
OToole also repudiated the extremist rationale that inspired the Tsarnaev brothers: Surely someone who believes God smiles on and rewards the killing of innocents believes in a cruel god. This is not and cannot be the god of Islam.
At 21, Tsarnaev now becomes the youngest person on death row in the United States. Following the hearing, he will be taken from custody in Massachusetts to a federal prison in Indiana. He probably faces over a decade of appeals before his execution could take place.
OToole said no one would remember that Tsarnaevs teachers or friends were fond of him. He said what they what remember was that Tsarnaev murdered and maimed innocent people and did it willfully and intentionally.
Tsarnaev looked down and rubbed his hands together as the judge sentenced him. An appeal is automatic in death penalty cases.
During the testimony, police arrested a man outside the Moakley federal courthouse when he drove up in a Honda and took a large knife out of his license plate holder.

A handful of survivors spoke of forgiveness, and a few even mentioned closure. But many spoke of fighting for their future and of recovering despite the rippling consequences of the attack: medical costs, nightmares, children growing up without limbs, friends who no longer know how to communicate, and terror at the sounds of doors and sirens.
Survivor Johanna Hantel said that the trial has not been healing for her: I do not believe in closure.
But she did express pity for Tsarnaev, and was among a minority who asked him to try to do something good with the time he has left. In contrast, Michael Chase, a first responder who described the horror on Boylston Street in graphic detail, said: I dont want to speak to him. Im here to say were OK.
Stephanie Benz, whose left side had frozen as a result of injuries sustained in the bombing, said that she still had hope despite daily pain. Heather Abbott, an amputee, said that she did not care about Tsarnaevs fate. I care about what lies ahead for me and the other survivors and loved ones, she said.
Rebecca Gregory, a double amputee, stood before Tsarnaev defiant. To deliver a victim impact statement, Id have to be someones victim. And Im definitely not yours, she said.
Gregory said she hoped Tsarnaev could be shown the bigger picture of his actions.

Terrorists like you do two things in this world. One, they create mass destruction, but the second is quite interesting, Gregory said. Because do you know what mass destruction really does? It brings people together. We are Boston strong and we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea.
Hows that for your victim impact statement?
Meghan Zipin, another survivor, summed up a sentiment felt by many of her fellows who have struggled to piece their lives together and make sense of the prolonged trial.
She said that while sitting in court she had reflected on her future  going home to her husband, doing yoga and having pizza  contrasted with Tsarnaevs future in prison and the courts. I realized Im the one whos alive. The defendant, hes already dead.
After OToole sentenced Tsarnaev, most of the men and women who testified to their experiences left the court without responding to questions from the media. Three remained to field questions, including Lynn Julian, who described Tsarnaevs statement as an Oscar-type speech.
I regret having ever wanted him to speak, she said, adding that she heard no remorse in his voice. There was nothing simple about what he said and there was nothing sincere.
US attorney Carmen Ortiz said that the hearing was a day for the victims to have a voice and that her team of prosecutors are all feeling very gratified by the hearing.
She said that she was struck less by Tsarnaevs surprise speech than by what he didnt say.
He didnt renounce violence, she said. He didnt renounce terrorism.

Next month, well-heeled punters will flock to the Qatar Goodwood Festival for one of the highlights of the British horse racing calendar. Meanwhile in Paris, a once down-at-heel football club that became home to David Beckham and Zlatan Ibrahimovic is undergoing a metamorphosis into one of the top 10 sporting brands in the world.
In Doha, construction work is well under way on stadiums built to host an endlessly controversial World Cup in November 2022, including the showpiece Lusail Iconic stadium that nestles in a city built from scratch on the outskirts of the Qatari capital. Now, though, the tiny gulf state could be about to add another prime target to its global trolley dash: a major stake in Formula One .
A controlling stake in the sport, built over four decades by Bernie Ecclestone into a global money-spinning machine, has been the subject of rumoured interest over the years from a variety of suitors, including Rupert Murdoch.
But the Guardian understands that a mooted $7bn-plus bid from Qatar Sports Investments (QSI)  which also owns Paris St Germain (PSG) and the global sports broadcasting network beIN Sports  and a billionaire-backed US group is the most serious yet.
QSI is the sports arm of the Qatar investment fund that owns London landmarks including the Shard, Canary Wharf and the Olympic Village. Ecclestones 5% share in F1 would be sold alongside 35.5% owned by a venture capital firm CVC, but he would probably stay on in the short-term to run the sport. One of the most immediate motives for such a move might be to ensure that Qatar had its own F1 race in a calendar that includes events in neighbouring Abu Dhabi and nearby Bahrain.
In Britain, a similar rationale has underpinned huge Qatari investment in horse racing. Sheikh Joaan Al Thani, a son of the former emir of Qatar, retains Frankie Dettori to ride his string of horses and now sponsors the festival more commonly known as Glorious Goodwood. Sheikh Fahad Al Thani, meanwhile, established Qatar Racing and Qatar Bloodstock as subsidiaries of the private investment company Qipco, in 2011.
Qipco this year unveiled a 50m sponsorship deal with British racing to underwrite the Champions Series, taking in the biggest flat races of the season, until 2024.
As with Qatars other investments, from substantial stakes in Sainsburys and Barclays to its push into landmark London properties, the rationale is twofold. As outlined in its 2030 Vision document, the gas-rich state is attempting to prepare for a future beyond its bounteous natural resources and invest globally in industries that can provide an ongoing return.
But it has also chosen some of the most eyecatching brands and properties in the world as a means of putting the country on the map, and projecting soft power in an unstable region built on constantly shifting political alliances with its neighbours and the west.
While senior sources in Doha are keen to underline the differences between the investment funds and businesses that have bought into world sport on multiple levels, in a feudal monarchy with a single source of huge wealth the lines inevitably become blurred.
In 2010, Qatar agreed a deal for its charitable Qatar Foundation to take over Barcelonas sponsorship from Unicef, before a deal for Qatar Airways took effect that has since been renewed.
Sport presses emotional buttons that other investments cannot reach and the strategy is far from haphazard as far as QSI is concerned.
PSG were seized upon by QSI for the untapped potential of the biggest one-club city in Europe. Since then, partly through acquisitions including Beckham, Ibrahimovic, and Edinson Cavani  plus major investment in the stadium and infrastructure  the club has been successfully rebranded. A once down-on-its luck side has been transformed into an upmarket lifestyle choice.
The beIN Sports network, formerly al-Jazeera Sport, has bought up sports rights and launched channels around the world, including the US, and would provide a ready-made outlet for F1. It is the potential prize of combining ownership of a sport with the means of distribution that has attracted interest from Murdoch and others.
It is in this context of a web of complementary investments that the prospective F1 deal should be viewed. Where neighbouring countries have focused on retail or tourism, Qatar (like near neighbour Abu Dhabi, owner of Manchester City) has alighted upon sport and culture as a means of asserting its place in the world.
Sport is also seen as a means of bringing together a fast changing nation that is virtually unrecognisable from a generation ago and where the indigenous population enjoys the highest per capita income in the world, but are outnumbered seven to one by migrant labourers fuelling a construction boom.
Hand in hand with its global investments in sport, Qatars then-emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, succeeded by his son Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani in 2013, agreed to a push to bring the biggest global sporting events to the country. Bids for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics failed at the shortlisting stage.
But despite the climactic challenges in a country, where summer temperatures regularly top 50 degrees, it will host the world cycling road racing championships in 2016 and the world athletics championships in 2019, following money-no-object bids.
Most controversially of all, in December 2010 Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup in a vote that caused shockwaves that are still reverberating. While there is now believed to be some concern at the highest levels over the scrutiny that the World Cup has brought, it has clearly not damaged Qatars determination to buy into world sport at the highest level.

US prosecutors have launched an investigation into the balcony collapse in Berkeley, California , that killed six students as the family of the final victim to be buried revealed that a postcard from him had arrived home after his death.
Lorcan Millers father, Ken, showed the card to mourners at Rathmichael parish church in Shankill south, County Dublin, on Thursday.
On its front was the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, where the 21-year-old medical student had started work this summer. It only arrived on Tuesday, almost a week after he was killed.
The postcard read: As part of my job I have to talk with customers and I always tell them about my amazing brother and sisters and how much I miss them. Miller had signed the card with 12 kisses.
During the funeral, Ken Miller broke down as he paid an emotional tribute to his truly remarkable son. Lorcan was an extrovert who loved life and wasnt afraid to try new things, he told the congregation. He threw everything he had into everything he did.
Meanwhile, Conor Flynn, a 22-year-old Dublin student injured in the incident, was released from the John Muir medical centre in Walnut Creek, California. Flynn will remain in the San Francisco Bay area for a few weeks until he is able to fly home.

Sean Fahey was the first student to be discharged from hospital on Sunday and is already home in Ireland .
Six young people fell 12 metres (40ft) to their deaths while seven were hurt when the balcony they were on came away from the exterior wall of an apartment block on the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Five of the dead were Irish students; one had dual US-Irish nationality.
Berkeley city officials played down the prospects of criminal charges being pursued, but Alameda Countys deputy district attorney, Teresa Drenick, told Reuters that prosecutors would continue to investigate.
Potential targets could include the general contractor for the apartment building or the company that applied a waterproof membrane to the balcony, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
On Wednesday, one of the survivors posted a message on Facebook saying she may never walk again. Clodagh Cogley, 21, from Dublin, said she had sustained two collapsed lungs, a broken shoulder, a broken knee, five broken ribs and a broken spinal cord.
Life is short and I intend to honour those who died by living the happiest and most fulfilling life possible, she wrote. Who knows, maybe legs have been holding me back all these years and Ill realise my talent for wheelchair basketball.
The American environmental activist Erin Brockovich has offered her support and campaign advice to the families of th ose who died.
In a statement released on Facebook, the campaigner  who helped bring a case against a California utilities company in 1993 for poisoning a towns water for more than 30 years  said she was prepared to meet and assist the families.

Brockovich said she had linked up with Dublin law firm Phelim ONeill to help any family members as they begin their search for answers, explanations and justice.
I urge immediate action on the costs for Berkeley families. The company behind the construction of the Berkeley apartment block should take action to ensure that the families of those involved in the balcony collapse disaster are not left with enormous medical bills as a result of the faulty construction, she said.
Some of those injured would need extensive care before being able to return home, and it was essential the families did not face what Brockovich called the additional nightmare of mounting medical bills.
Brockovich added: As a Californian, I am devastated that these young visitors to our shores were caught up in this horrific situation. My heart goes out to their families, friends and loved ones, and along with all of the people of California, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the people of Ireland.

Google's action on revenge porn opens the door on right to be forgotten in US

Googles recent decision to delist revenge porn from its search results is a big deal, and not just for victims. Beyond opposing harmful conduct that disproportionately targets women , Google has essentially demonstrated how something akin to the European Unions right to be forgotten can, and should, work in the US.
Some Americans have panicked over Europes woefully misnamed right to be forgotten, anxious at the thought of the  biggest threat to free speech online erasing history and breaking the internet. But such a right doesnt have to exact an exorbitant price tag, and it can come about in many different ways .
In the case of the right to be forgotten, Google has shown that the world wont be knocked off its axis if the company goes beyond protecting financially relevant information ( copyrighted works , social security numbers, and bank information), and takes aggressive steps to remove links to socially relevant information that can harm autonomy, reputation, and emotional well-being.
As the debate over online privacy in the US advances, there are three important things to keep in mind.
1) Both government and industry must invest in data protection rights
The First Amendment restricts the ways the US government can oblige companies to provide citizens with data protection rights. The corporate free speech interests of Google and others will likely ensure that the US cannot mimic data correction and erasure rights in the EU. What this means is that the public must demand that Google  along with other online intermediaries  exerts leadership and avoids adopting a mentality thats concerned more with legal compliance than social good .
Even cynics must admit that Google made a voluntary choice to take action against revenge porn at a global level. This is the case even if the policy deflects some attention away from the tougher questions raised by delisting requests from EU citizens, and even if it follows moves by Reddit , Twitter , and other prominent companies in responding to online harassment. Evidence now suggests that if the public keeps applying pressure, industry and government can be partners in ensuring that it is hard for undesirable parties to obtain some of the information we have privacy interests in.
Seen from this perspective , good can come from the fact that Google is not legally required to make free speech exceptions for links to information some would deem newsworthy. Even countries with broader privacy rights like those in the EU could benefit from an invested industry.
2) Personal data rights will evolve through information-specific categories
The entire regulatory framework for protecting privacy in the US is fragmented and largely focused on safeguarding specific kinds of sensitive information, like health , financial , and education records. The right to be forgotten in the US will not be any different.
To be sure, a category-based approach to privacy has its drawbacks. It fuels an incremental orientation towards privacy protection, and every victory puts us at risk of being too complacent to go further and take up far-reaching and robust reforms.
But a category-based approach also has numerous advantages. Different solutions, ranging from expunging a minors criminal record to deleting stale credit history and delisting non-consensual pornography, can be worked out independently of one another. Clear justifications can be given for why special types of information are so problematic they should be obfuscated or removed from different systems. At the end of the day, categories of information that clearly do not belong in the wrong hands, such as non-consensual pornography, can be handled with comparative ease. Meanwhile, grey areas, like what to do about privacy-invasive public records, can be addressed later on as the discourse surrounding them matures.
Googles calculus for delisting seems to target information that is both harmful and without legitimate value to the public. This is a useful criterion, and the cases it covers can be expanded. As new technologies evolve and we become clearer about which categories of information should not be ripe for the picking, company policy or law might obscure additional classifications, such as biometrics and mugshots used to exploit people.
3) The right to be forgotten in the US will be, in effect, the right to obscurity
The entire history of forgetting in the US is really about making things hard to find. A minors criminal records and a persons outdated credit activity arent obliterated; indeed, many people know about them. In effect, then, what Googles new policy does is give people a limited right to obscurity .
Obscurity protections are not perfect and, as Google acknowledges , revenge porn will remain available on websites. But delisting it from search engines can make information harder to access and interpret. Such a burden can effectively deter many people from doing harmful things. According to University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks, given Googles global dominance, delisting revenge porn  will mean fewer victims of revenge porn in the future .
The ideals driving the poorly-described right to be forgotten are about striking the right balance between information availability and obscurity. Although Google claims that its stance on revenge porn is but  narrow and limited policy , the company is actually paving the way towards something far more substantial in the US.

Earlier this year, leaked emails from the Sony hack revealed that the Oscar-winner had requested details of his ancestry be suppressed after it was discovered that his background included a history of slave-owning . After producers complied, it caused controversy and it now puts the shows future at risk.
PBS and WNET have determined that the series co-producers violated PBS standards by failing to shield the creative and editorial process from improper influence, and by failing to inform PBS or WNET of Mr Afflecks efforts to affect program content, broadcaster PBS said in a statement.
The third season has now been postponed and the decision over a fourth season is yet to be made. PBS stated that it needs to be satisfied that the editorial standards of the series have been successfully raised to a level in which we can have confidence before saying yes.

The public network has also requested that if the show does move forward, the makers will need to employ another fact-checker and an independent geneaologist. Additionally, the Ben Affleck episode will be removed from circulation.
After the details emerged of Afflecks request, the star admitted that he was ashamed of what was discovered.
I didnt want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves, Affleck said in a statement posted to Facebook in April. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.

Migrants and police were engaged in an uneasy standoff on the motorways around Calais on Wednesday, as groups of young men tried to exploit the continuing disruption to climb on trucks bound for the UK.
Several hundred lorries were still queueing on the main roads leading to the ferry port and Eurotunnel, following Tuesdays strike by French ferry workers.
On the motorway above the main migrant camp  home to 3,000 people  there were regular skirmishes in the afternoon. Each time a queue of lorries formed, the migrants  many of whom have fled war and persecution in the Middle East and east Africa  abandoned what they were doing and ran up the bank to try and break into them.

French police tried to stop them and at one point officers drew their batons and hit out at a group of young men before using pepper spray on them.
Watching from the edge of the camp, Teddy, 20, from Eritrea said it had been a very difficult 24 hours. Lots and lots of people have been trying because of the lorry queues and some of them have made it, but it is very dangerous. The police have been very aggressive and many people have been injured trying to jump on the underside of lorries.
An Afghan man nearby held out his injured hand and said a police dog bit him last night. Are there any doctors? he asked.  Many people have been hurt but what else to do? We have to keep trying because this is no place to stay.
In the UK, the home secretary, Theresa May, said British and French authorities had stopped significant numbers of migrants climbing aboard lorries in Calais and entering the UK in the last two days. She said the UK border force had put in place tried and tested contingency plans to deal with chaotic scenes that led to the Channel tunnel being closed.
David Cameron moved to ease tensions with France over the migrant crisis in Calais, calling for an end to the finger pointing over who is to blame and signalling that Britain is prepared to contribute more resources if necessary. The prime minister described totally unacceptable scenes in Calais.

Asked what Britain was planning to do about the crisis, Cameron said it must work more closely with the French, tackle the people-smuggling gangs in north Africa and do more to make the UK a less attractive place for migrants.
The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart , told French radio on Tuesday that Britain had not offered a penny to help the authorities in Calais ease the pressure caused by the increasing number of migrants arriving in the town, as they attempt to travel to Britain.
But Cameron, speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, struck a conciliatory tone. This is a strong partnership that we have in place and we should keep it that way.
He said the UK would provide more security assistance to French authorities if necessary, including sending more personnel and sniffer dog teams. He also said more needed to be done with other EU countries to prevent migrants from attempting the journey to Europe in the first place. Thirdly, weve got to do more to make sure Britain is a less easy place for illegal migrants to come to and work in. Thats what our immigration bill is all about.

The heightened diplomatic tension came amid disruption caused by striking employees of the French firm MyFerryLink, whose industrial action forced the closure of the Channel tunnel and led to the cancellation of train and ferry services. Travel chaos was subsiding on Wednesday as cross-Channel services resumed but authorities in Calais continued to grapple with desperate migrants seeking to take advantage of the disruption.
One group of young men  some as young as 15  were chased away by a lorry driver as they tried to break into hisvehicle. This is terrible, worse than its ever been, said the driver from Poland, as the queue inched forward. It has been like this all night, it has been very difficult.
Another migrant managed to break the cord on the back of a nearby truck and was trying to clamber on board before he was confronted by the French driver. Neither man wanted to talk. A 17-year-old Eritrean man sitting by the side of the motorway slip road said he and his friends had been up all night trying to get into lorries bound for the UK. Many people have been trying, but it is very difficult. We are very tired now.
Emmanuel Agius, a deputy at Calais town hall, claimed that the British PM was in danger of sparking a diplomatic incident. David Cameron says he does not want these migrants, he doesnt want to take responsibility but the UK is part of the EU and it cannot continue to try and play two roles.
It is not acceptable to say: we are insular, we are an island and we will only be part of Europe how and when we want  you Europeans just deal with it. That is too easy. If he continues to speak in that way then he is in danger of creating a diplomatic incident.

For there to be a lasting solution to the crisis Europe had to work together, and that included the UK, Agius added. If the UK and Mr Cameron want to leave Europe, then at least the situation would be clear and precise and in that case the British could have their border back in the UK instead of here in Calais, he said.
Agius said migrants have one idea in their heads and that is to cross the 30km to Dover for a better life in the UK. He said the UK needs to stop ignoring that reality and take responsibility.

Nato, in an echo of the cold war, is preparing to re-evaluate its nuclear weapons strategy in response to growing tension with Russia over Ukraine, sources at the organisation have said.
Updating Natos nuclear policy would amount to an escalation in tit-for-tat exchanges with Russia since the Ukraine crisis erupted last year. Expressing concern over President Vladimir Putins announcement last week that Russia was to buy 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles, Nato officials also said there was alarm over Russian rhetoric on nuclear weapons and the extent to which such weapons are involved in military exercises.
A Nato diplomat said: There is very real concern about the way in which Russia publicly bandies around nuclear stuff. So there are quite a lot of deliberations in the alliance about nuclear [weapons], but it is being done very slowly and deliberately. We need to do due diligence on where we are.
The issue is being discussed on the margins of a two-day Nato ministerial meeting that began in Brussels on Wednesday. But the US is keen to get the issue on the table and a meeting of Natos ministerial nuclear planning group is likely to be held later this year  earlier than planned  to discuss refreshing the nuclear doctrine.

Among potential topics is an enhanced role for nuclear weapons in Nato military exercises. Also up for discussion would be how to better interpret Russian warnings about nuclear weapons: whether they should be taken seriously or whether these amount to no more than rhetoric.
Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, British defence secretary Michael Fallon said Russias nuclear messaging is not helpful. He added: It is important we understand its implications for the alliance.
Since the peak of the cold war, the US and Russia have slashed their nuclear arsenals but Russia still has an estimated 1,582 strategic warheads deployed on 515 missiles and bombers, while the US has 1,597 deployed on 785. There is no suggestion at Nato headquarters of a return to the days of nuclear arms races and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, and the US has specifically ruled out returning cruise missiles to Europe .
But Nato officials, military and diplomats are raising worries that the US-led alliances existing nuclear posture reflects the thinking of a decade ago when Russia was viewed as a potential partner. That strategy badly needed to be refreshed, they suggested. Although Nato nuclear exercises are classified, the organisation does, like Russia, conduct them. The concern at Nato is that the role of nuclear weapons in such exercises needs to be upgraded to take account of the changed relationship with Moscow.
Natos secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, said the nuclear issue was serious and had to be treated with caution. The nuclear activities, the investments of Russia in new nuclear capabilities, and the exercise activities by Russia in the nuclear domain is part of the global picture where we see a more assertive Russia.
The American ambassador to Nato, Douglas Lute, briefing journalists in Brussels on Tuesday, said: There is a general assessment under way in Washington and a parallel assessment here in Nato to look at all the possible implications of what Russia says about nuclear weapons, its doctrine and so forth, its pronouncements, its rhetoric, and what we actually see on the ground in terms of development and deployment. Nato, he added, had not yet reached any conclusions or decided on what are the actions that are implied in our response.

Putin last week announced plans to purchase 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles and complained of US acts in eastern Europe as amounting to the most aggressive since the cold war. Russia argues that the expansion of Nato into eastern Europe and its courting of Ukraine has been a repeated provocation.
A Nato official said: Deterrence, based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities is a core element of our overall strategy. We cannot go into detail on our nuclear discussions. These are internal, sensitive and classified matters. What I can say is that Nato continuously assess all aspects of Russias military activities, including Russias nuclear rhetoric.
A second Nato official said: The Russian leadership is rhetorically lowering the threshold when it comes to nuclear weapons and this is something which should not be done. It largely wasnt done even during the cold war.
This kind of nuclear threat was something which we found quite surprising, quite negative and is something we believe should be avoided but we are closely examining it carefully as part of the overall examination of Russias activities in Europe and how we at least in Nato must unfortunately react.
Fallon announced on Wednesday evening that the UK is to double its spending on training Ukrainian troops from 3m to 6m.

British intelligence agency GCHQ is facing fresh calls to reveal the extent of its involvement in the US targeted killing programme after details of a fatal drone strike in Yemen were included in a top secret memo circulated to agency staff.
A leading barrister asked by the Guardian to review a number of classified GCHQ documents said they raised questions about British complicity in US strikes outside recognised war zones and demonstrated the need for the government to come clean about the UKs role.
The documents, provided to the Guardian by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and reported in partnership with the New York Times , discuss how a joint US, UK and Australian programme codenamed Overhead supported the strike in Yemen in 2012.
The files also show GCHQ and Overhead developed their ability to track the location of individuals  essential for the targeted killing programme  in both Yemen and Pakistan. The legality of the USs lethal operations in both countries has been questioned by international lawyers and human rights groups.
Jemima Stratford QC, who reviewed the Snowden documents for the Guardian, said: Assuming that the documents which I have seen are genuine, in my view they raise questions about the extent to which UK officials may have had knowledge of, or helped to facilitate, certain US drone strikes which were not carried out in the context of an international armed conflict, she said.
These documents underline why greater transparency as to UK official policies would help to ensure legality from a domestic and international law perspective.
Stratford published a legal opinion last year warning that UK intelligence support for lethal strikes outside traditional battlefields  such as Iraq and Afghanistan  was likely to be illegal. In our view, if GCHQ transferred data to the NSA in the knowledge that it would or might be used for targeting drone strikes that transfer is probably unlawful, she wrote.

British officials and ministers follow a strict policy of refusing to confirm or deny any support to the targeted killing programme, and evidence has been so scant that legal challenges have been launched on the basis of single paragraphs in news stories.
Commenting on the new information, Conservative MP David Davis said: Its no good the government hiding behind its standard security line that they never comment on security matters. The phrase extra-judicial killing is a euphemism. What we are talking about here is murder. It may be that you are murdering terrorists and the people are villains, but it is still murder. We dont countenance murdering criminals in Britain. Why should we countenance murdering them in Yemen or anywhere else?
It is important the government makes plain: what are the limitations it puts on the use of its intelligence, and under what statutes and on whose approval this information is shared?
Even a former head of GCHQ has objected to Britains continuing secrecy over the issue. David Omand joined Davis and fellow MP Tom Watson in signing a letter last November calling on the government to disclose its guidance on intelligence-sharing where individuals may be targeted by covert strikes.
The release of the information, they wrote, would underline the distinction between Reaper strikes by our armed forces in Afghanistan, and now Iraq, and those of other states elsewhere.
Watson told the Guardian: The government has always maintained we are not complicit in targeted extra-judicial killings. Any note of ambiguity identified by these documents has to be thoroughly investigated.
The new documents include a regular series of newsletters  titled Comet News  which are used to update GCHQ personnel on the work of Overhead, an operation based on satellite, radio and some phone collection of intelligence. Overhead began as a US operation but has operated for decades as a partnership with GCHQ and, more recently, Australian intelligence.
The GCHQ memos, which span a two-year period, set out how Yemen became a surveillance priority for Overhead in 2010, in part at the urging of the NSA, shortly after the failed 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot in which Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his underpants on a transatlantic flight.
Ten months later a sophisticated plot to smuggle explosives on to aircraft concealed in printer cartridges was foiled at East Midlands airport. Both plots were the work of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the Yemen-based al-Qaida offshoot.
GCHQ noted in the memos that the NSAs focus on Yemen was a great opportunity for UK agents to focus on any leads they had in the country. Given the domestic terror threat to the UK as well as internal conflicts in the country, GCHQ has multiple reasons to be monitoring individuals in the country.
One Comet News update reveals how Overheads surveillance networks supported an air strike in Yemen that killed two men on 30 March 2012. The men are both described as AQAP members.
In the memo, one of the dead men is identified as Khalid Usama  who has never before been publicly named  a doctor who pioneered using surgically implanted explosives. The other is not identified.
In the two years of memos seen by the Guardian, this was the only specific strike detailed, raising questions as to why GCHQs team decided to notify staff about this particular strike among hundreds.

The Guardian asked GCHQ whether this was because UK personnel or bases were involved in the operation. The agency declined to comment, and offered no explanation as to why British staff were briefed on this particular strike.
US officials confirmed to Reuters in 2012 that there had been a single drone strike in Yemen on 30 March of that year. According to a database of drone strikes maintained by the not-for-profit Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the only incident in Yemen on that date targeted AQAP militants, causing between six and nine civilian casualties, including six children wounded by shrapnel.
Asked whether the strike described in the GCHQ documents was the same one as recorded in the Bureaus database, GCHQ declined to comment.
The incident is one of more than 500 covert drone strikes and other attacks launched by the CIA and US special forces since 2002 in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia  which are not internationally recognised battlefields.
The GCHQ documents also suggest the UK was working to build similar location-tracking capabilities in Pakistan, the country that has seen the majority of covert strikes, to support military operations in-theatre.
A June 2009 document indicates that GCHQ appeared to accept the expanded US definition of combat zones, referring to the agencys ability to provide tactical and strategic SIGINT [signals intelligence] support to military operations in-theatre, notably Iraq and Afghanistan, but increasingly Pakistan. The document adds that in Pakistan, new requirements are yet to be confirmed, but are both imminent and high priority.

The note was written months after Barack Obama entered the White House and escalated the use of drones in Pakistan, conducting more strikes in his first year in office than George W Bush had in the previous four years.
By this point NSA and GCHQ staff working within the UK had already prioritised surveillance of Pakistans tribal areas, where the majority of US covert drone strikes have been carried out. A 2008 memo lists surveillance of two specific sites and an overview of satellite-phone communications of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, in which nearly all Pakistan drone strikes have taken place, among its key projects.
British intelligence-gathering in Pakistan is likely to have taken place for a number of reasons, not least because UK troops in Afghanistan were based in Helmand, on the Pakistani border.
One of the teams involved in the geo-location of surveillance targets was codenamed Widowmaker, whose task was to discover communications intelligence gaps in support of the global war on terror, a note explains.

Illustrating the close links between the UK, US and Australian intelligence services, Widowmaker personnel are based at Menwith Hill in the north of England, in Denver, Colorado, and in Alice Springs in Australias Northern Territory.
Other Snowden documents discuss the difficult legal issues raised by intelligence sharing with the US.
A secret 2009 legal briefing suggests that British military lawyers believe that some US operations beyond traditional battlefields may be unlawful  a document that also highlights GCHQs efforts to operate within the bounds of the law in a complex and challenging environment.
The briefing prepared for GCHQ personnel sharing target intelligence in Afghanistan instructed them to refer to senior compliance staff before sharing information with the US if they believed it may be used for a detention or cross-border operation.
This, the documents states, was because the US forces were operating under Operation Enduring Freedom rules, which are less restrictive than the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force rules governing UK personnel. As a result, sharing intelligence may result in unlawful activity by GCHQ staff.
The Guardian contacted GCHQ with the information contained in this article, and asked a series of questions on the extent of intelligence sharing with the US in connection with targeted killing, and the legal framework for any such activities. The agency declined to comment on specifics.
The Guardian asked Downing Street why it refused to clarify any UK role in US drone strikes. A government spokesperson said: It is the longstanding policy of successive UK governments not to comment on intelligence operations. We expect all states concerned to act in accordance with international law and take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties when conducting any form of military or counter-terrorist operations.
Asked last year about the Britains role in US operations outside traditional war zones, defence minister Mark Francois told parliament that strikes against terrorist targets in Yemen are a matter for the Yemeni and US governments. Ministers including Sayeeda Warsi have used similar language when discussing drone strikes in Pakistan.
The UK has faced previous legal challenges over the issue. In 2012, the family of a tribal elder killed in Pakistan, Noor Khan, launched a court case in England in which barristers claimed GCHQ agents who shared targeting intelligence for covert strikes could be accessory to murder. Judges twice refused to rule on the issue on the grounds it could harm the UKs international relations.

Vancouver becomes first Canadian city to regulate growing marijuana market

Vancouver has approved new rules to license and regulate illegal marijuana stores, making it the first city in Canada to attempt to control the burgeoning market  and setting it on a collision course with the countrys federal government.
After four days of public hearings, the city council approved regulations that will set zoning controls and hefty licence fees for Vancouvers many pot shops: the city of 600,000 is thought to have more marijuana stores than its 109 Starbucks locations.
Neon green cannabis leafs have sprouted in shop windows across the city, and many shops employ in-house naturopaths available for quasi-medical consultations.

The boom has come amid a haze of legal ambiguity: the supreme court has forced the Canadian government to allow access to medical marijuana for those with prescriptions, but it remains illegal to sell pot products from a retail storefront. Meanwhile, the Vancouver police department has stated that a crackdown on pot shops is not a priority for them.
In an attempt to resolve the contradiction, the council launched public consultations on regulation in April.
The proposal prompted a furious attack from Ottawa. Federal health minister Rona Ambrose wrote to Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson suggesting that any attempt to regulate the pot shops would mean legitimizing an illegal activity. She called on council to reject the proposal and close the stores down.
Vancouver councilor Geoff Meggs said Ambroses comments showed that she was completely out of touch with the realities on the ground.
Addressing council before the vote, Meggs said he believes Vancouvers approach will make a difference across the country.
I think its going to be a significant decision. I think it will have widespread impact.
Many Canadians  including the federal Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, local police departments and health authorities  have argued that the time has come to legalize, control and tax marijuana. The sticking point remains the federal government, who are the only authority with the power to legalize pot, and who remain fervently pro-prohibition.
Ambrose released a statement shortly after the Vancouver vote, restating the governments position.
Storefronts selling marijuana are illegal, and under this Conservative Government will remain illegal, the statement said.
As Canada gears up for the October federal election, she also took time to take a political pot shot at Trudeau.
These stores have absolutely no regard for the rule of law and have been caught selling marijuana to kids  they represent Justin Trudeaus vision for Canadian neighbourhoods from coast to coast to coast, Ambrose wrote.
Former British Columbia attorney-general Geoff Plant QC expressed support for regulation: The federal government is increasingly out of touch. They are stuck in a reefer madness, non-evidence-based position.
The government of Canada has  with its failure to grasp the reality of marijuana and grapple with it  actually made things worse, he argues. They have allowed a black market to flourish, and now a white market has taken hold, and the longer it goes on, the harder it is to bring it back to a clean slate and introduce proper policy.
In an attempt to sidestep a potential legal challenge from Ottawa, Vancouver has been careful to say they are simply regulating the businesses involved, not the products they are selling.
Under the new rules, dispensaries will be banned from operating within 300 metres of a school, community centre, or rival pot shop. They will also be obliged to pay a business license fee of $30,000, compared to a regular business license of just $250.
Over the period of public consultation, more than 200 people put their views forward in person or by email to council. City manager Penny Ballem said that the most striking submissions came from people working so-called compassion clubs, where medical marijuana is provided for sufferers of cancer and other illnesses.
Following those presentations, the proposed business license fee for that model was dropped to $1000.
It was very compelling to hear how they provide access at an affordable rate to the most severely disabled and in need, Ballem, a physician by training, notes.
They are a different category to those simply retailing marijuana.
Ballem said she believes interest in the marijuana market has boomed as a reaction to the legalization of pot in nearby Washington and Oregon states.
They see a change in Canada as imminent, and they want to get in on it and get ahead of the game.

        <MainBody>An Irish woman on holiday with her two sons in the resort, described how she grabbed her children and ran for their lives when they heard gunfire erupting from one of the hotels.
Elizabeth OBrien, from Dublin, told RTE raido:
We were on the beach, my sons were in the sea and I just got out of the sea. It was about 12 oclock and I just looked up about 500 metres from me and I saw a (hot air) balloon collapse down, then rapid firing, then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me - because I thought it was fireworks,.
So, I thought oh my God, it sounds like gunfire, so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started saying run, run run! and we just ran to our room, which is like a little bungalow. So we are actually trapped in our room.
OBrien said the Irish consul in Madrid, Spain, called her to say it was a terrorist attack in the hotel next door and told her to stay where she was. She said:
My travel agent told me to go to the reception to speak to the rep, but Im afraid. Im stuck in the room with my two sons, not knowing whats going on.

France launches terror inquiry after factory attack

France has launched a terrorism investigation after police found a decapitated body and a flag with Islamist inscriptions following an attack on a factory belonging to a US gas company in the south-east of the country.
It is a terror attack. There is no doubt about it, the countrys president, Franois Hollande, told reporters in Brussels before leaving a European council summit to return to Paris.
A decapitated body found at the scene had a message written on it, Hollande said, without elaborating. Reports suggested the person, who has not yet been identified, might have been beheaded before the attack.

As well as the body, one suspected attacker was killed at the scene by a firefighter, according to Frances interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve. Two people were also injured in the attack.
Another suspected attacker was arrested, Cazeneuve said. His identity had yet to be confirmed, but he was thought to be Yessim Salim. The minister added: This person was under investigation for radicalisation but this investigation was not renewed in 2008. He had no police record.
According to local newspaper Dauphin Libr, another suspect has been arrested at his home in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier. He is believed to be a man seen driving around near the factory in a Ford car before the attack in a suspected reconnaissance attempt, the paper said.
Details of the attack remained unclear hours after police were first called at about 10am (0800 GMT).
According to a source linked to the investigation and quoted by Agence France-Presse, the incident began when one or several individuals drove a vehicle into a factory belonging to the US multinational Air Products in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon. There followed an explosion, which some reports said was apparently caused by gas canisters.
Speaking in Brussels, Hollande outlined what was known: This attack was in a vehicle driven by one person, perhaps accompanied by another, which rammed its way at high speed into this establishment which contained bottles of gas. The intent was without doubt to cause an explosion. It was a terrorist attack.
Another security source told the Associated Press a severed head was found on top of the gate at the entrance to the factory. The official said the body was found near the site of the explosion, and it seemed the blast was not the cause of the decapitation.
Two flags, one white and one black, both with Arabic inscriptions, were found at the scene, the same source told AP.
Map of the attack
Air Products confirmed there had been an incident at its factory and said all staff had been evacuated.
We can confirm that an incident occurred at our facility in LIsle-dAbeau, France this morning, a statement said. Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for. Emergency services are on site and have contained the situation. The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities.
Hollande, who said he would return immediately to the lyse palace, said the vehicle was crashed into the building with clearly an intention to cause damage. Police and troops had been deployed and all measures are being taken to prevent any other tragedies, he added.
France has been on alert for possible Islamist-related attacks since gunmen killed 17 people in January in assaults on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly and a Jewish food store.
Hollande said the response to such attacks should be measured. He said: We all remember what has happened in our country, and in other countries. There is a lot of emotion, but emotion is not the only answer. We need action, deterrence, and we need to spread out values and to never give in to fear.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, spoke to Hollande on Friday, Reuters cited an unnamed official as saying. The prime minister has just spoken to President Hollande to express his sympathies for what looks like an appalling incident there, they said. It clearly looks an extremely concerning situation and our thoughts are with all those affected by it.
Air Products, based in Pennsylvania, US, supplies gases, chemicals and associated equipment. It has 20,000 employees and outlets in 50 countries.

'The Marikana massacre is a tale of utter shame for South Africa'
Injustice and suffering have prevailed after report fails to hold a single person accountable for the deaths of 34 striking miners, writes Ranjeni Munusamy

Ramaphosa, a board member of Lonmin platinum mine where thousands were protesting in August 2012  made phone calls that allegedly escalated the confrontation; sent emails reportedly calling for action to be taken against these criminals, whose crime was to seek a wage increase; and held secret meetings to get the government and police to act in a more pointed way to quell the unrest.
Thirty-four miners were killed during the strikes  the bloodiest massacre by South African security forces since the end of racial apartheid.
But for Judge Ian Farlam leading the investigation, to tie the massacre to the person holding the second highest post in government, Ramaphosa would have had to be standing behind the police line with a loudspeaker instructing the police to shoot at the striking Lonmin workers himself.
Farlam said in his 646-page report that the commission could not find even on a prima facie basis that Mr Ramaphosa is guilty of the crimes he is alleged to have committed despite hearing from lawyers, witnesses and observers how Ramaphosas interventions were infested with a litany of conflicts of interest.
The commission is of the view that it cannot be said that Mr Ramaphosa was the cause of the massacre, the report states.
For the injured and families of those who died, and those who continue to live in poverty and indignity at Marikana, there was always going to disappointment with the outcome of the commission, because they were looking for accountability at the highest level.
That was never going to happen.
What happened was the opposite. Over a thousand days since the deaths of 34 people not a single person is being held accountable. There is no justice or closure for a single life lost or family destroyed.
The wound stays open. The suffering continues.

They were killed by a state meant to protect them
President Jacob Zuma had the Marikana report in his possession for 86 days before it was fully released. On Thursday night, he announced its key findings , without any specific actions on his part  apart from asking the relevant ministers to study the report and advise him on the implementation of the recommendations.
The commission overall found that a multiple failure from all involved resulted in the violence at Marikana, but in language that is extremely cautious. It found that Lonmin did not use its best endeavours to resolve the labour dispute, and did not respond appropriately to the threat and outbreak of violence. But the company that profits from the sweat of poorly paid workers got off fairly lightly.
The commission found that the companys failure to provide proper housing created an environment conducive to the creation of tension, labour unrest, disunity among its employees or other harmful conduct.
In almost three years since the massacre, the workers live and work in the same conditions that contributed to the violent protest in 2012. Lonmin has not acted to correct the situation, and a slap on the wrist from the commission is hardly stimulus to do so now.
Those who went on strike were people who tried to upset that balance so that their lives might be better
Judge Farlam said he did not agree that there was a toxic collusion between the police and the Lonmin mine, a finding that runs contrary to the narrative of the workers and the victims families. The commission did not recommend any form of compensation for those injured or dependents of the deceased, saying the terms of reference were not wide enough to cover this issue.
The commission also found that the two unions involved, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) did not do enough to prevent the violence. The report said Amcu members sang provocative songs and made inflammatory remarks, which tended to aggravate an already volatile situation. The NUM, it said, wrongly advised rock drill operators that no negotiations with Lonmin were possible until the end of the two-year wage agreement, and also did not take the initiative to persuade and enable Lonmin to speak to the workers.
After waiting 34 months to hear why their loved ones and colleagues were killed, the people of Marikana have to contend with the fact that there is as yet no justice or accountability for the extreme violence visited on them, and no compensation owed to them.
They live in indignity and die in indignity. Their blood and tears mean nothing to the rich and powerful who benefitted from their toil.

Day after day, they pass the killing fields of Marikana and go deep into its bowels so that the balance between the poor and the rich, the prosperous and the damned is maintained. Those who went on strike were people who tried to upset that balance so that their lives might be better. For that they were shot and killed by a state that is meant to protect them.
Marikana is and always will be a tale of utter shame.

Deadly attack on Tunisia tourist hotel in resort of Sousse
At least 27 people, including one gunman, killed in attack on the Imperial Marhaba hotel, according to Tunisian interior ministry
British tourists in Sousse say people began running and screaming when the shooting started

At least 27 people have been killed in an attack on a hotel in the Tunisian beach resort of Sousse, according to an interior ministry official quoted by Reuters.
The attack was on the Imperial Marhaba hotel, a source and local radio said.
A security source at the scene said the body of one gunman armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle lay where police had shot him dead. It was unclear whether there were other assailants.
Elizabeth OBrien, an Irish woman on holiday with her two sons in the resort, described how she grabbed her children and ran for their lives when they heard gunfire erupting from one of the hotels.
We were on the beach, my sons were in the sea and I just got out of the sea. It was about 12 oclock and I just looked up about 500 metres from me and I saw a [hot air] balloon collapse down, then rapid firing, then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me, she told RTE Radio.
Gary Pine, a British tourist close to the scene of the attack, told Sky News he was on the beach and heard what we thought was firecrackers going off 100 yards away, followed by an explosion from the next hotel complex along.
There was a mass exodus off the beach, Pine said, adding that his son told him that he had seen someone get shot on the beach. Pine said guests at his hotel were first told to lock themselves in their rooms, and later to gather in the lobby.
The British foreign office said it was urgently investigating the situation
Sousse, 150kms (93 miles) from Tunis, is one of Tunisias most popular beach resorts, drawing visitors from Europe and neighbouring north African countries. There have been no details on the nationalities of those killed but during the holy month of Ramadan, those on the beach tend to be tourists.
Tunisia has been on high alert since March when Islamist militant gunmen attacked the Bardo museum in Tunis, killing a group of foreign tourists in one of the worst attacks in a decade in the north African country.

How Britain's khat ban devastated an entire Kenyan town
Mild stimulant used to be Mauas most valuable export, bringing prosperity to all involved. A year since it was outlawed, the local economy has been devastated

Share on WhatsApp
In a quiet and unassuming town tucked away in a hilly part of eastern Kenya , the British home secretary Theresa Mays name is spoken with barely concealed anger. Since her role in the ban of the towns most valuable export, shes become a universally vilified figure.
For more than two decades, Maua enjoyed booming business propelled by the growth and sale of khat, known locally as miraa, a popular herb whose leaves and stems are chewed for the mild high they offer.
But last year the UK, home to one of khats biggest markets, declared the stimulant a class C drug and banned all imports , prompting Mauas rapid descent into economic purgatory.
Since the early 1990s, Britain has imported between 2,500 to 2,800 tonnes a year, according to the Home Affairs committee. Although in its initial findings the committee could not find a compelling health or social reason to ban khat, Mays argument  that continuing to allow trade in the UK would spawn off an illegal export corridor to other European countries where it is banned  won out in what became a controversial cultural debate .
Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food
Miriti Ngozi
Now, a year after the legislation was signed, residents in Maua have been hit hard by a shrinking local economy that has left many facing poverty.
Losses
Edward Muruu is one of the earliest pioneers of the khat export trade. A retired headmaster at a local primary school, he says he has experienced unprecedented losses since the ban came into effect.
I used to ferry miraa (khat) from Maua to Nairobi four times a week using 27 Toyota Hilux trucks, where it was repackaged for export. I used to make around 2,100 a month. Now I am lucky if I bring in 250 per month, he says.
With the European market gone, the only place left for Muruu to sell his stimulant is Somalia , where consumers now dictate how much they pay  and its not much.
The other issue with the Somali market is that the only people who can transport miraa to Mogadishu are Kenyan Somalis, meaning that the rest of us drivers have been put out of work, says a former worker of Muruus, who only identified himself as Kanda.
According to Kanda, if non-Somali drivers attempt the trip they are attacked along the journey. For a town of its size and location, Maua has a disproportionately large number of residents of Somali heritage, most of whom are involved in the khat trade as middlemen. They are also big consumers themselves.

Miraa was the heartbeat of this town
The effects of the London ban have reached everybody in the khat micro-economy, from the big name traders like Muraa to the small fish who depend on the trade for their survival.
Although Muraa has made investments that have cushioned him against the blows of a deeply depleted income, those at the lower end of the food chain have not been so lucky.
Miriti Ngozi, chairman of the Miraa Traders Association, says that many farmers and traders are no longer able to pay school fees or even buy enough food for their families.
The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else
Lawrence Kobia
You have to understand that in this region, subsistence farming has long been overshadowed by the more prestigious miraa farming. Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food and many families are sleeping hungry, he says.
Yet many remain reluctant to uproot their khat crops and plant maize instead, holding on to the hope that their fortunes might one day return.
Pius Mbiti, a trader in his early 30s, is a qualified vet but says that he makes most of his income from picking and selling the stimulant.
On a good day I used to make up to 12 which, when supplemented with earnings from my vet practice, was enough to take care of my family. But since the ban I am lucky if I make even 2 pounds, he says.
He cannot rely on animal medicine any more either because farmers no longer have the money to pay for his services.
This narrative is familiar across the town, with the common refrain being that shutting down miraa imports to London is killing businesses indirectly linked to the herb.
The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else. With revenue from miraa so drastically low, people no longer have the money to buy things, says Lawrence Kobia, who owns a bookshop. He says that his sales have plummeted by more than 40% since last year.

In its submissions to parliament, the Home Office committee warned that banning khat would result in the formation of a black market  as seen in the United States and other European countries including Norway and Holland.

Although initially khat sold for between 3 and 4 a kilogram in Britain, the committee reported that if it was banned the price could increase to 318, similar to its price in the US.
Their predictions turned out to be true: there has been a proliferation of the stimulant in London since the ban. While the border police have no statistics on seizures, the London Metropolitan police says it has handled a number of khat-related offences.
A spokesperson said that in the first six months after the ban came into effect, a total of 68 warnings and 14 penalty notices were issued. In addition, 36 people were arrested for possession of the herb, four of whom were later charged.
In the meantime, the Kenyan government is trying hard to get the ban lifted, with president Uhuru Kenyatta even promising the farmers in Maua as recently as February that he will petition to have the market reopened for them.
The farmers, however, see this as a cheap political move to whip up support, complaining that no tangible rewards have come from promises made by politicians regarding the matter in the past.
But the squabbling over high-level politics in Kenya and the workings of the parliament in Britain are meaningless to the miraa farmer in Maua, whose only worry is where the next meal will come from.

From photographs to video, every-day items to modern artefacts, an exhibition touring Russia is blurring the lines between art, science and ethnography to educate the population about the cultural and geographical diversity of their own country.
Our peoples idea of geography is an absolute mess. When the countrys main TV channel speaks of Altai being in the far north when it is one of Siberias southern-most republics, it is very hard to accept, says Sofia Gavrilova , one of the exhibitions curators.
Initiated by an organisation called Russia Research, the first project was an installation in the central Russian Udmurt Republic, followed by a focus on the village of Kalevala in Karelia, along the border with Finland, and another on Moscows satellite towns.

I love conducting an experiment among my students, says Gavrilova. I ask them: What makes New York different from Florida? And how is Birobidzhan different from Vladivostok?
Everyone is stuck. No one has a real image in their head, she says. They cant go to these places themselves. Whats left is the mass media, the news, and the image of these regions that the Russian Geographic Society promotes.
Russia Research is made up of a team of well-known photographers, including Ikuru Kuwajima, Maxim Sher, Ivan Mikhailov and Sergey Novikov.
The group is described as Russias first inter-disciplinary project bringing together artists, photographers, geographers, anthropologists, architects and urbanists with the aim to study modern anthropological and geographical processes taking place in Russia today, through the medium of art.

Often, their photographs from Russias diverse regions are accompanied by written commentaries from psychologists, economists, anthropologists, urbanists and sociologists. But none of the commentators are told where the photographs were taken, or what the story behind them is. Instead, theyre forced to speculate. The curators say this allows them to escape from presenting the photographers visions and the commentaries as the truth, but as art.
For example, one caption exhibited at the groups recent show at Moscows Triumph Gallery reads: The women are going to the centre of town, or to the city; theyre waiting for a bus that only goes two or three times a day. The women look solemn, important. Its obvious that they are travelling for the same reason. They are old, but still healthy, still work  maybe at the local dairy plant.

Dmitry Khankin, a partner at Triumph Gallery, says that by allowing artists to approach the subject of social customs and folklore, the nuances that might otherwise be overlooked by anthropologists or other professionals can come to the fore: As strange as it sounds, artists with a strong social conscience are able to measure processes that scientists sometimes arent able to see.
The Ministry of Culture in Moscow has so far supported two exhibitions, but hasnt given a grant for the whole projects. Yet to be convinced of the value of Russia Researchs work,
for the moment, everything is happening gradually, one exhibition at a time.
But as Russia becomes increasingly isolated  and its position in the world increasingly tense  supporters of the organisations work say it offers a unique way for citizens to gain an understanding of their own country at a critical time in the countrys political climate.

EU to counter Russian propaganda by promoting 'European values'

The document, drafted by the EUs diplomatic corps, also calls for efforts to persuade people in countries such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova of the benefits of European-style reforms.
The plan was prepared ahead of the EU summit in Brussels and offers a strategy to provide alternatives sources of information to outlets such as Russias state-funded RT television, amid an increasingly polarised media environment sparked by the war in Ukraine .
A communications unit called the East StratCom Team, launched in April, will support EU delegations in the six eastern neighbourhood countries, Armenia, Azerbaijan , Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine  as well as in Russia itself.
The main objectives include communicating and promoting EU policies and values, supporting independent media and increasing awareness of disinformation activities by external actors.
The document states that communication towards the east should first and foremost focus on the development of positive and effective messages regarding EU policies towards the region.
Brussels needs to spread the message that reforms promoted by the European Union can, over time, have a positive impact on their daily lives, the action plan says. It stresses that the strategy should highlight the benefits, not the bureaucracy, focusing on clearly explaining the positive effects of EU programmes and policies rather than going into details about the policies.
Tensions between Europe and Russia have exacerbated since Ukraines former president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following months of protests sparked by his decision to scrap plans to move closer to the EU and improve trade ties with Moscow instead. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 and has backed separatists fighting with government forces in the east.
The action plan also calls for the 28-nation EU to more actively to promote freedom of the media in the eastern neighbourhood region, mainly in concert with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe . Proposals include targeted training and capacity building for journalists and media outlets in the region. Brussels will also consider how best it can support training for journalists experiencing conflict situations, to better enable them to report on issues of relevance to local populations.
Several potential responses to Russian propaganda have been discussed among EU member states, including an initiative led by countries such as Denmark and Latvia to create a Russian-language TV channel.
The action plan does not mention the creation of new media outlets in Russian, but it notes that a number of Member States are already increasing their support for broadcasting in the Russian language to cater to national minorities. In the meantime the EU will continue its support at local level for independent media, including Russian language media, to ensure that citizens have access to alternative sources of information in their local language.
It also states that the EU will ensure that communication materials and products are available in local languages, notably in Russian.

'Armenia is not a new Maidan. Please don't make it one'
Protests against electricity price hikes in Yerevan have little in common with Ukraines uprising  but Russian geopolitical rhetoric has a habit of making self-fulfilling prophecies, says Paul Goble

Many Russian analysts are hurrying to suggest that this weeks protests in Yerevan and their suppression by the Armenian government are the opening round of a new Maidan  an anti-Moscow action promoted and exploited by the west as part of a broader geopolitical struggle.
But such an interpretation of events, if it comes to guide policy, could prove to be the worst form of a self-fulfilling prophecy, transforming what are protests by Armenians about domestic conditions into something more. Should Moscow choose to defend the existing authorities in Yerevan no matter what, it would alienate the country against Russia .
That is the conclusion Sergey Markedonov of the Russian State Humanities University offers in his latest commentary , one that constitutes a clear warning to the Kremlin, as well as analysts inside Russia and abroad, about misreading the situation on the ground by trying to make everything fit a pre-existing framework.
Those who read every case of popular discontent in the post-Soviet space as a Maidan or proto-Maidan are falling victim to a kind of geopolitical determinism, as Markedonov puts it, according to which practically any [protest movement] is only an expression of a proxy war between the United States and Russia.
Such people are taking the lazy way out, and forgetting that a political crisis is not a virus which spreads from one place to another, but rather reflects specific problems, however much some of those who are participating in it  both the regimes andthose who oppose them  draw on past cases in their vocabulary.
What is happening in Armenia is decidedly not like what happened in Ukraine . For one thing, Russia considers Armenia its strategic partner. For another, the government and the people are not divided in their attitude toward Moscow. Some in the government question Yerevans ties with Russia; and many in the streets would like to see those ties deeper.
In short, the Moscow analyst says, the issue of Russia is not the defining element in their struggle and it is critically important that in Moscow people do not fall victim to emotions and look for signs of a Maidan where they are hard to find. Rather, Russia must recognise that the protesters are not unhappy with the Kremlin but with Yerevans own power structure.

Capturing the world of Russian amateur football, one game at a time
A long way from the glitz and gore of the Fifa scandal, photographer Sergey Novikov is travelling to the furthest reaches of the country to capture local teams at play. The Moscow Times reports

Beating on drums and chanting loudly, two dozen supporters of FC Semyonov football club march across their local teams pitch and take their places in the stands.
Down on the grass, photographer Sergey Novikov is instructing the 11 local players how to stand as he takes a pre-match photo, before the game against FC Spartak Tumbotino begins.
The shots Novikov takes are part of his ongoing project, Grassroots , which has seen the 35-year-old spend the past three years travelling around central and western Russia to photograph amateur football teams and their stadiums.
Focusing as much on what lies beyond the pitch as who is playing on it, Grassroots is more than just a collection of sports photography. From the sparse pitches in the far north of the country to fields in central Russia surrounded by churches, Novikovs project also offers a glimpse into everyday life in the furthest of Russias regions.
For me it is always interesting to look at what surrounds the stadium: how does it fit into the urban landscape? Novikov says. The stadiums in the Tver region are often surrounded by concrete blocks. In the village of Pryazha in the Karelia region, they built a wooden fence around the pitch as if it was an ancient fortress.

Sport, or alcohol
Novikov works in Moscow as a photo editor for culture news site Colta.ru. He devotes much of his spare time to Grassroots, funding the project out of his own pocket. The problem is when  you have to travel really far for one photo, its very expensive, he says. In order to make the trips worthwhile, he tries to attend two or three games in the same area over a weekend.
Given the amateur status of the teams that he photographs, Novikovs plans are prone to disruption. He recalls travelling to the northern town of Kirovsk in the Murmansk region only to find out the match had been cancelled. It turned out that a day of mourning had been declared after more than a dozen local officials were killed in a helicopter crash.

Plans to watch another team in the Nizhny Novgorod region also fell through after the club  FC Ruslan, named after a character in Alexander Pushkins poem Ruslan and Lyudmila  withdrew from the game citing financial reasons. Novikov says problems with money are the main reason for cancellations.
When asked why Russian supporters should shun professional clubs in order to watch amateur teams, Novikov notes that grassroots matches say a lot about real life.
Stadiums are especially important in provincial towns because they are often the only place that members of the local population can let off some steam. When everything is going badly at work, when you face chaos and corruption in your town, when your wife leaves you for another man then you have two options: sport, or alcohol.

To find clubs to take part in his project, Novikov scrolls through fixtures on the websites of regional championship federations and then contacts them via Russias VKontakte social media site. Two towns in particular took weeks of planning to photograph  Snezhnogorsk and Polyarny in Murmansk. These , like other so-called closed cities, are successors of Soviet towns which house military or nuclear facilities, locked-off to non-residents. For Novikovs visit official minders accompanied him to and from the games.
Grassroots is still a work in progress, and Novikov says he wants to extend his project eastward beyond the Ural Mountains and into Siberia. His aim is to complete the project by 2018, when Russia will host the Fifa football World Cup .

Grassroots is not Novikovs first football-inspired project. A previous series titled FC Volga United saw him photograph amateur and professional clubs dotted along the banks of the Volga River. It was during this time that Novikov realised: how diverse the footballing landscape of the country was and decided to do Grassroots to document the more unique and interesting pitches across Russia.
The stadium in Semyonov comprises one stand overlooking a synthetic pitch that is dotted with sand-filled holes. Behind the stand lies a copse of birch trees, where several cows are grazing. A herd of cows once almost wandered onto the pitch at another match, Novikov says.
He says he always shoots the team before the game because after the match the weather  or the players moods  might change.
Teams usually respond well to having their photo taken, but Novikov notes the players often act very seriously. Sometimes when I do a group photo, I feel like adding a bit of irony  so if someone not connected to the team comes into the frame, Im for this.
No sooner has the days game kicked off than the group of raucous FC Semyonov fans let off a flare, prompting five or so policemen to march over.
That will be a 3,000 rouble [35] fine, says a middle-aged man dressed in a suit and with glasses perched on the end of his nose, marking the violation down on his clipboard. Hes a match inspector from the regional football federation,and spends the rest of the game lurking around for possible infractions.

At least one police car and a medical officer are obliged to attend every football match organised through football federations, says Novikov, pointing to the designated doctor for todays game  a middle-aged woman wearing three-inch heels and a nurses apron underneath her coat.
In the 70th minute, one of the home players punches an opponent in the face and is sent off. Later, the same sides goalkeeper is ordered off after he flattens an attacking player just outside the penalty box.
FC Semyonov did eventually pull a goal back, but a 45-yard lob sealed the win for Spartak Tumbotino, who won the match 3-1. The two dozen hardcore Semyonov fans left about five minutes before the end of the match, releasing several flares outside the stadium gates as they went.

        <title>What do Iranians really think of a nuclear deal beyond the polls and Twittersphere?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/25/iranians-speak-out-landmark-nuclear-deal</Link>

        <MainBody>Related: Offices in houses and the best tea breaks  welcome to working life in Tehran
When I first started at the company, my new co-workers warned me about delving too heavily into politics with others. Most were afraid there might be an informant lurking in the office. Careful  dont say that in front of just anyone, theyd say. Living in Tehran, Im no stranger to talk of bugged rooms, keywords that alert spooky software to tap your phone, and government agents disguised as hipsters.
Ive decided, however, that much of this is the same exaggerated nonsense that must have hovered over the Shah s secret police in the 1970s.
So I unabashedly spark conversations on the nuclear negotiations in the office.
But when I extract myself from the Twittersphere and ignore my politically savvy journalist friends, I notice few at my workplace are engaging with the nuclear negotiations as passionately as Im being told they are. Or as passionately as I am.
Because when Irans nuclear negotiators struck a framework agreement in early April (the Joint Plan of Action  JPOA), I was ecstatic. Our office? Not so much.
Hamed says Im nave if I think anythings going to change.
Gita tries for small talk with a you think so? and then delivers her finishing blow with a lukewarm I sure hope so. Mohsen just lays it on: the mood hasnt changed.
In the office where I spend most of my days, the nuke talks dont always arouse heated discussion. I cant blame my co-workers for not being fired up. Irans reformers have been shot down so frequently over the past few decades that JPOAs, comprehensive JPOAs and framework accords seem like noise set against a backdrop of immense un- and underemployment, inflation that outpaces pay raises, and social restrictions that have no place in 2015 ( lets avoid the hijab for a second: physically playing musical instruments on state TV is still against the rules). That mood will remain unchanged, Mohsen says, until Iranians see the proof in the proverbial pudding.
Related: Iranians optimistic about end to isolation, says new poll
People dont believe its going to happen  its like theyre waiting for the talks to end in disaster, says Hesam, whose smartphone is clearly more grabbing than the prospect of having sanctions lifted. I probe him for more: what about the street celebrations on Vali Asr street after the framework deal  the pictures, the tweets? He looks up as if to swat a fly. People were happier on the first day after the agreement. But over time, they started to doubt it again.
And its not just at the office: were less than a week away from what could be a historic agreement, but it sure doesnt feel like it in my slice of Tehran. That doesnt mean people dont support the deal. Everyone I know would like nothing more than to see the sanctions removed. They just arent excited - or optimistic - about it.
Sometimes, I fantasise about the nuke deal. I see Iran on the cusp of what could be a transformation  an end to nearly four decades of exasperating sanctions that have prevented its full and unhindered reintegration into the international community. Its big. It could bring massive foreign investment , job creation, and cleaner air. It could pry the economy from entrenched establishment types that have abused the countrys relative isolation for their own gain. It could mean McDonalds, Starbucks and maybe somewhere down the line, Shakira and Radiohead.
Then reality smacks me square in the face and Im back at the office. I remember dropping by my co-workers room a while back to follow up with a project we were both assigned to. I noticed he was gone, so I checked a few other rooms to find still more unattended desks. When this happens, I usually head to the cafeteria, which contains one of two televisions hooked up to state TV. Sure enough, the second-floor staff had huddled around the lunch table, gripped by the last few minutes of a soccer match on Channel 3.

Theres nothing unnatural about this. It was just a bizarre contrast to the complete lack of interest in the run up to the JPOA last November, when Iran and the United States  sworn enemies for 36 years  took the first concrete step toward dtente. No one rushed to the cafeteria to see if the negotiations had succeeded, even though IRINN was on, broadcasting live updates. At the time, in fact, most were busy furiously debating an upcoming faceoff between Esteghlal and Persepolis . If there has ever been passion in our office, it was then.
Related: Did the Supreme Leader just torpedo the nuclear talks?
(Admittedly, Ali, who used to sit across from me, would occasionally ask for the latest on the nuke deal, setting off a conversation between me, him, and the guy who sat in the corner. Once he stopped me in the stairwell, saying he was worried about the supreme leader lambasting the US at a critical juncture in the talks. I responded by asking him to picture the utter regime meltdown that would ensue if the supreme leader had instead extended an olive branch to America. Our conversation thus ended).
Determined to find someone beaming with as much enthusiasm as I am in the aftermath of the framework accord, I head upstairs to the third floor. Here I find Asghar, who isnt beaming but is content with the faint scent of hope that has wafted through Iran. Just the fact that theres hope  like when [President Hassan] Rouhani was elected  is enough. Iran has to change gradually, he says, because sudden changes  like a revolution  could end up in a full-blown civil war between the not-so-religious and the religious.
Across the table, Elnaz takes the counterpoint: the agreement only prolongs a status quo she utterly despises. This just means that these people are only going to stay around longer - for another ten to 20 years now, she says of her countrys political leaders.
The lack of excitement still confounds me. Maybe Im cuing into the wrong signs? You would assume an agreement that could fundamentally remake Irans relationship with the world would be glamorous enough to trigger something beyond prosaic elevator chitchat.
Then I think back to what the always-smiley Morteza had to say. Instead of looking at the formidable challenges ahead, he marvelled at the distance we had already travelled.
Related: Iran's state TV tries 'soft power' to win hearts and minds
I mean just the fact that our two presidents have spoken to each other is big, he says of President Rouhanis historic phone call with President Barack Obama in September 2013. Could you imagine that just a short while ago they tried to avoid each other? Like, if one of them learned the other was walking somewhere, he would try to distance himself so they didnt cross paths? Morteza is telling the story of the Islamic republics first reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, and the rumoured lengths to which he went to avoid a run-in with Bill Clinton in the UN bathroom in 1997 (lest he inflame Iranian hardliners).
Maybe I should be paying attention to the little things, like Morteza. Maybe I need to temper my daydreams with a heavy dose of the little changes weve already lived through. Maybe  just maybe  my co-workers are more willing to acknowledge that the nuke deal wont be the be-all end-all panacea than I am. Even for Mohsen, its the gradual changes that might make the wait worthwhile.
Look, all Im saying is that even if we regain our stature and honour in the international community - if the Iranian passport is a valid document again - that alone will make more of a difference to me than any improvement in our livelihoods, he says. So the next time somebody says Iran, people dont just turn around and look the other way.
I dont think it will have much of an impact on our lives, says Mahnaz of a potential nuke deal a day after I interviewed Mohsen in front of her. I think most of the benefit will accrue to the higher echelons of society: I mean, thats the way its always been. I dont know how this is going to be any different.
She continues: Just like [Mohsen] said the other day - if our countrys reputation improves in the eyes of the international community, that alone would be wonderful.
Names have been changed.

Thousands of Armenians have taken to the streets to protest against electricity rate hikes, marching on the presidential palace and staging all-night sit-ins around the main square of the capital, leading to fears in Moscow of a Ukraine-style popular uprising.
The protests in Yerevan, which began on Friday, escalated significantly after police fired water cannons to disperse seated demonstrators on Tuesday morning. By Wednesday evening thousands of people had gathered on Marshal Baghramyan Avenue near the presidential palace, chanting slogans and blocking traffic.
In the early hours of Wednesday, ruling party politicians and others formed a human shield between police and protesters, although negotiations over a potential meeting with the president, Serzh Sargsyan, fell through for the second night.
Smaller-scale protests spread to the cities of Gyumri, Vanadzor and Charentsavan, Armenia Today reported .
A lot more people came on [Tuesday] because they understood that you cant just drive people out like that, Nikolai Torosyan, a journalist at the site PanArmenian.net, who has been attending the demonstrations. They came to protest not just against the electricity price hike but also against the rough way protesters were dispersed.
The sit-ins began on Friday near Yerevans opera house. On Monday night demonstrators marched toward the presidential residence, where they remained through the night. On Tuesday morning riot police sprayed seated protesters with water cannons , then marched forward to force them out. In video of the events, several bulky men in civilian clothes can be seen grabbing protesters and dragging them behind the police line.
According to police, 237 people were detained and seven demonstrators and 11 policemen were injured. They were later all released.
Torosyan told the Guardian that although he was wearing a press badge, police knocked him down and kicked him as they confronted protesters on Tuesday. Other journalists reported having their cameras broken or confiscated by police.
The protests flared up in response to a decision on 17 June by the state utilities commission to raise electricity prices by 17 to 22%, at the request of Electric Networks of Armenia , which has a monopoly on distribution. The utility company is fully owned by the Russian company Inter RAO, which is headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of president Vladimir Putin.

The price hike, which will come into effect on 1 August, is the third in the past two years and provoked anger in the poor landlocked country of three million, where unemployment was reportedly 17% in 2014 and has been rising.
Armenias growing economic woes are closely tied with those in Russia. The rouble lost half of its value in 2014 amid falling oil prices and western sanctions over Moscows role in the Ukraine crisis. As a result, remittances sent home from by Armenians working in Russia have reportedly fallen by as much as half in dollar terms.

The state utilities commission remained unwilling to back down on Wednesday, with spokeswoman Mariam Stepanyan saying it had not made decisions that need to be corrected.
Although its daughter company was behind the price hikes that drew people to the streets, Inter RAO claimed that it had no role to play.
Inter RAO believes that the events in Armenia have become political, and were engaged in business in Armenia, not politics, and we dont plan to participate in these events, spokesman Nikolai Gorelov said on Tuesday, the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reported.
Amid the standoff between Moscow and the west over the Ukraine crisis, Russian politicians have suggested the Yerevan protests could be the start of a US-orchestrated colour revolution to topple the Armenian government.
Igor Morozov, a member of the foreign affairs committee in Russias upper house of parliament, said the unrest in Armenia was exactly the same as the beginning of the Maidan protests in favour of European integration that ousted Ukraines president Viktor Yanukovych last year.

The American embassy in Armenia is also actively participating in the current events in Yerevan, Morozov told state news agency RIA Novosti.
Liberal commentators have in turn blamed the Kremlin. Opposition activist Vsevolod Chernozub tweeted a photograph of Sechin, who heads state oil champion Rosneft as well as Inter RAO, with the caption, The State Department puppet whose company suggested raising electricity prices in Armenia by 40%.

Speakers at the rally in Yerevan have reportedly denounced the idea that they were being influenced by foreign organisations or governments, and protesters have tweeted that they were simply opposing the price hike and that the demonstrations should not be compared to the Euromaidan protests in Kiev.
Although some protestors had waved European Union flags, Torosyan said they included people from all political backgrounds. This weeks events are the first major protests since demonstrations over the presidential election in 2008, he added.
Its new people who are taking part, people themselves who use these services, they are coming out on street, Torosyan said. There are not just poor people, there are middle class, nationalists, liberals. Its a very wide swath of society, and there are no political overtones.
Torosyan said he planned to join protestors again as they assembled on Wednesday evening.
Alexei Malashenko, a Caucasus and Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Centre in Moscow, called the Yerevan demonstrations ordinary economic protests, but said Armenias economic situation would likely remain bad.
Sargsyan only just signed documents with Putin that Russia will sell Armenia cheap gas, and everyone was happy, Malashenko said, referring to a 2014 deal for customs-free sale of oil products that the federation council on Wednesday extended until the end of 2015. Then they raise electricity prices, no one likes this, and they hold up EU flags... Will there be a Maidan in Armenia? I doubt it, but the fact they harshly dispersed protestors has grown the demonstrations.

Rwandan spy chief's arrest exposes the intricacies of international justice
Emmanuel Karenzi Karakes Heathrow airport detention may be justified but will be used to confirm claims that African leaders are unfairly targeted, says Simon Allison

In the last week, the international community has seen three high-profile arrests, and three explosive debates about jurisdiction. First came the arrival of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir on South African soil , and the countrys failure to arrest him for alleged crimes of genocide in Darfur  defying both the international criminal court and domestic law.
Then followed the arrest of Al-Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour , detained at an airport in Berlin at the request of the Egyptian government  who had convicted the reporter in absentia for allegedly torturing a lawyer during the Tahrir Square protests in 2011.
And finally, news broke on Tuesday that Rwandan spy chief Lieutenant-General Emmanuel Karenzi Karake, head of the countrys notorious National Intelligence and Security Services, had been arrested while trying to depart from Londons Heathrow airport.
So what do these three cases tell us about international justice?
Where Bashirs is an example of the top-down approach  where an international body investigates and prosecutes crimes anywhere in the world  Mansours shows national agreements and organisations such as Interpol helping countries enforce their national laws in other jurisdictions.
The arrest of Karake  one of 40 Rwandans indicted by a Spanish judge in 2008 for allegedly ordering revenge massacres in the wake of the Rwandan genocide in 1994  is a good example of universal jurisdiction in action.
The term refers to the idea that a national court may prosecute individuals for any serious crime against international law  such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and torture  based on the principle that such crimes harm the international community or international order itself, explains the International Justice Resource Centre.
The majority of states  163 of the 193 UNs member , according to Amnesty International (pdf)  provide for some kind of universal jurisdiction, but few exercise it.
Spain is a notable exception: it has actively prosecuted international crimes committed in faraway places including Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala  and now Rwanda.
Karakes arrest is a major test of universal jurisdiction in action

Karakes arrest is a major test of universal jurisdiction in action. In addition to accusations relating to the post-Rwandan genocide massacres, Karake is implicated in the killing of hundreds of civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo during fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan forces in 2000, according to Human Rights Watch.
In 2009 a Finnish court tried Francois Bazaramba, a former Rwandan preacher, with genocide and 15 counts of murder for his role in the 1994 atrocity , exercising its law which allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.
Selective justice?
But although the legal case for Britain to extradite Karake to Spain is strong, there are political considerations that will impact on the process.
Britain and the Rwandan government have a close relationship: the east African country is a major destination for British aid, and president Paul Kagame has a  close working relationship  with former British prime minister Tony Blair.
Already, Rwanda is putting on heavy diplomatic pressure to secure Karakes release, with its ambassador to the UK describing the arrest as an insult.
Williams Nkurunziza, the Rwandan high commissioner to the UK, told the BBC World Service: We take strong exception to the suggestion that hes being arrested on war crimes. Any suggestion that any of our 40 leaders are guilty of crimes against humanity is an insult to our collective conscience.
But the British government wont be able to ignore its courts  like South Africa did over Bashir.
Which begs the question: why was Karake detained in the first place? According to media reports, Karake has made several trips to Britain since 2008 but has been permitted to leave each time. This implies either that something has changed  perhaps the furore around Bashirs non-arrest forced Britains hand  or that some border official was a little over-zealous in the execution of his duties.

Another factor that politicians will be considering is the ramifications that extraditing Karake will have on the already strained relations between the African continent and organs of international justice.
Karakes arrest is a public relations coup for African leaders looking for further justification that they are being unfairly targeted by the western justice.
In December Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, said the international criminal court is a tool to target Africa, while Rwandas own president Paul Kagame accused the court of selective justice . This is in some sense true: since its establishment in 2002, the ICC has heard 22 cases and indicted 32 individuals . All of them are African.
While there are sound reasons for the German court to have released Mansour  and for Britain to extradite Karake  these decisions could easily be portrayed by disgruntled African states as western judiciaries unfairly choosing to enforce only western arrest warrants (in the case of Spain and Karake) while neglecting African cases (in the case of Egypt and Mansour).
Britain is now in a delicate position. If it does go ahead with extradition proceedings it risks angering an important ally on the African continent and alienating their supporters  while giving self-interested leaders more fuel for their claims of western bias in international justice.
If it doesnt uphold the case, it will have to defy its own rule of law, potentially dealing a crippling blow to the concept of universal jurisdiction in the process. Its a legal and political minefield.

Unsolved murders of indigenous women reflect Canada's history of silence
As spotlight returns to decades-long violence against native women and girls, calls for national inquiry have been rebuffed but groups refuse to give up

Hanging on the walls of Kattie Lee Fontaines living room are two striking portraits of her cousin Tina, who was just 15 when she disappeared from the streets of Winnipeg, Manitoba, in August 2014.
Tina and her four cousins, Kattie Lee, Rose, Jolene and Angel grew up together on the Sagkeeng First Nation, an indigenous reserve east of Lake Winnipeg with a population of 3,000  and six unsolved cases of missing or murdered First Nations women.
In June 2014, Tina travelled to Winnipeg to rekindle her relationship with her estranged biological mother. Her family reported her missing, and five weeks later, on 8 August, Fontaine was picked up by police in a vehicle that had been pulled over for drunk driving.
Despite the missing persons report, the officers let Tina go, and later the same day she was found passed out in a downtown alleyway. Paramedics took her to hospital, where she was handed over to a social worker to be taken into foster care, but she ran away.
Nine days later, Tinas body, wrapped in a plastic bag, was dragged from the Red river. We couldnt even open the casket because of what her murderers did to her, said her great aunt, Thelma Favel. Nearly a year after her death, Tinas family are beginning to lose hope that her killers will ever be caught.
Meanwhile her cousins fear that they could suffer the same fate as Tina: the four girls live in the North End, an area of Winnipeg rife with violence and sexual harassment. We feel even less safe since her death. We miss her so much, says Kattie Lee.
Tina is just one victim in an decades-long epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women. Ever since the 1970s  when aboriginals were encouraged to migrate to the cities  women of all ages have been shipped back to their families in coffins, said Derek Nepinak, the Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC). I lost an aunt in Winnipeg in 1978, he said. This is not a new phenomenon by any means.
But Canadians are finally starting to pay attention.
In its first attempt to gauge the scale of the problem, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) last year retrieved data from 300 police authorities across the country. The study concluded between 1980 and 2012, at least 1,017 First Nations women were murdered, while a further 108 went missing in suspicious circumstances.
Last week, the RCMP released an updated report , which concluded First Nations women are four times more likely to go missing or be murdered than other Canadian women. While aboriginal women represent just 4.3% of Canadas female population, they represent 16% of female murder victims and 11% of missing persons cases involving women, the report said.
The update also said in the 12 months since the first report, 11 more indigenous women had gone missing.
It isnt really high on our radar
When the findings were first published, thousands gathered for candlelight vigils in cities across Canada , and chiefs and activists renewed their calls for a national inquiry into the countrys indigenous femicide.
But those calls have repeatedly been rebuffed by the Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, who has argued the problem is mainly one of domestic violence and criminality on indigenous reserves.
Asked about the possibility of a national inquiry by the CBC state television in December, Harper replied:  It isnt really high on our radar, to be honest. 
First Nations leaders acknowledge that violence is a problem on the reserves  which are beset with poverty, drug abuse and unemployment. But only 40% of the countrys indigenous people actually live on reserves, and activists and analysts say the abuse and murder visited on Canadas indigenous women reflects a broader history of marginalization and abuse.
That view is shared by the United Nations, which has repeatedly called for a national inquiry into violence against First Nations women, similar to the investigation launched into the murder of hundreds of women in Ciudad Jurez in Mexico .
The victimisation of native women is partly the legacy of colonial heritage
Authors Niklas Bruun and Barbara Bailey
The UNs Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (Cedaw) concluded last year that the Harper governments refusal to investigate the violence was a grave violation of indigenous womens rights.
The victimisation of native women is partly the legacy of colonial heritage where gender-based violence is linked to the lack of realization of their economic, social, political and cultural rights, said the authors of the report, Niklas Bruun and Barbara Bailey in an email.
Nahanni Fontaine, a special adviser to the Manitoban government on aboriginal womens issues, argues that the violence is a form of collateral damage wrought by centuries of prejudice. From the first moments of contact with European explorers, indigenous women were scorned and stereotyped as promiscuous because they owned their sexuality and were treated as equals by their male counterparts, she said.
Related: Canada confronts its dark history of abuse in residential schools
Such contempt for indigenous women was reinforced by brutal attempts to force First Nations to assimilate into mainstream Canadian society. Earlier this month the countrys Truth and Reconciliation Commission described such policies as a form of  cultural genocide  in a report on the state-sponsored, church-run Indian Residential School system.
Between 1876 and 1996, 150,000 aboriginal children were taken from their families and interned in boarding schools specially designed in the words of the systems founder Sir John A MacDonald, to take the Indian out of the child.
One of those children was Sue Caribou, who in 1972 was separated from her family at the age of seven, and taken to a Catholic school where for the next five years she was physically and sexually abused by missionaries who forbade her from speaking Cree, her native language.
The violence has never stopped: by the time Caribou left the school in 1979, both her parents had been murdered. Now aged 50 years old, Caribou has lost three female relatives to murder. The last was her beloved niece Tanya Nepinak, who disappeared in 2011 on her way to get pizza in Winnipeg. She was 31 years old.
When is this going to end? Its getting worse, Caribou said.
Tanyas body was never found, but police believe she was killed by a man called Shawn Lamb, who in 2012 admitted murdering two other indigenous women, Carolyn Sinclair, 25, and Lorna Blacksmith, 18.

Indigenous groups argue that institutional racism contributes to a culture of impunity for perpetrators of crimes against aboriginal women.
Justice for the missing or murdered
Canadas worst serial killer also targeted First Nations women: pig farmer Robert Pickton tortured and killed at least 33 aboriginals before he was arrested in British Columbia in 2002.
Soon after his arrest, Amnesty International concluded that perpetrators of violent crimes tend to target them because the police in Canada have often failed to provide Indigenous women with an adequate standard of protection.
Polices failings proved fatal for Jennifer McPherson, 41, an Ojibway woman who went missing in British Columbia in May 2013. Her remains were found one week later scattered around the island where she was an off-season caretaker of a fishing resort. McPhersons husband Traigo Andretti, later admitted to choking the 41-year-old and burning her body.
Andretti confessed to murder, but investigators soon discovered evidence linking him to the disappearance of another indigenous woman seven years earlier.
Myrna Letandre had been dating Andretti when she went missing from her home in Winnipeg in October 2006. Her sister, Lorna Letandre, begged Winnipeg detectives to search Andrettis house, but he was released after being interrogated just once and was never charged. He married McPherson a couple of months later. Last year, Letandres remains were found buried in the house  seven years after her sister first raised the alarm.
If the Winnipeg police had properly investigated Myrna Letandres case, my sister would still be alive today, said Kim McPherson, Jennifers sister, her voice still cracking with grief.
Last year, Winnipeg police announced that it was making investigations of missing and murdered aboriginal women a strategic priority; it has also established a special task force of 18 officers to solve 28 outstanding cases of murdered or missing women in the province. The force has also worked on improving relations with the community in the citys poorest neighbourhoods  all of which are predominantly indigenous.
But better policing alone is not the answer, warned Winnipegs police chief, Devon Clunis. The Jamaica-born commissioner said that Canada still needed to embark on a difficult national conversation on discrimination against First Nations.
Its not just simply a police issue. Its not an indigenous community issue. It is an issue for every single person who calls himself a Winnipegger, a Manitoban, a Canadian, he said.
Such a reckoning seems all the more urgent in Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, which was named as  Canadas most racist city  by the national news magazine MacLeans.
The city is home to the countrys largest urban indigenous population, but that population is relegated to relatively impoverished neighbourhoods, which are plagued by underemployment, drug abuse, substandard housing and violent crime.
A dysfunctional foster care system
Activists say that the citys social services  which should be protecting vulnerable indigenous children  are instead exposing them to further risk by plunging them into a dysfunctional foster care system.
Indigenous children make up 87% of the children in foster care in Manitoba, even though they only account for 34% of the provinces population under 18. This means that at any given time, nearly 10,000 native children are under the care of the provincial Child and Family Services department (CFS).
We see a direct correlation between girls who are taken into foster care at a young age and women who go missing, says Grand Chief Nepinak of the AMC. We have to stop traumatising our children.
Carolyn Sinclair was separated from their alcoholic mother when she was only two. She and her sister Amanda were placed in a foster home where Carolyn was sexually abused, and by the time they were teenagers, both girls were using hard drugs.
Amanda, now 35, managed to turn her life around and now has a steady job as a construction worker. Carolyn Sinclair never found a way out of her chaotic lifestyle: she was murdered and dumped near a garbage bin in Winnipeg at the age of 25.
In turn, Carolyns two small children have now been taken into foster care, and Amanda has been refused rights to see them. We dont even know if they are still alive, she said.
For more than a decade, a chronic shortage of foster placements meant that children taken into care were often simply left in hotels in downtown Winnipeg. Tina Fontaine disappeared after running away from a Best Western hotel where she had been given a temporary placement.
In April, a 15-year-old girl in emergency care was violently assaulted and left for dead in the same hotel. Four weeks later, the minister responsible for the CFS, Kerri Irvin-Ross, was promoted to become deputy prime minister of Manitoba.
Indigenous activists such as Sue Caribou see a grim parallel between the casual neglect of the current foster care and the systematic abuse of the residential schools.
Kids are shuffled around in abusive homes. Its starting all over again, she said.
Tina Fontaines great aunt Thelma Favel said she hoped that coverage of her nieces murder would help focus attention on the violence  and perhaps even save a few lives.
Speaking through her tears, she said: My priest has told me that like Jesus died for our sins, Tina died so that other girls could be saved.

The Scottish ferry operator CalMac has been forced to cancel two-thirds of its routes as a strike by RMT union workers caused more disruption than expected.
CalMac said the 24-hour strike, prompted by a dispute over a potential privatisation , meant only nine of its 27 routes were running.
The publicly owned ferry company, which is facing fierce competition from the private operator Serco for a new contract, said all its larger vessels sailing to the Outer Hebrides  Coll, Tiree, Colonsay, Islay and Arran  remained at the quayside.
Gordon Martin, the RMTs regional organiser for Scotland , said up to 700 crew were taking part in the strike and that picket lines at Gourock  CalMacs headquarters  Ardrossan, Stornoway on Lewis, Oban and Lochranza were very well attended. The vessels are tied up and are going nowhere, he said.
Fridays strike follows two days of work-to-rule by the RMT in a dispute over the preservation of jobs and terms of employment under the next eight-year contract, which starts in 2016.
Talks with the RMT will resume next week but the dispute could escalate further after a second CalMac staff trade union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), which represents 100 ticket office staff and managers, ballots its members on industrial action next week.
Serco, which has already taken over CalMacs contract to serve Orkney and Shetland, is thought to be the favoured bidder for the far larger and more lucrative contract for 27 routes on the Firth of Clyde, inner and outer Hebrides.
Scottish government ministers insist they are required by EU law to put the contract out to open tender, and deny opposition and union charges that awarding the tender to Serco woud amount to privatisation.
The government would still own all the ferries and infrastructure and would set the timetables, routes and fares. Serco would be running a public service contract and would not own the service, the government argues.
CalMacs managing director, Martin Dorchester, said he was disappointed that the strike had gone ahead and said extra sailings overnight and on Saturday would help some travellers reach their destinations.
Those included runners heading for the Barrathon race on Barra and guests travelling to seven weddings in the Western Isles. Putting weddings at risk is just one of the very human consequences this strike is having, Dorchester said. Im grateful for the efforts of staff to salvage peoples big day, but this cannot go on, it is damaging the social and economic fabric of our communities.
He said the RMT should have accepted CalMacs offer to include a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies in its bid, in a last0minute deal to avert the strike.
Martin said that was very welcome but it did not bind Serco or the Scottish government. If CalMac doesnt win the contract it means nothing. As well as being in their bid, we want it written into our collective bargaining agreements and contracts of employment, he said.

Mood shifts in Athens: labour minister says creditors asking for 'suicide of an entire people'
Over in Athens this morning the mood appears to have shifted yet again, reports our correspondent Helena Smith.
Last night, it was optimism that ultimately reigned with senior officials in Greeces governing Syriza party expressing the hope that a cash-for-reform deal was ultimately in sight.
The radical left partys prominent MEP, Dimitris Stratoulis, told the Guardian from Brussels.
There is a detectable shift in stance. Under pressure lenders have retreated on several issues.
This morning, grave doubts were being expressed as to whether a deal was possible at all.
Panos Skourletis, the labour minister who is in close contact with prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels, told Mega TV:
On the basis of what things look like today the possibilities of an agreement are slim. Every time a solution is almost found and there is convergence, they come and say bring us a few more pensioners to execute. What they are asking right now is tantamount to the suicide of an entire people.
The politician, reflecting what is clearly the latest thinking in Syriza, did not rule out fresh elections, or a referendum, if the impasse could not be broken.
If dilemmas occur that are outside the democratic mandate that we have been given, we will once again resort to the people, he said, adding he did not rule out some king of extension being given and negotiations restarting later in the year. I dont exclude that either, he added.

Cloud of racism hangs heavy over Obama eulogy for South Carolina pastor

President Obama travels to Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday to deliver the eulogy for Reverend Clementa Pinckney , the pastor of Emanuel AME church who was gunned down last week along with eight others , amid intense speculation over whether he will use such a sensitive moment further to articulate his views on race.
The president will make his funeral oration at TD arena at the College of Charleston, in front of more than 5,000 people including relatives and friends of the victims as well as African American, church and local political leaders. He will be joined by the first lady, Michelle Obama, and Vice-President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill.
It will be one of the most closely scrutinized engagements of Obamas six years in office. With the aftershocks of the gun rampage by an avowed white supremacist still thundering across the deep south, the presidents main focus will be to celebrate the life of a much-loved pastor whom Obama himself knew well.
But he also faces the much more delicate task of offering the nation some kind of moral way forward as it continues to struggle to understand more than a week after the event an act of undiluted racial hatred. State capitals across the south  not just Columbia, South Carolina , where the Confederate flag still flies high  have been racked with soul-searching since the shooting spree on 17 June, much of it directed towards enduring public symbols of the regions slave-owning secessionist past.

In his remarks so far on the Charleston massacre, Obama has tended to emphasize his frustration with Americas lax gun laws which, as he put it the day after the shootings, has forced him to make statements like this too many times. He also made reference in that speech to the Emanuel AME church, the scene of the carnage, as a place of worship founded by African Americans seeking an end to slavery.
But his remarks in public over the past nine days have been restrained, muted almost, in regard to the overt racial nature of the attack. The past nine days have been in keeping with the cautious stance that Americas first black president has consistently adopted when talking directly about the countrys legacy of racial strife.
Whatever the extent of his comments on race on Friday, it is certain that his eulogy will address the many achievements of its subject. The president will have rich material to work with  the aftermath of last weeks massacre has been marked by an outpouring of affection and praise for the 41-year-old Pinckney in both his public roles, as pastor and as state senator.
On Wednesday several thousand mourners filed past Pinckneys open coffin at the South Carolina state house to pay their respects to a man equally at ease in a place of worship as on the floor of the legislature. On Thursday night a wake was held at his church, a place of worship that was so integral to Charlestons African American community over so many years that it became known as Mother Emanuel.
Obama forged his friendship with Pinckney during his first presidential run in 2008, in which South Carolina played a key role as a turning point in the fierce battle for the Democratic nomination between the then US senator for Illinois and Hillary Clinton. Even then, the contest was notable for its racial undertones .
How much further the president chooses to go in the course of his eulogy into the snake pit of modern American race relations remains to be seen. There are signs that as he approaches the end of his term in the White House he is feeling liberated enough to speak more openly  just this week he used the N-word in a podcast, stating that the nation has yet to be cured of racism.
He has also indicated that his post-presidency plan is to try to help young black American men cope with the many hurdles that stand in their way. In the wake of the spate of recent unrest over police behavior towards black citizens in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, the subject of race is clearly at the front of Obamas mind, though only rarely does he give the nation a glimpse of his thinking.

'Offensively tasteless' Mother Canada statue plan sparks outrage against PM

A plan to erect a 10-storey statue in a national park on one of Canadas most scenic shorelines has prompted outrage and sparked a growing political row as the country heads towards a general election this fall.
The statue of Mother Canada  a cloaked female figure with her arms outstretched towards the Atlantic Ocean  is intended to honour the countrys soldiers who died overseas.
But growing anger over the plan has made it a new focus of opposition to the increasingly unpopular government of Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper .
The proposed monument is an awkwardly remodelled, vastly upscaled version of an earlier statue, known as Canada Bereft , which adorns the memorial to the countrys first world war dead near Vimy, France.
The design has been widely lambasted both for its design and its proposed location in Cape Breton Highlands national park. In an editorial this week, the Globe and Mail newspaper described it as  offensively tasteless  and a hubristically arrogant act of arrogant unoriginality.
The bigger-is-better approach to art is best left to Stalinist tyrants, theme park entrepreneurs and insecure municipalities hoping to waylay bored drive-by tourists, the paper wrote.
The project is the brainchild of Toronto businessman Tony Trigiani, who was inspired after a chance visit to a Canadian war cemetery in Italy and set up the Never Forgotten National Memorial Foundation to realise the plan.
The initiative gained early and enthusiastic support from the Harper government, which has donated the necessary public land and $100,000 from its parks budget to help erect the colossus on a rocky spit along the Cabot Trail, eastern Canadas most popular scenic drive. The foundation hopes to raise $25m to complete the project, in part by selling corporate sponsorships that will be prominently acknowledged on the site.
Growing criticism in the nations media has helped swing opinion against the grandiose scheme, but opponents fear the fate of rocky, windswept Green Cove is already sealed.

Were pleased with the momentum, said Sean Howard, spokesman for Friends of Green Cove. What we dont know is how much time we have. Our worst fear is that theyre going to send the bulldozers in before the federal election this fall.
But until Green Cove becomes concrete cove, Howard added, were going to keep fighting.
Trigianis Never Forgotten National Memorial Foundation and the government hope to have the colossus up by 2017, the sesquicentennial of Canadian Confederation and also the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge.
In addition to the statue, the monument will include such amenities as the Commemorative Ring of True Patriot Love, the True North Commemorative Square and the With Glowing Hearts National Sanctuary  all named after the English lyrics of O Canada, the national anthem.
Howard accuses the monument of a kitsch glorification of war, but local opponents are also angered by the speed with which the project is to be executed.
You have to have a very strange process to get through such a strange product, Howard said. Its hair-raising how fast they want to do it.
A significant majority of those who are engaged with the issue believe that the statue either shouldnt be built anywhere or for sure shouldnt be plopped down in a beautiful national park, Howard said.
A spokesman for Parks Canada declined to answer questions about the monument, describing it as privately funded and referring inquiries to the Never Forgotten Foundation. Trigiani, president of the foundation, declined a request to be interviewed.
With criticism of the monument going national, the most articulate opponent remains Cape Breton resident Valerie Bird, 93, who served as an auxilliary with the royal air force in the Middle East during the second world war. It is vulgar and ostentatious, she said. It certainly doesnt belong in a national park, and I dont think its going to do a darn thing for veterans.
I think the idea of this horrible thing offends veterans, she added. I find it difficult to find words. This is a monstrosity.

The worlds first commercial jetpack will cost $150,000 next year
Jetpacks could fly out of science fiction and on to the streets carrying first responders and millionaires next year

After 35 years in development, the worlds first commercially available jetpack will be available next year for $150,000.
The Martin Jetpack is made from carbon fibre and aluminium. It eschews the traditional rockets of science-fiction jetpacks, which are powerful but difficult to control, and instead uses fans.
A two-litre petrol engine drives two fans either side of the pilot to lift the jet pack and up to 120kgs of human into the air, along with a low-altitude parachute for use should things go wrong.
After initial test flights in 2011, an updated version was shown off recently at the Paris airshow. It could fly for up to 30 minutes at speeds as fast as 74 kilometres per hour. Pilots will be able to reach altitudes of 1,000m taking off and landing vertically, meaning rooftops, gardens and parking lots are all viable launchpads.
In fact, Martin believes that the jetpacks ability to land in confined spaces will be its selling point, not aimed at millionaires as an expensive toy, but the emergency services.
I think the first responders will see that as a massive improvement to their capability, Peter Coker, chief executive of Martin told Reuters. Naturally for the ambulance service getting to a point of importance of rescuing people in the shortest possible time [is crucial].

The jetpack will ship for emergency services in the second-half of 2016, with a personal version scheduled to be released the following year.
New Zealand-based Martin Aircraft recently floated on the Australian stock exchange , seeing a $50m investment from Chinese aerospace company Kuang-Chi Science, valuing Martin at $100m. It began taking orders earlier this year, and has been showing off a simulator of the jetpack at airshows including Paris.

A young man has appeared in court charged with starting a bushfire that spread to a coalmine and sent toxic smoke over eastern Victoria in 2014.
The 20-year-old, who cannot be named, has been charged with arson and recklessly causing a bushfire over a blaze in the Latrobe Valley that spread to the Hazelwood open cut mine at Morwell.
The man was arrested on Friday and faced the Latrobe Magistrates Court over the fire, which is alleged to have been started on February 7 in the Hernes Oak area.
It spread to the open cut coal mine two days later, where it burned for several weeks.
Morwell was blanketed in toxic smoke and ash for 45 days, prompting many of the towns 12,000 people to flee their homes.
The man was released on bail and will return to court in September.

The factory targeted in a suspected Islamist attack in south-east France is owned by Air Products , a US company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
The company supplies gases, chemicals and equipment for products ranging from TVs and mobile phones to sports cars and running shoes.
It was unclear on Friday whether the company was targeted because it was American.
In a statement, it said: Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for.
Emergency services are on site and have contained the situation. The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities.
Air Products was founded in 1940 and is now the 276th largest company in the US with $10.4bn of global sales last year. It employs more than 20,000 people in 50 countries.
Its French subsidiary, created in 1990, employs 400 people across a number of sites. It is the third largest producer of atmospheric gases in France , with more than 15% of the market.
The companys chair and chief executive is Seifi Ghasemi, an Iranian who emigrated to the US in the 1960s and holds a masters degree from Stanford University.

Northern Ireland gay marriage ban faces judicial review
First couples in UK to enter civil partnerships delighted with result of legal battle, saying religious views should not affect public policy

The first two couples to become civil partners in the UK have won the right to have the same-sex marriage ban in Northern Ireland subjected to judicial review.
A Belfast high court judge ruled on Friday that Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles, and Charles and Henry Flanagan-Kane, should be granted the review, which is set for the autumn.
Both couples civil partnership ceremonies were held at Belfast city hall, just a short distance from the high court, 10 years ago.
The review is likely to be held in November, alongside several other legal challenges taken by gay couples in the region, and who are backed by the Rainbow Project, an LGBT rights organisation.
Neither couple was in court for Fridays ruling but their barrister and senior counsel representing the Northern Ireland regional government were present to hear Mr Justice Treacy say that he had read the case papers and had already satisfied himself that the matter should proceed to judicial review. The applicant has an arguable case, he said.
Members of the Rainbow Project and Amnesty International were also in court. Others supporting the legal challenge included the former CEO of the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast Dawn Purvis and the actor Nuala McKeever.
Outside court, solicitor Mark OConnor issued a statement on behalf of both couples: We are delighted that we have been able to get over the first hurdle in relation to the judicial process and that the judge today has granted leave for us to bring this judicial review.
We are thankful that the judge has made that decision today. We believe that religious policy and religious views shouldnt be affecting public policy. Thankfully today the judge appears to have accepted that there is an arguable case to answer  and hopefully we will have success in the future in relation to this matter.
Prior to the hearing Grainne Close had said: This is not a religious issue, it is a human rights issue. That is why we are going to court.
Close said she and her US partner had been inspired by Irelands overwhelming vote in favour of gay marriage last month and the joyous scenes that greeted the result of the referendum at Dublin castle.
The Rainbow Projects director, John ODoherty, welcomed Treacys ruling. We are pleased that this case is progressing and that it will likely be heard alongside our clients case challenging the failure of the Northern Ireland government to recognise their lawful marriage.
The current illogical patchwork of marriage laws created by the Westminster government is placing LGBT people in Northern Ireland at an inexcusable disadvantage and we hope that the courts will agree and find that there must be a harmonisation of marriage laws across the UK.
A Sinn Fin motion on marriage equality was defeated in April, with 47 Northern Ireland assembly members voting in support, but 49 unionists against. Even if there had been a small majority in favour, the Democratic Unionist party would have exercised a special veto drawn up under devolution.
The petition of concern rule allows any party to veto legislation if it can argue the law would not have sufficient cross-community or Protestant/Catholic support.
Earlier this month, 20,000 trade unionists staged a rally in Belfast city centre to support gay marriage in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK where LGBT couples cannot be married.
Amnesty International said the ban has turned Northern Ireland into a discriminatory backwater for the gay and lesbian community.

A second police force has joined the search for an aggressive 6ft ostrich-like bird that escaped from a farm in Nottinghamshire. Officers have warned that the rhea bird, which has been missing for four days, poses a very real threat to the public.
The male bird escaped from a farm in the village of Carlton-in-Lindrick between Monday evening and midday on Tuesday through an open gate. South Yorkshire police joined the search on Friday after the on-the-run rhea was spotted in Rotherham.
A South Yorkshire police spokesman said: Police in Rotherham are currently searching in the Rother Valley area and surrounding land, following reports of a sighting of the aggressive rhea from Nottinghamshire.
The bird has also been sighted in the Dinnington area. Officers are there to ensure that there is no risk to members of the public and the bird is located and captured as soon as possible.
Dinnington is about five miles north of the birds home village. The rhea, a flightless bird native to South America, can run at speeds of about 30mph.
Inspector Paul Peatfield from Nottinghamshire police has said the bird poses a very real threat to the public due to its size, aggressive nature and the unfamiliar surroundings it could find itself in.

I hope they catch this escaped killer bird, it's like Mad Max times in my village! #rhea #rheagate
Owner Alex MacDonald, 24, told Sky News that the bird had been spotted at a college in Dinnington . They have a smallholding at the college where they keep two female rhea themselves, said MacDonald
The thinking behind it is that he could be responding to hearing their call as it is mating season. He has expressed fears that the bird may have been stolen and said the family are going through CCTV from the farm where they also keep alpacas and goats.
He said the birds female partner has been pacing the field they share looking for her mate.
Shes alright. She doesnt really want to attack you when you come in but the male was aggressive, very protective because he was sat on the eggs, he said.
 Its the male that does the sitting on the eggs with these... My dads just put them in a bucket at the top of the garden hoping that hell come back and will know to come to its eggs.
MacDonald said it often needed four men to wrestle the male bird to the ground if they need to move it.

Migrant reportedly dies trying to board Channel tunnel freight train
Amid worsening migrant plight in Calais, Le Parisien reports that an Eritrean man has died after attempting to get on a moving train at Coquelles

An Eritrean man is understood to have died on the French side of the Channel tunnel as he tried to board a moving freight train bound for the UK.
The unnamed man was found at about 5am near the terminal in Calais, a spokesman for Euro Tunnel said.
Aid workers say the situation in the French port has deteriorated in the past few months as more people arrive in the camps, and migrants  many of them unaccompanied children and teenagers  take ever greater risks to get to the UK.
This week, a strike by French workers at the port caused huge tailbacks on motorways leading to both the ferry port andChannel tunnel. Hundreds of migrants  mainly from east Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan  attempted to take advantage of queuing traffic by breaking into lorries bound for the UK.

On Wednesday, Riswan, a 19-year-old from Pakistan, who had been in the camp, known as the new jungle, for a month, told the Guardian the situation was very dangerous.
He said many migrants had been hurt the night before as hundreds of people took ever greater risks to get on to lorries and trains bound for the UK. One boy was badly injured in his chest when a wheel went over him, he said. There was lots of blood.
Other migrants told how they had tried to cling to the bottom of lorries and trains but had either fallen or been dragged off by police. Many people have been hurt but what else to do?, said an Afghan man. We have to keep trying because this is no place to stay.
Last year, a Guardian investigation revealed that at least 15 people living in the makeshift camps in Calais had died trying to get to the UK in just 12 months. Aid workers say the situation has got even worse in the past six months.
Related: Calais migrants: 'we have to keep trying because this is no place to stay'
Martine Devries, from Mdicins du Monde, a medical charity that works with the migrants, said people in the camp were hungry and living in appalling conditions. It is much worse than it was before. There are more people and they are becoming more desperate and are taking more risks.
Last year, people would only make attempts to get on to lorries at night. Now there are so many and they are so desperate people are trying in broad daylight.
French police do not keep a record of how many migrants die trying to get to the UK from Calais.
On Friday, a spokesman for the Euro Tunnel said: I understand that the person was pronounced deceased but we havent had any official confirmation of that. We dont know what the circumstances are just yet, but obviously this is a very regrettable incident.

Kobani-based Kurdish activist Mustafa Bali said small groups of jihadis were still in the town and had taken civilians hostage.
He added that Kurdish fighters were besieging three areas where Isis fighters took up positions.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday that the attack on Kobani and its suburbs left 120 civilians dead.
Bali said more than 100 civilians were killed in Kobani as well as 40 Isis fighters, whose bodies were still lying in the streets.
Kobani, on Syrias border with Turkey, had become a symbol of Kurdish resistance against Isis extremists.

If you think you understand Lebanon, you havent been properly briefed. Thus went the advice dispensed by the spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force in the wild south of the country in the mid-1980s. The same worldly-wise adage applies these days to the entire Arab region, wracked by collapsing states, terrorism, sectarianism, proxy wars and alliances of the strangest bedfellows.
It takes patience, clarity and perspective to explain the whole grim picture and the links between its constituent parts. These qualities are on impressive display in an important new book by the French scholar Jean-Pierre Filiu. His particular skill is to describe the development, survival and resurgence of the Arab deep state, the security agencies that have kept it going and the monster they helped create - in its most extreme form the jihadis of the Islamic state (Isis).
Filiu traces how autocrats in Syria, Egypt and Yemen used their experience of managing internal dissent to unleash their own thugs - different names in different countries, same vicious methods - to enforce their will when the call went up to reform or change their regimes. Anyone who experienced the heady events of 2011 will recognise the bitter truth in his admission that the excitement of the Arab spring obscured the prospects of successful counter-revolution.
I thought I had seen it all from the Arab despots. Their perversity, their brutality, their voracity. But I was still underestimating their ferocity and their readiness to literally burn down their country in order to cling to absolute power.
Following the departure of Hosni Mubarak, counter-revolution triumphed in Egypt with the repression of the Muslim Brotherhood. The overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, compared with the success of Rachid Ghannouchi in Tunisia, provided an instructive lesson, Filiu argues: Islamists who succeed at the ballot box, in complex and volatile circumstances, must not take their electoral victories as a blank cheque. To ignore that is to invite the backlash that brought Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi to power and forged a reality even worse than under Mubarak.
The guardians of the status quo were ready and waiting across the region. Fighting domestic enemies - Kurds in Turkey, armed Islamists in Algeria, Libya and Egypt, separatists in Yemen - had helped keep the operators of the mukhabarat state on their toes throughout the 1990s. Opaque, oil-fuelled budgets helped line the pockets of their masters and their crony capitalist friends.
The 9/11 attacks, in Filius compelling analysis, were a bonanza for the Arab dictators and their security mafias, who cooperated willingly with George Bushs global war on terror. Rendition and torture were the backdrop to Tony Blairs grubby flirtation with Muammar Gaddafi. In Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh tightened his grip on an ever-expanding security apparatus in the battle against al-Qaida while secretly colluding with the terrorists to keep their menace usefully alive. Egypt proved its enduring worth to the US as the guardian of the peace treaty with Israel.
The master, though was Bashar al-Assad. After the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, he backed the Sunni insurgency next door and used the post-Saddam chaos to justify repression at home. Ali Mamluk, one of his top security chiefs, famously met US officials and boasted of Syrias ability in penetrating terrorist groups. In 2011 Assad first denied the existence of popular and mostly peaceful protests and then blamed them on captured terrorists who confessed to their crimes on camera. He carried out what Filiu calls a highly selective amnesty - releasing Islamists from prison: one went to Iraq to join al-Qaida and later founded Jabhat al-Nusra, its Syrian affiliate. Assads self-fulfilling prophecy became true.
Iraqs Nouri al-Maliki, like Assad a close ally of Iran, helped fuel a vicious Sunni insurgency by his unbridled Shia sectarianism. The outcome, promoted by the mayhem in Syria, is a transnational jihadi movement that morphed into Isis, captured Mosul and declared its caliphate a year ago.
It is unclear how it could have turned out differently given that Arab leaders were determined to hold on to power at any price. Support for their moderate opponents - in the west at least - was limited and halting. Saudi and Gulf backing recklessly promoted extremists - but so did the impunity for Assads chemical weapons attacks in 2013. Deep-seated suspicion of Islamists played a role too, especially in Egypt. Spring was followed by winter. Yet the answer, Filiu concludes bravely, has to be more democracy, not less, not a fatalistic acceptance that change can never come to the Middle East. The Arab people are not doomed to remain pawns, the perpetual victims of a deadly game between their dictators and the jihadis.

Investigators who discovered two bodies in an Irish bog believed to be the site where the IRA secretly buried some of its victims in the 1970s are continuing to search for a possible third set of remains.
Specialist search teams charged with finding the remains of the IRA victims who became known as the disappeared were initially looking only for the body of Joe Lynskey, a former Catholic monk-turned IRA man, who the Republican group murdered in the early 1970s.

But on Friday, the senior investigator Jon Hill, from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR), said there could be more remains at the site in County Meath.
We were searching for the remains of Joe Lynskey, only expecting to find the remains of one person, he told BBC Radio Ulsters Good Morning Ulster programme. As the archaeologists were uncovering the remains they had found, it became clear that there was more than one where we were searching.
Hill said he thought the two bodies were probably buried together.

Apart from Lynskey, the other bodies suspected of being buried there are those of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee, both IRA members who were abducted, murdered and buried secretly by the organisation in 1972. They were accused of being recruited as British agents by an army undercover unit carrying out covert attacks in west Belfast at the start of the Troubles.
Hill stressed that it would be some weeks before DNA could give more clarity on the identity of the bodies.

Maria Lynskey, Joe Lynskeys niece, who has been to the site at the Coghalstown bog, said on Thursday that she thought the whole day that it was her uncle who had been found, but had come to terms with indications that now may not be the case.
The three men were part of a group of 17 people bar one that the IRA accused of being informers during the Troubles. They were abducted, killed and buried in secret locations across Ireland . The IRA only admitted to their murders decades after they had been disappeared.

The most notorious case was that of Jean McConville, a widow and mother of 10 who was kidnapped, taken in a car from west Belfast across the border to the Irish Republic, shot dead and buried at a beach in County Louth.
It was also the most controversial case because the IRA commander and hunger striker Brendan Hughes claimed Gerry Adams, now the Sinn Fin president, had given the order for the woman to be killed and buried in secret to avoid political embarrassment for the republican movement. Adams has always denied any connection to the McConville murder or even being in the IRA.
This year was the first dig for Lynskeys remains. The list of 17 disappeared includes Gareth OConnor who was murdered in 2003 and had his body recovered in June 2005 at Victoria Quay, Newry Canal, County Louth.
The ICLVR has investigated 16 of the abductions and murders. The most recent confirmed discovery was that of Brendan Megraw, whose remains were found in Oristown bog, also in County Meath, in October.

Thailands military government has forced a human rights group to cancel the launch of its report on the Vietnamese governments persecution of an ethnic minority, saying it could affect national security and bilateral relations.
The 33-page report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch describes persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnams central highlands , whose religious practices have been described by the government as evil.
Thai police said in a statement on Friday the scheduled event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand (FCCT) could have an impact on the countrys security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam.
It is the third event in a month that has been cancelled at the venue, including seminars about the human rights situation in Thailand and the countrys harsh lese-majesty law protecting its monarchy.
More than a dozen plainclothes and uniformed police officers were waiting outside the club, along with a police truck parked nearby. The FCCT said it received a written order from the police, issued on behalf of the ruling junta, to cancel the press conference by Human Rights Watch at which the report was to be launched.
The FCCT complied with the written request, which was also sent to HRW, the club said in a statement. However, the report was available on the groups website. An electronic version was also sent to journalists by email.
The FCCT lets out its premises for public events as a service for the media, diplomatic community and students.
Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watchs senior researcher in Asia, said the forced cancellation of the event was very disappointing and another affirmation that human rights organisations can no longer report, not only about the situation in Thailand, but situations in neighbouring countries in south-east Asia.
Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in (south-east Asia), which added more damage to Thailands already tarnished international reputation under the military rule, he added.
Thai authorities have cracked down on critics and dissent since the military seized power from a civilian government in last Mays coup and briefly blocked the Thailand section on Human Rights Watchs web page.
In its report, Human Rights Watch called for the Vietnamese government to end abusive policies and practices that have forced hundreds of Montagnards to flee the country.
It said the Montagnards beliefs and faith practices, such as De Ga Protestantism and Ha Mon Catholicism, were suppressed by the government on the grounds that they are not religions at all. It said the Montagnards have been subjected to intimidation, arbitrary arrests and mistreatment in custody.
There was no immediate response from the Vietnamese government on the report.

China issues report attacking US human rights record
In its annual rebuttal to accusations of Chinese human rights violations, Beijing accuses the US of being haunted by spreading guns and racial discrimination

China accused the United States on Friday of being haunted by spreading guns and racial discrimination, in its annual tit-for-tat rebuttal to US criticism of Chinas human rights record.
In a lengthy report carried by the official Xinhua news agency, Chinas State Council Information Office said the United States violated human rights in other countries in a more brazen manner, and was given more red cards in the international human rights field.
The US was haunted by spreading guns and frequent occurrence of violent crimes, which threatened citizens civil rights, the report said.
The China section of the annual US State Department report on human rights conditions globally, released on Thursday, said that repression and coercion were routine against activists, ethnic minorities and law firms that took on sensitive cases.
Human rights have long been a source of tension between the worlds two largest economies, especially since 1989, when the US imposed sanctions on China after a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijings Tiananmen Square.
While senior leaders periodically promise Chinas citizens democracy and human rights, the last two years under President Xi Jinpings administration have been marked by a sweeping crackdown on dissidents and activists.
China has long rejected criticism of its rights record, saying providing food, clothing, housing and economic growth are far more relevant for developing countries, pointing to its success at lifting millions out of poverty.
The State Department report came in the same week that the United States and China held three days of high-level talks in Washington DC.
The Chinese report, which was mostly compiled from US media articles, said racial discrimination has been a chronic problem in the US human rights record, adding that the United States suppressed the voting rights of minorities.
It cited a USA Today report that said preliminary exit polls showed that voters of African origins accounted for 12% in the 2014 midterm election, down from 13% in the 2012 presidential election.
In 2014, multiple cases of arbitrary police killing of African Americans have sparked huge waves of protests, casting doubts on the racial equality in the US and giving rise to racial hatred factors, the report said.
The report also criticised the US for conducting surveillance on world leaders and civilians and for allowing a few interest groups to influence the governments decision-making.

An excursion plane carrying sightseers from a Holland America Line cruise ship has crashed in south-east Alaska , with all nine on board killed including the pilot.
Reports said wreckage was located on a rocky cliff face about 800ft (240 metres) above a lake after the plane was reported missing on Thursday afternoon. Search and rescue crews were sent.
The crash occurred near Ella Lake, about 20 miles (30 km) north-east of the town of Ketchikan, the Seattle-based cruise company said in a statement.
We have nine fatalities, said Clint Johnson, head of the National Transportation Safety Boards Alaska office.
Rain and wind forced an end to recovery efforts on Thursday night in the rugged terrain about 20 miles north-east of Ketchikan, south-east Alaska. Officials would mount a recovery attempt again on Friday, he said.
The eight passengers were guests from the Westerdam, a ship on a seven-day cruise that departed Seattle on Saturday. Promech Air, an airline based in Ketchikan, operated the air excursion sold through Holland America Line, the cruise ship company said in a statement. The pilot was among the dead.
There was no immediate indication of why the DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter turboprop crashed. It was found on Thursday against the granite rock face of a cliff, 800ft (240 metres) above Ella Lake.
Johnson said it was too soon to know circumstances of the crash, including whether the plane flew into the cliff.
The NTSB was assembling a high-level team to investigate the crash, including three members from Alaska and at least two people from Washington DC.
The initial rescue crew that went in had a very tough time because of the terrain, Johnson said. Its a very steep, mountainous area and weather conditions caused them to stand down.
Coast Guard Petty Officer Lauren Steenson said the agency received a report around 2.15pm that the plane was overdue. Troopers said an emergency locator transmitter activated in the Misty Fjords National Monument area and a helicopter pilot spotted the downed aircraft above the lake, which is about 800 miles (1,300km) south-east of Anchorage.
Holland America Line said in a statement: We are incredibly distressed by this situation and our thoughts and prayers are with those onboard the plane and their families. Holland America Line is extending its full support to travelling companions of the guests involved.
Promech said that the crash happened about 11.20am and the plane was one of five Otter aircraft in its fleet.
The Ketchikan Daily News reported the Westerdam had been scheduled to leave the city at 1pm but remained in port on Thursday evening.
The airlines website advertises tours of the Misty Fjord National Monument in its float planes. Towering granite cliffs, 1,000-foot waterfalls, lush and remote valleys and serene crystalline lakes make up this incredible landscape, it says.

First, I was delighted at the letter from my old friend Marian telling me she is coming this summer to Maine. Of course she must weekend with me and of course Id go to visit her at her interesting summer job with Indians near the Canadian border.
Then the doubts came hurtling in: visions of snubs, incidents, demonstrations, police dogs, hoses, tear-gas. For my friend Marian is a Negress, and I know I am not cut out to be a heroine in an integration crisis this summer of the Civil Rights Bill.
What would my landlady say about a Negro woman coming to stay in one of her all-white apartments, built into the wing of the landladys own beautiful home? What would my friends say? I would have to invite some of them to a party for Marian, morning coffee at least. I would have to take her out to one of the famous New England meals such as a shore dinner with lobster and clams. I know from my New Orleans days that there is something specially provocative about inter-racial eating. When I taught there even religious groups gathered at meetings could not take even light refreshments together. But I owed Marian all kinds of hospitality. She had often fed me and put me up for the night when I went as art teacher to the Pennsylvania Adult Centre, where she acted as dietician.
At this centre Marian had occupied far better accommodation that I, for a dietician is more valuable than an art and English teacher. Because of my English background, she had shown me the manuscript of her novel about her familys ancestry, going back to her White ancestress who had been an English governess in love with the mulatto son of the plantation owner who employed her. Marian had never been to me in the category of the Southern cooks and cleaning women who with melodious names like Samantha and Sophronia had added charm to my fifteen years of life in New Orleans. She is a University woman with dignity and beauty.
She would be horrified if she got into a Civil Rights Bill racial incident by being my guest in Maine. I didnt want to create an incident. I am not even a Maine native but a naturalised American, glad to live in a peaceful New England small town similar to the Lancashire town where I spent my childhood. Perhaps for both Marians and my own sake, it would be safer not to invite her here.
Doubtfully I called my most liberal friend, a social worker, and put the question directly. Shall I have difficulties? Just what is the situation in Maine?

April 1968: The race riots that followed Martin Luther Kings assassination, Washington, DC.
Rose gave the matter serious thought. Of course Ill want to meet her, she proffered, but I dont know what youll get yourself into. We tried to give a farewell party at the Country Club for that pretty girl who was here for a while as social worker, and they wouldnt let her into the club. What did you do? I gasped. Well, I was just threatening to leave with the whole party when one guest phoned a board member she knows, and he gave permission so long as wed use a private dining-room. Dont worry too much, though, she finished. I dont believe shed have any trouble on buses or at hotels. Im not sure really. But well arrange for you and Marian to come over here to something. I brightened, thinking of Roses useful car. There would be no taxi problem then.
I made myself phone Marian that night on the rate of three minutes for a dollar. When her warm voice responded from Philadelphia, I came forth with my congratulations on her summer job and my delight that we might meet in Maine. But I couldnt bring out the fateful words, You must visit me one weekend.
During the next few days as I combed the local newspapers for indications of how the racial question goes in Maine, my research only got me a headache. Front page headlines shrieked out: Rocks and bottles thrown at Negro boys at Maine schoolchildren visiting Washington. Outbreaks of violence seemed to be everywhere, but I found a small announcement of a symposium on the race question to be held at a Roman Catholic college a hundred miles away. Martin Luther King and half a dozen other experts on Civil Rights issues would speak, and there would be panel discussions.
My enthusiasm for meetings runs lukewarm, but my regard for Marian got me into the necessary buses, and I arrived at the college gymnasium where a crowd of nearly a thousand Maine people rose and clapped as the speakers came in - protected by local police, State police, and even sheriffs with wide hats and guns dramatic enough for a Hollywood set.
During the speeches, my barometer registered only what the speakers comments meant in terms of Marians possible visit to me. When a speaker warned that violence might increase if the Civil Rights Bill didnt pass without being watered down to useless form, I could see Marian caught up in the backwash by troublemakers in Maine, where a National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People has only been formed this month. When veteran civil disobedience demonstrators quipped about how cosy a prison cell could seem when one reached it in the midnight hours, I could see myself and Marian jostled in a police car because we had picknicked together.
On the bus next morning returning home, I was hypersensitive when I saw ahead of us a Negro girl waiting by the roadside. Would the bus driver stop for her? I prayed that she was a regular like the other girls we picked up along the forested road and deposited at various restaurants and beauty shops and nursing homes for their daily work. The bus driver stopped. The Negro girl got on, smiled at us all in general, and took one of the front seats. The bus stopped again, this time for a young white girl outside a lonely farmhouse. My barometer swung with joy as the white girl took a seat by the Negro girl. Soon they were chatting busily, two regulars on their way to work at the usual time.
All at once my mental map shook into proportion. Police dogs and demonstrations faded. When I dropped the fateful letter of invitation into our corner mailbox that afternoon my knees had stopped quaking. Whats your fuss? I asked myself. Youve simply invited an old friend to come and visit.

Australia's population increase from migration continues to slow

Australias population increase from migration continues to slow, the latest data from the Bureau of Statistics show, while people are increasingly moving to Victoria from other states and territories.
Last year, the net overseas migration figure was 184,100 people, a fall of 15% from the previous year. Migration to Australia added 473,500 people to the population, 5.3% fewer than the previous year.
Victoria recorded its highest interstate migration in more than 40 years, with most of the new arrivals  2,700  coming from New South Wales. This was followed by 2,100 from South Australia and 1,400 from Western Australia.
In Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, more people left the state in 2014 than arrived, but all jurisdictions increased their overall population thanks to the number of births exceeding the number of deaths.
The bureaus director of demography, Denise Carlton, said overseas migration had peaked in 2008, and that many push and pull factors influenced the rate of this movement.
Carolyn Whitzman, a professor of urban planning at the University of Melbourne, said the data highlighted the need for capital cities to develop better plans for growth.
Australias population increased by 330,200 to reach 23.6m by the end of last year, representing a growth rate of 1.4%.
I dont think population growth is the problem per se, because cities like Melbourne have seen growth at a higher rate over much of its history, Whitzman said.
The problem is, we arent planning for the future. The bottom line is, whether Melbourne, Sydney and Perth grow at all, there is a need for better kinds of housing, transport and social infrastructure, like schools and healthcare.
She suspected growth in jobs in the healthcare and education sectors had contributed to the movement to Victoria.
But it was important that the infrastructure built to support those industries, such as hospitals, schools and public transport, were spread equitably, she said.
Unfortunately, major cities see rapid urban sprawl, coupled with infrastructure not catching up, Whitzman said.
This story was amended on 26 June to correct the interpretation of the ABS figures. The overseas migration figure refers to the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants, not the absolute number of emigrants.

Pro-democracy activists have accused Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh of trying to price potential opponents out of the market through astronomical rises in registration fees for presidential elections.
The government has announced plans to charge candidates one million dalasi (US$25,000) to run in any future campaigns  10,000 times the current cost.
The sum would differ from a conventional election deposit in that it would be non-refundable, even upon victory, under a bill being put before parliament.
The government is proposing the same charge for political parties, as well as smaller, but still significant, increases for candidates for parliamentary and mayoral elections.
The proposed amendments are retrogressive and are designed to scuttle the growth of multiparty democracy in the Gambia, said Ousainou Darboe, secretary general of the main opposition United Democratic Party.
About two-thirds of the population of the west African nation live on less than US$1.25 a day and would have to spend nothing for more than half a century to be able to afford to run for president.
The Gambia , mainland Africas smallest country with a population of about 1.7 million, has been ruled with an iron fist by Jammeh since he came to power in a bloodless coup in 1994.
One of the poorest countries in the world, it survives mostly on agriculture and tourism, luring sun-worshipping Europeans to its sweeping, palm-fringed coastline.
Jammeh has woven an aura of mysticism around himself, dressing in billowing white robes, never letting go of his Quran and brooking no dissent.
The former wrestler, who claims he can cure AIDS, is often pilloried for rights abuses and the muzzling of journalists. He has threatened to cut off the heads of homosexuals and heaps derision on any criticism from the west.
He won a landslide re-election to serve a fourth term in 2011 presidential polls slammed by the opposition as bogus and fraudulent. The next vote is expected in 2016.
Due to high levels of illiteracy, voting is through a unique system using glass marbles instead of ballot papers.
The marbles are dropped into drums, which are coloured to represent each candidate. As the marbles fall they hit a bell that sounds loudly, preventing multiple voting.

The president of Nauru has attacked foreign media organisations as he confirmed three MPs faced criminal charges after a protest outside the island nations parliament.
The government has accused members of the opposition of an orchestrated campaign to disrupt parliament and the passage of the budget.
On Friday president Baron Waqa condemned their shameful actions and said they were guilty of a campaign of lies backed by foreign media outlets in a statement issued on Friday.
He named Guardian Australia, the ABC and Radio New Zealand has having an agenda to attack the Nauru government, Radio NZ reported .
Waqa said information from police suggested the former president Sprent Dabwido and fellow MPs Mathew Batsuia and Squire Jeremiah were the ringleaders of a protest held almost a fortnight ago and they would face criminal charges.
The hundreds-strong rally reportedly called on the government to resign over corruption allegations aired on the ABC, new laws cracking down on free speech and the indefinite suspension of the MPs.
The government has characterised the protest as a riot.
Members of the opposition have been speaking loudly and freely against the reform measures of our government for some time, Waqa said.
The government of Nauru will not be dictated to by a handful of power-hungry people focused on causing fear and panic.
Waqa accused the organisers of the demonstration of using children as part of their protest and plying them with alcohol. He blamed the organisers for not warning public servants they might lose their jobs if they took part.

The remains of two bodies have been found on reclaimed bogland in the Irish Republic where three of the people believed to have been disappeared by the IRA are thought to have been secretly buried.
As part of a search for the remains of the former monk Joe Lynskey, a dig on farmland in Coghalstown, County Meath, unearthed one body on Thursday morning, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) said.
A second body was discovered as further examinations took place at the site and preparations were made to take the first body out the ground.
IRA victims Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee are believed to have been buried in the same area as Lynskey, the ICLVR said.
We have always said that we think three bodies are in that area and until there is further identification we just dont know, a spokesman said.
It is understood the second set of human remains was unearthed as specialists cleared ground around the first body to prepare it for removal.

Lynskeys family had been notified of the initial discovery and were said to be shocked but relieved.
The former Cistercian monk from Belfast was abducted and murdered by the IRA in August 1972. The group only admitted his disappearance in 2010.
Wright, an asphalt layer also from Belfast, had been in the IRA and was murdered by his former colleagues, who accused him of being a British army agent and a member of its military reaction force  an undercover unit.
Wright was 25 and married when he went missing in October 1972.
McKee, again from Belfast and in the IRA, was murdered in the same year because of the same suspicions the IRA had of Wright. McKee was interrogated and murdered by the terrorist group.
Lynskeys niece, Maria, who expected to visit the site, said her thoughts were with other families awaiting news.
We would like to thank the [ICLVR] and those who have engaged with the commission in the search for Joe, she said. Our thoughts are with the other families whose loved ones remain disappeared.
Extensive searches have been carried out at the site for both Wright and McKee, but this year was the first dig for Lynskeys remains.

Its instructive that someone of Simon Jenkinss elite western background perceives current patterns of migration so narrowly ( The human tide the west doesnt want , 19 June). For him its primarily an immigration issue, a threat to his nation. National identity is fixed in history and geography, he says. But geography is transforming rapidly as a consequence of the wests increasingly desperate efforts to maintain a fatally flawed ideology and way of life. After centuries of nation-building, expansion, colonialism, militarism, capitalism, exploitation, expropriation and extermination, the European international project of the last 500 years is collapsing. The writing on the wall couldnt be bolder  climate change, destruction of habitats, the global economic crash, frenzied migration  but the elite continue to promulgate the old narratives and pretend to carry on as normal even as they bail out to become part of a global superclass. They exist in a new four-dimensional world created by the technology and transport necessary for the progressive shrinking of time and space required to maintain capitalist growth. The notion and importance of the European concept of nation have been transformed by them. They are operating in a world without borders.
Without conscious irony, Jenkins supports his case with references to Australia and America seeking to deter and repatriate migrants with imprisonment and transhipment. More accurately, he should have referred to this as the actions of the European diaspora. I suspect the descendants of the survivors of European invasions will have a clearer understanding of the current migration situation than Jenkins. Viewpoint is also influenced by history and geography.

 The governments plan to expel non-EU migrants whose earnings after six years fail to exceed 35,000 ( Report , 22 June) could be the first step towards eliminating poverty in the UK. It only needs an extension of that rule to force anyone whose income is below that level to live elsewhere. It would get rid of a lot of troublesome pensioners before the infirmities of old age make them costly for the NHS. It could be a little problematic if it also meant that we lost most of our social workers, a lot of teachers, and many other leeches on the public purse. But it would boost the nations apparent wealth. I look forward to another of the prime ministers Alice in Wonderland speeches.

        <title>Dirty boulevard: why Paris's ring road is a major block on the city's grand plans</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/26/ring-road-paris-peripherique-suburbs-banlieue</Link>

With 1.1m cars a day, the 35 kilometres of the Boulevard Priphrique are the busiest in Europe . Pariss inner ring road runs around the French capital, following the citys administrative boundaries almost perfectly and connecting the city proper and its banlieues, or suburbs.
Since its inauguration in 1973, the priphrique  measuring 40 to 60 metres wide and composed of up to six lanes  has been a concrete belt around Paris, making all too real what should have remained an invisible administrative boundary. This has reinforced the insurmountable contrast between Paris and the citys adjacent municipalities, adding a physical dimension to political borders and separating the Parisiens from the rest of France .
Architect Richard Rogers , who designed a strategic plan for the city , said: I dont know of any other city where the heart is as detached from its limbs. A number of studies published this year by Atelier Parisien dUrbanisme , the public agency in charge of urban studies, qualify almost the whole priphrique as a challenge for urban integration.
As a result, on the first day of 2016, the Mtropole du Grand Paris will come to life. The MGP aims to deliver a more integrated development to Paris and its suburbs, by creating a new metropolitan governance.
Pariss boundaries are defined by its fortifications  displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning
The City of Paris and its 2.3 million inhabitants will be merged with its petite couronne (small crown, or inner suburbs), adding about 4.6 million residents and an extra 128 local authorities to form a new metropolitan institution: the Grand Paris.
Where New York, Berlin and London have successfully created metropolitan governments, can Paris overcome its inner boundary, and convince inhabitants of Paris proper and the suburbs that they are all Parisiens? And to achieve this, should it sacrifice the priphrique, the citys most prominent physical and symbolic boundary?
The roots of the division between Paris and its suburbs run much deeper than the building of the road in the 1970s. To understand the significance, we need to go back to the fall of Napoleon. In March 1814, the Battle of Paris saw the defeat of the Napoleonic troops and Prussian forces storming the capital city.
Consequently, King Louis-Philippe and French prime minister Adolphe Thiers decided to transform Paris into a fortress and protect the city from any further intrusion, ordering construction of city fortifications in the 1840s. Completed in 1844, the message was clear: Pariss boundaries were to be defined by its fortifications  displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning.

Consisting of a thick wall, 10 metres high and protected by a wide ditch, the ramparts were also granted a 250-metre wide non-building zone. Yet, as the fortifications lost military relevance and became obsolete only decades after their completion, informal settlements mushroomed within the Zone, housing the Parisian proletariat.
The destruction of the fortifications was in the pipeline as early as 1882, but only started in 1919 and was completed in 1929. To put this into perspective, Berlin destroyed its last fortifications in 1740; London in 1760.
In Paris, the defunct fortifications were replaced at the beginning of the 1930s by a grand scheme of social housing. Yet the Zone remained untouched, full of zonards (still a deprecating term for someone from a deprived area who loiters suspiciously) and their insalubrious housing.
While the idea of an orbital road around Paris emerged in the 1920s, it was only in 1956 that the construction of the priphrique started. It addressed the increase in inner-city car use, and similar schemes were designed in cities around the world . The zone was cleared, its inhabitants evicted and the priphrique was inaugurated in 1973 , after 17 years of building work.
Cutting across the city, the priphriques viaduct structure is omnipresent in the working-class neighbourhoods of north-east Paris, but in well-off areas  such as Vincennes in the east, and Boulogne in the west  it discreetly passes underground as a tunnel. In the main, though, a formidable ring of concrete now stands where fortifications once did. London has its green belt, Paris its concrete one.

To explore the physical boundary created by the road, we must meet the people who have a direct relationship with it. All along the priphrique, the entrances to Paris are still named portes, as they are located where the fortifications gates used to stand. Walking from Porte Dore to Porte de la Chapelle, I encounter various types of transition between Paris and its banlieues. In some places, the transition is smooth and painless: the tunnel of the priphrique allows Parisians to easily access the Bois de Vincennes  one of Pariss green lungs, which sits outside the boundary but is under Pariss jurisdiction. Where Paris connects with the well-off cities of Saint-Mand and Vincennes, several effortless transitions are in place, allowing residents to move easily from one area to another, as resident Dorothe confirms.
In 1932, Dorothes in-laws moved into a housing block built in the place of the fortifications; she moved into the flat herself in 1969, as the priphrique was being completed. Living on the edge of the 12th arrondissement, she is within walking distance of Saint-Mand and Vincennes. In other spots, such as Porte de Montreuil, its really different  there is a real break between Paris and [those suburbs]. But here, we are well connected. Theres a real continuity.

The compact and humble houses evoke rural France
The Porte de Montreuil, a few kilometres up the priphrique, offers a starker contrast between Paris and the adjacent environs of Montreuil and Bagnolet. The roundabout, which connects the area with the priphrique by means of four access roads, is empty of almost any pedestrian or bicycle  and, although the Rue dAvron on the Paris side and the Rue de Paris on Montreuils side are very busy thoroughfares, they do not connect.
Bndicte, a Montreuil resident, describes the priphrique as a ditch between Montreuil and Paris. While the priphrique running below the roundabout leaves a wide void between the two areas, how it is built  its height, architectural style and condition  on each side of the road reveals another level of divide.
In Montreuil and Bagnolet, alongside glossy new office buildings sits the traditional suburban housing stock: 19th-century houses that are one or two storeys high. With its compact and humble houses, sometimes left in ruins, the streetscape evokes rural France, not the core of the wealthiest region in Europe. An unlikely vision when you consider that Paris is among the biggest property markets in the world.
Here you might be only 60 metres away from the capital, but you are not in Paris any more. Cross the priphrique and the value of properties drops by half , from 6,300 per sq metre in the 20th arrondissement to 3,800 per sq metre in Bagnolet. Yet it has good transport connections, with line 3 of the Mtro stopping here, plenty of buses to Paris, and docking stations for both Autolib and Vlib: the self-service car- and bicycle-sharing systems launched by the City of Paris.
As I continue my orbital journey along the priphrique, the divide between Paris and its banlieues changes many times. A few hundred metres further, I have to face the Bagnolet Interchange  Pariss very own spaghetti junction. A few kilometres later sits the Porte des Lilas: here the road has recently been covered, creating a whole new district and a new way to move between Paris and the adjacent town. A couple of kilometres later, arriving at Porte de la Chapelle, the contrast is even more pronounced.

But there is not only negative feeling for the priphrique. Carla, a resident of the 19th arrondissement of Paris who works in the nearby town of Colombes, and her colleague Aude, who lives in Saint-Ouen right outside the priphrique, explain that not all the points of passage on the priphrique are the same. For instance, at the Porte Montmartre there are always people, even in the middle of the night. It is always full.
I am very aware of the Paris-banlieue divide, probably because I grew up here: thats a very Parisian attitude
While some parts of the priphrique remain a hostile environment for pedestrians, it seems the residents close to the road have found ways to cope with the concrete beast. Sophie, who lives on the edge of Pariss 18th arrondissement, says the break between Paris and the banlieue is visible. Its physical. For instance, the cycle path between Paris and Saint-Ouen stops at the Porte Montmatre, where the priphrique starts. Yet, Anis, from the 17th arrondissement, says: The priphrique, its like a rampart, like a wall  but more or less invisible. Bndicte from Montreuil adds: The priphrique is both a connector and the separation between Paris and its suburbs.
Talking with the residents, I realise there is much more to this than just an urban design issue. While the road and its 1.1m daily cars does not help, the reconnection between the citys heart and its limbs might require more subtle intervention. Perhaps the last wall that will bring down the invisible rampart is in fact a psychological one.
Marko, from Clichy, and Bndicte believe the banlieue is a myth. Bndicte, who moved to Montreuil in the 1990s after a lifetime in central Paris, adds that Montreuil was a compromise: My husband [who did not grow up in Paris] had no prejudice about the suburbs. Meanwhile, I am very aware of the Paris/banlieue divide, probably because I grew up here: thats a very Parisian attitude.
Marko and Anis were interviewed in 2013 by citizen collective and NGO Mtropop for its project titled My Neighbourhood, My Heritage. Antoine Le Pessec, its president, tells me Mtropops objective is to question representations of the banlieues, to work on social prejudice, and to accompany Parisians and suburbanites towards founding a genuine Grand Paris. Beyond redesigning political institutions or the priphrique, the real challenge is in peoples heads.

From 1 January 2016, Bagnolet, Montreuil, Vincennes, Saint-Ouen, Colombes, Paris and more than 100 other municipalities will form the Mtropole du Grand Paris. For the first time since 1860, we will witness an institutional attempt to move Paris beyond its own boundaries, beyond the priphrique. Yet, in six months time, the road will still be standing, untouched and unchallenged.
Projects  of uneven quality and relevance  to get rid of the priphrique have regularly appeared in the media since the 1990s. Some parts have been covered, making the transition between Paris and the adjacent municipalities smoother. Yet a total coverage of the priphrique has never been seriously contemplated  it would be immensely costly  and nor has its destruction, as the city struggles with managing its car traffic.

Yet plans announced in May by Mayor Hidalgo to pedestrianise inner-city urban motorways along the Seine were, until recently, seen as ludicrous and unrealistic. They follow up on a similar successful scheme implemented by former Mayor Bertrand Delano in 2013, which was met at the time with fierce opposition from pro-car lobbies. Why cant the challenges of the priphrique be met with similar panache?
This iconic road remains an eyesore, as well as a major health hazard for the hundreds of thousands who live close to it. And, surely, dedicating hundreds of hectares in a central location to a single road is a lost opportunity in a city where land is scarce.
The main divide between Parisiens and banlieusards, however, remains a psychological one. While redesigning and reinventing the priphrique is certainly part of the solution, it is Parisians perceptions that must change if the ghosts of Pariss historic fortifications are to be eradicated for good.

'My children are suffering but what can I do?' Delhi's polluted air, by the people who live there

For three years Mohammad Yunus, his wife Babli, five children and a handful of relatives have made their home on a patch of concrete in the middle of an eight-lane motorway, near a stretch of road named after Mahatma Gandhi. As lorries, buses and motorcycles roar past on either side of the familys cramped bit of south Delhi pavement, and a modern, concrete flyover carries several more lanes of traffic overhead, their evening routine unfolds.
A young woman in a pink dress squats to kindle a fire from wooden sticks and plastic bottles, then breaks a lump of dough into pieces to bake into chapatti bread. A three-month-old baby and a toddler sleep on a dirty mat just a few feet from the curb. The incessant blaring of horns makes conversation difficult, but does not rouse the children.
Delhis horrendous air pollution  the worst in the world, according to the World Health Organisation  is far from the only worry facing the Yunus family. But the poisonous fumes are doing them serious harm, and the children are particularly vulnerable to its health-wrecking effects .

Babli Yunus has a thick, phlegmy, hacking cough that she says never goes away. Her son Toufiq, who looks about nine (no one at this encampment knows their precise ages), has had a fever for several days. I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do? Babli asks as one daughter, aged about three, leans back in her lap, playing with a dirty yellow comb. This child has a cough and cold. So does this one.
Babli doesnt know whether the familys latest round of illnesses was caused by the diesel and petrol exhaust that gives the air an acrid smell and a heavy feel, or by a soaking rain that left their clothes and blankets wet. It all goes into our systems, she says. We end up eating a lot of dust.
Dust, dirt, everything, her husband echoes. This is a main road. It never closes.
It is hard to imagine an existence more wretched than that of the Yunus family, huddled together on this dirty rectangle of concrete about 10 x 4 metres, surrounded by traffic on three sides and pressed on the fourth against a tall metal fence. Mohammad brings home what money he can, working on construction sites and selling vegetables in the market. His children, who do not attend school, earn a few coins collecting discarded plastic bottles from around a nearby bus stop.
Mohammad says a total of 1820 people live in the space. Their belongings hang from the fences spikes: a plastic bucket, bundles wrapped in patterned cloth, a few blankets, a shirt. Pedestrians stream past just inches away, dodging traffic and carrying goods on their heads or under their arms. A few months ago, a girl of around eight living on the same stretch of road was struck by a car and killed, nearby families say.
Delhis foul air impacts all sections of its society. A 2010 study of more than 11,000 schoolchildren found 43% had poorly developing lungs, compared with 25% of a rural control group. The Delhi pupils were three times more likely to have severe impairment, and such deficits are believed to last for life.
I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do?
Babli Yunus
But the citys destitute  poorly nourished, often suffering from chronic illnesses, and unable to afford medical care  are the most severely affected. These people dont get any respite from the pollution, even at night, so yes I think it does [cause more death and illness among the poor], says Dr Neeraj Jain, a respiratory consultant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Its just their economic status that makes them more vulnerable.
A growing body of research also shows that those living within a few hundred metres of major thoroughfares suffer greater health problems. Everywhere in Delhi, the air is thick with toxins, and levels of the tiniest pollution particles  linked to ailments from heart attacks and stroke to cancer , respiratory infections and even dementia  reach 17 times the recommended limits in some parts of the city. Even in the springtime, when the air is far better than in the filthy, choking winters , the haze is visible night and day, shimmering in the headlights of cars and blurring buildings and bridges behind a gauzy grey curtain.
Mohammad and his relatives came to Delhi from their village near Lucknow because the high cost of land made it impossible for them to earn a living by farming. The family originally camped a few kilometres away but police forced them out so they settled beneath the flyover, unable to find anywhere better to live.
It was Gods will that we came here, says Yunus, a slim man in a worn grey shirt and trousers, his face freshly shaven but for a neat moustache. Where should we go? You tell us.

The autorickshaw driver
In Delhi, millions live much of their lives on the street. It is not just the homeless: vendors of everything from car parts and furniture to drinks and snacks spend their workdays beside busy roads. Rickshaw drivers wait at busy corners for fares, then pedal through heavy traffic, inhaling pollution deeply.
Sitting for hours in New Delhis gridlocked traffic, perched behind the handlebars of his open-air autorickshaw, Nand Lal Kumar coughs and coughs, struggling for air. His head pounds, my chest gets heavy, stomach gets tight and I feel suffocated, anxious.
I have difficulty breathing at the end of the day, my face is black with soot, says Kumar, waiting for his next fare on a noisy corner in south Delhi, beside a road jammed with honking cars, trucks and buses. But theres absolutely no other alternative. There are no other jobs.
Kumar, 38, left his village more than 20 years ago to seek opportunity in the capital, but he still struggles to scratch out a living. After fuel, maintenance and loan payments, he nets 300 or 400 rupees, about three or four pounds, each day.
I cant even pay my rent on time. I havent been able to pay my childrens school fees for a year or two. I pay half the fee, they go for a while, then they have to stop, he says. Nobody thinks about autorickshaw drivers in this country. Passengers are only concerned that we might overcharge them. Nobody cares about us or our families.
The doorless, green-and-yellow three-wheelers that clog Delhis streets were converted to compressed natural gas years ago, so they create little pollution. Their drivers, though, inhale the health-wrecking air on the roads all day. Scientists who measured levels of tiny, dangerous airborne particles in autorickshaws backseats said they were the among the worst ever found in a regular form of transport, up to eight times higher than Delhis already disastrous baseline pollution. Kumar, in battered sandals and a worn, blue-grey uniform, knows he suffers the effects.
He sees a respiratory expert every few months, to little avail. Take medicines and youll be fine, thats what the doctor says. It gets OK and then it gets bad again, he says. My cough doesnt stop for a month at a time.
I do worry about my future health, but theres nothing I can do, he says sadly. My job is a hazard for me.
The young family
As well as the 7.5 million vehicles on Delhis roads (with nearly 1,400 more added every day), smouldering garbage fires are everywhere in the city, and poor families burn wood and dung to cook and stay warm. Just beyond the city limits, thousands of primitive brick-making factories send plumes of black smoke into the air, while coal-burning power plants lack even the most basic filtration systems.
Dirty diesel generators power mobile-phone towers and provide back-up electricity for malls, hospitals and apartment blocks. Smoke from the fires that farmers in neighbouring states set to get rid of crop stubble after harvest settles over the city. Construction projects such as the expansion of the Delhi Metro  a long-term hope for reducing pollution  only add to the clouds of dust.
After Manjali Khosla and her family moved to Delhi from Dubai three years ago, she spent the first six months fighting pneumonia. She tried every brand of face mask she could find, to filter out the pollution she blames for her illness and keep others from catching it.
Born in India and raised in Hong Kong and North America, Manjali wanted her children to experience life in their parents home country and spend time with extended family. She and her husband did not understand until they arrived just how big a role Delhis filthy air would play in their lives.
You feel like theres like an ulcer inside you, somethings burning, and it takes a week for the feeling to go away

The children, a 10-year-old and twins aged eight, sometimes wear masks at school . Someone in the family is always coughing and Manjalis father-in-law suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a severe lung problem. She has a PhD in chemistry so she understands the science. Air pollution is Indias fifth-biggest killer, causing 620,000 premature deaths a year, and it terrifies her.
Manjali has bought filters for the familys house and plants that are said to purify the air. She finds indoor activities to discourage the kids from playing outside on the foulest days, and plans holidays abroad as often as possible  but still frets about what their years in Delhi may do to her childrens health. Ive even dreamed polyps coming out of their lungs, something very drastic, she says.
Returning to Delhi after trips away, the kids come off the plane holding their noses. Symptoms are always bad during the first days back: You feel like theres like an ulcer or something inside you, somethings burning, and it takes about a week for the feeling to go away, she says. The sinuses hurt, your head hurts, your eyes water.
But while many of the foreign families Manjali knows are contemplating leaving, she is determined to stay in Delhi for a few more years yet.
My kids say, Why are we here, why dont we just leave? But I say, If we leave, it doesnt solve the problem  your grandparents are still here, your cousins are still here. Lets stay and try to fix it. And in the meantime, wear masks.
The paediatrician
Dr Sanjeev Bagai has one word to describe what it feels like to see the wheezing children who stream through his surgery door every day: Helpless.
He can treat them with steroids and inhalers, and antibiotics for those with bronchitis  but he cannot clean the air that makes them sick.
In his practice, asthma cases are up by 40-45% in the last five years, poor lung function is common, and lowered oxygen levels caused by breathing difficulties can lead to long-term problems with vision, growth and brain development, says the paediatrician.
This morning, Ive seen five patients; three had wheezing. All of them were under six. Bagai, a burly man with cufflinks and a carefully waxed handlebar moustache, explains that asthma, once seen only in children over three or four, is now common in babies and toddlers. He once diagnosed it in a newborn, less than three weeks old. Rapid breathing, breathlessness, spasmodic cough, he says.  It can be life-threatening.
According to Bagai, asthma carries a stigma in India , and young patients often become depressed and withdrawn. They feel scared to play, they miss a lot of school days, he says. Very often kids say, Im taking all the medicine, but why am I getting this again and again? Why me?
The lorry driver

In the hottest part of a baking day, eight truckers are stretched out on a concrete platform in their companys bare, windowless office, waiting for 10pm, the earliest they are allowed to drive their hulking diesel vehicles through Delhi.
A dozen lorries are parked outside, their cabs decorated with scraps of sparkly tinsel. Its a tough life, but this is what I do, says Surinder Singh, sitting on a blue wooden table, a Hindi newspaper in one hand. If I had some other job, I could spend time with my children, relax, go to the market.
It is mid-afternoon and Singh, with a round face and boyish sweetness in his eyes, has not been home since last night; grey stubble covers his cheeks and chin. He plans to stop there for a nap, dinner and a bath before heading out with a load of iron pipes. There is no rest in this job.
An estimated 80,000 trucks crowd Delhis roads every night, spewing a toxic stew of pollutants . So Singh and other drivers have become a focus of the citys growing pollution concerns.
Now, their livelihoods are in jeopardy. In April, judges barred all diesel vehicles more than 10 years old from entering the capital. Truck drivers threatened to strike and the court postponed its order , but the threat remains.
My truck will be as good as scrap [under the rule], Singh says. He estimates the decision slashed two-thirds off the value of the lorry that became his in 2013, after nine years of repayments. How will I feed my children? How will I educate them if I lose my business, my job?
He feels the effects of dirty air himself  shortness of breath, itchy eyes, a cough. But he doesnt think truckers deserve all the blame. Look at the garbage fire right here, he adds, pointing toward a thick cloud of acrid smoke across the street. And what about the 20 and 25-year-old cars that drive on the roads of Delhi?
The wantaway Delhiite
Pavika Bakshi has swallowed live fish and drunk the waters of a healing stream in search of something to stop her wheezing. Aside from medication, the only thing that helps, she says, is yoga.
It wont be enough to keep her in New Delhi, though. Bakshis parents are searching for a husband for her, and she has told them to look beyond the city.
It could be outside India, it could be in India around the coastline, she says, perched on a chair in a quiet room at the yoga school where she practices. Anywhere I feel better.
Its not a happy situation to be in, because this is my city and I absolutely love it  but I wish it was minus this huge baggage. I keep asking my mother all the time, Why are we a part of this place? Why are we here? Can we not leave?
Bakshi, 32, says she feels well whenever she goes abroad, so is certain it is Delhis air that makes her chest grow tight and her breathing raspy. You come back glowing, because you are healthier, she says. But soon after returning, there is no energy and you are lifeless and you are dull.
Her friends talk all the time about leaving, says Bakshi, who has long, dark hair and a sparkling stud in her nose. Weve all been in good jobs, we are making good money here, but what am I supposed to do with that money? she says. It cant buy me clean air.

Dirty air, and the death and illness it causes, have become front-page news in India. Government ministers and the courts are taking heed, announcing a bevy of measures  from fines for burning garbage to coal-fired power plant upgrades. But many doubt the rules will be enforced.
At one level, Im confident that something will happen now, because the public outrage over this rising pollution is at such a pitch that a government cannot ignore it altogether, says Arindam Sen Gupta , executive editor of the Times of India. But how effective this plan will be is a matter of speculation.
I dont think theres a cohesive vision  we work in fits and starts. When the problem becomes acute, we wake up to it and then emergency measures are taken. Its usually pressure from below which works in India, from the people.

Before the sun rises over the East Coast Road south of Chennai each day, a lone rider speeds down the tarmac. Dressed in a fluorescent jersey and cycling shoes with a srichurnam  a red line of lime and turmeric paste  on his forehead, Ramanujar Moulana has followed exactly the same route every day for the past four decades  until now. For the past few weeks theres been a new stop on his agenda: Indias first cycle cafe.
Nestled in Kotturpuram, a plush neighbourhood in the south of Tamil Nadus state capital, is the Ciclo Cafe . It boasts a cycle spa, where riders can watch their bike get washed while they drink their coffee, a reading area stocked with books on cycling, and decor fashioned from bike parts  cycle-chain chandeliers and table legs made from front forks. A retail zone showcases high-end brands like Bianchi, Cannondale, Mongoose and Schwinn.
There is more to Chennai than ancient temples, Carnatic music and filter coffee, says Nidhi Kapoor Thadani, the co-founder of the cafe, who was partly inspired after a visit to Look Mum No Hands! in Shoreditch, east London. Thanks to the many recreational cycling clubs in Chennai the city has a strong cycling culture.
I gave up cycling in the late 80s. As the city grew, so did pollution, and cycling was pass

Cycling has been a part of Chennai since the colonial period, when many British officers used bikes as their main mode of city transport. Nowadays, at least 37% of Chennai households own a bike, according to the Energy and Resources Institute; yet there is little in the way of local provision for cyclists and the city remains without a single urban bike lane.
Ciclo Cafe customer and longtime Chennai resident Mithra Massillamoney remembers that 1970s Madras, as the city was known until 1996, was friendlier to cyclists. I used to ride a cycle to work every day in the mid 70s. Madras wasnt so crowded back then. But I gave up cycling in the late 80s  as the city grew, so did pollution, and cycle was pass  motorbikes and cars were in.
Mithra wasnt alone. Cycling dropped significantly through the 1980s and 90s, as the city became known as the  Detroit of India  for its burgeoning motor industry  international companies including Hyundai, Renault, Bosch, Ford and BMW have factories in the area.
Since 1949, Chennai has also been home to manufacturing by TI Cycles  one of Indias big four bike-makers alongside Hero, Atlas and Avon, who together account for 90% of the 16m bicycles sold in the country every year. Yet, while India ranks among the worlds top bicycle manufactures, bikes lack the status of cars or motorcycles.
While Chennai doesnt have any cycle infrastructure, cities such as Delhi have built some bike paths. I definitely dont think Indian cities provide facilities for cyclists, says prominent environmentalist Sunita Narain, who suffered multiple fractures when she was hit by a reversing car in Delhi two years ago.

In fact, we are going in the opposite direction. We dont see cyclists on the road. Urban planners consider them invisible people. The entire planning objective of the government is to widen the road to accommodate cars and even when cycling tracks are constructed in places like Delhi, they are not continuous and only cover a very small part of the city.
Data shows that the most vulnerable road users are cyclists and pedestrians. Our cities need cycle tracks and we need to increase penalties for those responsible for road accidents, and increase camera surveillance to investigate when somebody is hit. This is why the upcoming Road Transport and Safety Bill must look at the safety of cyclists.
The urban decay started in the late 1970s and continues today, adds Jasbir Singh, co-founder of Pedal Yatri, a recreational cycle group based in Gurgaon near Delhi. In the 1960s and 70s, every Biswajeet or Rajesh Khanna movie seemed to have at least one musical number featuring a group of happy girls cycling blissfully along, but in the name of urbanisation many switched to 100cc motorbikes and the bicycle was left to the economically needy, he explains. Given a choice, even the poorest people will not ride a bike because of safety concerns, and because they want to grow up in life.
Jasbir does believe that is changing, though, thanks to a handful of lifestyle and health conscious individuals.

In Chennai, a growing number of recreational cycling groups  the Tamilnadu Cycling Club, Madras Randonneurs and Chain Reaxion among them  are building on that heritage. At the forefront are the Cycling Yogis, founded by Ramanujar Moulana, whose 2,000 members take part in organised rides to heritage sites in the city.
He hopes Ciclo Cafe can help raise awareness about cycling as a viable mode of transport by, for example, profiling residents who bike-commute in the pages of the menu and organising rides for customers. If the cafe can stir the interest of non-cyclists about cycling, he says, it is definitely a good addition to the city.

        <title>Cape Town's death industry: 'If you’re buried here, it’s ​​as if they threw you away'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/23/cape-town-south-africa-death-graves-xhosa-buried-eastern-cape</Link>

One recent Friday night just outside Cape Town , I sat on the side of the N1 highway and counted dead bodies. Kombi vans pulling coffins on trailers were converging at a tunnel that cuts through the mountains. Some call this the border between the city and the Other Side: the Eastern Cape, the rural heartland of the Xhosa people where hills are dotted with colourfully painted mud huts and pastures are grazed by sheep, goats and cattle.
Many Xhosas leave the family homestead to work in Cape Town. They make up the vast majority of this South African citys black population and spend most, if not all, of their lives there. But few want to spend their afterlives there too. So, every weekend, the reverse migration of the dead begins. Over the span of four hours, I counted 196 coffins.
The UNs Population Division estimates that, by 2050, nearly 80% of South Africas population will live in cities . But, among the Xhosa, this rapid increase in urbanisation is happening at the same time as a fierce reclamation of their connection to the old soil. They cinch that commitment with their bones. And its not just the newly dead who are being brought home. Those who have been buried in Cape Town for decades are finding their way back to the Eastern Cape, too.
Bukelwa Fortuin, 26, works just outside the city for First National Bank and lives in Site B of Khayelitsha, Cape Towns largest township. A few months ago, she started dreaming of her dead mother, who had been buried in Cape Town nearly 20 years earlier. Fortuin dreamed the same dream six times, and couldnt get her mother out of her head.
These drives can be perilous and they are expensive, too: the transport alone can cost upwards of $1,000

Every time she passed the cemetery where her mother was buried, she would cry. She would cry at other times out of the blue, and had a few strange experiences  such as the time she beat up a guy who was being disrespectful to an old lady at a taxi rank. When Fortuin eventually sought the guidance of a sangoma healer, she was told that her mother was trying to show she didnt want to be buried in Cape Town. She wanted to go home.
Fortuin talked to some Xhosa elders. They suggested she go to the grave to speak to her mothers spirit and try to bring it back to the Eastern Cape. No, she told them, I think she wants to be exhumed.
Fortuin talked to her father, Griffith, about the possibility of digging up her mothers bones and bringing them home. He explained that he hadnt originally wanted to bury her in Cape Town but wasnt working at the time, so had had no other choice. The regret he felt for burying his wife in the city meant he welcomed the idea of bringing her bones back to the Eastern Cape.
They hired an undertaker, found the death certificate, identified the grave, and planned a second funeral in their village in the Eastern Cape. Funeral policies do not cover exhumations, so the hefty price of the endeavour  around 15,000 rand ($1,300)  came out of their own pockets.
A date was settled on, so that a Cape Town health inspector could be present to prevent any active spores from diseases such as tuberculosis from infecting those unburying the bones. When the day came, Fortuin, her father, the undertaker, the health inspector and a few hired hands went to the graveyard in Maitland . Fortuin watched men with rubber boots, overalls, masks and gloves dig into the dirt.
When the men neared the spot where her mothers bones lay, Bukelwa stepped forward without saying a word. She clambered into the grave, plucked each bone out of the soil with her bare hands, and placed them in a pile on the ground. When she climbed out of the grave, she put the bones inside a new coffin. She didnt want one piece of her mother left in Cape Town.

In the latter half of the 19th century, once diamonds and then gold had been discovered in South Africa, men from all over the region began leaving their rural homelands in search of employment. Between 1871 and 1875, as many as 80,000 Africans worked in the diamond fields each year. Plenty of challenges came with being uprooted: the dangers of working the mines, the horrors of the living conditions, the distance from home. But nothing was as horrible as the idea of being buried in foreign soil.
Miners did all they could to avoid dying far away from home. The academic Tshidiso Maloka describes how, at one diamond mine in the Orange Free State , each Mosotho migrant contributed three pence a month to create a fund that would help the sick return home . These mutual aid funds became common among African miners, and are the basis for the burial societies still common in South Africa today.
These days, of course, its not just miners who live far from home. Families are spread out across the country, but amid this spatial dispersion, the fear of dying far from their point of origin has remained . It is now the reason for a growing industry that transports the dead across South Africa  an industry I came across while living on the Other Side in the small city of King Williams Town, whose streets seemed to boast more funeral parlours than convenience stores. You could buy funeral insurance there in drugstores, at the bank, or even via SMS.
Every Saturday, huge tents housing suit-clad men and dressed-up women would spring up throughout the surrounding countryside; the demand for burials in that much-loved soil came from both near and far. Many of the funeral ceremonies were for people who hadnt lived in the region in years  or, in the case of a growing generation of young Capetonians, who had never lived there at all.
A few months later, I began hanging out in the townships of Cape Town, where most of the citys Xhosa population now resides. I wandered from shack to shack, asking the people I met, Where do you want to be buried?
For bodies to make the journey to the Eastern Cape they have to be embalmed, which happens at the mortuary

People often chuckled at my forwardness and desire to talk about death so soon after meeting them  but almost everyone answered without hesitation: the Eastern Cape. People knew where they lived (the city), they knew why (to work), and they knew where their true home remained (the Other Side).
In one shack on a sandy road in Khayelitsha, a group of young people answered in unison that they all wanted to be buried in the Eastern Cape. Our great grandparents come from there, said Lwazi Lwasi, a young man in a striped collared shirt. Why would we be buried in the sand when theres proper soil back home?
If youre buried here, its as if they threw you away, said Vikela Qinga, a young woman with a floral T-shirt and grey leggings.
Siyabulela Duna, a tall man standing in the open doorway, shook his head at the idea of being buried in Cape Town. Not here, not here, he said. I dont belong here. I am a visitor here. Duna, like most of the young people present that day, was born and raised in Cape Town.
I turned to the others in the room, and asked if they felt like visitors here, too. All of them nodded. Im only here for a job, Mzyanda Mseleni said. I dont belong here. I belong in the Eastern Cape.

Mourners sing at a Khayelitsha funeral
Cape Towns funeral industry has responded to this hankering for home by modernising, and commercialising, the movement of dead bodies across what the academic Rebekah Lee calls the  rural-urban nexus . After someone in Cape Town dies, their family hires an undertaker. The undertaker takes care of the logistics: getting the body to a mortuary, organising the death certificate, helping the family pick out a coffin.
For years most undertakers were white, but once black entrepreneurs took over in the scene in the townships, they became cultural mediators and technological innovators. Unlike white undertakers, who may not have understood the desire to exhume bones or transport a body to a different location, Xhosa undertakers knew precisely why families wanted these things, and could advise customers accordingly.
For bodies to make the journey to the Eastern Cape they have to be embalmed, which happens at the mortuary. Embalming involves injecting a body with a carcinogen so that it doesnt rot, a practice that took hold in the United States during the Civil War, when northern families had their dead loved ones brought home from the south.
Most funerals happen on a Saturday so, come Friday night, there is one last service in the city. The undertaker takes the body from the morgue, puts it in a coffin, loads the coffin into the back of his car  most use old station wagons  and then drives it over to the familys house for the service.
After the service is over, usually around 7pm, the coffin is packed into a trailer and surrounded by clothes so it doesnt budge or shake on the 12-hour drive back to the Eastern Cape. Before family and friends crowd into the kombi pulling the trailer, one family member speaks to the body, telling the deceased that they are going home, and asking them for a safe journey on the way there.
These drives can be perilous  accidents en route to funerals have been dubbed  twice deaths   and they are expensive: transport alone can cost 10,000 rand (upwards of $1,000). But many Xhosa believe that, if you dont pay for a body to leave Cape Town immediately after death, youll only pay more later by organising an exhumation, as Fortuin and her father did.

According to the official census, 391,749 people lived in the Khayelitsha township in 2011, although many estimate that the population is larger. The township is a recent development; while Cape Towns growth accelerated with the boom of gold and diamonds at the turn of the 20th century, pass laws were put in place to keep the city segregated  including the Natives (Urban Areas) act of 1923 , which made all cities in South Africa white, and forced all black African men in cities to carry around passes. Those found without this permit would be arrested and sent back to a rural area.
When the National Party was elected in 1948, this geography of exclusion turned rigid with the implementation of apartheid. Within the city, the Group Areas act began to be enforced, which meant separating races into their own areas in what had been, for some 300 years, a mixed city. In neighbourhoods such as District Six, which was deemed a white area in 1966, many people were forced to leave their homes.
During this time, measures were also taken for influx control to keep Africans out of the cities and in their Bantu homelands  rural areas designated to different ethnic groups, some of which were separate nations until the end of apartheid.
Yet, despite all of these efforts at containment, by 1980 Greater Cape Towns population was nearly 1.9 million people. Pass laws were repealed six years later, and the city, especially the townships, experienced a whole new influx, which brought what is now Khayelitsha into being.

Noluthando Kapa (second left) and friends in Khayelitsha reminisce about home
The South African author Rian Malan described it thus:  It was as if a distant dam had broken , allowing a mass of desperate and hopeful humanity to come flooding over the mountains and spread out across the Cape Flats. They came at the rate of 80, 90 families a day, and built homes with their bare hands, using wooden poles, tin sheeting, bits and pieces of trash rescued from landfills and plastic garbage bags to keep out the rain. Within two years, the sand dunes had vanished under an enormous sea of shacks and shanties, as densely packed as a medieval city.
More than 20 years after democracy, the spatial separation and the sea of shacks and shanties remain: 99% of Khayelitsha residents are black Africans. Life in the township has its perks  cheap transportation, the possibility of work, young people to pass the time with. But, over and over, when I mentioned the idea of being buried in town, people here shuddered.
The watery ground of Cape Town is one of the most common reasons people say they dont want to be buried in the city. Most dwellings in Khayelitsha lie within the floodplain of the Kuils River, where the sand doesnt drain well. When the winter rains come, Khayelitsha floods. One study found that more than 81% of households in one section of the township always flood, and 11% of households sometimes flood. Another found that, during three winters in the late 2000s, between 32,000 and 34,400 people were displaced from informal settlements in Cape Town each year as a result of flooding.
This water is troubling in life  wiping out houses, spreading disease, forcing people to move  and in death, too. When Khayelitsha floods, so do its graves. As Lee notes in her article Death on the Move , a 2003 metropolitan cemetery study in Cape Town identified a looming cemetery crisis, with 16 of the 31 municipal cemeteries  subject to high water table conditions for up to six months of the year.
One afternoon, I talked with a group of women in a shack in Khayelitsha. One of them was an older woman named Noluthando Kapa. She moved to Cape Town more than 20 years ago, but laughed when I asked where her home was, and scoffed at the idea of being buried anywhere but the Eastern Cape.
How can we be buried in town? Be buried here and swim in the water? Water comes up to here, she said, pointing to her neck. When we die ,we need to sleep peacefully and rest, not drown. How can we die so many times?
When we die, we need to sleep peacefully and rest, not drown. How can we die so many times?

At 11pm on a recent Friday night, having counted 196 coffin-toting kombis, I stopped keeping tally and returned to Cape Town. On the ride back, I kept seeing the kombi vans zooming past on the other side of the highway: an ongoing procession of the homeward bound. People say the same thing happens during the holidays, only with more intensity: kombis full of Xhosa people bottleneck at the tunnel of the N1 highway, lining up to pay the tolls, lining up to go home.
In Marilynne Robinsons novel Gilead , a dying father writes a letter to his son. They live in a small town in Iowa that everyone, it seems, wants to leave in favour of the big city. The father writes, This whole town does look like whatever hope becomes after it begins to weary a little, then weary a little more. But hope deferred is still hope. I love this town. I think sometimes of going into the ground here as a last wild gesture of love  I, too, will smoulder away the time until the great and general incandescence.
For now, the midnight march of vans on Friday nights, from the big city back to the Eastern Cape, is a last wild gesture of love; an enduring gift for an unforgotten home.

Sound of the city
Trams have been crisscrossing Sofia since 1901. By the look of them, you might think theyre the same ones (they are mostly old, yellow and clanking). Recently some tram lines have completely closed because of our two expanding metro lines, but downtown and in neighbourhoods such as Krasno Selo, the rumble of the old trams remains a steady part of the citys soundtrack. Its not exactly romantic, but there is a certain old-world charm to it.
Best current venue

Anything outdoors; Swimming Pool was an instant hit. Sofias latest space for contemporary art is located in a charming pre-war rooftop apartment with a mind-blowing 360-degree view of the city, and a real  albeit non-functioning  swimming pool.
The latter serves as a blue cube to host artistic projects and performances twice a year. The first exhibition, Balconia, was curated by Swimming Pool founder Viktoria Draganova.
Whos top of the playlist?
A true poet and master of social satire, Itzo Hazarta is not a new kid on the block. The founder and frontman of Bulgarias all-time favourite hip-hop group, Upsurt, has been around for more than 15 years now. Singing strictly in Sofia dialect, Upsurt achieved cult status thanks to their razor-sharp, hysterical and completely untranslatable lyrics referencing Bulgarian culture, current affairs and daily life. These days Itzo Hazarta continues in the same vein, but solo.
Best local artist
With a physics degree, a job in IT and school friends who were imprisoned or shot, Svetozar Georgiev  AKA ghostdog  is not your average poet. His poems are a unique blend of rhythm and slang, self-deprecation, humour and sensitivity. His plays, on the other hand, ponder existential matters such as the phases of post-breakup recovery, what office culture might be like in purgatory and the inner life of a Russian cosmonauts wife, with the characters ranging from Homer to Tupac Shakur, Darth Vader to Alan Turing.
The look on the street

Sofia is not fashion-forward and you will rarely see avant garde or eccentric characters, but looks vary greatly, from chalga (a popular music genre based on Balkan rhythms, associated with simple lyrics and provocative clothes) to sporty and from hippy to hipster. Many women will only step out in full make-up and high heels. On the other hand, the cultural and creative communities take it easy in that understated, dressed-down Berlin way (a city some people say Sofia reminds them of). Western brands such as H&amp;M and Zara prevail, mixed and matched with secondhand finds. Lately a number of original Bulgarian designer brands have cropped up  Shevitza for scarves, Serendipity for jewels, Bogdanin Brothers for leather bags, 45 Street for hats, and Garderob , Sassa Bjorg and Knapp for clothes.
Comedy gold
The latest comedy hit is actually a staged multimedia sequel of a cult TV show. Aired between 1992 and 2004, the much-loved political cabaret Ulitsata (The Street) was based on brilliant improvisations and sketches about the life of small people after the fall of communism. A whole generation grew up with it, memorising lines from the show. Twenty years later, director Tedi Moskovs swan song did not disappoint loyal fans.
The best cultural Instagram
Boyscout is an online magazine, created originally as a guide for young men with good manners, but it has found a wider audience hungry for cultural media in a market where the only magazines are the Cosmos and the Playboys. Boyscouts weekly selection of popular culture is solid, stylish and diverse, covering music, fashion, design, events and arts both from the local scene and internationally.
Whats the big talking point?

Monuments are always controversial in Bulgaria (we are still processing parts of our past), but three weeks ago the newly erected Bulgarian Tsar Samuils monument in central Sofia prompted a fierce war of words . Academics and intellectuals criticised the tacky glow-in-the-dark eyes, setting off a number of internet memes on the monuments relation to Darth Vader. The pro camp said the critics were being unpatriotic and pretentious. The state failed to act and now the monument is there  not to honour Tsar Samuil, but as symbol of our societys deficiencies.
Moment in history?
While in 2012 the joke went that Greek protesters carried banners reading, Keep quiet, dont wake up the Bulgarians, in 2013 our civil society finally did wake up, and went out on the street to protest the governments nepotism and corruption. The protests were accompanied by artistic performances and a spirit of hope that something was happening. The legacy is still debated (the government did change, but not as a direct result), but one thing the protests are credited for is shaking civil society out of its coma.

An artistic take on the cyrillic alphabet, 30bukvi (30 Letters) is a project by Bulgarian graphic designer Georgi Georgiev. He printed his visual interpretation of the cyrillic on ceramic tiles and then secretly plastered them on to the streets of Sofia the night before 24 May last year (Bulgarian Education and Culture, and Slavonic Literature Day). The project was a bid to celebrate the alphabet as a part of the nations identity.

Will Google's $5m plan make cycling in the rest of Silicon Valley easier?
Cycling is safe and easy inside the search giants Mountain View HQ, but getting to the site from elsewhere in Silicon Valley means crossing fast-moving expressways and busy train tracks. Is Googles new bike plan the answer?

Inside the Googleplex  the tech giants headquarters in Mountain View, California  hundreds of multi-coloured bikes are scattered around. With bright yellow frames and big blue and green rubber tires, theyre seemingly everywhere  clustered at the edges of parking lots, lined near building entrances, or clumsily toppled over into the office park landscaping. The bikes make it easy for Googles employees to move between its many office buildings, spread over roughly two miles of land at the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay in a neighbourhood known as North Bayshore. Inside the Googleplex, biking is safe and easy.
Outside the Googleplex, not so much.
Getting to and from North Bayshore is not exactly pleasant, says Shiloh Ballard, executive director of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition. The neighbourhood is on the other side of a highway from most of the rest of Silicon Valley, and a bike ride to the Googleplex would typically involve crossing busy train tracks, navigating arterial roads with high speed limits and braving the valleys expressway system that has essentially turned many surface streets into mini freeways.
Ballards group is one of many that have become concerned about how people can bike from the residential areas of Silicon Valley to North Bayshore, where Google , Microsoft, LinkedIn and dozens of other companies are located. And, since the city of Mountain View recently made available more than 2.2 million square feet of commercial construction rights in North Bayshore, even more people will be heading to the area in the near future.

In an effort to improve the bicycle commute to North Bayshore, Google set out to rethink the areas bicycle infrastructure network. Working with the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition, the company commissioned an urban planning consultancy, Alta Planning + Design, to look not only at the area immediately surrounding the Googleplex, but at each of the cities in the general vicinity. The goal was to envision a bike network that would help people get from their homes to the tech offices in North Bayshore, but also for the entire community to have better bike access. The result is the recently released Bike Vision Plan for North Santa Clara County . The plan outlines a potential future for the area that moves away from its suburban office park present towards a Copenhagen-like future of bikeable streets and interconnected neighbourhoods.
The plan moves away from the suburban office park present towards a Copenhagen-like future
Such a transition may be more vision than plan, but Google has already engendered a vibrant bicycling ethos in the valley, at least among its own employees. Roughly 9% of Google employees living in the cities immediately surrounding its headquarters commute by bike. Within a 9-mile radius of the office, 21% are bike commuters.
To bump that number even higher, and to grow overall bicycle commuting in the valley, Googles vision focuses on expanding the existing bicycle infrastructure in the area and targeting what it calls high-stress streets  streets where speed limits are 35 miles per hour or more. By adding strategic infrastructure like protected cycle tracks, multi-use paths and buffered bike lanes, the plan envisions a low-stress bike system that covers 277 miles of roadway in the area, up from 87 miles today. The plan proposes $5m in matching grants that Google will award to cities or other groups in the region who come up with the best ways to start building this system.

But some worry that Googles bicycle vision and a broad swath of other proposed community benefits linked to the companys development plans may be in limbo. In May, the Mountain View city council dashed Googles proposed plans for a 2.5 million square foot project in North Bayshore, approving just 515,000 square feet of the project. The city instead awarded 1.45 million square feet of developable land to LinkedIn. The public benefits package tied to Googles development plan  including affordable housing, infrastructure repairs, new bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and upgrades to two existing multi-use trails  would have been worth upwards of $200m.
The likelihood of the entire plan going forward, thats contingent upon a 2.5 million square foot expansion, says Ballard. We already know they didnt get that, so now its a matter of looking at these different pieces of it and asking whats going to move forward.
Mountain View City Council member Lenny Siegel says the bike vision plan will likely stay on the table. Google seems willing to invest in those benefits even if its not linked to a particular approval, Siegel says.
Google officials were not available to comment.

Siegel says Google can be an important partner for municipalities like Mountain View to kickstart projects like the bike vision plan. But he also notes that the company should take responsibility for some of its impacts on the community.
The rapid growth of Google and LinkedIn and the other companies has created transportation needs, and we have to figure out a way to use the wealth thats been accumulated by those companies to pay to address those needs, Siegel says. And right now, Google is the company thats most willing to do that.
Ballard is hopeful that the bike plan will help Silicon Valley to begin building out a more complete bike infrastructure network, whether to Copenhagen levels or not. And with Googles $5m pledge, she says the plan has a good chance of getting the cities in the area to take action  and to compete with each other to get the matching funds.
The idea here is, look, weve got a pot of money, whos going to do the best job drawing down this money and doing some great bike projects? she says. We can absolutely use peer pressure to get the cities to be doing innovative things.
Though Ballard concedes that $5m is only a small investment in a huge problem, its at least a starting place for cities in Silicon Valley to help spread bikeability beyond the Googleplex.

He was a prophet without imprimatur in his own city. Charles Correa , who passed away late on the night of 16 June, was among the great architects of our times. His institutional buildings across the world are all iconic. Yet, Mumbai, his lifelong home, boasts just one residential tower designed by him  an irony as much as a travesty. Though the cubist Kanchanjunga is eye-catching, its still high-rise: a genre caustically savaged by this patron saint of low-slung architecture.
It gets worse. Correas real passion was the designing of cities that are easy to live, work, play  and commute  in. But his karma was Mumbai, which can check none of these boxes with a straight face. The man who described cities as places of hope was fated to live in a city of disappointments . Its not just because its skyline resembles an alarming ECG. More specifically, Mumbai mindlessly sabotaged two of his masterful plans, each of which would have helped it regain its post-independence swagger as Indias showpiece.
One was his design for New Bombay across the harbour in 1964; the other his masterplan in 1996 for the textile mill-lands in the heart of what had by then been rechristened Mumbai. Ironically, he had been appointed for these visionary tasks by the very politicians who would later subvert them; one with myopic indifference, the other with unmitigated greed.

In a leap of imagination from prevailing wisdom, Correa envisaged a large, independent New Bombay, not a satellite town. He knew that nothing less would do to save a metropolis that was growing at a lethal pace. From 1951 to 61, the citys population had doubled; it would increase by 80.8% in the next decade. The City &amp; Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) was set up to give form to this wowing blueprint drawn up by him, Shirish Patel and Pravin Mehta. New Bombay could accommodate 2.1 million people, happily.
Instead, largely because the state government did not move its offices there as planned, it remained a dormitory town, and not a conducive one because the suburban railway lines were not extended. Correa was wryly vindicated some 40 years later when Mumbai finally burst at the seams, spilling over into Navi Mumbai  where real-estate prices on swanky Palm Beach Avenue now almost rival those on Mumbais art-deco Marine Drive.
The mill-lands, meanwhile, have turned into a nightmarish Gotham in a much, much shorter time. Before our eyes, chimneys give way to giant cranes: midwives delivering massive housing and residential complexes, whose hyperventilating billboards blithely ignore the antiquated civic utilities underneath.
By the time he died at 84, Correa had long been a disillusioned man
Correa may or may not have got smug satisfaction from this urban morass. His commissioned plan was a living, breathing document, developed along transit lines and integrating commerce, culture and ease of living. His canvas had been the open land which had fallen into decay after the fatal textile strike of 1982 , and which, after protracted legal wrangling over workers dues, was then opened up for development.
But with a rapacious sleight-of-hand, the relevant rule was reworded overnight: open land was redefined, and the promised 166 acres for public use shrivelled to a scandalous 32. Mill-owners and builders made a killing on the rest; the same can be said for much of Mumbai.

Correas sheer genius excused his arrogance. He worked with a manic stillness, and was caustically impatient with journalists unable to convey his nuanced urban vision  this writer included. I also still blush over a 2013 incident, when I invited him to launch my book on Mumbai at the Times Litfest . He adamantly refused at first, dredging up some long-ago lapse, then relented  only to lambast me from the stage for a bigger crime. I was the festival director, and our 11th-hour sponsor was exactly the kind of developer he routinely slammed for the citys destruction.
By the time he died at 84, Correa had long been a disillusioned man , compensating for the rampaging skyline at home with the accolades and commissions abroad he continued to execute. Ahmedabad-based Balkrishna Doshi, a believer in the same principles of architecture and planning for 60 years  and best man at Correas wedding  said he was overwhelmed by the new project plans his friend showed him on a recent visit. These included an extension for his awesome Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown : a research and treatment facility for neurosciences and cancer built on almost the same spot on Lisbons river Tigus from which Vasco da Gama sailed out on another voyage of discovery, five centuries ago. (Doshi also recalled how Correa would play Those were the days, my friend every time he visited him.)

Correas wife Monika is an accomplished art-weaver; his son-in-law, Rahul Mehrotra , also a globally acclaimed architect and planner. Monika and Charles were a striking couple for almost half a century on the citys cultural landscape  and the familiar faces of the cognoscenti that still holds on to the idea of Bombay were all there at the funeral mass this morning.
But there was much of Mumbai too  both students and unknown admirers. They gathered, undeterred by the unrelenting monsoon squall, in Salvacao Church : Correas expansive creation in congested Dadar, with its distinctive roof and circular, stained-glass window. From his signature mastery of light and space, Charles Correa departed from the city he tried to save  and which is paying the price of its greedy disobedience.

        <title>Epicentre of the Great Recession: what happened to Cleveland's Slavic Village?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/18/epicentre-great-recession-cleveland-slavic-village-foreclosure</Link>
        <Description/>

When Anthony Trzaska hears the words Slavic Village in news reports, he knows what is coming next. Its almost like when the media reports anything on Slavic Village, its followed with: Comma, where the foreclosure crisis in America started, says the 31-year-old resident. Its not like the foreclosure mess didnt happen. But it didnt just happen here.
Clevelands Slavic Village is widely perceived as the epicentre of the Great Recession . In 2007, when the media finally realised that the housing bubble was bursting wide open (about two years after 48 states had sued subprime lender Ameriquest for fraudulent loan practices), a few journalists decided to run some zip codes to see where the most foreclosures were happening.
The zip code 44105 popped up at the top of the list . And with that, the great international financial crisis of the 21st century was centred in an old neighbourhood in Cleveland, Ohio  one that had been declining since the 1970s. At the time, few reported that foreclosures were also hitting cities like Miami, Las Vegas, Detroit and Phoenix far worse than Cleveland. Instead, some claimed that what was happening on Fleet Avenue, home to Polish sausage makers, was influencing the International Monetary Fund s economic policy.

But what happened in Slavic Village  about five miles south of downtown Cleveland, on the eastern edge of the industrial valley  was symptomatic of greater issues across the cities of the American rust belt. For decades, old neighbourhoods had lost their economic reason for being; their factories were closing, their populations rapidly declining. They had too much housing in very poor condition, high poverty, high crime and little outside investment. When the housing crisis hit, many of the houses were abandoned, boarded up and left to rot.
After 50 years of decline, however, Slavic Village  named after the Polish and Czech immigrants who once settled there, with a current population of 22,000 that is now about half black and half white  is trying to crawl out of the wreckage. Never hip or trendy, it was, nevertheless, once the biggest retail district in Cleveland outside of downtown.

Trzaska is working to bring that back. The property developer is a native: his family still operates a funeral home in Slavic Village. Now he is buying up property to market to small businesses. The focus is on Fleet Avenue, which is currently being torn up as part of a $9m renovation project to be completed this year. His firm, Sonny Day Development , is hoping to encourage small businesses to take root in the old neighbourhood, with retail on street level and housing above  an old model that has fallen out of favour.
Slavic Village is playing the cards it has been dealt, Trzaska says. But I can see millennials approaching [local life] more in the way our grandparents did. Its not just that they want things close together  their work and social life, and stores they support  but they want to be a part of a neighbourhood. They didnt have that growing up in the suburbs.
The neighbourhood has a lot of natural advantages: it is 10 minutes from downtown, with solid housing stock. And part of the reason for Slavic Villages success in the fight against blight is the Slavic Village Recovery project . The private, for-profit entity has succeeded in fixing up decent, affordable housing for sale on the market  and has found that bypassing government subsidies to do so can actually make the houses cheaper.
The company is run by Robert Klein, CEO of Safeguard Properties, which manages foreclosed properties for banks. Klein, 62, knew from experience that banks just want to get rid of abandoned properties. But government regulations for non-profits trying to fix up foreclosed homes made the process too expensive  in short, taking public money meant you had to fix up homes too nicely.
We find we can do the basic refurbishments for about $40,000 to $50,000 and then sell a three-bedroom, 1,200 sq ft home for about $65,000, he says. We can make a small profit of about $7,000 on the house, and then put that money into doing more houses. We dont take a cent in public money.

Taking public money can make properties difficult to finance through bank lending. For example, to be eligible for tax breaks and other funding grants in Cleveland, a property must meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards: green regulations that exceed what is required by the Cleveland city building code. Meeting LEED can often require tearing all walls down to the studs  an expensive prospect. Third-party contractors must also supervise and certify parts of the refurbishment, which can further drive up costs. The difference can be big: about $100,000 total cost for a home certified under LEED guidelines versus about $60,000 for one that meets city building codes. Banks are less willing to lend $100,000 for a house with LEED certification in a neighbourhood where comparable homes are selling for $40,000, but will be more willing to loan up to $65,000 for a renovated home in that same neighbourhood that meets city building codes.
Because Slavic Village Recovery does not meet the full government green standards, its houses are not eligible for the citys 10-year tax abatement for refurbished houses. But, even without the tax break, the average monthly mortgage payment for a $65,000 refurb in Slavic Village comes in at about $450  whereas for a $100,000 home it would be $625, even after the $100 tax break.
It is pretty simple, Klein says. We can get people into a three-bedroom house in a neighbourhood that is coming back for less than most rentals in the area. And the buyers are not getting tax breaks, so the city isnt getting shorted, either. We found the government programmes were very slow, and didnt really help the neighbourhood much because it was one property here and another there. We work with the community development corporation to pick out houses we want to do, and try to concentrate on one neighbourhood first before we move on to other streets.
The community development corporation performs a sort of triage on the neighbourhood: those houses that dont make the grade are slated for demolition. About 150 homes  two-thirds of the ones theyve assessed so far  have been demolished in the past two years. These are usually houses with structural issues, especially ones that have been gutted by thieves stealing plumbing pipes and kitchen and bathroom fixtures.

This month, after two years of operation, the Slavic Village Recovery project will celebrate its 25th homebuyer. Another eight are under contract, with 30 houses total in the inventory and about 10 in the process of refurbishment. Klein says he has heard from other communities  in Columbus, Chicago and Atlanta  who want to do what Slavic Village is doing. Getting rid of blight isnt as complicated as it is made out to be, Klein says.
Eight years since it was written off, the housing market in Slavic Village seems to be on the up. Owning a three-bedroom home, 10 minutes from downtown, has practical market value. And retail follows rooftops that have people underneath them  shops and housing are each one half of an equation, both dependent on the other. Im pretty optimistic the worst is over for Slavic Village,says Trzaska. This neighbourhood has value, and thats what it was based on historically. Im seeing people realise that part of it once again.

        <title>Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/26/albania-battle-against-corruption-organised-crime</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
In Albania , corruption has long been part of everyday life. People talk of taking a loved one to hospital and having to pay the doctor to get the best treatment, or of going to a property registration office and being asked to pay an extra fee to speed things up.
This culture of bribery has not only kept societys most vulnerable from accessing vital services but has also damaged Albanias international image. In a 2011 study , the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said Albanian citizens ranked corruption as the second most important problem after unemployment.
Since emerging from the decades-long dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, who turned Albania into one of the worlds most isolated states, the Balkan country of 2.8 million people has struggled to deal with corruption and organised crime.
When he took office in 2013, Prime Minister Edi Rama, the one-time flamboyant mayor who oversaw the repainting of Tiranas communist-era grey buildings, made it a priority to tackle corruption and improve Albanias international standing.
The centre-left coalition governments reforms have focused on improving administrative systems, enforcing the rule of law, and making it easier for people to report corruption.
Last February, the government launched an online anti-corruption portal to allow citizens to anonymously record instances of unscrupulous practices. The website covers 12 key areas, including police, health and customs.
Since then, 6,840 reports have been logged . Many of these involve complaints about poor service, but 777 cases directly relate to accusations of corruption, with 35 reports referred to prosecutors.
Rama insists Albanias poor international reputation is based on exaggerated stereotypes rather than reality, but admits that combating corruption is key to changing perceptions. To improve the image of a country, first you have to change the country itself, he said. I believe corruption becomes the alternative when a government is not able to serve its citizens in a transparent and efficient way. So we have to modernise, and modernisation is about reforms.
Another anti-corruption programme involves text messages being sent to citizens to ask whether they had to pay a bribe when receiving treatment at state-run hospitals.
The scheme, run by the ministry of state for local issues and anti-corruption, and supported by the World Bank , was launched in March and has reached more than 33,000 people, about 20% of whom have provided feedback.
The doctors are always late and the corruption continues as always. Without giving away money, no one takes care of you, said one person. Another person, who had gone to a hospital in the city of Durres, was more positive: I have been in hospital before, but this time you could feel the change. No one asked for a bribe.
The World Bank has previously supported a similar programme in Pakistan.
Low trust in government leads not only to informal means of obtaining services and less willingness to pay taxes, it also leads to lower resources for the government to provide public services, thus completing a vicious cycle of mistrust and corruption, Jana Kunicova and Zubair Bhatti, public sector experts at the World Bank, wrote in a blog . By proactively collecting citizen feedback and using it for management actions, this vicious cycle can be broken.
In its 2011 survey , the UNODC said on average 28.3% of Albanians aged between 18 and 64 had been exposed, either directly or indirectly, to a bribery experience with a public official in the previous year. But it noted that about 30% of bribes paid were actually offered by citizens themselves.
Albania, which ranks 110th out of 175 countries in Transparency Internationals 2014 corruption perceptions index, joins a list of other countries using the internet to crack down on corruption , either through naming and shaming or by bringing bribery and other corrupt practices into the open.
The UN Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting Albanias anti-corruption drive. The country, which was given a ninth millennium development goal on good governance, is now piloting the governance indicator of the new sustainable development goals , which will frame development priorities until 2030.

Between June and December 2014, the project focused on identifying indicators relevant to Albania. The second phase, which ends in September, will implement systems to measure the indicators.
The UNDP says Albania recognises that reforms in good governance are essential if the country wants to achieve European Union membership. Many Albanians are optimistic that acceptance last year as an official membership candidate signals a new start for the former communist country.
The governance indicators are very important for Albanias EU integration and for strengthening the rule of law, said the UNs resident coordinator, Zineb Touimi-Benjelloun. Controlling corruption and improving good governance remain a challenge here, but being a pilot country has proved to serve as a catalyst for the government to set up appropriate systems and improve service delivery.
After the first phase of the pilot, about 20 indicators were proposed and grouped into three target areas: improvement in governance to meet EU standards by 2030; better service delivery, with a focus on water, electricity and land; and improved economic performance, using foreign direct investment as a measure.
Rama believes his government is moving in the right direction. Albania suffered for many years from lack of reforms and badly made policies, he said. We have shown we can make positive changes but, of course, we have not solved all the countrys problems yet. Every month, we have something important scheduled to happen and, less than two years in, we are definitely where I hoped we would be.

With the endgame nearing for the sustainable development agenda, leaders must commit to helping those worst affected by poverty and discrimination

When heads of state sign an international agreement on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in September, the document is likely to include a promise to leave no one behind.
The principle will be one of the most important in the entire agreement. Implemented properly, it will take the world beyond business as usual, marking an important difference between the existing millennium development goals and the new SDGs.

But if countries make impressive overall progress towards the goals while people suffering the worst poverty and discrimination see little or no change, then the whole project will arguably have failed.
So as negotiators resume talks on the SDGs in New York this week, they should push for an agreement that enshrines the principle of leaving no one behind in the outcome document. The concept has obvious appeal. Not only is it a prerequisite for ending extreme poverty by 2030, it can also be applied in every country, rich and poor alike.
Nonetheless, some are sceptical about the idea. It does not address the pressing issues of global wealth concentration and international inequality. Moreover, making it a reality will involve hard work. Addressing entrenched poverty and discrimination will require finance, including international funding , and the political will to make difficult decisions.
Governments around the world will have to integrate the idea into their own policy and planning and may have to contemplate economic, structural and fiscal reforms.
All countries will need to buy into the idea, but if it is to succeed there must be a focus on particular countries, such as least-developed countries, that need additional support.
Once agreement is reached, the hard work will begin. Every country should be required to develop national SDG implementation plans, identifying those people and communities at risk of being forgotten.
These groups may match up with some already listed in the existing post-2015 draft: women and girls, migrant workers and people with disabilities. But there may be other social groups that should be highlighted in national plans  minority groups, indigenous people and those affected by caste-based discrimination, for example.
Country plans should also include interim or mid-term targets. A 15-year timeframe is important for achieving long-term change, but stepping stones are also needed to ensure that the hardest tasks are not deferred.
Christian Aids new briefing on leaving no one behind tries to bring the principle to life, illustrating its global importance and suggesting how governments might start to implement the idea.
The briefing includes some shocking examples of the millions of people left far behind, from a wide range of countries across the world. Ghana, for instance, reduced its income-poverty level from 52% in 1992 to 28.5% in 2006. Yet, while the reduction in the south of the country was 58.66%, in the north it was just 8.87%. Maternal mortality rates are similarly uneven.
Every country should be required to those people and communities at risk of being forgotten
Brazil, meanwhile, despite laudable progress towards reducing income inequality, still has one of the worlds most unequal patterns of land ownership, with 3% of the population owning two-thirds of all arable land. Quilombola people , who are descended from slaves, are at the other end of the spectrum from the big landowners. Only 8% of their 3,000-plus communities in Brazil own the land on which they live, leaving them vulnerable to harm from private interests, such as mining companies, as well as government authorities.
In south Asia, the briefing notes: Poverty is overwhelmingly concentrated among those groups who face discrimination because of who they are and the work they do. Discrimination based on work and descent, associated with the practice of caste, is a root cause of inequality and persistently high levels of poverty  worldwide, it is estimated that 260 million people are affected.
Dalit women are particularly vulnerable, the briefing notes.
The SDGs have the potential to focus policymakers attention on the people who are left behind in their societies. With so many women, men and children so profoundly affected  and with less than 100 days until heads of state meet to finalise the new goals  the challenge of embedding the idea of leaving no one behind in the new development agenda could not be more important or urgent.

        <title>Foreign Office under fire over aid spent on game show and Facebook workshop</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/foreign-office-under-fire-aid-money-facebook-workshop-game-show-hamlet-workshop</Link>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has launched a review of its use of aid money following reports it has spent nearly 300,000 on projects including a TV game show in Ethiopia , a Shakespeare workshop in Ecuador and efforts to find mates for fish off Madagascar .
While the overwhelming majority of the UKs 12bn aid budget is administered and spent by the Department for International Development (DfID) , the Foreign Office was allocated 343m of aid money last year.
On Thursday, the Sun newspaper published a list of projects apparently funded by FCO aid money, ranging from a 7,000 anti-littering campaign in Jordan to a 970 programme designed to promote the safe and responsible use of Facebook in Laos .
According to the Sun, the FCO spent nearly 14,000 on the Ethiopian quiz show as part of its drive to connect with a younger generation of Ethiopians  [and] engage them on UK values of human rights and good governance. A further 5,000 went on Hamlet education workshops in Quito to mark a visit by the Globe theatre in London, claimed the newspaper.

In a box headlined Fish Called Squander, the Sun reported that the department also spent 3,400 trying to help find mates for two endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in London Zoo.
Although the FCO pointed out that the projects in question had cost a total of 278,000  0.08% of its total aid allocation last year  it said the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, had asked for the spending to be investigated.
The foreign secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCOs aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money, said a spokeswoman.
Building closer relationships with growing economies is important. The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show tax-payers cash is being spent wisely.
Some Tory backbenchers attempted to derail the legislative process, with one dismissing it as sop to Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, lentil-eating do-gooders with a misguided guilt complex .
On Sunday, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, suggested that more of Britains aid budget should be spent to discourage mass migration from Africa so that the UK does not have to fish refugees out of the Mediterranean.

International donors led by India and China have pledged approximately $3bn (1.91bn) to rebuild Nepal in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes that hit the country.
Sushil Koirala, the countrys prime minister, vowed zero tolerance of corruption and said all aid money would go to those affected by the disasters.
Nepal says it needs about $6.7bn (4.3bn) to recover from the quakes that occurred in April and May , which killed more than 8,800 people, destroyed nearly half a million houses and left thousands in need of food, clean water and shelter.

At a meeting of foreign donors on Thursday, Indias foreign minister Sushma Swaraj pledged $1bn to finance reconstruction, while China promised 3bn yuan ($483m) in grant assistance.
Nepals two giant neighbours have historically vied for influence in the Himalayan nation, and both were heavily involved in post-quake rescue and relief efforts.
Additional pledges of $600m from the Asian Development Bank , $260m from Japan, $130m from the US, $100m from the EU as well as an earlier announcement of up to $500m from the World Bank means the total assistance pledged now stands at roughly $3bn.
The Nepalese government wants all aid to be channelled through a new state body, raising concerns among some international donors that bureaucracy and poor planning will hamper reconstruction.
Koirala, however, urged delegates to work with us, the government of Nepal and vowed zero tolerance toward corruption.
I assure you that we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the support reaches the intended beneficiaries, he said as he opened the one-day meeting in Kathmandu.
Nepal  one of the worlds poorest countries even before the disaster  desperately needs assistance to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals destroyed or damaged by the earthquakes. .
One in 10 people are homeless and the Himalayan nations already weak economy has been hit hard, with annual growth forecast to fall to just 3%, the lowest in eight years.
But critics say Kathmandu is struggling to lay out a roadmap to recovery.
What is lacking right now is a clear strategy  the government needs to come up with a credible plan to implement reconstruction projects within a stipulated time, Chandan Sapkota, an economist at the Asian Development Banks Nepal office, said ahead of the meeting.
As pledges rolled in, participants said it was crucial to ensure the money was spent well.
Money will be important for building back a more resilient Nepal  but its not just about money, the World Bank president Jim Yong Kim told delegates in a video message. Just as important is how these funds are spent.
The international community pledged several billion dollars in aid to Haiti after a catastrophic earthquake struck the Caribbean nation in January 2010 .
But the pledges yielded little tangible progress as donors delayed implementing projects due to concerns over corruption and political instability, leaving thousands living in temporary shelters five years on.
Follow-up is extremely important  when pledges are made, the government formulates its plans accordingly and if the money doesnt come, it throws everything out of gear, said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the World Health Organisation s regional director for south-east Asia.
We have seen that happen in previous cases with devastating results, so I think we will lose our credibility as members of the donor community if we dont act on our promises, Singh said on the sidelines of the conference.
Dev Ratna Dhakhwa, secretary general of the Nepal Red Cross Society , said earlier he feared Kathmandus one-window policy for reconstruction would obstruct relief efforts, with political parties already trying to manipulate the system to siphon off funds.
People are using political influence to pressure officials and access funds meant for quake victims, by getting their names added to government-managed records, Dhakhwa said.

Ten reasons why European governments should back a global tax body

In a basement under the UN headquarters in New York, the worlds governments are negotiating an agreement that could strengthen the future course of global tax systems. A deal on this could also dramatically contribute to financing poverty eradication and environmental protection, securing development priorities for the next 15 years .
The talks  meant to lead to agreement on how to fund the sustainable development goals  will culminate in a global summit on financing for development in Ethiopia next month.
A core issue in this heated discussion is whether developing countries have a right to sit at the table when global tax standards are decided.
Aware that they lose more money to international tax dodging than they receive in aid , developing countries have demanded fundamental changes to the way global standards for cross-border taxation and financial transparency are decided.
They want a global body on tax cooperation under the auspices of the UN. Today, global tax standards are decided behind closed doors at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD )  also known as the rich countries club.
The result is a set of standards that disadvantage developing countries financially, and a broken global tax system, riddled with loopholes for tax dodgers.
This system also creates a race to the bottom whereby governments clash in tax wars  fighting to get multinational corporations to pay taxes in their own country, while at the same time providing loopholes for multinationals to dodge taxes in other countries.
The victims include national companies unable to compete with multinational corporations, and citizens, who face higher prices and poorer public services.
Developing countries want a new tax body to foster global cooperation based on the simple principle that countries should not destroy the tax systems of other countries. This would strengthen the ability of countries to set their own tax rates and decide their own national systems.
European states have different positions, but  in particular because of the UK and France  the EU is rejecting the proposal for a global tax body.
Related: EU must pull its weight to help create a better global financial system
Here are 10 reasons why the EU should change its stance:
A key step towards a coherent global system. The international tax system consists of a complicated web of legally binding bilateral tax treaties, and parallel international systems to regulate cross-border taxation. A global system offers the only way to remove this complexity.
Stronger cooperation between tax administrations. A coherent global system will improve working conditions for tax administrations, enabling more efficient cooperation to ensure multinational corporations pay their taxes.
Less unilateral action. Individual governments have resorted to blacklisting and aggressive national laws to protect their tax base. Under the status quo, we are likely to see more self-protective measures, which complicate the lives of ordinary people and those companies not evading taxes.
An end to the race to the bottom. The fear of losing investments is driving governments to introduce tax incentives, loopholes and harmful tax practices.
A better business environment. Diverse, inconsistent national tax systems create heavy administrative burdens, legal uncertainty and high risks for international business.
A level playing field. Governments fear that being a first mover on tax transparency will push businesses to register in other jurisdictions. Through truly global negotiations, governments can agree coordinated action and ensure a level playing field.

Stronger implementation. No government feels obliged to implement tax standards that were adopted, without consent, behind closed doors. The UN is the only global institution where all governments participate as equals.
Less double taxation and double-non-taxation. Mismatches between national tax systems explain why some get taxed twice on the same income while others dont get taxed at all. Only truly global cooperation can end these problems.
More financing for development in the poorest countries. The exclusion of the worlds poorest countries from decisions on global tax standards means that international systems often dont consider their interests. This means lower tax income and scarcer financing for development.
Fair and consistent global action against tax havens. Many governments try to protect their tax base through national blacklists based on criteria that are often unclear and inconsistently applied. The EUs controversial new  tax haven blacklist  omits countries like Switzerland and Luxembourg but includes, for example, Liberia  one of the worlds poorest countries and not a major player in the offshore world. Action against tax havens must be fair, consistent and globally coordinated to be effective.
There is also one last bonus reason. Right now, disagreements about the tax body are preventing governments from reaching an agreement on a wider financing for development accord.
This deal, meant to be finalised in Addis Ababa, would be the first step towards the adoption of the sustainable development goals in September and the drafting of a climate treaty in December . Unblocking the stalemate over a global tax body could pave the way for more multilateral breakthroughs.
Its time for EU countries to call their negotiators in New York and tell them to shift position.

        <title>Development finance's $83bn question: who will pay for gender equality? | Chiara Capraro and Kasia Staszewska</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/financing-for-development-gender-equality-83bn-question-addis-ababa-sdgs</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>While a significant number of governments have championed an ambitious standalone goal on gender equality and womens empowerment in the negotiations on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), discussions on financing have struggled to reach agreement on issues that are fundamental to women.
Last week, governments met in New York to draft the outcome document for the third international conference on financing for development (FFD) , which will take place in Addis Ababa in mid-July. Negotiations are continuing as governments struggle to agree on key issues such as tax, a critical source of financing for development commitments, human rights and gender equality.
The Addis Ababa conference is of crucial importance to women. Decisions made in the Ethiopian capital will determine how the SDGs will be financed.
Although no specific costing for achieving gender equality and womens rights within the context of the SDGs has yet been calculated, in the case of the millennium development goals (MDGs), which expire this year, the gender equality financing gap in low income countries was projected at $83bn (53bn) in 2015 .
Because the new development agenda is universal  and far more ambitious than the MDGs  the costs are likely to be even greater.
Yet it is not only the quantity of funds that matters but how funds are raised and who receives them. As women and men occupy different roles in society, different sources of money affect them differently.
According to research, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off
Across the world, women carry out at least twice as much unpaid care work as men , and this contribution is often invisible and unrecognised. At work, women are worse off too. According to recent research by ActionAid, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off . Governments need to value women and their unpaid work when thinking about economic policy.
The FFD process can and should address major structural issues such as tax dodging, which deprives developing countries of far more than they receive in aid . Lack of revenue forces governments to spend less on essential public services. This can have a disproportionate effect on women in poverty if, for example, you consider childcare or support for survivors of gender-based violence  both services that are used mainly by women. Governments should take the opportunity offered by the Addis meeting to accelerate progress on global tax reform that works for developing countries.
Aid will continue to be a critical source of finance for the SDGs, especially for the least developed countries, but the share of aid supporting womens needs is still too low. According to OECD GenderNet , in 2012-13 only 5% of aid had gender equality as a principal objective .
Governments must recommit to meet the long-standing target of devoting 0.7% of GDP to aid, and increase the share of aid dedicated to gender equality, while investing more in supporting the crucial work done by womens rights organisations on the ground .
To date, huge emphasis has been placed on the role of the private sector in financing development, especially multinational companies. While the private sector has a role to play in creating decent jobs and ensuring equal pay for women, the footprint of many companies has been harmful to womens rights at work .
Related: Less pay, more work, no pension: the 21st-century woman's lot laid bare
We need to move away from voluntary corporate social responsibility commitments towards a legally binding regulation to make sure companies are accountable. If businesses did this, and paid their taxes in full, it would send a strong signal that the private sector is serious about supporting sustainable development, gender equality and womens rights.
The current draft of the Addis Ababa Accord starts well by stating a commitment towards gender equality and womens rights, but falls short on staying true to this vision throughout. Lack of recognition of the structural causes of gender inequality, such as the disproportionate responsibility of unpaid care borne by women and girls, means it risks focusing only on what women can do for the economy rather than on how the economy must work in a way that supports rights for all.
As governments continue their discussions, they must reach a consensus on financing methods that can really make a difference for gender equality and womens rights for years to come. The vision for change is clear  now the money must follow.

The article warzone rape seen as costly failure , published on the Global development site earlier this month, raises, perhaps unintentionally, some of the crucial issues that need to be discussed as part of a strategy to combat gender-based and sexual violence in armed conflict.
What needs to be prioritised? How do we determine budget allocation? What are the appropriate responses and how should we measure results? These are big questions. The overriding issue, though, is why does sexual violence happen and what can be done to address it?
The Prevention of Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) set some very clear objectives, with ending the impunity of perpetrators the foremost. This, however, was merely a starting point.
Related: Revealed: how the world turned its back on rape victims of Congo
The reality is that if men think of women as property  if violence at home, or committed by family members, is considered a private matter; if society continues to judge the conduct and dress of women in sexual violence cases; if the state fails to insist upon political, social, economic and cultural equality for women in all fields, and fails to engage with men in resolving the issue  then sexual violence will continue.
The former British foreign secretary William Hague publicly asserts that the leading issue of these times is the empowerment of women. He speaks of the need to address the root causes of sexual violence and see sexual violence in conflict as a matter of international peace and security. And he is right. Rape destroys communities and the consequences are international, as peace remains unobtainable. PSVI is a component of a global agenda on women, peace and security that recognises the critical importance of womens and girls empowerment and gender equality.

It is wrong to look at short-term indicators. Results will take many, many years. Rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will not end before the conflict does, and even then it will continue unless attitudes towards women also change.
Legal frameworks have to be reformed and applied, mindsets transformed, social and economic systems put in place. These things can only be achieved by national governments. Hence the need to bring them on board and keep them committed.
Budget is also important. Funding has been provided, and must be spent wisely. Though 5m was spent on the summit hosted by Hague and Angelina Jolie, the investment  tiny in relative terms  got more than 100 states on board. This should be compared with the more than 250m pumped into the Nato conference in Wales in the autumn of 2014 to discuss military deployments.
Stopping sexual violence is an obligation under international law, but still it happens. Governments have made commitments by ratifying human rights treaties and the statute of the international criminal court but, as we know only too well, they commit only to walk away, with South Africas decision to let the Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir leave the most recent, shameful example . It does not mean that we should stop bringing them together to remind them of what they have to do. It gives civil society more advocacy possibilities and with the protocol, launched at the summit, a practical tool to work with .
There was a lesson from the summit for the present UK government too. There can be no serious engagement on sexual violence without respect for, and delivery of, human rights, including economic and social rights and equality. State legal systems must incorporate these fundamental obligations and they must be complied with.
PSVI has the potential to make a serious difference; it has started to do so and now needs to be strengthened. The UK must be robust in demanding accountability for sexual violence by peacekeepers and insist on the participation of women in all peace processes. Britain must also ratify the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women , to which it committed three years ago.
The principles Hague enunciated are above politics and are not negotiable. There is a manifesto commitment to continue with the work he started. Those of us who work in civil society want this initiative to succeed and will give it the support it merits. We also understand that there is no quick fix and that we all need to be in this for the long haul.

Sierra Leone poised to lift bar on pregnant girls being educated
UN and donors optimistic that talks with Sierra Leonean government over ban introduced in 2010 are about to yield major breakthrough

The decision to continue the school ban on pregnant girls in Sierra Leone could soon be reversed as the government inches towards an agreement with international agencies.
It had been expected that the government would lift the ban, imposed in 2010, when schools reopened following the end of the Ebola crisis but the education minister, Minkailu Bah, reaffirmed it .
Now, after weeks of talks with the government, senior UN officials and UK and Irish aid representatives say they are on the verge of a significant breakthrough.
It is estimated that a third of children in Sierra Leone are born to school-age children and there is anecdotal evidence that the incidence of teenage pregnancy rose sharply during the Ebola outbreak.
In a survey of 1,100 girls and boys between the ages of seven and 18, 10% reported that girls, especially those who had lost relatives to Ebola, were having to engage in transactional sex to cover their basic needs.
There were also reports of children being assaulted in quarantined areas.
This report confirms that Ebola has put an incredible strain on childrens lives and it will take time for them to recover. The impact on them has been huge, said Casely Coleman, country director of Plan International in Sierra Leone.
Aid agencies including the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Irish Aid and the Department for International Development are working with the Sierra Leonean government to find a temporary solution that would involve girls being educated outside the classroom.
They are insisting the girls should continue to receive formal education and not be downgraded to vocational studies.
Government and development partners want a way for these girls to stay in the formal education system and we are hopeful that we can find a solution. There is a flexibility and openness to find a solution, said Sinead Walsh, the Irish ambassador to Sierra Leone.
Walsh, who is responsible for discharging Irish Aid, which had a strong presence in the country before Ebola hit,
continued: This not a new problem for Sierra Leone and we have been working to find a solution before Ebola. Weve looked at a lot of African countries where teenage pregnancy rates are high and there isnt really a magic solution.
So this could be an opportunity for Sierra Leone to play a leadership role in the region and find something that works.
Aid agencies say off-site education is not a sustainable solution in concept, but would be a watershed for a country where the incidence of teenage pregnancy is so high.
A senior UN official in New York described the bar on pregnant girls going to school  a policy in many African countries  as irrational and a breach of human rights.
Kate Gilmore, deputy executive director of the UNFPA, said the ban would perpetuate the cycle of poverty and hold the country back economically.
Ebola may be going, but its presence and consequences for the country are enduring. This is a sign of how much the situation has deteriorated, she said.
Gilmore said the government should be concentrating on educating pregnant girls and ensuring they delivered healthy babies rather than stigmatising them.
We have a fantastic relationship with Sierra Leone over many many years before Ebola. Sierra Leone was doing an extraordinary amount to achieve a turnaround in sexual reproductive health and reduce infant mortality, particularly as a post-conflict country, so the tragedy of Ebola is intense on so many fronts, with the reversal of such hard-won gains alongside the loss of life, she said.
Sierra Leone is already one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth, with maternal mortality and child mortality rates among the highest in the world.
These are the most vulnerable, they are at risk of child marriage and maternal mortality, said one aid worker, who asked not to be named because of local sensitivity on the subject.
Gilmore said she can understand that antipathy towards teenage pregnancy in many countries, but said traditional belief systems were not a reason to hold on to a toxic norm.
She said it was possible to change social conventions: We have done it with smoking, seat belts, FGM, there is no reason why we cant do it with teenage pregnancy, Gilmore said.
You can understand that irrationality might dominate in the early phase but pregnancy is a health issue, not a bar to education. This is eroding their capacity, as future parents, to be literate, to be numerate, to be part of economic society, she said.
This is about the demographic dividend. There is an economic boom to be reaped here  that is there for the taking for Sierra Leone.

        <title>Uganda: NGO bill aims to muzzle civil society, say activists</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/24/uganda-ngo-bill-aims-muzzle-civil-society-say-activists</Link>
        <Description/>

Ugandan civil society groups are warning that a bill to regulate non-governmental organisations is a blow to basic freedoms and threatens to curtail the activities of some groups, reducing essential services to some of the countrys poorest people.
The NGO bill , which was published in the east African countrys official gazette in April, must be debated in parliament before it can be passed into law. That debate is expected to take place in the coming months, but NGOs are urging MPs not to send the bill to President Yoweri Museveni to be signed.
Nicholas Opio, a human rights lawyer and the executive director of Chapter Four Uganda , said the legislation would extinguish the very character of non-governmental organisations and make them puppets of the state. It unjustifiably restricts the space for civic engagement, civic association [and] civic participation in governance and in service delivery.
The new law will replace previous legislation  described by rights groups as stringent. According to its preamble, the aim is to provide a conducive and enabling environment for civil society organisations.
The internal affairs minister, Aronda Nyakairima, wrote in an introduction to the bill that while NGOs provide key services such as health, education and water, the rapid growth of non-governmental organisations has led to subversive methods of work and activities, which in turn undermine accountability and transparency in the sector.
Opio estimates there are around 11,000 registered NGOs in Uganda  there are no comprehensive official figures  and activists admit there is some lack of clarity about what they do and who runs them. But they say this opacity is due to the dysfunctional nature of the official NGO board, which is meant to regulate the sector. The board will be given new powers under the proposed law.
Opio said Ugandas efforts to tighten state control over NGOs mirrored similar actions by other governments across the region, citing notably a 2009 law on charity funding in Ethiopia, which included a provision stating that any organisation receiving more than 10% of its funding from abroad was a foreign NGO, and thus banned from any activities concerning democratic and human rights, conflict resolution or criminal justice.
It began in Ethiopia in 2009 with an extremely repressive NGO law and it appears many of the countries in the east and Horn of Africa are learning from Ethiopia, Opio said.

Last year, Kenya shut down around 500 NGOs for non-compliance with the law, accusing some of using their charitable status as a front for raising cash for terrorism. In May, South Sudans parliament passed a law that would force aid agencies to ensure that no more than a fifth of their staff are foreigners. The bill is still awaiting the presidents signature.
Under Ugandas proposed legislation, the NGO board will register NGOs or community-based organisations and issue permits. NGOs will have to declare their sources of income and obtain permits from local authorities to operate. Groups that seek to operate without a permit could face fines, prosecution and criminal penalties of between four and eight years in prison for directors.
The NGO Board will be able to revoke permits if NGOs contravene their constitutions or the bill, or if in the opinion of the board it is in the public interest to do so. The NGOs must also not engage in any act which is prejudicial to the security and laws of Uganda.
The vague nature of these latter articles, in particular, have raised concerns. Livingstone Sewanyana, director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative Uganda , said the bill aims to create fear among activists. The fight against corruption, human rights abuses and maladministration will be seriously jeopardised, he says. It seeks to disable citizens who would have a say in how they are governed  and the outcome is dictatorship.
As well as providing basic services to many communities, NGOs have worked to preserve the land rights of Ugandans living near oil finds and spoken out against government excesses and rampant corruption.

Maria Burnett, a senior researcher in the Africa division for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says government control over civil society risks negating the very essence of freedom of association. We have documented threats to the operating space for civil society over many years in Uganda, [especially] groups working on oil transparency, human rights, land, governance, corruption and other sensitive issues, particularly when they publicly advocate for change, Burnett says.
Oil has been discovered around Ugandas Lake Albert but production is not expected to start before 2018.
Lawyer Isaac Semakadde, who works in a legal aid centre, says the bill, if it comes into law, will drive NGOs away. It will make it impossible to establish and operate an NGO; as a result, practitioners will be selectively allowed to stay [in the sector], and those organisations that advocate against the government side will certainly be told to give way, he said.
Under the bill, NGOs are also banned from fundraising or campaigning for any political party or candidate. Ugandans will vote for a new president next year, and Museveni, who has held the job for nearly three decades, is widely expected to run again for his National Resistance Movement party.
The 70-year-old leader has been criticized by some donors for hanging on to power, but there are no term limits in Uganda.
Cissy Kagaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition of Uganda , said NGOs would start to self-censor to avoid losing their permits. The bill wouldnt be bad if it intended to kick out quack [NGOs], but when you target whoever opposes the official position, then that does not work, she said.
Ofwono Opondo, a government spokesman, argued that the NGO bill was necessary to force the sector to be transparent and accountable. There is even duplication of activities; NGOs claim they are providing water and when you go there you dont find anything. We want them to specify their area of jurisdiction and what they want to do exactly, he said.
He linked opposition to the bill to anti-gay activists in a country with a growing anti-liberal movement, tough laws against homosexuals and a rise in religious conservatism.
Opio said the NGO sector was not against regulation, per se. What we are rejecting is control because we are non-governmental, he said.

Governments are failing to meet their international obligations to protect women from violence by starving womens groups of funding and closing the space in which they can operate, according to a report by ActionAid.
Laws and national action plans introduced to end violence against women and girls are routinely ignored, while efforts by local civil society groups to push for change are being thwarted by threats and intimidation, the NGO said on Tuesday.
A survey of 47 womens rights activists from more than 20 countries, conducted by ActionAid and Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition , found that more than 60% of women said they felt less safe in their work than they did two years ago. Of this group, 19% said they felt significantly less safe. Activists working on abortion, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights reported feeling particularly under threat.
Armed militias, governments, the police and religious groups were identified as the main instigators of threatening behaviour, which includes verbal abuse, sexual remarks, sexual harassment and assault.
ActionAid said rather than protecting womens rights, and meeting the UN resolution adopted in 2013 to protect activists , many governments are directly perpetrating violence against women, while failing to address cultures of impunity. And rather than supporting women in their struggle, many states are closing down the civil society space which all civil society, including womens organisations, need in order to be effective.

More and more women are facing the fear of violence and its consequences for them and their families, said Lucia Fry, head of policy at ActionAid. The work of fearless women standing up against violence is being eroded by increasing intolerance of dissent and the rising influence of fundamentalist agendas that are anti-womens rights.
As our survey shows, women activists from countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and the US have all seen threats of violence increase, making them insecure and hampering their efforts to improve womens lives and end violence in society.
The survey marked the launch of ActionAids Fearless campaign , which is calling on the UK to take a lead in working with the international community to fulfil its obligations to end violence against women and girls with practical action and adequate funding. Rights activists are hoping this year will be a catalyst for long-term change for women with the adoption in September of the sustainable development goals. A target to eliminate all forms of violence is expected to be included in the goals, which come into force for all countries next year.
Speaking at the Fearless launch, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the proposed SDGs were immensely powerful and had the substance on achieving gender equality that was lacking in the millennium development goals. She added that the issues raised in the campaign were so important.
This is a battle that if were not winning it, were losing it. There are many people in many parts of the world who think women have too many rights, that its gone too far and should go back to where it used to be, she said. I have a voice and have a responsibility to use it to speak for those who dont to make sure we are winning that battle.
Figures published by the World Health Organisation in 2013 estimated that almost 30% of women experience physical or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner, despite more countries passing anti-violence laws. According to the World Bank, 76 out of 100 countries surveyed have laws to tackle domestic violence, compared with 13 in 1995.

An ActionAid report published with the survey outlined numerous cases of women being attacked in the course of their activism. These include Atena Farghadani, 28, an artist who was placed in solitary confinement in Iran for posting a cartoon on Facebook criticising a government bill to limit family planning services, and Gladys Lanza , who was convicted of defamation in Honduras when she spoke in defence of a woman who had accused a government official of sexual harassment.
Samira Hamidi , former director of the Afghan Womens Network, said she had been repeatedly threatened by opposition groups in the course of her work. There are no prevention and protection mechanisms by my government where any women  but particularly women human rights defenders  can be supported.
ActionAid is calling on governments to adequately fund local womens rights groups, which it said are critical to ending gender-based violence.
A survey conducted in 70 countries over four decades found that the mobilisation of womens rights organisations was the most important factor in turning commitments to end violence into meaningful action  having more impact than the number of women in parliament, or the wealth of a country.
But, between 2012 and 2013, of the $28bn earmarked for gender equality globally, the overall funding for womens organisations was less than $400m, said ActionAid.
A global survey of 740 womens organisations conducted by the Association for Womens Rights in Development (Awid) in 2010 found the average annual income of these groups was just $20,000 (12,000). Organisations in sub-Saharan Africa often receive just $12,000 a year.

Doris Owusu Prempeh, a member of a community-based anti-violence team (Combat) in southern Ghana supported by ActionAid, said she had seen a reduction in gender-based violence locally in the five years since her team had been working.
The team, comprised of three women and four men, educate people about what constitutes domestic violence and why its wrong, and support those who have been attacked, with counselling and reporting the crime to the police. When we started, we had so many cases [of violence] but now it has reduced to one a month. When we started, we got more than six or seven a month because there was no education about domestic violence, she said.
But there is only so much the group is able to do. Police are sometimes reluctant to pursue an arrest unless they are paid by the victim or the family. We dont have money and our work is voluntary so that makes it very difficult for us to report cases, she said.

Economic inequality will make it harder for countries to weather crises such as natural disasters and social unrest in the future, a study has shown.
The 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) measured the ability of governments, businesses and civil societies in 127 countries to handle economic change and take advantage of investment opportunities.
It evaluated each countrys quality of governance by looking at macroeconomic frameworks, business environments and the rule of law. Researchers also considered the freedom and influence of civil society groups.
Economic inequality was seen as the greatest threat for many nations, leaving them vulnerable to financial shocks, according to the CRI, which was released on Tuesday by KPMG and Oxford Economics thinktank.
A recent study by Oxfam on extreme wealth inequality said 85 of the worlds richest people had the same wealth as half of the worlds population.
Worsening inequality can lead to or exacerbate conflicts and reduce social cohesion
Change Readiness Index
Uneven economic growth does not reduce poverty as quickly as growth that is spread across societies, the CRI said. It also warned that worsening inequality can lead to or exacerbate conflicts and reduce social cohesion.
The 2015 index said Namibia, Haiti and Guatemala had the least inclusive economic growth.
Some low-income countries ranked higher than expected in the CRI. Trevor Davies, executive director of KPMGs International Development Assistance Services (Idas), said this was because of economic diversification, a strong rule of law, and educational opportunities.
Weve found that the countries that do well are the ones that actually focus not just on the economic side, but also on bringing about good governance and improving the lot of their people  so making sure that the economic benefit flows through inclusively to their population, said Davies.
Mozambique, which came 80th in the index, performed better than any other low-income country, based on projections of gross national income. Uganda, Cambodia and Tanzania also ranked high in the index.
Timothy Stiles, chairman of Idas, said: Many countries compensate for lesser wealth with robust governance, a strong social foundation, and a positive business environment.
Algeria registered the biggest gain in this years rankings, because of impressive improvements in its enterprise and government capability, the report said.
The Philippines strong political institutions demonstrated the importance of good governance in recovering from natural disasters, according to Davies. Much of the country was devastated by typhoon Haiyan in 2013, but the Philippines effective policies and institutions have enabled it to persevere, and it is projected to be one of the worlds fastest growing economies in 2015.
The index showed that the volume of national income is the most significant factor in determining change readiness, with the top 22 spots in the index going to high-income countries. Small countries with high gross national income are the best positioned to handle economic shocks and take advantage of investment, the report said.
Singapore came top, followed by Switzerland, Hong Kong, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Qatar, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
The report combined data from 22 primary survey questions that were gathered from 1,270 country experts around the world. Data sources included the World Economic Forum, World Bank, Legatum Institute, International Monetary Fund and United Nations.

Kenyan president's call to arms on self-sufficiency carries health risks
Resolving some taxing issues must be top of President Kenyattas agenda if he is to end dependence on aid without harming healthcare or education

During the 25th African Union summit from 7-15 June, Kenyas president Uhuru Kenyatta took to Twitter to urge his fellow leaders to move away from reliance on development aid from donor countries.
In his tweet at the conference in South Africa , Kenyatta said that sometimes aid only appears to be charitable and so often carries terms and conditions that preclude progress.
Kenyatta has been a vocal opponent of perceived Western influence and power in Africa  notably since he was charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . The charges, which related to post-election violence in 2007-2008 and were denied by Kenyatta, were dropped in December 2014 after key witnesses withdrew.
But despite Kenyattas bold call for increased African self-sufficiency, could Kenya do without aid in the near future?
Advocacy group Results has researched health financing in Kenya with the Kenya Aids NGO Consortium (Kanco). The study, Who Pays for Progress?, looks at the balance between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Domestic Resource Mobilisation (DRM) such as tax, and will be launched in July. The data so far suggests it would be a major challenge to move away from aid in the health sector, and also difficult in other areas, such as education.
Related: Financing the sustainable development goals  podcast
Of the overall health budget, 45% is currently provided by donors and 55% by the Kenyan state. In some programmes, the dependency on ODA is even greater. In a series of interviews in March 2015, we learned that the HIV and Aids programmes are funded 70% by donors, and work on nutrition is around 80% funded from ODA.
Even these figures do not tell the whole story  for tuberculosis programmes, 23% of funding comes from domestic sources, and 17% from ODA, but 60% of the need is completely unfunded. At present the country needs to increase funding for healthcare if it is to fulfil the ambition stated in the 2010 constitution to achieve universal health coverage.
In the long run, all Kenyans would be happy to see a time when the country does not need aid, said Allan Ragi, director of Kanco. But at present, if ODA falls then we will be unable to deliver essential healthcare to the most needy.
In the medium term, there is more cause for optimism. Economists in Kenya see ample scope to increase domestic resources, for example by improving the efficiency of the tax system.
The Kenya Revenue Authority has identified a significant number of high-net-worth individuals who could increase their tax payments, and the same is true of some multinational companies. Kenya had around 8,700 dollar millionaires in 2014 and in Nairobi alone, there are at least 65 high-net-worth individuals with wealth exceeding $30m.
As well as improving tax revenue, the country could reduce illicit financial flows out of Kenya. According to authoritative research Kenya lost $4.9bn in capital flight in 2010 alone: this is approximately $120 per person. This ties in with global analysis that shows that while high-income countries collect an average of 34% of their GDP in taxes, low-income countries in Africa only collect 17%, or even less.
Related: Without leadership over development finance, talks in July cannot succeed
The government of Kenya has identified ways to close some tax loopholes and thus make more funds available for health and other development programmes. Capital gains tax of 5% was reintroduced on 1 January this year after an absence of 30 years. The National Aids Control Council has said it can increase the domestic funding of the HIV programme from 30% to 85%, but not until 2024.
If Kenya can raise more domestic finance through taxation, and devote a greater share of the national budget to health, then the current funding gap for essential health programmes can be filled. Chatham House health economists estimate that around $86 per person per year is needed to deliver adequate health coverage in developing countries.
President Kenyattas call to arms to fellow African presidents came just a month before the Financing for Development conference in Ethiopia on 13-16 July, where the world community will debate how to pay for development priorities over the next 15 years.
Kenyattas call for self-sufficiency will surely find a great deal of support in Addis Ababa, but health economists will be urging caution, and will want assurances that domestic finance for health is in place before ODA dries up.

        <title>68 million children likely to die by 2030 from preventable causes, report says</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/unicef-68-million-children-under-five-die-2030-preventable-causes-report</Link>
        <Description/>

Almost 70 million children under five will die by 2030 from mainly preventable causes unless the world is bolder and more strategic about helping the poorest and most vulnerable young people on the planet, Unicef has warned in a blunt final report on the millennium development goals (MDGs) .
The UN childrens agency says that while the MDGs have yielded significant achievements in reducing child and maternal mortality and improving access to drinking water, they have failed millions of disadvantaged children and even increased levels of inequality within some countries.
Unicef attributes the failures to a lack of ambition and planning, but also points to the way in which data was collected and used  and the fact that the MDGs inadvertently encouraged countries to measure their progress through national averages.
In the rush to make that progress, many focused on the easiest-to-reach children and communities, not those in greatest need, says the report, Progress for Children: Beyond Averages .

In doing so, national progress may actually have been slowed. This is because we were not strategic enough. Though it was once assumed that reaching the hardest-to-reach was unrealistic, we now know that investing in the most disadvantaged children can actually be more cost-effective.
The agency says that the sustainable development goals  which will replace the MDGs later this year and set the development agenda until 2030  must take into account lessons learned from their predecessors if lives are to be saved and futures altered.
Without concerted action to reach the most vulnerable children, Unicef estimates that by 2030, 68 million more children under five will die from mainly preventable causes; 119 million children will still be chronically malnourished, and half a billion people will still be defecating in the open .
In sub-Saharan Africa , the risk of a child dying before her or his fifth birthday in the region is almost 15 times higher than the risk facing a child born in a high-income country, while Unicef estimates that, at the current rate, it will take 96 years for all girls from the regions poorest families to complete their lower secondary education.

The report also notes that neonatal deaths currently represent a larger share of the total under-five deaths than they did in 1990: by the end of 2015, about 1 million children  16% of all under-five deaths  will die on the same day they were born. Eleven children are predicted to die every minute in 2015.
The differences within countries are equally stark: children from the poorest households are twice as likely to die before turning five  and far less likely to achieve minimum reading standards  as children from the richest households.
Although Unicefs executive director, Anthony Lake, insisted the MDGs as a whole had absolutely not failed the worlds children, he said the report had to serve as a wake-up call.
If the global community allows the current trends to continue, we will fail millions of children, he said.
This shows the huge stakes in achieving the goals of the SDGs and we believe that to achieve the most results, most efficiently, we have to focus ever more on the most disadvantaged children.
Lake said targeting the poorest children was the best way to reduce cycles of intergenerational poverty and improve the lives of families, communities and societies.
They are where the needs are greatest and our modelling over the years has shown that its the most cost-effective way to achieve results, because the results you achieve in the most disadvantaged areas almost always outweigh the additional costs of reaching those areas, he said.
Despite its bleak assessment of some MDG progress, the report highlighted a series of successes in the fight against poverty, disease and mortality levels since 1990.
It pointed out that under-five mortality dropped by 53%; that chronic malnutrition among children under five decreased by 41%; that maternal mortality decreased by 45%, and that 2.6 billion people gained access to improved drinking water sources .

Hugh Muir presents this edition of the Global development podcast, ahead of the UN's third international conference on Financing for Development. Having set in motion a bold agenda for a better world with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will drive development priorities over the next 15 years, member states now have to work out how to finance them.
The talks will cover everything from aid and taxes to the role of the private sector and trade  and success is crucial if the SDGs are to be achieved by 2030.
Clr N Chonghaile went along to a panel discussion, Financing the Future, at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), and asked participants what they hoped the Addis meeting would deliver. Research officers at the ODI Gideon Rabinowitz and Andrew Rogerson emphasise the importance of developed countries delivering on the 0.7% target of national income as ODA. We also hear from Rupert Simons, chief executive of Publish What You Fund, on his hopes for the Addis talks.
Joining Hugh to discuss the development financing agenda are Tim Jones, policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, and Paddy Carter, one of the lead authors of the ODI's report on how international public finance should fund a global social compact to eradicate poverty. We also hear from Jean Letitia Saldanha, senior policy advisor from CIDSE, the International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity.
Plus, Kary Stewart takes a tour of London's tax-dodging hotspots to find out just where the country's top corporate tax avoiders call home.

Corruption stymies Niger's attempts to stem flow of migrants to Europe
Despite a government crackdown on people-smuggling, police corruption means the migrant convoys continue on the perilous journey across the Sahara

In the desert town of Agadez in central Niger , almost anyone can point out the smugglers compounds where African migrants lie low before heading for Europe. Almost anyone, except the police.
At a checkpoint on the outskirts of town, police officers turn a blind eye as dozens of smugglers trucks packed with migrants drive past at nightfall. This happens every Monday as convoys start the three-day trek across the desert to Libya.
We cannot stop the migrant trucks. They do not pass by here, says one of the policemen, gesturing vaguely into the blackness. They go around us, far off in the desert.
After two migrant trucks pass, a turbaned fixer hired by a smuggler to pay off the police gets back on his scooter and drives away, his work done.
A confidential government report into illegal migration in Agadez concluded that corruption was so entrenched here that to tackle migrant smuggling would require replacing almost all military and police officials.

A record 100,000 migrants are expected to cross Niger this year into Libya, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), taking advantage of the chaos that has given smugglers an open door to Europe.
The EU believes just over half the migrants arriving in Italy travel first through Niger. More than 1,800 migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean this year alone and Europe is looking to Niger for action.
Last month, President Mahamadou Issoufous government passed a tough anti-migrant smuggling law that establishes prison terms of up to 30 years for smugglers. It said this was to protect vulnerable young Africans.
Not only are many migrants exploited by smugglers, falling victim to forced labour or prostitution, but others die in the desert when they are abandoned there, or when vehicles break down.
Officials in Niger, ranked as the worlds poorest country by the UN, know that implementing the new law means cracking down on endemic graft in a country where a young policeman earns less than $190 a month.
For a truck of illegal migrants to cross Niger and reach Libya, many officials must turn a blind eye, said Goge Maimouna Gazibo, head of Nigers National Agency for the Fight Against People Smuggling (ANLTP).
From now on, any official who allows a bus to cross a border will be considered guilty of smuggling and corruption, Gazibo added.
Niger has tried before to curb migration. After 92 migrants were found dead in the desert in 2013, the government launched raids on several smugglers compounds, known as ghettos, and replaced a handful of police officers.
Migrants and smugglers say they are obliged to bribe police, in a racket worth millions of dollars a year
Two years on, little has changed. Flows from countries like Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria, Mali and Ghana are higher than ever. Migrants and smugglers say they are obliged to bribe police, in a racket worth millions of dollars a year.
On the road north from Nigers capital Niamey, police systematically took migrants aside at checkpoints to demand payment. Although citizens of west African countries have the right to travel in Niger, many migrants say they prefer not to show their identity papers for fear they will be confiscated by corrupt police.
If they stop you, you have to pay, said Lamine Bandaogo, a lean 17-year-old fleeing Burkina Faso, as he stood in a bus depot on the route to Agadez. Bribes range between $2 and $20. If you have nothing, you must beg forgiveness.
Since winning power in 2011, Issoufou has made some progress in the fight against corruption. Niger has risen to 103rd in Transparency Internationals 2014 survey of graft perceptions , from 134th (of 175) the year he took office.

Yet some people question whether security forces are ready to forego lucrative revenues from migration. A confidential 2013 national police report concluded that Agadez, which acts as a gateway to the north, was an El Dorado for security forces. It found there were more than 70 smugglers ghettos active in the town, each one protected by a paid police agent.
A separate report by the Halcia anti-corruption agency said that payments to security forces and local authorities totalled $450 per vehicle and $30 per foreign migrant on the route between Agadez and the Libyan border.
The Halcia mission also found that bribes paid by migrants were essential to keep the security forces functioning as money earmarked in the military budget to buy diesel for vehicles, spare parts and food simply disappeared in Niamey.
The security forces recognise that they take money but they have no choice. That is money they use to do their jobs, said Ousmane Baydo, deputy head of Halcia.
In an effort to bypass corrupt security forces, the new law places the legal responsibility on transport companies to ensure travellers have valid documents.
Any transport company that doesnt check documents, well prosecute them for complicity, Gazibo said, adding this should help to reduce migrant numbers by next year.

Once we have confiscated two or three buses, the transport companies will start to cooperate, he said.
The justice minister, Amadou Marou, said Niger cannot tackle the problem alone and has appealed to neighbouring countries to adopt similar laws punishing those who profit from illegal migration and to agree terms for the repatriation of migrants.
Niger officials are concerned that any unilateral expulsion of west African citizens could sour relations with neighbours.
Niger plans to create welcome centres in Agadez to try to prevent migrants from falling into the hands of smugglers, to inform them of the risks of the perilous journey, and to return those wanting to go back to their own countries.
This is not a law to protect Europe, Marou said. We have done this to save lives because African governments also have a responsibility.
But with some west African states reliant on remittances from migrants, questions remain over how determined they are to combat illegal migration.
Marou said Europe needed to make legal immigration easier. If it is possible for European citizens to come to Africa , it should be just as easy for Africans to go to there.

Niger is the largest per capita recipient of European aid , with some 600m ($680m) earmarked between now and 2020. EU ambassador Raul Mateus Paula said that would be boosted by at least 30m this year.
An EU police training mission will open an office in Agadez and focus its activities on migrant smuggling. The EU will also contribute to the centres to inform and repatriate migrants.
Yet Niger and its European partners recognise that, if they are to stem the flows, migrants and smugglers alike need economic alternatives.
The 2013 national police report warned that Agadez lived off smuggling and any attempts to end it could lead to riots. With tourism devastated by Islamic militancy in the Sahara, many in the town say they have no other source of income.
A smuggler can make 3m CFA francs ($5,212) with just one 4x4 packed with 30 migrants  a fortune in a country where most people live on less than $2 a day. Dozens of ghettos lie behind red mud walls on Agadezs dirty backstreets, with metal gates offering glimpses of groups of young men inside.

They cannot stop migration completely. If there was no immigration, Agadez would grind to a halt, said Bashir, who owns a migrant ghetto. He says he is getting out of the business because of the new law and wants himself to emigrate.
If Europe would give us money, then we would stay here, he said.
Giuseppe Loprete, local head of the IOM, said migrants who have sold everything to pay for their trip are ready to die rather than return empty-handed to even worse poverty. Would-be migrants should be told more about the risks so they do not leave in the first place, he said.
The IOM is training members of western African communities in Niamey to explain the dangers. Djibril Sow  a Senegalese expatriate who has lived in Niamey for years  says he will seek out his fellow citizens in bus stations.
Loprete said: If they know that there is a 90% chance of dying, or getting held up, or coming back with nothing, then I think people will change their minds.

In three months, the UN looks set to adopt 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) that will guide the international communitys efforts to tackle global poverty, inequality and climate change over the next 15 years.
After years of negotiations among policymakers, NGOs and academics , a zero draft of the SDGs is now under discussion. But how will we know if we advance towards achieving these targets? What should be the indicators of progress?
The draft goals call for an end to poverty in all its forms everywhere and set the target of reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. But how do countries measure the multidimensional nature of poverty and track progress towards reducing it?
Multidimensional poverty measurement has been rapidly evolving over the past five years, both at the national and international level. Since 2010, the UN Development Programme s human development report office has published a Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), developed with and calculated by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford .
Related: Number of people in extreme poverty could be greatly underestimated, report says
The index complements traditional measures of monetary poverty and captures the multiple, overlapping disadvantages poor people can face  such as poor sanitation, malnutrition, poor quality of housing and lack of education.
According to the latest updates of the Global MPI , released by OPHI on 22 June and covering 101 developing countries, 1.6 billion people are living in multidimensional poverty around the world.
Of this number, most MPI poor people  69.6%  live in middle-income countries. In addition, looking at the 67 countries for which there is comparable data on both MPI and monetary poverty, 29% or 1.4 billion people are MPI poor, while 1.07 billion or 22% live on less than $1.25 a day.
In certain countries, including Mexico, Pakistan and Egypt, the number of those living in multidimensional poverty is twice the number who are living on less than $1.25 a day, and is more than 1 million people. This emphasises how the MPI complements monetary poverty measures, as both together better capture the true reality of poverty.
This month more than 100 policymakers and senior officials came together in Cartagena, Colombia, for the third annual meeting of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), a group of more than 40 governments and institutions that promotes the use of national multidimensional poverty measures.
In a communique released after the meeting, which was hosted by President Juan Manuel Santos and the government of Colombia, theparticipants called for an improved Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI 2015+) to be included in the SDGs.

This index would reflect progress towards tackling different dimensions of poverty, and could also be broken down to show exactly what poverty is like in different areas of a country, or among different groups of the population. Such information would help ensure that no one is left behind by the post-2015 development agenda.
The network supports governments designing national MPIs using indicators of poverty that are relevant to their specific country contexts. The governments of Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Bhutan, as well as the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, have already adopted official multidimensional poverty measures. And a rapidly increasing number of countries, including Pakistan, Philippines, Malaysia, Tunisia and Vietnam, are developing their own MPIs.
What is electric is how these measures galvanise action. By pinpointing exactly how and where people are poor, national MPIs enable governments to better target their resources and combat poverty more effectively through integrated and well-coordinated policy interventions.
The MPPN hopes that the global and national MPIs will receive support at the UNs conference on financing for development in Addis Ababa next month. It also hopes the MPIs will be recommended as indicators by the expert group that recently concluded its first meeting on the indicator framework in New York.
How we understand poverty is changing  its multidimensional nature is now widely acknowledged. But recognising this fact in the SDGs is, in itself, not enough. We must commit to measuring multidimensional poverty to ensure that the many overlapping disadvantages faced by the poor can be energetically and successfully tackled.

Peru harnesses ancient canal system to tackle Lima water shortage
Restoring a pre-Inca network of channels to ensure a steady flow of water from the mountains should help Lima meet some of its growing needs

In the mountains above the Peruvian capital Lima, the worlds second largest desert city, scientists are working with farmers to restore ancient canals, believed to predate the Inca empire, in an effort to tackle the citys increasing water shortage.
The system  known locally as mamanteo, a term derived from the Spanish word for suckling, or amunas  could help the city of nearly 10 million inhabitants to ride the seasonal extremes of floods and droughts.
It works by funnelling water from highland streams into the mountain itself, where it percolates through cracks and natural aquifers over months to emerge in springs and natural reservoirs.
Its all about building in delays in the hydrological runoff of these catchments because if the water continues through this stream it will reach the village downstream in a question of hours. Letting it seep through the mountain, we expect to build in delays of weeks and hopefully months, says Bert De Bivre, an expert on Andean water basins working with the Consortium for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Ecorregion , an NGO.
The delay means that the abundant wet-season moisture in these highlands at more than 3,500 metres above sea level can be gradually distributed during the dry season, which can last more than half the year.
Floods and landslides killed nine people, left thousands homeless and caused major infrastructure damage on the outskirts of Lima in March. Meanwhile, unusually warm autumn temperatures brought drought in other parts of the city, where at least 700,000 live without running, potable water, according to Sedapal , the citys water board.
A third of Peruvians live in Lima and up to 150,000 migrants continue to swell its infrastructure-starved peripheries every year. Authorities are struggling to supply the growing population, dependent on three rivers that flow from the Andes: the Rmac, Chilln and Lurn.
Regrouting and maintaining the pre-Inca drainage canals provides a cheap alternative to building modern hydric infrastructure, according to De Bivre. Experts believe they may have been built by the Wari culture as long ago as 700AD, yet De Bivre says it is clear they were developed over centuries by different cultures  and we are just one more of them.
State funding for the project began in March. Perus national water regulator Sunass multiplied the proposed budget, diverting 1% of consumer tariffs from Sedapal over the next five years  more than 70m Peruvian soles, or about $22m (14m)  to green infrastructure. This will include restoring amunas and recuperating highland wetlands. A further 3.8% of tariffs, approximately $89m, will be used for climate change adaptation and disaster risk mitigation.
The investment in green infrastructure would mean an increase in Limas water volume by at least one cubic metre a second, which makes it very affordable in contrast to building a canal, said Fernando Momiy, the president of Sunass.
Lima is a desert city which keeps growing and in five years there will be another 700,000 inhabitants who will need water. Thats why we need to look at combining grey infrastructure with green infrastructure, said Momiy.
Its the first time that a regulatory body has promoted this kind of infrastructure in Lima. We see that theres a lot of focus on grey infrastructure when we should be looking at green infrastructure, so as not to have to invest so much in expensive grey infrastructure.
Pointing to water crises in California, the UK and Sao Paulo in Brazil, Momiy said: Theres no reason to think that couldnt happen to us.
With a commanding view of the distant smog above Lima, the small district of Huamantanga feels far removed from the city that houses a third of Peruvians.
Here we count on the expertise of the local people who know all the water sources and springs, says De Bivre.

With nearly four million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, a heavy toll has been placed on local populations. Basic infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water supplies, has been placed under enormous strain.
But despite the pressures, many local communities have stepped in to help new arrivals. Refugees have also banded together to support each other. To mark World Refugee Day, the European commissions humanitarian aid and civil protection department (Echo) has partnered with the Danish Refugee Council to pay tribute to the everyday heroes supporting Syrian refugees.
There is a lot of media coverage highlighting the negative impact of the crisis on the refugee-hosting countries, but there are also many positive stories that never get reported, says David Verboom, Echos regional head of office in Amman, Jordan. This is an attempt to redress the balance a little, to shine some light on the generosity and friendship shown towards the refugees, and vice versa, that often goes unnoticed.

Khalif fled Syria in August 2013 with his wife and six children, taking nothing but the clothes they were wearing. The quietly spoken 42-year-old now lives in Darashakran refugee camp, where he has become a father figure, helping more than 300 families access clothes, food and medicine.
They come here with nothing. [Just] the clothes on their back. Many have not eaten for days and they are scared. The children cry a lot, Khalif says. You become aware of those that are really struggling, so I make calls and talk to people and we share what we have. We dont make a fuss. We leave the clothing, food or blankets at night so it can be found in the morning.
We may not have much, but what we do have we share. Are we not called humans, after all?

It is not good enough to give a tent and leave them. We must ensure we offer dignity too, says Fathullu, one of the few female mayors in Iraq. She aims to offer a personal welcome to each refugee who arrives in the district, and has overseen the construction of Darashakran camp, home to 11,000 Syrian refugees.
She says the camp has reliable electricity, water and sanitation facilities, as well as green areas for children to play and families to meet. Our door here is always open because we, like our brothers and sisters in Syria, are humanitarian people who look after one another. From one human to the next, I offer my support. I want them to feel secure.

Dirani is the director of one of the few womens resource centres for Syrian refugees in Lebanons Bekaa Valley.
The stories I have heard from women I work with are often unbelievably heartbreaking. But at the same time, day by day, I see their strength grow, their heads rise and strength building as they learn new skills that help empower them, Dirani says.
More than half of the 400,000 refugees from Syria living in the Bekaa Valley are women and children.
Most days women just sit in their homes, cook, clean and worry about how they will be able to provide a good future for their children. Some women have been abandoned by husbands who take on younger, second wives. They struggle and even push their daughters into early marriage or pull their children out of school so they can work and earn money, Dirani says.

With food donated by local restaurants and food manufacturing companies, Terro runs a street feeding programme for refugees in Beirut. In the three years since the project began, Foodblessed has provided more than 190,000 meals to Syrian families.
Terro leads a growing team of more than 400 volunteers who make and distribute meals from food that would have otherwise ended up as waste. I used to think that people didnt care, but Ive found out that people just didnt know how, she says.
Journalist Ahmad Abu Hamad knows first-hand what it is like arriving in a new country as a refugee

Journalist Ahmad Abu Hamad is a Palestinian refugee who grew up in Jordans Madaba refugee camp. Having experienced life as a new arrival, he says his aim is to bring humanity into the conversation on refugees.
There is a misconception that people believe a refugee has no responsibilities. But to become a refugee, that person has had only three options to choose from  to be killed, to be imprisoned or to become a refugee. It is that simple.
Last week I interviewed a 20-year-old refugee girl. When we spoke I looked at her and thought, What has she done? No home, alone. A refugee because of what?

Many things have changed for 13-year-old Salam Al Jundi in the past 15 months, among them being able to smile and walk.
In March 2014 the young Syrian was walking with her young brother and cousin to a shop near her home to buy sweets when a bomb struck their path. Her cousin died, her brother was injured and Salam lost her leg.
With no treatment available near their home, her parents took the chance and sent Salam and her eight-year-old brother to Souriyat Across Borders , a medical centre in Jordan offering free treatment to Syrian refugees.
These kids do not only need treatment but also love and encouragement. Their disability is a mark in their mind and a lot of them lose faith in a brighter future, says Yaseen, a volunteer physiotherapist. I always ask them, Do you need your legs or head to think and attend school? That way I encourage them to believe that they can study and achieve their dreams.

More than half of the Syrian refugee population are children, and agencies are working to provide psychosocial support for children, both in refugee camps and host communities. One form of support is art therapy, which aims to help children express themselves and share stories with others who have had similar experiences.
Artist Hala Abu Said, a Syrian refugee herself, says she hopes she can make a small difference in the lives of the children she works with. This is the best gift I can give the kids as an artist. Every person has something to help Syrians, regardless of their nationality.

Aid agencies must rewire their approach to refugees' energy needs

Many years ago, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, printed a poster of Albert Einstein with the caption Einstein was a refugee  a reminder of the enormous contribution that refugees have made to the world. But this World Refugee Day , instead of celebrating their contribution, we will unfortunately have to focus on finding solutions for an unprecedented global crisis.
Antnio Guterres, the head of the UNHCR, has spoken of a world facing an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement, as well as the response required, is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before.
There are now nearly 60 million forcibly displaced people in the world: thats almost the same as the combined populations of Canada and Australia. Half of these displaced people are children, and the overall numbers are increasing rapidly.
Related: Pakistan: 'Son, you brought electricity to the village and added 15 years to my life'
Addressing this problem demands coherent migration and refugee policies. Reversing the trend will require effective conflict resolution and prevention. These all remain a long way off. In the meantime, we must find practical, humane and cost-effective ways to respond to the needs of displaced persons.
Like everyone else, displaced people need access to safe, reliable and clean energy, whether for lighting, heating, cooking, sanitation, earning a living or communicating. They rarely get this. Every situation is different, but millions of people in camps depend on rudimentary or primitive energy solutions, such as three-stone fires and candles.
This has profound human, environmental and economic consequences. Accidents with naked flames can cause injuries and death, such as this months tragic example in a Syrian refugee camp in Lebanons Bekaa Valley, where at least four people were killed when dozens of tents caught fire.
Indoor cooking with open fires contributes to serious respiratory illness, chiefly among women and children who tend to be most exposed to the fumes. The same women may also spend hours each day gathering firewood, increasing the risk of gender-based violence, especially as areas around camps become deforested and the women are forced further and further afield in search of firewood.
Humanitarian agencies try to provide what energy they can but their efforts can often be inefficient and costly.
The potential benefits of doing things differently are obvious. They include reduced deforestation, carbon emissions and pollution; improved health and reduced levels of violence; and lower costs. Better energy access can also create livelihood opportunities and could improve relations between displaced people and local populations by supporting enterprise or generating benefits for both communities.
The celebrated UNHCR poster featuring Albert Einstein.
So why is access to sustainable energy not front and centre in responses that seek to address the needs of displaced people?
The problem is not technological. A breathtaking range of innovative products and services exists to meet needs for everything from lighting and cellphone charging to cooking and heating, water pumping and cooling. Some technologies, such as solar PV or panels and mini-grids, are highly advanced. Others, such as fuel-efficient stoves, are basic. All offer cleaner, safer and more reliable energy at an affordable price, and represent a significant improvement on the current situation.
However, a host of obstacles  political, financial and institutional  constrain humanitarian agencies in their efforts to meet the energy needs of displaced populations.
Governments and local authorities in host countries may be reluctant to facilitate energy access for refugees, particularly if local populations have unmet needs, or if they fear increased energy provision may prolong the existence of a camp.
Although most solutions offer very attractive payback times, agencies may struggle to find predictable, long-term funding to procure them. Within the humanitarian system, energy often falls through the cracks. Dedicated agencies, organisational arrangements and funding lines exist for basic needs such as food, water, shelter and health. But not for energy. This means that in the rush to save lives and respond to crises, energy provision is often an afterthought  uncoordinated and short-term.
The scale of these challenges cannot be understated. Success will require rewiring the humanitarian system, developing new funding models, building capacities and expertise where none currently exist, and persuading governments with responsibilities for refugee influxes to try new approaches.
Crucially, it will also require the involvement of the private sector, which is often where the deepest expertise and capacity for innovation lies.
The Moving Energy Initiative , a partnership between the UNHCR, GVEP International, Chatham House , Practical Action Consulting , the Norwegian Refugee Council and the UKs Department for International Development has been formed to address these challenges.
Working in different countries and with other collaborators, the project is designing and piloting new approaches and models for energy provision among displaced populations, building the case for reform and developing recommendations for systemic change.
This year the international community will agree a new set of sustainable development goals . As currently proposed, the seventh goal is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. If all is to mean everyone, the humanitarian system has to start changing now.

If Theresa May wants to tackle illegal immigration, better to target overstayers and focus on root cause of Mediterranean migrant crisis
Asylum seekers try to jump on to a moving lorry at Calais on Tuesday

The shocking television footage of desperate asylum seekers and others trying to jump on the slow-moving, queueing lorries on the approach roads at Calais were a sharp reminder of the scenes 15 years ago when the tabloids, daily in the grip of invasion panic, complained of illegals flooding Calais in their efforts to come to soft-touch Britain.
In fact, the migrants are just one element in the chaos created by striking French port workers that will fade once Calais gets back to normal. The home secretary reassured MPs that contingency plans had kicked in to ensure that there had been no mass break-in to Britain.
The numbers of those trying to cross the Channel from Calais fluctuate according to the international situation, and with the largest refugee crisis since the second world war currently playing itself out across the Mediterranean, in north Africa and in the Middle East, it is not surprising that more than a few thousand have gathered in the port.
Millions have already been spent on building bigger fences at Calais to ensure that the port does not become a back door, or indeed a front door, for illegal entrants into Britain.
But the truth is that the vast majority of illegal migrants in Britain are not smuggled across the Channel in the back of a lorry, but enter Britain perfectly legally through the front door on a plane through Heathrow on a visa. If you want to tackle the problem of illegal immigration, then better to tackle those overstayers than the few thousand who might make it across the Channel each year.

Calais migrants: Get to England or die trying - a Guardian investigation
Anyway many of those in Calais are asylum seekers who have fled from countries such as Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan. Some will have come direct from Italy or Greece having made it across the Mediterranean.
Theresa May is right that the root cause lies in the Mediterranean migrant crisis. This weeks EU summit will see the European Union agreeing a programme to share responsibility for just 60,000 migrants and refugees over the next two years. There are already more than 1.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey alone. The United Nations has said in the face of this crisis, the European Union could easily take one million refugees.
All 28 EU countries will agree to take some refugees under this scheme, but the numbers fall far short of the numbers in need of international protection. Britain last Friday dropped its reluctance to take any at all and said it would resettle a few hundred more Syrians.
The replacement of the former flagship, HMS Bulwark, by the small survey ship, HMS Enterprise, this week means that Britain has also scaled back to almost next to nothing its contribution to the EU humanitarian effort to save the lives of those trying to cross the Mediterranean.
The home secretary says she wants to break the linkbetween getting into the boats and reaching Europe. HMS Enterprise is to take part in an eight-strong EU naval fleet to target the smugglers boats. This will be backed by a new taskforce of intelligence, policing and asylum experts to smash the people smuggling networks.
The EU summit this week will agree a timetable for the new force to seize their boats with a possible military operation to destroy them in time if the Libyans consent is ever obtained. Events are moving rapidly in the face of this refugee crisis, and the British and European response is equally rapidly moving from humanitarian solutions, based on international protection, to declaring a war on traffickers based on military solutions.

US ransom policy shift undermines UK's hardline stance
Barack Obamas decision may put Americans at greater risk, fuel hostage price inflation and raise pressure on UK to save its citizens in the same way

Barack Obamas decision to relax Washingtons blanket ban on paying ransoms to free hostages will be seen as belated American acceptance of an unpleasant but unavoidable necessity by west European countries criticised in the past for buying off terrorist kidnappers with cash.
But if David Cohen, deputy director of the CIA , and other counter-terrorism experts are to be believed, Wednesdays announcement may increase the risk of American citizens being taken hostage abroad, because the payment of large amounts of money for their release now appears more likely.
Obamas policy shift does not in any way overcome the basic ransoms-for-hostages dilemma, which is the fear that handing over money is, in effect, giving in to the bad guys and will encourage and finance more terrorism. Linked to this is the belief, common among American and British politicians, that European governments that pay ransoms (while officially denying it)  notably France, Germany, Spain, Austria, Switzerland and Italy  are letting the side down.
This view contains an element of self-righteous moralising that, whether justified or not, is of scant comfort to the grieving relatives of executed American and British hostage victims. Acutely aware of this cruel human toll and of a string of failed or thwarted armed rescue operations, particularly in Syria, Obama ordered the policy review in an attempt to ensure US policy was consistent and that hostages relatives were treated fairly and kept informed and involved.
Families complained that they had been threatened with prosecution for trying to arrange ransoms, while different government branches were giving them contradictory advice. Obama will allow officials to communicate and negotiate with kidnappers, but has made clear he remains opposed to making concessions to terrorists.
Related: British government faces dilemma by refusing to pay hostage ransoms to Isis
David Cameron is outspoken on the ransom issue. He cajoled the G8 countries into issuing a joint declaration in 2013 pledging that they would not meet ransom demands. This vow has since been ignored by key signatories. In September last year, Cameron told parliament he had no doubt that the many tens of millions raised by Islamic State extremists through hostage-taking in Syria and Iraq was being used to promote terrorism. Thus Britain would not change its stance. Britain continues with this policy, America continues with this policy, but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure that other countries are good to their word, he said .
Obamas shift  giving American hostages families or their representatives the right to pay ransoms without fear of legal repercussions, and authorising US government officials to communicate and negotiate with captors in arranging such deals  cuts the ground from under Camerons feet. Although it has occasionally broken its own rule, Britain now stands alone among the big western powers in adhering to the principle of no hostage ransoms, with the possible exception of Shinzo Abes Japan (which lost two hostages this year after rejecting Isis demands). Camerons stance may prove increasingly hard to maintain as public pressure grows to rescue British citizens in trouble abroad in the same way that other countries do.
The US move has several other ramifications. It potentially raises the profile of the hostage-taking business, giving the terrorists what Margaret Thatcher called the oxygen of publicity. Critics will say it encourages copycat scams by criminal gangs. The change may also fuel hostage price inflation. According to figures researched by the New York Times , al-Qaida took in $125m (80m) in revenue from kidnappings between 2008 and 2014, with more than half  $66m  extorted in 2013. In total, ransoms paid amounted to $165m in the same period. In 2003 the average hostage head-price was $200,000. Now $10m is not unusual.
France, for example, is said to have paid about $40m in 2013 to free four citizens held in Mali. (It denied having done so.) In total, France has reportedly paid out $58m since 2008. In January this year, two Italian aid volunteers held in Syria were freed after $14m was reportedly handed over to their captors, the Nusra Front. Italy and Spain previously paid about $8.9m for the release of three tourists abducted in southern Algeria. Similarly, Germany paid out untold millions last year for two hostages held by Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines .
When Isis paraded the US hostage James Foley before video cameras and threatened to behead him, the asking price for his release was an extraordinary $132m. This figure reflected Foleys political and propaganda value to Isis, rather than any realistic hope of obtaining so large a sum. Foleys subsequent murder was a cruel reminder that in the world of Isiss new caliphate, no amount of money may suffice to save a life if fanatical extremists decree otherwise.
Some evidence suggests Americans will become more attractive to kidnappers due to Obamas move, because al-Qaida and other terror groups target individuals according to their governments willingness to pay. Of 53 hostages taken by al-Qaida from 2009-14, a third were French and a disproportionately high number were Spanish, Austrian or Swiss. Its obvious al-Qaida is targeting them by nationality, Jean-Paul Rouiller, a Swiss counter-terrorism expert, told the New York Times .
David Cohen, deputy CIA director and formerly the top US Treasury official responsible for terrorism and financial intelligence, made a similar point in a trenchant speech in London in 2012 . Unless he has radically changed his opinion since then, Cohens view is sharply at odds with the new White House approach.
Cohen said: We know that hostage-takers looking for ransoms distinguish between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not, and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that do not pay. Recent kidnapping trends appear to indicate that hostage-takers prefer not to take US or UK hostages because they understand they will not receive ransoms.
He said paying ransoms, by whatever means, was a bad idea. Ransom payments lead to future kidnappings, and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments. And it all builds the capacity of terrorist organisations to conduct attacks.

Why has Greece only now included defence cuts in its Brussels proposals?
Athens has been in no hurry to put military spending on the table, but then neither have its creditors, including its main European arms supplier - Germany

Among the measures Alexis Tsiprass government has used to swell the package it tabled in Brussels on Monday is a 200m (142m) cut in next years defence budget. Estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) for 2014 suggest that would equate to a reduction of around 5% in Greeces military spending . The proposal raises an intriguing question: why did Tsiprass Syriza party not offer more swingeing cuts in defence spending at an earlier stage in its tortuous negotiations with Greeces creditors?
It would seem the obvious course of action for a leftwing  arguably far left  movement. It might also have obviated the need to inflict yet more pain on Greeces long-suffering consumers and workers in the form of the higher VAT and increased social security contributions that also form part of the package. Until now, however, the Tsipras governments only move in the direction of more modest defence spending has been to put the brakes on a 500m programme for the modernisation of naval support jets .
The case for deeper cuts in the defence budget would seem to be all the more persuasive given that Greeces military expenditure is high. Ironically, the EUs most leftwing government spends proportionately more on defence than any other. Greeces military spending amounted to 2.2% of GDP last year, according to Sipri. Among Nato countries, only the US spent more in proportion to the size of its economy.
Thanos Dokos, a defence analyst and director general of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, noted that the latest figures nevertheless reflected a sharp drop since the start of the Greek crisis. The defence budget has come down by around 40% in the last four years, he said.
If it is still high, that is because of a consensus in the country that there is a threat from Turkey and that we need to be able to defend ourselves against it. This is not Belgium or Portugal, Dokos said.
Deeper cuts than those outlined in the Tsipras plan might also be difficult to implement for both political and practical reasons. Tsiprass government is a left-right coalition. Its parliamentary majority depends on support from the rightwing ANEL nationalist party whose leader, Panos Kammenos, holds the defence portfolio.
With no new procurement initiative on the horizon, future defence budgets will consist largely of the cost of earlier arms purchases, military pay and pensions and the armed forces operating expenses. Only the last can be reduced. Which is where a rich irony enters the picture, because Greeces biggest European arms supplier over the years has been Germany . According to Sipri, more than a quarter of Greeces weapons imports between 2000 and 2011 were from the country that has become its main creditor.
There is also strong evidence to indicate that some of the contracts under which the arms were supplied were obtained by bribery, a practice for which Greece has been widely criticised in creditor nations .
The Tsipras government may not have been in a hurry to put military spending cuts onto the table in its talks with its creditors, but then nor has the other side. Greeces plentiful defence budget has proved a nice little earner for its eurozone partners over the years.
No one put a gun to our head and made us buy those weapons, said Dokos. But, although I cannot prove it, I dont think [other European countries] were too keen to make it an issue. I dont think they were too displeased with Greece buying their weapons.

        <title>Creditors' economic plan for Greece is illiterate and doomed to fail</title>

The troika plan for the Greek economy has already failed twice, and it will fail for a third time if the economically illiterate plan being foisted on Athens is adopted. Greece requires growth and debt relief, but the proposals currently being discussed provide neither.
As usual, the International Monetary Fund, the European commission and the European Central Bank will come up with forecasts showing that the latest set of austerity measures will boost confidence, promote investment, stimulate growth and lead to lower unemployment. As usual, they will be wrong. The recession will deepen and the crisis will return.
Back in 2010 when it first got involved , the IMF assumed that the Greek economy would have a painful but relatively short recession. There would be a 6% peak to trough contraction in the economy, which would bottom out in 2011.

Things did not go according to plan. By the time the fund announced its second programme for Greece in March 2012, the economy was in freefall. The IMF assumed the decline would end that year, with a period of flatlining followed by the resumption of growth.
In the end, the Greek economy shrank by 25%, a slump equivalent in its severity to that suffered by the US between 1929 and 1932. Recovery coincided with the arrival of Franklin Roosevelt in the White House.
One of the insights gleaned during the Great Depression was that it does not make a lot of sense for governments to try to balance budgets during a severe downturn, because tax increases and spending cuts reduce demand. That deepens the slump, leaving an even bigger hole in the public finances.
In Greece , though, it as if the clock has been turned back to the pre-FDR days when Herbert Hoover was US president. Weak growth means that Athens continues to miss the deficit targets the troika sets for it. The troika responds by insisting on additional savings to put the budget back on track.
Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning US economist, posted a chart last week based on IMF data that illustrates what happened to the underlying public finances of the eurozone members in 2014.
This measure of budgetary discipline looks at the primary budget surplus - the gap between revenues and spending excluding debt interest payments - adjusted for the state of the economic cycle. Measured in this way, Greece ran a surplus of more than 5% of GDP last year, comfortably higher than any other eurozone country.

It is, however, not enough for the troika. In order to avoid a debt default and a run on its banks that would threaten its continued membership of the single currency, Greece has now had to table proposals that will suck an additional 8bn out of the economy in the next 18 months. Consumer spending will be hit by an increase in VAT and higher pension contributions, while investment will be dampened by a one-off levy and an increase in corporation tax.
Greece has a number of severe economic problems. It suffers from a lack of demand, and a five-year slump has pushed it into deflation. Falling prices have added to the real, inflation-adjusted burden of the governments debt, which currently stands at 175% of GDP. A fresh dose of austerity will make all these problems worse.
One way for Greece to get out of its mess would be for it to leave the euro, devalue its currency and renege on all or part of its debt. That is not an option if it stays in the single currency, which the public wants.
Another way out would be for the creditors to cut Greece some slack. That would involve immediate debt relief and more realistic targets.
The troika, though, will continue with policies that have failed before in the hope that they will succeed this time. Einstein had a definition for this - insanity.

Queen's choice of Germany for state visit seen as diplomatic coup
German observers view monarchs trip, which includes a meeting with Angela Merkel, as a way of showing how poor Europe would be without Britain

For several days, Germans have been fed a daily stream of instructions on what to do should they happen to meet the Queen. In the first instance, she is to be addressed as Your Majesty, wrote the liberal daily the Sddeutsche Zeitung, and thereafter with Maam, to rhyme with gram. And um Gottes willen, keine Selfies! [for Gods sake, no selfies].
If such newspaper guides are anything to go by, Germany is taking Queen Elizabeths seventh official visit to Germany , which begins on Tuesday, extremely seriously. Lilac is a safe colour to wear if you meet her, was another more specific crumb of advice in the tabloid Bild, which pointed out that it is also, appropriately, the tone that results from mixing together the colours of the union jack.
Angela Merkel welcomed news of Her Majestys visit. Queen Elizabeth is witness to the development of the relationship between Germany and Britain which is very friendly today, the German chancellor said this week. And when she visits, its always a big event. But as this is expected to be one of the 89-year-old monarchs last state visits, the interest is more heightened than usual. That their country should be the choice of her final foreign port of call is seen as immensely flattering to the majority of Germans.

There has been much speculation in Germany as to the reasons, including her husband the Duke of Edinburghs German roots  he was born into the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glcksburg and went to school in southern Germany  and not least, her own strong German ancestry. Only during the first world war was the family name changed by her grandfather, George V, from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor.

But as the German socialite and most prominent royal watcher, Alexander, Count of Schnburg-Glauchau, pointed out to readers of Bild in a five-part series, Die Queen und die Deutschen: It is not the Queen who decides when and where she travels, but the British government  and Downing Street has very concrete reasons why it should want to send the Queen  the secret weapon of British diplomacy  to Germany.
Historians have been wheeled out in their droves to explain how her first, 11-day, 18-city visit in 1965 was seen as a major contribution to healing the wounds caused by the second world war. In Britain some critical voices called it an insult to Britains war dead. It was highly symbolic  a sign that Germany was once again being viewed as a normal country, said historian Simone Derix, who has researched the topic in depth. At the same time there were fears among officials that some Germans in their enthusiasm to see her would let slip a heil, she said. In the end, they shouted: E-li-sa-beth!
In the following years, the cold war made her visits just as necessary, not least after prime minister Margaret Thatcher was quoted in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, as saying: I love Germany so much, that Im glad there are two of them. Those wars may be over, and Germany long since reunited, but nowadays, said Schnburg, the anxieties are quite similar, namely Londons fear of  an EU which fuses into a super-state, in which the individual states lose their independence.

David Camerons decision to piggy-back on the visit, when he attends a state banquet with the Queen and the German president, Joachim Gauck, on Wednesday evening, has certainly raised eyebrows. Downing Street insists his trip follows an invitation from the German government. But observers in London and Berlin view it as a deliberate exercise to reinforce the countries commonalities ahead of crucial EU talks Cameron is due to hold with Merkel over Britains future relationship with Brussels, before an in/out referendum on the UKs membership in the EU.
Related: Brexit  what would happen if Britain left the EU?
Certainly, when the Queen is greeted by Merkel on the steps of her cuboid chancellery on Wednesday morning, the pictures will, hope diplomats on both sides, speak volumes about the British-German relationship. Merkel has said she will do all she can to try to keep Britain in the EU. Schnburg said: The Queen, simply through her very presence, is supposed to remind us Germans just how poor Europe would be without Britain.
One commentator from the leftwing paper Taz suggested that another effect of the encounter might be to finally put Merkel, often referred to as the Queen of Europe, in her place, because after all, when Elizabeth became Queen, Merkel was not even born yet.
The packed schedule of the three-day visit will on Wednesday see the Queen and Prince Philip greeted with military honours by Gauck at his residence, Schloss Bellevue, before they take a boat up the river Spree to the chancellery, where the Queen will hold talks with Merkel, before laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
At the Technical University she will listen to the annual Queens lecture, this year delivered by the outgoing director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor  one of the most popular Britons in Germany since his curation last year of an exhibition on 600 years of German history, and the recent announcement that he will take over as a chief adviser on the contents of the new cultural palace in Berlin, the Humboldt Forum.

On Thursday, she will travel to Frankfurt, the countrys financial centre, where the underlying message will be the strong business ties between Britain and Germany, which many say would be threatened by a Brexit. But the most poignant item on the Queens schedule will undoubtedly be her first ever visit to a former concentration camp when she goes to Bergen-Belsen on Friday. The camp was liberated by British troops in April 1945.

The visit  taking place at the Queens request, according to the British embassy  will see her meet survivors and liberators of the camp. It is being kept deliberately low-key but again will usefully serve to reinforce the bond. Details of everything  from what she and Philip will eat (guinea fowl and venison), where shell sleep (the fact that his room is reportedly at the other end of the corridor from hers in Hotel Adlon), to the colour of her Bentley, which was transported to Berlin at the weekend  are being pored over.
One celebrity magazine claims to have seen the protocol note that says the Queen did not respond to the German query as to whether she preferred to take the lift rather than using the stairs. And her personal cook in the Adlon said, on being asked if there was any food she wished to avoid: I was told anything goes, which I think is quite charming.
Everyone, from porcelain manufacturers to toy makers, is exploiting the event for all its worth. The Berlin branch of Lego has even produced a limited edition Queen figure. The fascination is easily explained, say German royal watchers, by the fact that the country does not have its own royal family to admire. From the butler who will serve her tea on her arrival at the Adlon, where the royal entourage will move into 70 rooms on two floors, to the organ grinders outside on Pariser Platz, everyone has their own memories of her last visit in 2004. And few have forgotten how she briefly fell asleep during a lecture on medicine and magnets in Dsseldorf, an incident which did nothing to lessen the love.

Is the Confederate flag a racist symbol? After Charleston, the debate rages on
For most Americans, the answer is simple: yes. But the flag has its defenders who insist it expresses a rich southern heritage, not hatred associated with slavery

The killing of nine African Americans inside a Charleston, South Carolina, church last week by a suspect who appears to have decorated online declarations of his white supremacist views with the Confederate battle flag has returned debate over the flag to the national stage.
Related: South Carolina governor calls for removal of Confederate flag from statehouse
Is the flag a quintessentially racist symbol? Recent polling suggests that for about half of Americans, the answer may be as brief as the question is basic: yes.
The flag was first sewn for an army that fought to preserve in the United States the legally sanctioned slavery of African Americans. Racist hate groups continue to love the flag for something more than its aesthetic appeal. For most African Americans, especially, the meaning of the flag is clear.
Certainly symbolically, we cannot have the Confederate flag waving in the state capitol, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) president, Cornell William Brooks, said in Charleston last week, referring to a banner that flies at a memorial to Confederate soldiers on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse. Hundreds of protesters, black and white, marched on the statehouse at the weekend to demand the flags removal.
Yet the flag has its defenders who insist that it does not express hatred. Many of those voices have become scarce in the days since the Charleston shooting . Elected officials and public figures who have vocally defended the Confederate flag in the past and who ignored repeated requests for comment or declined to answer questions for this story include the president of the College of Charleston, the president pro tempore of the South Carolina state senate and a former speaker of the state house of representatives.
Those who were willing to talk about their devotion to the Confederate flag said, among other things, that it honors soldiers killed in the American civil war who were fighting out of a sense of duty to God and family  not hatred.
Ben Jones is the chief of heritage operations for the Sons of Confederate Veterans and traces multiple lines of ancestry, he said, to soldiers who died fighting for the Confederacy. But he is better known as the actor who played the mechanic Cooter in the 1980s hit television show The Dukes of Hazzard . The heroes in the show drive a car named the General Lee  for the Confederate leader Robert E Lee  which has a Confederate battle flag painted on its roof.
Symbols mean different things to different people in different contexts, said Jones, who is also a former Democratic US congressman from the state of Georgia. When you ask me what it symbolizes, it symbolizes, in a personal way, the courage and the valor of my ancestors, who in their time did what they believed was the right thing to do.
Jones, 73, who runs a chain of Cooters Place outlets in the south that sell Dukes memorabilia including Confederate flag license plates , said the flag had a place in southern culture that had become detached from its history as a battle flag  and from the question of race and racism.
Its been used to sell soap, and its been used to sell rice, and its been used to sell grits, and apples, and travel brochures and beauty pageants, and at race tracks, and its been the name of sports teams, and that flag is flown throughout the southern culture in a hundred different ways to mean the spirit of the south  the independent, the rebelliousness of the south, Jones said.
The argument that the flag is a harmless cultural symbol, however, has withered before. The rapper LL Cool J and country musician Brad Paisley were charged with trivializing slavery for a 2013 collaboration called Accidental Racist . In the song, Paisley says the flag only means that he likes the southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd . LL offers: If you dont judge my do-rag, I wont judge your red flag.
The song isnt perfect, LL Cool J later told talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres, but what we were talking about is love and not judging people on symbols.
South Carolina senator Kevin L Bryant, a Republican, said he thought the Confederate flag outside the statehouse eventually will come down, and that he would support, with ambivalence, legislation to take it down.
Im torn on the issue, Bryant said. Theres three groups of people. Theres some that find it offensive. And then theres a small amount of people who use it as a symbol of hate. And then theres a large group of folks who have had relatives that fought and died in the war between the states  a title used by some in the south for the American civil war  who see it as their heritage.
Ive talked to lots of constituents and theres strong feelings on all sides. Its just unfortunate that some people, like this murderer in Charleston, use it as a symbol of hate. I dont think the flag on the statehouse grounds had anything to do with this murderer.
Jones forcefully disclaimed any link between the flag and the suspect in the Charleston killings, Dylann Roof, whom Jones called a demented white supremacist, a reactionary little drug addict and a nowhere man who tried to make a name for himself.
These were wonderful people who were murdered by an idiot, Jones said. That does not stand for anything. That is a hateful individual.
What else did he have, a black Hyundai? Is that a symbol of racism?
South Carolina congressman Doug Brannon, a Republican, has written legislation to remove the flag from the capitol grounds. He described how southerners who seek to honor the memory of their ancestors could still ask for the flag to be removed from the statehouse, where it was first flown in 1962 in order to signal resistance to the forced desegregation of southern schools and public places.
Theres a number of people in South Carolina that will tell you that flag represents their heritage, Brannon said. But the truth of the matter is, those people dont understand the history of the flag, and the state capitol. That flag may in fact be your heritage. But the flag of your heritage is the flag that was carried by battalions or divisions in a war 150 years ago.
The flag that Im talking about is the one that was put on the state capitol dome in 1962 in response to desegregation. So  its two separate issues.
The flag of their heritage is fine for them. And their flag of heritage needs to be in a museum. The flag that Im talking about was put up by a bunch of white guys in 1962 in response to desegregation. And thats not heritage. Thats hate.
State senator John Matthews was one of the African American leaders of the legislature who led the fight to take the flag off the capitol dome, where it was raised until 2000, and plant it in front of the Confederate memorial.
To African Americans, we saw it as suppression, Matthews told the Guardian in an interview last week. We at the state are evolving from where we were, to where we need to be. A lot of people in this state are good people moving on and moving up. But some of the old south is still lingering.
The Confederate memorial to which the flag attracting the current controversy is attached is one vestige of the old south. It was dedicated in 1879, just 14 years after the civil war ended and four years after the statehouse itself was finished.
Heres how the monument explains itself :
This monument perpetuates the memory, of those who true to the instincts of their birth, faithful to the teachings of their fathers, constant in their love for the state, died in the performance of their duty: who have glorified a fallen cause by the simple manhood of their lives, the patient endurance of suffering, and the heroism of death, and who, in the dark hours of imprisonment, in the hopelessness of the hospital, in the short sharp agony of the field, found support and consolation in the belief that at home they would not be forgotten.
But Gwendolyn Neal, a black woman who was born and raised in South Carolina and was interviewed by the Guardian at the capitol over the weekend , said the flag was offensive, full stop: Its always going to be a slap in the face, as long as its up there.
This article was amended on Monday, 22 June, to more accurately represent polling numbers on American views of the Confederate battle flag.

        <MainBody>ECB MAINTAINS EMERGENCY FUNDING BUT DOESN'T RAISE IT

Its official, the European Central Bank has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity support on offer to Greece, but it has also not provided any extra help.
In a statement, the ECB says that it has decided to maintain the ELA ceiling at Fridays limit (thats 89bn).
So it hasnt pulled the plug, but it also hasnt provided extra funding to cover the funds that have flowed out of Greek banks this weekend.
For weeks, the ECB has been agreeing to requests from Greece for extra emergency liquidity, often providing a billions euros or more each week.
So if theres no extra ELA, that is going to make it harder for banks to handle withdrawals, if people keep taking money out.
Heres the full statement:
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank today welcomed the commitment by ministers from euro area Member States to take all necessary measures to further improve the resilience of euro area economies and to stand ready to take decisive steps to strengthen Economic and Monetary Union.
Following the decision by the Greek authorities to hold a referendum and the non-prolongation of the EU adjustment programme for Greece, the Governing Council declared it will work closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability.
Given the current circumstances, the Governing Council decided to maintain the ceiling to the provision of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greek banks at the level decided on Friday (26 June 2015).
The Governing Council stands ready to reconsider its decision.
Mario Draghi, ECB President, said:
We continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro area economies.
Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, said:
The Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.
The Governing Council is closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council is determined to use all the instruments available within its mandate.

Bill Cosby admitted in 2005 that he got quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with, and that he gave another sedative to at least one woman and other people, according to documents obtained on Monday by the Associated Press.
That woman and a second woman testified in the same case that they knowingly took quaaludes from him, according to the unsealed documents.
The AP had gone to court to compel the release of the documents from the deposition in a sexual abuse lawsuit filed by former Temple University employee Andrea Constand  the first of a cascade of sexual abuse lawsuits against him. Cosbys lawyers had objected on the grounds that it would embarrass their client.

Cosby settled that lawsuit under confidential terms in 2006. His lawyers in the Philadelphia case did not immediately return phone calls on Monday. Constand consented to be identified but did not want to comment, her lawyer said on Monday.
Cosby, 77, has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct, including allegations by many that he drugged and raped them in incidents dating back more than four decades. Cosby has never been criminally charged, and most of the accusations are barred by statutes of limitations.
Related: Court documents open window into Bill Cosby's legal problems
Cosby, giving sworn testimony in the lawsuit accusing him of sexual assaulting Constand at his home in Pennsylvania in 2005, said he got seven quaalude prescriptions in the 1970s. The lawyer for Constand asked if he had kept the sedatives through the 1990s  after they were banned  but was frustrated by objections from Cosbys lawyer.
When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with? lawyer Dolores M Troiani asked.
Yes, Cosby answered on 29 September 2005.
Did you ever give any of these young women the quaaludes without their knowledge? Troiani asked.
Cosbys lawyer again objected, leading Troiani to petition the federal judge to force Cosby to cooperate.
Cosby later said he gave Constand three half-pills of Benadryl, although Troiani in the documents voices doubt that was the drug involved. The two other women who testified on Constands behalf said they had knowingly been given quaaludes.
Three of the women accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting them have a defamation lawsuit pending against him in Massachusetts. They allege that he defamed them when his agents said their accusations were untrue. Cosby is trying to get their case thrown out before discovery.
Cosby had fought the APs efforts to unseal the testimony, with his lawyer arguing the deposition could reveal details of Cosbys marriage, sex life and prescription drug use.
It would be terribly embarrassing for this material to come out, lawyer George M Gowen III argued in June. He said the public should not have access to what Cosby was forced to say as he answered questions under oath from the accusers lawyer nearly a decade ago.
Frankly ... it would embarrass him, [and] it would also prejudice him in eyes of the jury pool in Massachusetts, Gowen said.
US district judge Eduardo Robreno asked last month why Cosby was fighting the release of his sworn testimony, given that the accusations in the Temple womans lawsuit were already in the public eye.
Why would he be embarrassed by his own version of the facts? Robreno said.
Cosby resigned in December from the board of trustees at Temple, where he was the popular face of the Philadelphia school in advertisements, fundraising campaigns and commencement speeches.

Campaign to cut supermarket food waste reaches European parliament

A French councillors campaign to stamp out food waste by forcing supermarkets to give unwanted items to charity will reach the European level on Wednesday.
Arash Derambarsh, who has already persuaded the French government to pass a law barring shops from destroying food as it approaches its sell-by date, hopes the European parliament will approve an amendment to a new circular economy law encouraging individual member states to follow suit.
Derambarsh, a municipal councillor in Courbevoie, north-west of Paris, said he was confident the amended law would be approved during Wednesdays proposed vote, describing it as historic.
Related: France to force big supermarkets to give unsold food to charities
This is such an important issue and we have to work fast before the food lobbies get together and start opposing us, he said.
I set a deadline of getting the law passed in France and Europe within a year, and were six months in, so were doing well. After that, its the world.
If Wednesdays law is approved, Derambarsh said it would go before the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who would decide if and when it should be applied.
Derambarsh said: I call on Mr Juncker to sign it immediately so it can be applied now. This is the most important legislation of the year and we cannot lose time.
The councillor started his campaign by collecting unsold food from his local supermarket. He and a team of helpers personally distributed it to the needy, many of them pensioners, families struggling in poverty and people living on the streets and in shelters.
A petition launched in seven European countries including Britain that calls for support for the law has more than 539,000 signatures.
Derambarsh has the backing of French MEPs Nicole Fontaine, a former European parliament president, and Anglique Delahaye, of the Rpublicains party, who introduced the amendment into the law.
The French law, passed in May, obliges large supermarkets and food stores to sign an agreement with a charitable organisation by next year.

During a recent visit to Italy, Derambarsh also enlisted the support of former UN goodwill ambassador and actor Gina Lollobrigida.
The amendment calls on the European commission to promote in member states the creation of conventions proposing that retail food sector distribute their unsold products to charity associations.
Derambarsh is planning to table the issue  via the campaign group ONE, founded by U2 singer Bono  in September when the United Nations discusses its millennium development goals to end poverty in September, as well as at the G20 economic summit in Turkey in November and the COP21 environment conference in Paris in December.
Derambarsh, a lawyer whose family moved to Paris to escape the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, is a member of Nicolas Sarkozys rightwing Rpublicains party. Critics have accused him of trying to further his own political career by creating a media storm over food waste.
The 35-year-old admits he is engaged in what he calls a press blitzkrieg, but only to raise awareness of the scandalous and utterly absurd situation where comestibles are thrown away or destroyed with bleach while people go hungry.
He cited his teams success working with their local Carrefour store since last October.
In Courbevoie we collect 40kg of unsold food worth around 500 (350) and we are able to help 100 people. Imagine what that translates to on a European level. With this law we can bring immediate relief to the poor and hungry, he said.
Derambarsh, who says he is also working with Action Contre La Faim and the French Red Cross, added: Its true that these kind of issues are normally associated with socialist politicians, but when it comes to thirst and hunger, there should be no political divide. These issues cut across national and political lines. Its something we can all agree on.
The job of any politician is to help people, my objective is to help people who are hungry.
An estimated 7.1m tonnes of food is binned in France each year  67% of it by consumers, 15% by restaurants and 11% by shops. The figure for food waste across the EU is 89m tonnes while an estimated 1.3bn tonnes are wasted worldwide.

        <title>Pamplona festival: two Americans and a Briton gored by bulls</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/bull-runners-gored-pamplona-festival-san-fermin-spain</Link>

Six half-ton fighting bulls were let loose in the narrow streets of the northern Spanish city for the festivals first run, which was described as quick and dangerous. Eleven people in total were injured in the two minutes and 23 seconds it took for the bulls to barrel down the 850-metre route from the holding pen to the city bullring.
A 38-year-old American was gored in the armpit, and a 30-year-old Brit was left slightly injured after being gored in the groin. A 27-year-old from California was treated for a superficial wound on his lower back after being grazed by a bulls horns. None of the injuries were considered to be life-threatening.
Eight other men, including three Americans, were treated for bruises and scrapes.
Tuesdays run included six animals from the Jandilla ranch in the rural western region of Extremadura, known for the ferocity of its bulls. The Spanish newspaper El Pas heralded a particularly feisty bull named Fastuoso, or Magnificent, who took an early lead in the run, knocking people aside as he charged down the tightly packed street. As he rounded a curve, Fastuoso hurled a runner against the wall, breaking a water pipe in the process.
The nine-day festival, which traces its roots back to the 13th century, was made famous by Ernest Hemingways 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. Each year thousands of tourists, mostly from the US, Australia and Britain, flock to the festival to tear through the streets dressed in red and white.

The festival is a target for animal rights activists, who point out that the bulls used in the eight days of runs are all killed in evening bullfights. On Saturday 100 or so protesters, many of them covered in fake blood, gathered outside Pamplonas bullring to protest at what they call a week of fear and death for bulls. Pamplonas streets are stained with bulls blood, read their signs.
Fifteen people have been killed in the festival since records began in the early 1900s. Dozens are injured each year, many of them during the panicked chaos of the bull runs.

        <title>China and Russia: the world's new superpower axis?</title>

Forget euro summits and G7 gatherings: for the countries that like to style themselves as the worlds rising powers, the real summitry takes place this week in central Russia, where Vladimir Putin will hold court.
Leaders of the Brics countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) will meet Putin in Ufa on Wednesday, then make way for the Asian powers grouped in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Russia and China are the common denominators, as in so much geopolitics these days. The UN security council, Apec, the G20 - Russia and China are the ever-presents, a powerful pairing whose interests coincide more often than not.
Moscow and Beijing have lots in common apart from a 2,500-mile border, economies dominated by state-run firms and oligarchies that can enrich themselves as long as they play by the prevailing political mood of the day.
organisation membership
Officially, Putin is dismissive about suggestions of a new eastern alliance. We are not creating a military alliance with China, he said last month. We are not creating a bloc-based approach, we are trying to create a global approach.
And yet both countries share a desire to limit American power; they enjoy a burgeoning trade relationship in which, in essence, hydrocarbons are swapped for cheap consumer goods; and they have a mutual interest in promoting an alternative model to western diplomacy.
Trade has increased sixfold over the past decade. Last year they trumpeted the biggest gas deal in history. The summer will be bookended by two striking events: Russian and Chinese warships puttering about together in the eastern Mediterranean in May, gaming war; and Russian and Chinese presidents standing shoulder to shoulder in Beijing for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in September.
So how robust is the Russia-China axis?
Geopolitics
For China, one of the main attractions of closer relations with Russia is the potential for challenging Washingtons still dominant global position.
In China, where until recently the official line was non-alignment, some prominent scholars have started to make unambiguous calls for a comprehensive strategic alliance with Russia, Alexander Korolev, at the National University of Singapores centre on Asia and globalisation, argued recently . [They are] arguing on the pages of the CCP [Communist party] central party schools internal publications that China-Russia strategic relations are the most substantive ones and elsewhere that China will be unable to shift the world from unipolarity to bipolarity unless it forms a formal alliance with Russia.
But often cooperation and tension are two sides of the same coin. Take Central Asia. Chinas president, Xi Jinping , has set his sights on a new silk road, using Chinas billions to help neighbours and regional allies to develop, indirectly supporting growth at home and the expansion of Chinese soft power.
However, this is also Russias traditional sphere of influence and any Chinese presence that goes beyond commercial dealings is likely to raise hackles in Moscow.
Its totally possible for China to develop its relations with central Asian countries without challenging Russia, said Liu Jun, a Russian studies expert at East China Normal University. Its true that Russia would be concerned if Chinas influence in Central Asia grew too much, but the concerns are not mainstream in the bilateral relations  there are more benefits in cooperation than otherwise.
Russia shares the strategic goal of challenging US hegemony in favour of a more multipolar world, and the two powers often find themselves on the same side in the UN security council, where they wield vetoes as permanent members.

No deal on regulating Irans nuclear programme can be made without Russia and China, which have staunchly backed its atomic expansion in the past, and the two countries support is largely the reason Bashar al-Assad has been able to hold on to power in Syria. Recently, Russia has been making political and economic overtures to North Korea, which relies on food, arms and energy from its key ally, China, to survive.
As they support the idea of a multipolar world against American dominance, Moscow and Beijing will also tacitly back each others attempts to defend their own spheres of influence, said Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. In the past two years, Russia has annexed Crimea and backed a separatist campaign to frustrate Ukraines turn to the west, and China has been disputing islands with western allies in the South China Sea.
China admits de facto that Russia has interests in eastern Europe , Russia admits that China has interests around the perimeter of its borders, and even though neither will actively help its partner in Ukraine or the South China Sea, both will observe an advantageous neutrality, Trenin said. There wont be criticism of each other in the areas of their core interests.
Leadership
Government enthusiasm for warmer ties with Russia is summed up by a recent video from the state-controlled Xinhua news agency entitled What Do Chinese People Think About Russia?
It features Chinese children describing Russia as even bigger than China, an old man praising Russias strength, demands for more investment, gas sales, a high-speed train, and plenty of airtime given to adulation of the Russian president.
Putin has long been popular in China, where he is seen as a strong leader who has bolstered national pride, and is not a little admired for his topless photo shoots. Putin youre a handsome man, says one middle-aged woman on being asked what message she would like to send to Moscow.
There is also an overt comparison to Xi, who has fostered a personality cult of bold leadership that has echoes of the Russian leaders (though with less bare flesh). Putin is the same as our Papa Xi, says one young man, using a government endorsed affectionate term for the president.
For their part, Russians are more ambivalent about Xi, who has a far lower profile in Russia than does his counterpart in China.
Trade
Chinas interest in Russian exports has until now been largely focused on natural resources and military hardware. Beyond that they do not make natural partners. Russia can offer little by way of famous brands or innovation in consumer technology to tempt ordinary Chinese customers.
Its a good thing that there is political will behind the business cooperation. Without it, a lot of things wont happen, Liu said. Most big projects are backed by the governments and the volume of trade along the border is quite small.
The imbalance of the relationship can be seen in the breakdown of their bilateral trade, worth around $100bn a year. China is Russias second largest trading partner after the EU, while Russia only just scraped into a list of Chinas top 10 trading partners, accounting for barely 3% of the countrys total trade volume.
Moscow is also hoping Beijing will help with finance for businesses, after western funds dried up last year. Some Chinese firms have seen the Russian economic wobble as an opportunity to make capital investments in the country.
Energy
China and Russia should make natural partners in energy deals, but in reality they have struggled to turn past agreements into real supply deals; pipelines announced last decade have still not been built because of disagreements over pricing and other conditions.
Earlier this year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil to China for the first time, with Russian exports to China more than doubling since 2010. But Beijing is accustomed to shopping around for energy and driving a very cheap bargain with its suppliers, while Russia is used to controlling prices for European customers with few other options.
The expansion of shale gas production may have weakened Russias hand by improving global supply, but China is also increasingly concerned about climate change and needs to wean itself off the dirty coal that still provides well over half its energy.
Since Russia has rarely agreed to sell stakes in strategic land-based deposits to western companies, Putins offer of a stake in state oil champion Rosnefts biggest production asset, the Vankor oilfields, to China in September underlined the new direction the countrys energy policy is taking.

The offer was made at a ceremony to start construction of Russias $55bn Power of Siberia pipeline, a breakthrough project that is planned to deliver an annual 38bn cubic metres of gas to eastern China over the next 30 years. In November, the two countries also signed a framework agreement for an Altai gas pipeline to potentially supply 30bn cubic metres of gas to western China each year for 30 years.
But neither pipeline deal appears to have been completely finalised, and economic sanctions and a weak rouble will probably make financing the huge projects difficult for Russias Gazprom.
It seems like at every meeting theres some sort of document signed and hailed as another big agreement  but Gazprom will need to develop large fields and construct the pipelines, said Grigory Birg, an analyst at Investcafe. I think in the current environment securing the finances is the major holdup, and we dont have any indication as to the economics of the project.
Although Birg estimated the rate of return on the Power of Siberia investment to be a modest 9% to 10% when the deal was signed, the profitability is likely to be even less if global oil prices remain weak. Beijing will, by all appearances, be able to drive an even harder bargain for the gas price under the proposed Altai pipeline to western China, a region that has less demand than the industrialised east of the country and already receives cheap gas from nearby Turkmenistan.
Nonetheless, analysts expect energy cooperation to continue to grow as Russia seeks alternatives to the politically thorny European market, and China addresses growing demand and problems with pollution and blackouts. Last year, China replaced Germany as Russias biggest buyer of crude oil. China is the major alternative market and is easily accessible for Russia given the [location of energy] reserves and the geopolitical partnership, so its an obvious fit, Birg said. But the timing at which it is happening is not in favour of Russia.
Pipeline to china
Currency
Both Russia and China have an interest in loosening the US dollars dominance in global trade as the worlds reserve currency. Russia now accepts yuan for oil payments (something that other oil exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, dont do).
Following the imposition of sanctions, Russian companies and banks  traditionally reliant on dollar-denominated syndicated loans  started to look to China for a financial escape route. The rouble-yuan currency pair reached records in trading volumes last summer.
Russian companies are not new to the renminbi market, nor to the issuing of dim sum bonds  bonds denominated in Chinese yuan and largely issued by entities based in China or Hong Kong. In the past these options represented a cheaper source of funding. Now theyre a necessity. However, yields on Russian corporate bonds denominated in yuan have increased as the list of sanctions started mounting up.
Military
Russian arms sales to China have been estimated at $1bn a year, the Russians were previously hesitant to give advanced weaponry to the Soviet Unions one-time military rival. But the recent announcement by Russias state arms exporter of a deal to supply China with its S-400 surface-to-air missile systems has taken their relationship to a new level at a time when Beijing is seeking new air and naval defence technologies.
The higher-level arms sales have been accompanied by greater military cooperation, which was on display in May with the war games in the Mediterranean Sea. Such exercises in what has traditionally been a Nato pond are designed to expand the Chinese navys reach while showing the United States that Russia is a potentially important military partner, according to Trenin.
Following the Ukraine crisis, which soured relations with the west, he said the main considerations behind Russias entente with China were political. Now Russia has an important stimulus to grow relations with China, because relations with the west are troubled, and China is the only large player in the world that can be considered as economic, political and to a certain extent military ally, Trenin said.
China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies
Both sides, meanwhile, are concerned that the unrest in Pakistan and Afghanistan could spill over into their territory, or serve as incubators for militants who may one day return home.
But none of that means that either side has forgotten past disputes or present differences. Russia is nervous about China sapping its revenue by reverse engineering the equipment it buys, and is also monitoring Beijing closely for any attempts to project military power into central Asia.
China and Russias strategic partnership is a result of the times, but it is totally different from a military alliance such as the one between the US and Japan, the Global Times, a Chinese nationalist tabloid, said in a recent editorial.
China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies. They do mean that. China also cares about relations with western countries. Russia does not want to see relations with the west become a deadlock.
UN vetoes
Cyber security
Both Russia and China share a concern over the US domination of the internet. In January, Russia, China and a number of central Asian dictatorships jointly submitted a new proposal for an international code of conduct on information security to the UN general assembly.
In a clause clearly aimed at the US, the document calls for countries not to use information and communications technologies and  networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other states or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability.
At a recent internet security forum in Moscow, officials from both countries called for a new approach to online security.
Its great they [the US] invented the iPhone but when you open your iPhone and see the camera you have to guess whether its photographing you at that moment or not, said Konstantin Malofeyev, a controversial businessman known for his backing for the Russian Orthodox church and the pro-Russian separatist movement in east Ukraine. Russia went into space first and Antarctic first but we dont control those things, they are controlled by international charters. Why should the US control the internet?

Chinese official Chen Xiaohua said: We should join hands to build cyberspace order. Various countries share a consistent vision of enhancing the governance of cyberspace  following the principles of mutual trust and mutual respect.
In the meantime, Beijing and Moscow signed a landmark cyber-security deal recently that could bolster defence against external attack as well as allowing them to share technology for domestic control.
The two countries have poured resources into managing the internet, aiming to curb its potential as a platform for dissent. Beijings great firewall is a powerful and sophisticated filter of the online world, but is still porous enough that most people inside China do not need to bother trying to evade it.
Both countries also field armies of both hackers and paid pro-government commenters, known in China as the 50 cent group, because of how much they are paid for each post. However, experts say their focus on internal controls may have come at the expense of security.
Prioritising political information control over technical cyber defence also damages Chinas own cybersecurity, Jon Lindsay of Harvard Universitys Belfer centre for science and international affairs said in a recent briefing . Lax law enforcement and poor cyber defences leave the country vulnerable to both cyber criminals and foreign spies.
Business mood
Among some business people, there is a fear that the enforced turn to the east will mean Russia selling out from a position of weakness.
The downturn in relations with the west is bad for Russia and bad for the west; the only beneficiary is China, one top Russian businessman said. The number of Chinese delegations coming to Russia has gone up tenfold, and the Chinese will only enter the market when they see the conditions are very beneficial to them.
Russian media have been told to play up links with China and other non-western countries, and companies have felt pressure from the government to look eastwards even if it makes little business sense. But what initially seemed pointless may be starting to bear some fruit.
It started as theatre, but now there are some companies out there really getting stuff done, said Tom Blackwell, CEO of EM, a consultancy firm that has worked with a number of major Russian companies on exploring the Chinese market. Chinese investment funds have very little experience or knowledge about Russia and its a hard sell. But the strategy seems to be to do the big state deals first and assume smaller ones will follow. Slowly, real things are happening.
Russias federal migration service is especially wary of an influx of Chinese migrants across the Russia-China border. It has stated that Chinese could become the largest ethnic group in Russias far east by the 2020s or 2030s; last summer a border official said that 1.5 million Chinese illegally entered the region from January 2013 to June 2014.

Australian swimming legend Dawn Fraser has apologised after she launched an extraordinary attack on tennis star Nick Kyrgios in the wake of his heated Wimbledon round-of-16 defeat to Richard Gasquet.
Fraser lambasted Kyrgios and compatriot Bernard Tomic on Tuesday morning on Australian television for their childish behaviour during this weeks Championships.
But the former Olympic gold medallist went a step further by suggesting both players should go back to where their parents came from if they were going to maintain such an attitude.

Fraser later said: I want to unreservedly apologise for any comments that I made this morning which may have caused offence to my fellow Australians, including Nick and his family. The live-to-air clip was part of a larger un-broadcasted interview however this does not condone what was said.
My intended message, which was not delivered as articulately as it could have been  was on a purely sporting level rather than meant as an attack on Nicks ethnicity. Nicks representing Australia and I want to see him representing Australian tennis in the best possible light.
Representing your country is the highest accolade for any athlete and being selected for Australia is both a privilege and an honour. Not only do you represent yourself, your team, your fans, your family, but you are representing the heritage of the competition and acting as a role model for young Australians.
Frasers comments emerged during an interview on Channel Nines Today program. Responding to a question from host Karl Stefanovic about Kyrgioss behaviour at Wimbledon and Tomics attack on Tennis Australia , which led to him being dumped from the Davis Cup team, Fraser said: They should be setting a better example for the younger generation of this country, a great country of ours.
If they dont like it, go back to where their fathers or their parents came from. We dont need them here in this country if they act like that.
Stefanovic glossed over the comments, but Kyrgios posted on his Facebook page after the interview in response to Fraser.
Throwing a racket, brat. Debating the rules, disrespectful. Frustrated when competing, spoilt. Showing emotion, arrogant. Blatant racist, Australian legend, he wrote.
His mother, Nill Kyrgios, said on Twitter that Frasers attack was out of line.
 nill kyrgios (@nillkyrgios) July 7, 2015
I have no comments on Dawn Frasers nasty racist attack...but she is out of line. #unaustralianbehaviour
Kyrgios was born in Canberra. His father Giorgios hails from Greece and Nill Kyrgios was born in Malaysia.
Tomic is German-born, with a Croatian father and Bosnian mother. The family migrated to the Gold Coast when Tomic was three.
Frasers comments were also criticised by Australias race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane. He told the National Press Club on Tuesday: Contrary to what the likes of Dawn Fraser might say, most Australians do not tell migrants and their children to go back to where they came from.

It is not the first time Fraser has made controversial remarks about race. In 1997 she said she was sympathetic to the cause of Pauline Hanson and considered standing for Hansons rightwing One Nation party in the 1998 election. At the time she said of refugees: Weve got a lot of problems in our own country and we should be looking at our own first, before looking overseas.
Kyrgios had earlier denied tanking against Gasquet and pushed back at questions over his on-court behaviour in his post-match press conference . Kyrgios faced a potential $US20,000 (A$27,000) fine under grand slam best effort rules, but fended off accusations that he had stopped trying.
Of course I tried, he said. There was a lot of ups and downs. It was a tough, tough time, especially when hes not missing any balls.
Im getting frustrated myself. I feel as if Im playing not how I should be playing. Im angry at myself.

Somalias al-Shabaab group has claimed responsibility for a gun and grenade attack that killed 14 sleeping quarry workers and wounded many others in northern Kenya. The attack was staged only weeks before a visit by President Barack Obama to the east African country.
Gunmen raided the remote village of Soko Mbuzi near the Somalia border at about 1am on Tuesday, smashing through a gate using a petrol bomb before hurling grenades at workers and spraying those who tried to flee with bullets.
Local police chiefs said the attack bore all the hallmarks of the al-Qaida affiliate, which has been blamed for a series of atrocities in east Africa .
All indications are that they were al-Shabaab militants. They destroyed metal grilled doors before they bombed the houses and opened fire on the innocent victims, the Mandera county commissioner, Alex Ole Nkoyo, told the Standard newspaper .
An al-Shabaab spokesman later claimed responsibility, telling Reuters the raid was part of its campaign against Kenya .
Several victims were rushed to hospital although the number of the injured was unclear.
The killings follow a pattern in which al-Shabaab militants have targeted non-locals working in the predominantly Muslim region near the Kenyan-Somalia border. Workers from areas outside the region tend to be Christian.
In December, 36 quarry workers were killed in similar circumstances in the same county.
Kenya has been on a heightened state of alert since it was announced in March that Obama will tour the country at the end of July to attend a global entrepreneurship summit.
Although the visit has generated considerable enthusiasm, in part due to the fact Obamas father was Kenyan, there are concerns militants could take advantage of the occasion to stage attacks.
Hundreds of security officers have been mobilised to bolster security and surveillance cameras have been installed in many streets in the capital, Nairobi. But al-Shabaab has shown itself capable of operating at will in the vast, historically marginalised region near the Somalia border where they are most active.
After a particularly shocking shooting rampage in a university in the northern town of Garissa left 148 students and security students dead in April, Obama called his Kenyan counterpart, Uhuru Kenyatta, to offer his support and said he would not change his plans to visit the country.
The Kenyatta government, which has come under intense public pressure to contain the al-Shabaab attacks, is expected to find itself under increasing scrutiny in the weeks leading up to Obamas visit.

Migrant dies on UK-bound freight train near Calais
Death is second in two weeks amid migrant crisis at French port, causing delayed passenger services and freight traffic

A migrant has died on a freight train while trying to reach Britain from the French side of the Channel, the second fatality in as many weeks.
The incident happened at about 6am (5am BST) on Tuesday near Calais. Freight traffic was disrupted but there were also delays to passenger services.
A Eurotunnel spokesman said: At 5.30am, the presence of migrants was reported on a freight shuttle just entering the tunnel.
Safety procedures apply automatically if there is any human presence in the tunnel, therefore the train was brought to a controlled stop and the overhead power was cut. The French police conducted a search, in the process of which they found a migrant who they declared deceased a short while later.
There are no details yet about the age, sex or nationality of the migrant.
An Eritrean man died while trying to get on a train at Coquelles last month. The latest death occurred as migrants tried to clamber on to a freight train. It was unclear how many were involved, but it was thought to be fewer than a dozen. Such incidents have become a regular occurrence as migrants resort to ever more desperate tactics to enter the UK.
Last year, a Guardian investigation revealed that at least 15 people living in the makeshift camps in Calais had died trying to reach the UK in just 12 months. Aid workers have said the situation has got worse in the past six months.
The travel disruption caused by the death of the migrant led Kent Police to implement Operation Stack on the M20 coastbound carriageway.
The force said: Due to this mornings disruption at the Channel Tunnel, all motorists are warned of significant disruption to their journeys.
Anyone intending to travel across the Channel is advised to check with the operator before starting their journey.
 Eurotunnel LeShuttle (@LeShuttle) July 7, 2015
Confirmation that due to migrants found on freight shuttle, we expect delays to Passenger service of 3hrs from UK &amp; 60mins from France . ^LE
Eurotunnel recommended that day trippers rearrange their travel for another date due to the length of delays.
Last week, about 150 migrants caused delays and cancellations when they tried to storm the Channel tunnel terminal in France amid calls for a resolution to the Calais migrant crisis.
About 3,000 people displaced from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan have set up camp near the port. French aid workers have described the situation at the camp, known as Jungle 2, as catastrophic.
Industrial action by ferry workers this summer has compounded the problems faced by truck drivers, with migrants trying to get on their UK-bound HGVs. Last week, more than 3,000 lorry drivers had to queue in high temperatures on the M20 during a wildcat strike by ferry workers in France.
Related: Migrant reportedly dies trying to board Channel tunnel freight train
French authorities have been criticised for not doing enough to safeguard lorry drivers from intimidation, violence and attempts by migrants to board their vehicles. Migrants have tried to board slow-moving or queuing UK-bound vehicles, forcing some drivers to take long detours to avoid Calais.
In a letter to the prime minister, David Cameron, the Freight Transport Association (FTA) said the death highlighted the need for urgent action.
David Wells, the FTA chief executive, said: It is a tragedy that the deplorable situation in Calais has resulted in a fatality, but it was clear that the issue at the port was spiralling out of control. We have been calling on the British and French governments to intervene for some time, and are now asking the prime minister to give the matter his urgent priority and implement plans to alleviate the crisis.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has called for the deployment of the French military to boost security in Calais. The Fresh Produce Consortium estimates that 10m-worth of fresh fruit and vegetables has been thrown away since the start of the year because of the problems in Calais.
Port of Dover officials said last weeks ferry strike cost the UK economy 1bn. They have joined calls for robust contingency plans to be introduced to ensure the port works smoothly.
Theresa May, the home secretary, and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, agreed last week to increase the joint intervention fund to improve security around the port and the Channel tunnel. They said they would rush through the improvement work, including measures to prevent access to the Channel tunnel.

        <title>Donald Trump: Mexican migrants bring 'tremendous infectious disease' to US</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/donald-trump-mexican-immigrants-tremendous-infectious-disease</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Related: Divided Mexico unites against Trump: 'He has no respect for human beings'
The would-be president and billionaire businessman, who has already branded Mexican immigrants to the US as criminals, drug dealers and rapists, accused the Mexican government of forcing their most unwanted people into the United States which has become a dumping ground for Mexico.
The worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government, Trump said in a statement he released on Monday, which criticised the media for deliberately distorting his earlier remarks .
The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The border patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.
Trump, who has lost several business deals as a result of his comments about Mexico , said his previous remarks  Theyre bringing drugs, theyre bringing crime, theyre rapists  could not have been simpler or more accurately stated.
The Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc, Trump said. This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a five time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didnt want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States. In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government.
Trump went on to accuse Mexico of wanting an open border with the US but only as long as its a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.
He attempted to temper his comments by saying that as well as the criminal immigrants, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it.
I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans  many of them are working for and with me ... and, just like our country, my organization is better for it, he said. I have great respect for Mexico and I love their people and their peoples great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours.
Trump said his message to citizens of the United States was that the Mexican government is not our friend.
Trumps statement is full of highly questionable assertions however, starting with the idea that immigrants are flowing unchecked over the Mexico border. Data from both the US and Mexican governments shows that net immigration has actually been steadily falling in recent years.
The idea that the Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States also seems to have little basis in reality: in the past year a crackdown by Mexican forces has dramatically reduced the flow of migrants into the US.
Meanwhile, migration experts often stress that the migrants prepared to take the considerable risks of heading north tend to be among the most determined, hard-working and ambitious family members.
Nor is there much evidence to back Trumps assertion that the Mexican government wants a one-way border into the United States. President Enrique Pea Nietos government is frequently criticized in Mexico for doing very little to push for a relaxation of the border or lobby for the rights of Mexican immigrants. The only major migration-related initiative attributed to the government in an effort to achieve such goals is the allegation that it is cracking down on Central American migrants in transit through Mexico in order to get privileges for Mexicans.
Trump said he lost a lot during the presidential run defending the people of the United States including deals with department store Macys, NBC, Univision and a host of other TV networks and sports organisations including Nascar. Macys, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country, he said.
This past weekend, the former Apprentice star said that while the outcry may have hurt him financially, his open criticism was helping his cause as voters agreed with him. I believe in punching back. You know I dont think theyve [the media] treated me fairly, he said on Fox News Sunday. A while ago they said hes never going to run, hes never going to run.
Then I ran. Then they said, Hes never going to file his papers. Then I filed my papers. Now they dont know what to say. Now, all of the sudden, I get these really big poll numbers. And, theyre really good. Although I think theyre going to go higher because I really think people agree with what I say about the border and just agree with me, period.
In several recent polls Trump was behind only Jeb Bush in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

Billions in gas projects stranded by climate change action, says thinktank
Carbon Tracker report reveals keeping to emissions targets would render obsolete more than $280bn worth of global liquefied natural gas projects

More than $280bn (180bn) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects being planned over the next decade risk becoming stranded if global action is taken to limit climate change to 2C, according to a report by the thinktank Carbon Tracker .
LNG projects allow gas to be compressed into tankers and sold around the world, making it key to hopes in the US, Canada and Australia of fully exploiting their gas reserves.
But the new analysis shows that if emissions are cut to keep global temperature rise below the internationally agreed target many LNG projects being considered will not be needed.
The report concludes that over the next 10 years $82bn of LNG plants in Canada would be surplus to requirements, $71bn in the US and $68bn in Australia, with the rest of the world, led by Russia and Indonesia, accounting for the remaining $59bn.
The analysis found Shells agreed takeover of BG makes it by far the biggest player in the market and $85bn of the combined companys potential LNG projects would not be needed.
Shell said it was only the biggest in LNG compared to oil majors, and no comparison had been with national oil companies.
The report is the latest to raise concerns that increasing action to cut carbon emissions, combined with falling renewable energy prices, will put some fossil fuel investments at risk. Carbon Tracker has pioneered this analysis, which has been backed by the Bank of England and the World Bank .
Investors should scrutinise the true potential for growth of LNG businesses over the next decade, said James Leaton, Carbon Trackers head of research. The current oversupply of LNG means there is already a pipeline of projects waiting to come on stream. It is not clear whether these will be needed and generate value for shareholders.
The Carbon Tracker report examined the LNG, North American and European gas markets in the light of scenarios produced by the International Energy Agency in which carbon emissions are cut to limit global warming. It ranked the future gas projects being considered by cost and found that those producing gas at over $10/mmBtu risked being stranded by an international crackdown on emissions.
Previous Carbon Tracker reports have shown that coal and oil use must decline in future decades to tackle climate change, potentially leaving $1tn of oil projects unable to make a return .
But gas, which produces fewer emissions when burned, could continue to grow to 2040, the new report finds. However, not all the planned projects could go ahead. The analysis finds that 16 of the worlds 20 biggest LNG companies are considering future major projects that are unlikely to be needed to meet gas demand to 2025 if climate change is tackled.
The golden age of gas once mooted by energy commentators has not arrived in most regions, the report states. With the costs of renewables falling, gas is already struggling to compete in some markets, or could be priced out soon in others. The shale gas revolution in the US has been the exception, but this has not been replicated in Europe where the swing has been from coal to renewables.
A spokeswoman for Shell said: At Shell, we believe that overall energy demand could double by 2050 driven by population growth and rising prosperity. The energy system is in long term transition as society looks to a lower carbon future, but peoples desire for a decent quality of life and less CO2 require both renewables and cleaner hydrocarbons such as natural gas and LNG to provide a full suite of energy products, from power to plastics.
Natural gas  methane  is a potent greenhouse gas and the fuel is only cleaner than coal if leaks of methane are kept low. Stopping these fugitive emissions should therefore be a priority for the industry, says the report. It adds: At the gas prices in our scenarios, capturing this lost product should more than pay for itself, so there is little excuse for not dealing with the problem.
The report does not expect fracking to be significant source of gas in the UK in the next decade. The economics shows UK unconventional supply will struggle to compete in the gas market over the next decade, and shale gas could only contribute a tiny volume if projects do go ahead, concluded Andrew Grant, lead analyst at Carbon Tracker.

Pope Francis has used his first mass in Ecuador to ask for support in his efforts to reach out to Catholics who feel shunned by the Church when the worlds bishops gather at the Vatican in October.
Speaking to 800,000 people on the first leg of his homecoming tour of South America, the 78-year-old pope weaved his homily around the theme of the family, which will be the subject of the monthlong synod at the Vatican .
The meeting is expected to discuss ways to reach out to Catholics who have divorced and remarried outside the Church. Under current rules, they are prohibited from receiving communion unless they abstain from sexual relations.

The gathering is also expected to discuss how the Church should reach out to homosexual Catholics.
The pope said the synod would consider concrete solutions to the many difficult and significant challenges facing families in our time.
He asked for prayers for the synod so that God can take even what might seem to us impure, scandalous or threatening and turn it ... into a miracle. The family today is in need of a miracle.
Conservative bishops oppose any changes regarding the divorced and remarried. At a preparatory meeting last year they botched conciliatory language on the pastoral care of gay couples.
Asked about the popes words on the synod, the Vatican spokesman said Francis was not referring to specific controversies but that he wanted the synod to find ways to help people move from a situation of sin to a situation of grace.
The Argentine-born pontiff delivered his remarks in Ecuadors second city Guayaquil, a steamy port sometimes referred to as the worlds banana capital.
In line with his simple style, Francis rode into the city in a small silver Fiat marked for the occasion with Vatican City number plates  SCV 1  standing for Stato della Citta del Vaticano or State of Vatican City.
Tens of thousands of people lined the route from the airport , at times rushing police to touch the car and throw flower petals before it.
His eyes often squinting in the sun, Francis switched to an open jeep when he reached the sprawling mass site and rode though the crowd, which authorities estimated at about 800,000.
Ive come to this spiritual encounter to ask the pope to heal me because I have cancer, said Franklin Borbor, 48, who despite his illness traveled more than five hours to find his place in the park.
Others came from as far away as Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico.
In his homily, the pope also called for a rekindling of family values and solidarity with the elderly, the abandoned and the unemployed.
How many of our adolescents and young people sense that (love and happiness) are no longer found in their homes? How many women, sad and lonely, wonder when love left, when it slipped away from their lives? How many elderly people feel left out of family celebrations, cast aside and longing each day for a little love? he said.
He said the family was the best social capital and could not be replaced by other institutions.
After the mass, Francis went to a Jesuit-run school to visit an old friend he has not seen in three decades, the cigar-smoking reverend Francisco Cortes.
When he was a seminary director in Argentina, Francis, then Father Jorge Bergoglio, would send seminarians to the school to study theology with Cortes, now a diminutive 91-year-old Spaniard affectionately known as Father Paquito.
The popes visit to Guayaquil took on extra significance for Ecuador , and its leftist President Rafael Correa, given it has been the epicenter of anti-government protests for weeks.
Francis was to hold talks with Correa later on Monday.
Thousands have been taking to the streets in Guayaquil and elsewhere to protest tax changes and what they see as state authoritarianism. Correa says the reforms will only affect the super-wealthy and accuses his foes of seeking a coup detat.
Protest leaders have called a truce during the papal visit.
The popes coming is putting a bit of peace in the hearts of we Ecuadoreans, said Jose Paldarreaga, 64, a participant at the mass in Guayaquil.
After Ecuador, the pope visits Bolivia and Paraguay on a tour encompassing three of the poorest and smallest countries in South America. The pope visited Brazil for a youth festival in 2013 but that was to substitute for predecessor Benedict after his sudden resignation.

This broader challenge of countering violent extremism is not simply a military effort, Obama said in remarks from the Pentagon on Monday. Ideologies are not defeated by guns. Theyre defeated with better ideas  a more attractive and more compelling vision.
This larger battle for hearts and minds is going to be a generational struggle, he added. Its ultimately not going to be won or lost by the United States alone. It will be decided by the countries and communities that terrorists like Isil [an alternative acronym for Islamic State/Isis] target.
Obamas remarks followed a rare visit by the commander-in-chief to the Pentagon, where he was briefed by top national security and military officials on the ongoing US campaign against the Islamic State. The meeting also came after the United States was placed on high alert over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, amid repeated warnings of Isis-inspired attacks that did not materialize.

Obama acknowledged the threat posed by lone wolf terrorists, citing an attack in May when two gunmen opened fire outside a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Texas. The incident, for which Isis claimed responsibility but to which it has not been directly linked, was evidence that militant groups have successfully convinced vulnerable people both in the US and around the world to join their fight, Obama said.
Numerous individuals have been arrested across the country for plotting attacks inspired by Isis or attempting to join the group in Syria or Iraq, he added, while still pointing out that improvements to homeland security have successfully prevented another large-scale 9/11-style event.
The threat of lone wolves or small cells of terrorists is complex, its harder to detect and harder to prevent, Obama said. That means that were going to have to pick up our game to prevent these attacks.
To meet that objective, the president said the US government will step up efforts to counter Isis propaganda online and partner with Muslim communities who must reject the groups warped interpretations of Islam and the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks.
Obama also criticized the Republican-led US Senate for failing to confirm Adam Szubin, the presidents nominee to serve as undersecretary at the Treasury Department. If confirmed, Szubin would play a leading role in cracking down on illicit funding to groups like Isis.
Earlier on Monday, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, lamented that Republicans had refused thus far to hold even a hearing, let alone a vote, on Szubins confirmation even though Obama nominated him in April.
Although he did not lay out a shift in his administrations strategy against Isis, Obama pledged to do more to train and equip moderate rebel forces in Syria. Responding to a question, the president also said there are no current plans to send additional US troops overseas but said he would do whatevers necessary to protect our homeland.

The possibility exists that Edward Snowden could make a deal with the US Justice Department and return to his home country, former US attorney general Eric Holder says.
Asked by Yahoo News in a Monday interview if the Justice Department might be open to a plea bargain that let the NSA whistleblower come back from Moscow, Holder said: I certainly think there could be a basis for a resolution that everybody could ultimately be satisfied with. I think the possibility exists.
The former attorney general, who left the Obama administration in April, also said that Snowdens revelations to the Guardian and the Washington Post of mass US and UK surveillance had spurred a necessary debate.
We are in a different place as a result of the Snowden disclosures, Holder said.
Holder, who has returned to Washington law firm Covington &amp; Burling, has previously said the US would be willing to engage in conversation with Snowden about returning to face charges, but the new comments appear to go slightly further.
But a spokeswoman for Loretta Lynch, Holders replacement, told Yahoo News the Obama administrations position had not changed. This is an ongoing case so I am not going to get into specific details but I can say our position regarding bringing Edward Snowden back to the United States to face charges has not changed, Melanie Newman said in an email.

None of the 16 declared or likely Republican presidential candidates came out in favour of the supreme courts ruling backing gay marriage last month, but one candidate stood out for the stridency of his opposition: Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin.
Calling the ruling a grave mistake, Walker issued a bristling statement that picked a fight not only with the decision but with the supreme court as an institution, dismissing the majority as five unelected judges with political agendas.
It is comments like these that have made Walker such an exciting potential candidate for conservative donors who have watched his struggle in Wisconsin against public-sector unions with admiration. Walker, who is expected to launch his presidential campaign next week, does not just use fighting words. He has shown that he means what he says  and is willing to draw blood.
As such Walker can be divisive, and on this issue he has proven himself so even among his own family.
Both of Walkers sons challenged their father after the supreme court ruling, according to Walkers wife, Tonette Walker, who spoke with the Washington Post in a revealing interview published at the weekend. She said she herself was torn over the issue.
That was a hard one, Tonette Walker said of the same-sex marriage ruling. Our sons were disappointed  I was torn. I have children who are very passionate, and Scott was on his side very passionate.
Its hard for me because I have a cousin who I love dearly  she is like a sister to me  who is married to a woman, her partner of 18 years.
The Republican party has a long history , from former vice-president Dick Cheney to senators Rob Portman and Jeff Flake to former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, of politicians kids leading their parents on marriage equality. The phenomenon reflects a generational gap on the issue.
For Walker the issue is especially loaded, however, because it represents more than a family conflict. It points to a key challenge as he seeks to expand his regional base in the northern midwest: will he prove versatile enough on the campaign trail to appeal to people who were not born agreeing with him?
The country has left Walker  and the rest of the Republican leadership  behind on marriage equality, with a record 60% of Americans now in favor, according to a Gallup survey from before the recent supreme court ruling.
The two Republican candidates who are demonstrating, at this very early stage, the broadest national appeal subtly bowed to those numbers in their responses last month to the Obergefell v Hodges ruling, going out of their way not to pick a fight.
Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and brother of former president George W Bush, said that we should love our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments.
Marco Rubio, the current Florida senator, included a line about how every American has the right to pursue happiness as they see fit.
Walker, by contrast, called for the extraordinary step of amending the US constitution  something that has happened only twice since the civil rights era of the mid-1960s  to block gay marriage, saying that an amendment was the only alternative left for the American people.
That intransigence could add up to difficulty with donors for Walker, too, according to reporting by Politico. The Wisconsin governor enjoys a regional base of support in the wealthy Koch and Ricketts families, big donors who share an enthusiasm for Walkers fiscal purity. But Walker has failed to gain comparable traction among influential Republican donors on Wall Street, who are skeptical about his moral purity.
There are signs that Walker may yet modulate his message. He told the Post that his familys input on marriage equality had encouraged him to find a different way of explaining it, so they can appreciate where I am coming from.
He added: It doesnt mean I change my position.

A girl aged about 13 was killed when explosives strapped to her body went off near a major mosque in northern Nigerias largest city Kano, police said, adding that no one else was caught up in the blast.
Kano police spokesman Musa Magaji Majia said on Monday that the explosion occurred at a roundabout, about 200 metres from the Umar bin Khattab mosque, where worshippers had gathered for prayers.
She blew up killing herself. Nobody else was hurt in the incident, he said of the blast, which happened at about 9:00 pm.
Police bomb squad officers were deployed to the scene to ensure there were no other explosives left nearby, he added.
A police source added: Its very likely the mosque was her target, but the explosives went off prematurely.
Boko Haram militants have increasingly used young girls and women as human bombs in their six-year insurgency to establish a hardline Islamic state in north-east Nigeria.
On Sunday night, rebel fighters fired shots and a rocket-propelled grenade at a mosque as part of a twin assault on the central city of Jos, which killed at least 44 people .
Earlier in the day, five people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a church in the north-eastern city of Potiskum.
Indiscriminate targeting of civilians, both Muslim and Christian alike, has been a feature of the rebellion, which has so far claimed at least 15,000 lives and left more than 1.5 million others homeless.

After receiving the report, the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said a further inquiry or investigation would be necessary to finally establish the facts surrounding the mysterious crash more than 50 years ago.
The panel found new information, which it assessed as having moderate probative value, sufficient to further pursue aerial attack or other interference as a hypothesis of the possible cause of the crash, said UN spokesman Farhan Haq.
The answers may lie in classified documents from the United States and Britain that the panel was unable to consult, despite requests for access.
Ban said he would follow up on the requests.
The UNs second secretary-general, Hammarskjld died when his plane crashed on 17 or 18 September 1961 near Ndola, in Northern Rhodesia, now known as Zambia.
The 56-year-old Swedish diplomat was on his way to negotiate a ceasefire for mining-rich Katanga province in what was then the Republic of the Congo, which had proclaimed independence from Belgium.
The three-person panel spoke to witnesses in Zambia who testified that there was more than one aircraft in the air when the plane made its approach to Ndola, or that the plane was on fire before it hit the ground.

These accounts seemed to corroborate information contained in a 2013 report by a separate commission that concluded that there was  convincing evidence  that the plane was shot down as it prepared to land.
A former US air force security officer, Paul Abram, told the panel that he heard transmissions about the shooting down of an aircraft near Congo while serving at a National Security Agency listening post in Greece.
The panel said it could not authenticate Abrams claims.
The US government wrote in a letter to the panel last month that a search had not revealed any documents on radio transmissions but added that other files classified as top secret from the National Security Agency would not be released.
Among the new information uncovered by the panel was a declassified report from a senior British diplomat to a secret service agent, Neil Ritchie, who details how he helped the Katanga leader Moise Tshombe travel to Ndola for his meeting with Hammarskjld.
The report did not mention the possible crash but its existence and content serves as new information about the presence of the British intelligence agency in the area, said the UN panel.
The British government responded last month in a letter to the panel that it would not be able to provide more information on the case due to security concerns.
The UN General Assembly in late December adopted a resolution, drafted by Sweden, that called for the new investigation to finally shed light on the top diplomats death.
Led by the Tanzanian prosecutor Mohamed Chande Othman, the panel also included Kerryn Macaulay of Australia and Henrik Larsen of Denmark.

South Carolina lawmakers take first step to remove Confederate flag

South Carolinas state senate has voted to take down the Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds in Columbia, the first of several steps needed for it to eventually be removed.
State senators voted 37-3 on Monday in favor of removing the flag from a memorial on the capitol grounds, but the bill must go for a third and final reading before it can go before the house, where it must pass by a two-thirds vote before heading to the governor.
The third reading is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, said lieutenant governor Henry McMaster.
The push to take down the flag became more urgent for activists after a 21-year-old man killed nine black people in a Charleston church. Days after the killing, images emerged of him posing next to a Confederate flag, a symbol of the part of the United States that seceded in response to the Unions decision to make slavery illegal.
One of the victims, Clementa Pinckney, worked inside the statehouse building as a senator.
State senator Vincent Sheheen, a Democrat and friend of Pinckneys, has wanted the flag to be taken down for several years and introduced the latest bill. On the senate floor on Monday, Sheheen said removing the flag is one small step that reduces the culture of division.
 Vincent Sheheen (@vincentsheheen) July 6, 2015
Thankful the SC Senate overwhelming voted to pass my bill to retire the #ConfederateFlag from SH grounds. I pray for unity in our state.
Senate Republican leader Harvey Peeler said that he would oppose the bill to remove the flag, saying that his ancestors owned slaves and that taking down the flag cannot change that history. With fellow Republicans Lee Bright and Danny Verdin, he was one of three senators to vote against the bill.
The reverend Jesse Jackson, who was born in the state, was in the senate chamber on Monday for the discussion. He pushed for protests against the flag in 2000, when it was flying atop South Carolinas statehouse. It was moved that year to its current position at a civil war memorial on the building grounds.
This move means that the flag can only be taken down with two-thirds support from the legislature. Governor Nikki Haley cannot force its removal unilaterally, though she has said she believes it should be taken down.
I dont think that this is going to be easy. I dont think that its going to be painless, Haley said on NBCs Today show. But I do think that it will be respectful, and that it will move swiftly.
Earlier in Mondays session, Republican state senator Lee Bright introduced an amendment that would allow voters to decide whether it should be displayed at the statehouse. His bill was tabled with a 36-3 vote, as was a bill to have it flown only on Confederate memorial day and to replace the flag with the first national flag of the Confederate States of America, which was the Confederacys official flag from 1861 to 1863 .
Bright said he opposes taking the flag down because it associates the souths history with the act of the killer.
I am more against taking it down in this environment than any other time, Bright said. Were placing blame on what one deranged lunatic did on people who hold their southern heritage high, and I dont think thats fair.

A Saudi air strike appears to have struck a livestock market in southern Yemen , killing more than 40 people  one of the deadliest bombings of a campaign that has now lasted three months.
The blast happened while civilians were trading in the market in the Fayyoush district of Lahj province. The Associated Press reported that the death toll was at least 45, with more than 50 wounded.
I came right after the explosion and saw dozens of dead strewn about and a sea of blood, while the wounded were being evacuated to nearby hospitals, resident Abu-Ali al-Azibi told the AP. [There was] blood from people mixed with that of the sheep and other livestock at the market.
A Saudi-led coalition launched an air offensive in March after Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran, took control of Yemens capital, Sanaa, and moved on the city of Aden to the south, forcing the Saudi-backed president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.
That month, more than two dozen people died in an attack on a refugee camp and 46 people were killed and hundreds wounded in a raid in April on the Faj Attan district in Sanaa.
More than 3,000 people have been killed and 14,300 wounded in Yemen since the war began.
The air campaign has had limited success and instead has plunged Yemen into a humanitarian crisis with food, fuel and medical shortages. Last week, the UN declared Yemen a level-three emergency, its most dire rating, placing it on par with Syria. It estimates that a million people been displaced since March.

Two leading human rights watchdogs said the Saudi-led coalition was failing to adhere to international law and was not taking the necessary precautions to prevent civilian casualties.
The cases we have analysed point to a pattern of attacks destroying civilian homes and resulting in scores of civilian deaths and injuries, said Donatella Rovera, a senior adviser at Amnesty International, in a statement last week following an investigation into eight attacks by the coalition.
There is no indication that the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition has done anything to prevent and redress such violations, she said.
Human Rights Watch said it had documented a series of apparently unlawful air strikes on the Houthis home province of Saada, including on residential houses, markets, a school and a petrol station.
The coalitions aerial bombing of Saada killed dozens of civilians, devastating entire families, said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and north Africa director at HRW, last week. These attacks appear to be serious laws-of-war violations that need to be properly investigated.

A convicted armed robber managed to escape from one of Iowas most highly secure prison cells by sneaking through the buildings piping on to the roof and guiding himself to the ground with a makeshift rope, authorities said on Monday.
Justin Kestner, 25, escaped early on Sunday from a cell in the A-Pod unit at the Iowa state penitentiary in Fort Madison, which houses some of the states most difficult prisoners.
This is an individual that I think was pretty ingenious in what he came up with, Governor Terry Branstad said.
Kestner was captured several hours later, about 100 miles away, near Geneseo, Illinois. He is suspected of stealing a car in Wever, Iowa, just miles from the prison, and abandoning it near Geneseo, prompting a resident to call authorities. An Illinois trooper found Kestner walking a mile from the vehicle on the side of Highway 82, near Interstate 80. Kestner fled into a cornfield but surrendered without incident after the trooper called for him.
The A-Pod is a unit where inmates are typically confined to locked cells 23 hours a day and are searched, handcuffed and escorted whenever they leave. The unit is for maximum-security inmates with housing restrictions such as Kestner, who had been sentenced by a prison judge last month to one year of detention for assaulting a correctional officer and other rules violations.
Kestner took advantage of the fact that cells in the unit have their own showers  a security feature designed to cut down on offenders interactions with guards and other inmates.
In his cell shower, Kestner removed the screws from an access cover that led to a pipe chase  an enclosed space that houses the prisons pipes, authorities said. Kestner managed to maneuver himself up the chase and through a vent to the roof  crawling through a very narrow area thats supposed to be too small for someone to crawl through, Branstad said.
The governor said Kestners makeshift rope was manufactured by tying together some 67 feet of bed sheets. He then guided himself down to an unfenced part of the prison grounds and fled.
Investigators do not think Kestner had any help from staff, a penitentiary spokeswoman, Rebecca Bowker, said.
Lawmakers said the escape raised security questions at the prison along the Mississippi river, which has a history dating back to 1839. Most of the prison is expected to close later this year as roughly 500 inmates get transferred a mile away to the new penitentiary  a huge undertaking that will involve local, state and federal officers.
This close to a transfer, we cannot be having escaped convicts. Thats just unacceptable, said state representative Bobby Kaufmann, a Wilton Republican who led an investigation into construction problems at the new $166m prison that was initially scheduled to open last year.
He worries that Kestners prison break  and last months escape of two killers from a New York prison  will potentially embolden other inmates to raise trouble when the time comes to move.
Kestner was serving a 20-year sentence he received in 2009 for robbing two gas stations in Sioux City, with a projected release date of 2019 before the escape. He was returned to the prison on Sunday evening and is expected to face escape-related charges.
On 25 June, a prison judge gave Kestner a term of disciplinary detention of one year and took away one year of earned time for assaulting the officer during a transport  the maximum penalty for serious or dangerous violence under prison policy.
Kestners cell was in a newer building at the prison complex, which was completed in 2001 and originally designed to house mentally ill offenders. Last year, the prison transferred most of those inmates elsewhere and converted part of the building to a minimum-security prison. But the building kept the highly secure A-Pod unit.
Im flabbergasted that anyone could have gotten out of there, said former building administrator Heather Brueck.

Chinas stock market collapse, which has knocked almost a third off share values since June, appeared to have been stemmed on Monday after Beijing authorities orchestrated a massive spending spree by Chinese financial institutions to bolster the market.
The Shanghai Composite Index initially bounced more than 10%, after more than 20 major stockbrokers and fund managers pledged to pump at least 120bn yuan (12.3bn) into the market and started hoovering up shares in some of the countrys largest businesses.
But hopes of a major turnaround in the fortunes of the Shanghai exchange were dashed after much of that initial rise was lost as small investors continued to panic over the safety of their investments. The final gain was 2.4%.
More than 2tn has been wiped off the value of Chinese-listed companies since 12 June, when concerns about a stock market bubble gripped investors and triggered a bout of panic selling.
Chinas stock markets had previously been among the top performing in the world, and had hit a seven-year peak in the middle of June. The Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months, but it has fallen 30% over the past three weeks  including a plunge of 12% last week.
There will be some fluctuation, but more money put into the market  I think it will be helpful to keep it steady
Shao Yu
State media reported over the weekend that the Chinese government, along with the securities regulator and financial institutions, had launched a joint effort to prevent more losses.
Most of the funds were pumped into banks and state companies, which saw their value soar. Shares in PetroChina, Asias biggest oil producer, rose by up to 10% following the move.
New share offerings were also suspended on orders of the state council. Twenty-eight Chinese companies with permission to float on the Shanghai exchange said that they would postpone further issues of shares.
Meanwhile, the Peoples Bank of China made a commitment to provide liquidity for China Securities Finance Corp, a state-owned company that provides insurance to cover stock market dealing.
China stock market value
Some analysts seemed confident the actions would have a positive impact on Chinas stock markets.
Shao Yu, chief economist with Orient Securities said the actions taken were clever. I think it will stabilise the market. Of course there will be some fluctuation, but more and more money put into the market  I think it will be helpful to keep the market steady, he said.
However, Shao added that he did not expect the market to reach the heights it had previously.
Previous efforts to keep share prices from falling, including interest rate cuts and plans to investigate short sellers, proved unsuccessful.
Oliver Barron, China policy research analyst at broker NSBO, said the selloff posed profound questions for the government. After the market continued to fall, despite myriad support measures, the government reached peak panic mode and must have worried that investors would not only lose confidence in the markets, but in the government itself, he said.
Chinas stock market is made up of mostly individual investors, rather than institutional investors. Almost 90 million people hold shares and up to 1.4 million new investors a week have been opening stock accounts. According to media estimates, the average loss of individual stock accounts has been about 420,000 yuan (43,000).
Meanwhile, a man has been detained by police in Beijing for allegedly spreading a rumour that someone had committed suicide due to the stock market slump.
The 29-year-old man, a project manager with a technology company, posted the information along with video clips and screenshots, according to the state news agency Xinhua. His post quickly spread and provoked a lot of online debate, particularly among those who had invested on the stock market.

For the past year, they have positioned themselves as allied agents of a change sweeping across southern Europe .
On the face of it, Spains leftwing anti-austerity Podemos party should have been crowing at the landslide victory of the no vote in Sundays Greek referendum. But while Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias was quick to praise Syriza and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras , his overriding message was a simple one  Spain is not Greece.
With a general election due in Spain by the end of the year, Iglesias, whose party made substantial gains in local elections earlier this year, was careful to mark the differences between the two countries, worried, analysts said, that any worsening of the situation in Greece could drive crucial middle-class voters away from his party.

We have a great friendship with Syriza, but luckily, Spain is not Greece, Iglesias told radio Cadena Ser. Were an economy with much more weight in the eurozone, were a country with a stronger administration and with a better economic situation. The circumstance are different and I think it makes no sense to draw parallels.
Instead, Iglesias framed the referendum as a step forward for democracy in that the Greek people had finally been handed the power to decide on austerity measures. Its good news for Europeans and Greek citizens, said Iglesias. The people of Greece have said they want change, they support a government who says that things can be done in a different way.
The referendum was a clear success for Tsipras, said political scientist Fernando Vallespn from Madrids Autonomous University. The automatic assumption is that what is good for Tsipras is good for Podemos, he said, but he feels it is too early to say whether that is the case, pointing to the efforts made by Iglesias to distance Spain from Greece. I think Podemos is worried that the situation in Greece wont get better.
Reinforcing the differences between the countries dampens the idea of contagion, he said, and maintains the partys appeal to moderate voters. The latest polls show Podemos is in a virtual tie with the governing Peoples party and opposition Socialists.
Podemos must walk a fine line when it comes to Greece, said Jos Ignacio Torreblanca, the author of Asaltar Los Cielos, or Storm the Heavens, which explores the rise of Podemos. On one hand its good news for them, because the message of the people having voted against austerity strengthens their message. The frame for them is fantastic because its the people against the troika, David against Goliath and the weak against the powerful, he said.
The challenge, however, is then to distance themselves from any bad news emerging from Greece. This is where the space opens for the Peoples party and others to point to issues such as the queues for cash machine withdrawals. All of the parties have been trying to use Greece to their advantage.
On Monday, the governing Peoples party pointed to the referendum to justify their decision to impose austerity measures during the height of the economic crisis. Fortunately Spain has a prime minister who said no to the bailout and instead undertook reforms, PP vice-president Fernando Martnez-Maillo told broadcaster Radio Nacional de Espaa. The alternative, he said, would look like Greece does today. Thanks to those reforms  were in a situation of economic growth and job creation.
While Greece was forced to accept a series of bailouts amounting to 240bn, Spain drew on 41bn-worth of EU funds to rescue its banking sector and exited from the programme last year. The Spanish economy has seen seven quarters of economic growth, but inequality is rampant and the countrys unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, at 23.8%, the highest in the EU after Greece.
Spains finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said that although the no vote made the situation more complex, Spain was absolutely not contemplating a Greek exit from the euro.
Greeces creditors had not handled the crisis perfectly, he said, but the onus was now on Greece to enact reforms. I think there were mistakes on the part of the troika, but it is inevitable that Greece implements reforms because there have been nations that have done them and they are emerging from the crisis.
The Spanish government is open to negotiations for a third rescue package, he said. Given the circumstances, from the point of view of the markets, it is absolutely necessary.
His remarks were a backing down from the hardline position taken by Mariano Rajoy , Spains prime minister, who last week said that it would be good for Greece if Tsipras lost the referendum. If he wins the referendum, Greece has no other alternative other than to leave the euro, Rajoy told Cope radio station on Tuesday.
How the Greek situation will play out in Spain hinges on what happens in the coming days, said Torreblanca. If Tsipras manages to sit down with creditors and obtain an additional packages of concessions, then its great for Podemos, he said. Its a bit early to say because right now we dont know what the final act of all this will be  whether its a drama, tragedy or something else.

Post-sanctions Iran 'could be the best emerging market for years to come'
Iranian businesses eye the trade that ending sanctions would bring, but say: dont expect a Russia-style gold rush  we already have a free market

Hamid Mohammadi is excited at the prospect of international sanctions on Iran being lifted once a nuclear agreement has been signed. But hes not that excited. The CEO of the Islamic republics equivalent of Amazon is certainly looking forward to being re-connected to the outside world  vital for a fast-growing company at the cutting edge of digital innovation. Still, ending sanctions will not be a miracle cure for the countrys economic ills.
Digikala, launched with three employees in 2007, will have 1,500 by the years end as its slick Farsi-language online shopping service expands. It symbolises the energy of a young generation of wired and entrepreneurial Iranians who have built a domestic market from scratch and prospered despite international isolation. It guarantees deliveries within four hours in Tehran and its site boasts a whopping 750,000 unique visitors a day.
Culturally, the company is a world away from the dour image form which Iran suffers. Its recent iftar  the evening meal breaking the Ramadan fast  for staff and their families blended western corporate style with speeches, an MC and a live band; there was barely a beard and no turbans in sight. Headscarves were extremely loose, female fashion elegant.
Digikala is also an investors fantasy. Yes, we have problems related to sanctions, like the lack of foreign investment, Mohammadi explained at the companys warehouse near the capital. And Iranian banks and investors dont see e-commerce as having a good future. We need access to technology and to partners. The Koreans and Chinese ignore the sanctions, but when they are lifted we expect to see European and American brands.

Mohammadis view of the benefits to the most successful start-up in Iran is widely shared by fellow businessmen. After sanctions the governments behaviour will change, he predicts. There will be more discipline and more professional behaviour. There are many weird and useless rules here. If more foreign companies come then the general economic environment will be better.
Prospects for recovery occupy as much space in the Iranian media as the chances of reaching a deal in the P5 + 1 nuclear negotiations in Vienna , which are due to end by Tuesday. Things are already looking up. The economy rebounded out of recession and grew 2.8% in 2014, President Hassan Rouhanis first year in office. The IMF predicts growth of 0.6% and 1.3% in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Inflation is down from 45% under the reckless and profligate former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to 15% today.
Expectations are high in the energy sector  the source of 35% of government revenues. Oil exports have halved since 2012 though the deputy oil minister said on Sunday that they could almost double when sanctions are lifted. We are like a pilot on the runway ready to take off, a bullish Mansour Moazami told the Wall Street Journal . This is how the whole country is right now.
Oil matters. But Irans economy is far more diverse than that of Saudi Arabia, its great rival in the region. It is the worlds largest exporter of cement, as well as pistachios, saffron and caviar. Shipping is another big earner. State-owned Iran Shipping Lines has been badly hit by sanctions and stands to benefit significantly when they go, analysts say.
The single most urgent change business wants is the end to the ban on bank transfers under the international Swift system. That has been the biggest blow, said Rouzbeh Pirouz, chair of Turquoise Partners. But its not just that. Iranian companies have had difficulty trading and participating in global markets.
Yet interest from European countries has grown exponentially since the interim nuclear agreement was signed in Lausanne in April. Irans financial sector, food and beauty products are of special interest, he added. And French investors are looking closely at investment in hotels in the expectation of a leap forward in tourism.
Hardliners who fret about the implications of a nuclear deal involving the US, the old great Satan, take comfort from the fact that Irans biggest trading partner is now China (25%), followed by Iraq, the UAE, Korea, Turkey and India.
A lot of western media propagate the myth that our economy will collapse if there is no agreement in Vienna, argues Foad Ezzadi, an academic and principalist in the local political lexicon. But sanctions will collapse if there is no deal because a lot of companies are waiting to get into the Iranian market.

If there is an agreement, there will be plenty of business opportunities, but no bonanza for foreigners. We are ready to use the potential of foreign investment, said banker Majid Zamani. But this is not Russia in the 1990s. Some people make it sound like a gold rush. There wont be one because there is already a free market and free trade here. For people who want to add value Iran is the place to be. It could be the best emerging market for years to come.
What is true for a growing giant like Digikala is true for traders in Tehrans legendary and famously conservative bazaar. I am optimistic about the future, beamed Mostafa, surveying his little stationery shop in one of the labyrinth of alleys around the Masjid Shah (Shah mosque  still referred to thus despite having being renamed Masjid Khomeini long ago). If sanctions end people will be in a better mood and buy more. And if the dollar is reasonably stable, we can buy the paper we import from Indonesia at a decent price.
On all sides there is a recognition of the clear link between resolving the nuclear issue and economic prosperity. In business we talk about win-win, quipped Saeed Rahmani, founder of Sarava Pars venture capital and chairman of the Digikala board. Countries are no different.
Yet many fear that hopes of improvement are too high: There is probably an inflated view of the impact of a deal and of sanctions removal, said Pirouz. The buildup has been so long in coming and the anticipation so great that people have exaggerated expectations of what removal will achieve. The real question is whether this will be a Deng Xiaoping moment  whether the Iranian government will use this opportunity to really open up to the world and integrate into the global economy. If they are willing to take that leap it could potentially be a very exciting time.

President Robert Mugabe moved Zimbabwes information minister, who he branded a devil incarnate last year, to an education department role in his second cabinet reshuffle since December.
On Monday, the minister of information, Jonathan Moyo  whom Mugabe says appointed opposition sympathisers as editors of state-owned newspapers, was to be minister of higher and tertiary education  the secretary to the president and cabinet told reporters.
Misheck Sibanda did not give a reason for the changes, but said Mugabe had left the post of information minister vacant.
Mugabes seven cabinet changes included moving Kembo Mohadi, longtime minister in charge of homeland security, to the national state security ministry.
Ignatius Chombo, who ran the local government ministry for 15 years, takes over the homeland security ministry.
Savior Kasukuwere, one of the youngest ministers in Mugabes government at 44 years old, is the new minister of local government after serving at the ministry of water and environment since 2013.
Kasukuwere, nicknamed Tyson for his combative style, made his name as the enforcer of Mugabes black economic empowerment drive that is forcing foreign-owned companies to sell majority shares to black Zimbabweans.
In December, Mugabe fired his deputy of 10 years, Joice Mujuru, and several other ministers.

'We're a violent nation'  director tackles Spain's festival culture of animal cruelty
As tens of thousands flock to Pamplona for the annual running of the bulls, Miguel ngel Rolland explains why he made his documentary Santa Fiesta
Animal abuse film exposes dark side of Spanish festivals

It hurts me to say it but the Spanish are a savage, insensitive and ignorant people, says Miguel ngel Rolland. In his new documentary, the Spanish film-maker has chronicled some of the 16,000 religious festivals across Spain that he says involve the torture of animals.
Every year about 60,000 animals are killed during these festivals, often held in honour of a local saint or the Virgin Mary. Spanish identity is a local, rather than a national, affair and people are fiercely loyal to their town or village and the customs associated with it.
The best known festival is this weeks running of the bulls during the fiesta of San Fermn in Pamplona. Tens of thousands of people from all over the world flock to the small Navarra town each year for a week of partying that begins each day with six fighting bulls and six oxen being driven through the narrow streets to the bullring, where the bulls are killed in a series of bullfights.
The festival has attracted increasing criticism from animal rights groups  on Saturday activists from Peta staged a protest to draw attention to what they say is a week of fear and death for bulls.
The cruelties documented in Rollands film (warning: graphic scenes) include pulling the head off a goose and throwing a live turkey from a church tower, but the most abused animal by far is the bull.

He calculates that during the 1,868 festivals involving bulls last year, more than 11,000 were tortured and killed. Aside from bullfighting, which still attracts large numbers of spectators, there are village festivals such as the toro enmaromado (roped bull), held to celebrate Corpus Christi in Benavente, Zamora, central Spain. Here, a bull has a rope tied to its horns while dozens of men chase and drag it to the abattoir. It has been declared an event of regional tourist interest by the regional government of Castile and Len.Many other such fiestas enjoy legal protection.
In Dnia, Alicante, bulls are chased off a pier and then dragged out of the sea, and according to Rolland they often drown. In Villalpando, Zamora, a bull is pursued by cars. In Ohanes, Almera, the animal is tied up and forced to bow down eight times before the statue of a saint.
I never once saw anyone object. Everyone goes, they take their children. These cruel events have the churchs blessing
Miguel ngel Rolland
Three years ago, Catalonia banned bullfighting but the correbous, in which bulls are chased down the street, often with flaming brands fixed to their horns, remain popular and legal in the southern part of the region.
The really sad thing is I never once saw anyone object, says Rolland, who filmed his documentary, Santa Fiesta, almost entirely in secret and was occasionally run out of town when he was caught. Everyone goes, they take their children. These cruel events have the churchs blessing. In the Canaries at election time candidates will campaign by offering to supply more bulls for the fiesta.

The majority of these festivals are held in Andalusiaand Castile and Len, but there is no region in Spain where they dont exist.
We are a violent nation, he says, adding that my father is a big bullfight aficionado. He used to take us to the fiestas until I was old enough to say no.
The police often make themselves scarce during the festivals as some are now illegal. In 2002 the Andalusian government banned the fiesta in Cazalilla, in which a live turkey is thrown from the church tower. But the practice continues and each year the villagers club together to pay the 2,000 (1,450) fine. If they tried to stop the turkey throwing, people would riot, says Juan Balbn Garrido, the mayor.
Rolland reflects: In Spain about 200 animals are killed every day for entertainment. Thats eight terrible deaths every hour.

RSA to appeal against 1.25m employment tribunal payout
Sum awarded to former head of Irish subsidiary, who resigned following accounting discrepancies, creates dangerous precedent, says insurance group

Insurance company RSA has described the award of 1.25m (790,000) by an employment tribunal to the former head of its Irish business as astonishing as it launched an appeal against the potential payout.
Last month, an employment tribunal awarded the sum to Philip Smith, who resigned in November 2013 following accounting discrepancies that forced the insurance group to pump 200m into its Irish subsidiary .
RSA said it fundamentally disagreed with the judgment and was seeking redress through the courts. We are astonished by the amount of the award made by the tribunal, which RSA believes is utterly inconsistent with that crucial finding and creates a dangerous precedent, Derek Walsh, general counsel of RSA, said.
Smith had argued that he had not attempted to hide the way calculations were made about the possible claims the insurer could face and argued that the insurer had failed to listen to his side of the case. When he resigned, he had said he was the fall guy for the accounting problems that eventually led to the 200m shortfall.
Contrary to the impression given by the tribunal decision, no one at RSA group level had any prior knowledge of the inappropriate large loss reserving practices which emerged in RSA Ireland . RSA group would never have condoned such practices, said Walsh.
We continue to believe that Mr Smiths case is without merit and in the circumstances have no option but to appeal the judgment.

Police said on Monday there was no evidence of gunshots and no injuries reported after officers searched a 20-story tower at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington.
Montgomery County police said a 911 call reporting hearing a single shot inside Building 1, the original hospital on the campus in Bethesda, came from the tower on Monday morning.
Spokeswoman Natasha Plotnikov said police would now bring in dogs to search the building for explosives. She said people were still sheltering in place.
The navys website warned that the campus was on lockdown after a report of an active shooter.
Roads around the facility were closed for hours but later opened. Police and the navy tweeted that all patient care at the facility had been suspended for the day.
Local television coverage showed police cars parked by the building and people walking away from it. Helicopters were circling above.

Introduction: Leaders await new Greece proposals
Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the continuing eurozone crisis and the latest attempts to broker a deal between Greece and its creditors.
With time running out - to quote German Chancellor Angela Merkel - Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to present new proposals following his resounding victory in Sundays referendum.
Finance ministers will meet later to consider what Greece has put on the table, with European leaders discussing the situation in an emergency summit this evening. Heres Ian Traynors story looking at the prospects for a deal:
Germany and France scrambled to avoid a major split over Greece on Monday evening as the eurozone delivered a damning verdict on Alexis Tsiprass landslide referendum victory on Sunday and Angela Merkel demanded that the Greek prime minister put down new proposals to break the deadlock.
As concerns mount that Greek banks will run out of cash and about the damage being inflicted on the countrys economy, hopes for a breakthrough faded. EU leaders voiced despair and descended into recrimination over how to respond to Sundays overwhelming rejection of eurozone austerity terms as the price for keeping Greece in the currency.
Tsipras, meanwhile, moved to insure himself against purported eurozone plots to topple him and force regime change by engineering a national consensus of the countrys five mainstream parties behind his negotiating strategy, focused on securing debt relief.
Full story here:
Related: Eurozone struggles to find joint response to Greek referendum
One key participant will be new Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, appointed after the resignation of his colourful predecessor Yanis Varoufakis on Monday. Here is our profile of Tskalotos .
Meanwhile Greek banks will not reopen today after capital controls were extended until at least tomorrow. The European Central Bank put more pressure on the Greek system by tightening the rules for giving emergency funding. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:
[The ECB move} is likely to increase criticism that the central bank is getting involved in exerting political pressure and acting beyond its mandate of price stability, and as lender of last resort, which any credible central bank should do as a matter of course.
All the ECB has done is make it more likely that Greek banks will run out of money in a matter of days. Furthermore it remains highly unlikely that the Greek government will be able to make it to the next key payment deadline of 20th July when a 3.5bn bond to the ECB becomes repayable.
While the departure of the polarising Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is likely to mean that relations between the creditors and the Greek government are likely to improve, in reality the move changes nothing, particularly since attitudes in some parts of Europe appear to have hardened.
The players may have changed but the problems remain the same and while European finance ministers have agreed to meet today to consider some new Greek proposals, the likelihood is that they are unlikely to be any more acceptable now than they would have been last week, particularly given that debt relief is likely to be one of the key demands from the Greece side.
This would suggest that any new agreement remains unlikely which means that Greece may well be forced to issue its own currency in a matter of days.

        <title>Jerry Weintraub: indefatigable champion of old-school and retro film</title>

Jerry Weintraub never exactly became a household name, but he was a prominent enough Hollywood insider, finagler and mythmaker to earn his own HBO documentary profile, called His Way  along the lines of Robert Evans The Kid Stays in the Picture. His Way  named in honour of Weintraubs connection with Frank Sinatra  allowed Weintraub to ramble happily along about making deals with Elvis and setting up films, as well as accepting the plaudits of his high-profile Hollywood pals, George Clooney and Julia Roberts among them. If nothing else, it shows Weintraub as a Hollywood made man, a capo among capos.

For this seems to be the essence of Weintraub: a Sammy Glick style motormouth hustler in an age of a corporate, machine-oiled film-making. In fact, his whole career seems to have emerged through a haze of cigar smoke and cocktails: he tended to favour the nostalgic, the old-fashioned, the sort of thing you can imagine being discussed in studio back offices by an earlier generation. In the 70s, when Weintraub began to make his mark in the film business, Hollywood was a wild west: the old studio system had collapsed, the old certainties had disappeared, new and strange forms of cinema had appeared  from the counterculture, from the B-movie ecologies of sex and horror. Weintraub was a graduate of the mailroom at William Morris agency, the kind of place where ambitious wannabes steamed open their bosses letters, before talking himself into an junior agents job at the MCA talent agency. It was the classic favour-for-a-favour route, and Weintraub ended up promoting successful concert tours in the 70s with the likes of Presley, Sinatra, Bob Dylan and John Denver: unhip but remunerative acts that allowed Weintraub to cross over into TV and other media. In fact, it was via Denver that Weintraub really got into the moving-image business, via a string of TV specials, and it was his louche, music-industry background that no doubt eased the path to his joining forces with Robert Altman for Weintraubs first movie credit: legend has it they bonded over a joint, and Weintraub ended up getting the $2m backing for Altmans 1976 country-music epic Nashville.

In fact, Nashville, with its ironic tone and rambling structure, was not especially typical of the projects Weintraub sponsored. His next film was the John Denver vehicle, Oh God!, with crotchety Borscht belt comic George Burns. (Cruising, directed by William Friedkin , the notorious gay serial killer film was a mis-step; it was an unlikely brush with gruesome thrillerdom that Weintraub never repeated.) Diner, which he got greenlit by MGM, was much more like it, harking back to the kind of 50s Jewish life he knew well. The Karate Kid, a bona fide commercial blockbuster, took a tried-and-tested structure  one that had just won the best picture Oscar for Rocky  merged with a then-modish teen-movie template.

His luck ran out with My Stepmother Is an Alien  a comedy with Kim Basinger and Dan Aykroyd, directed by Richard Benjamin, another of the old-school stand-bys  and its catastrophic losses led swiftly to the bankruptcy of his production entity, the grandly named Weintraub Entertainment Group. Through all this Weintraub endlessly promoted his friendship with President George Bush (Weintraubs wife Jane Morgan had been a girlfriend of Bushs) and to some extent explains his survival as a Hollywood player during the bad times.
Amazingly, Weintraubs indefatigable attraction to backward-looking properties came up trumps with the Oceans Eleven series: a remake of the 60s heist film starring  yes  Frank Sinatra. By the early noughties, retro was in, and Weintraub could forget about another embarrassment: the feature film version of British TV spy show The Avengers, starring Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, which completely failed to catch fire. But, led by an effervescent George Clooney, and orchestrated by a resurgent Steven Soderbergh , Oceans Eleven worked brilliantly; pitched at just the right level between slick hi-tech film-making and pre-Mad-Men Rat Packism.

Behind the Candelabra - video review
Eleven, and its two sequels, Twelve and Thirteen  sequels were a very Weintraub preoccupation  were huge worldwide hits, and put him back in the game. He had one more fantastic retro hit in him, the Soderbergh-directed Behind the Candelabra , which distilled the Vegas era in all its camp glory. Notoriously, neither Weintraub nor Soderbergh could get studios to back the film, supposedly because of its gay subject-matter; shamefully for Hollywood, TV operation HBO had to step in, a decisive changing-of-the-guard moment in the struggle between the small and big screens. At the same time, Weintraubs franchising, money-chasing instincts led him to participate in the Karate Kid remake featuring Will Smiths son; it dumped karate in favour of kung fu, presumably to get Chinese producers onside, and Weintraub refused to change the title. It was a mess. And in between the two he got his pal George Bush his own HBO documentary, 41. What goes around, comes around, would seem to be Weintraubs motto.

Greeces no vote has left everyone wondering what it all means. While the topline summary is that no won with 61.3% of the vote , this is perhaps not the landslide victory it has been hailed to be.
For a start, there is confusion around what the referendum was actually about. Were Greek people voting to decide whether to stay in the Euro ? Was it about saying no to more austerity? Or defending national pride and southern European culture? Talking to Greeks yesterday, you might have thought there were several referendums happening simultaneously  a perfect illustration of just how muddy the waters of the debt crisis are.
For many following the crisis for the last five months, it has become clear that it is not just about Greek debt. Beneath the cultural tensions and ugly stereotypes, an ideological war is taking place. This battle is happening because the current economic system has only two answers to debt crises, recessions and slow economic growth: stimulus and austerity .
Related: Growth is not the answer to inequality
Stimulus is about the government pumping money into the economy to encourage consumer spending, which will theoretically lead to economic growth. In recent times, stimulus efforts have taken the form of the government spending money on infrastructure and other socially beneficial projects (think the New Deal ) and quantitative easing . Austerity is a set of measures that aim to cut government spending and shrink the public sector to make the economy less dependent on it, which in theory should make room for and encourage a burgeoning free market (ie neo-liberalism ).
The argument against government-led stimulus asks how the economy can grow if the government has to keep expanding its debt and/or money supply in order to start new projects and stimulate the economy. Surely the stimulation it provides will never compensate for growing levels of debt? Anti-austerity advocates, on the other hand, ask how the economy can grow if people make less money and taxes are higher  people will save, not spend, and economic growth is based on consumer spending.
The issue of austerity versus stimulus is often framed as the entire debate  if you dont support one, you must support the other, because there are no alternatives. This is the same binary debate that has been going on for more than 100 years between the state versus the market. Yet, these dichotomies distract people from thinking about whats really important  the goal of these policies, which is to grow the economy.
No analysis Ive read thus far has questioned the damaging role that the endless quest for economic growth plays. Neither austerity nor government stimulus will ever be able to address the debt crises and recessions of the twenty-first century because what were dealing with here is an inherent contradiction of capitalism.
Related: A wave of disruption is sweeping in to challenge neoliberalism
This contradiction comes from the surplus of the system (profit) being taken out of the real economy (the economy of physical goods and services) and put into the financial sector to generate more wealth for people who are already wealthy. This requires the economy to continually grow to compensate for the extraction of profit, which is essentially the extraction of the economys surplus.
However, this extraction of profit is the same mechanism at the root of soaring levels of inequality. A recent Oxfam report estimates that, by 2016, the richest 1% of the worlds population will own more than the other 99%. If the average person is making relatively less every year, or struggling just to maintain the same financial state, they cant afford to buy ever more products and services, so the economy cant grow as it did when we had more financial equality. Thus capitalism has always carried the seed of its own demise.
We are seeing this self-destruction in Greece. The current Syriza government wants to go back to the negotiating table and create a new bailout agreement that will cut the debt to a more manageable size and reform the public sector in ways that wont affect the most vulnerable. This would still be austerity, albeit a much milder version than that of the past five years. Yanis Varoufakis resigned from his post as Greek finance minister to allow for smoother negotiations between Greece and its European partners in the hope of reaching such an agreement.
If an agreement cant be reached, Greece might well go back to the drachma. However, the government has no clear plan for this and an unplanned exit from the euro would be painful, with the poorest hit the hardest.
In all of these scenarios, the governments goal would still be to re-start economic growth, even at the cost of creating more inequality. None of these options gets to the roots of capitalisms inherent contradiction. Theres no way to grow ourselves out of this crisis; not for Greece, not for the rest of the world. What we are witnessing is the beginning of the collapse of capitalism.
So what is a sustainable path forward for Greece? If the Greek government could see that it wont be able to re-start growth, and that GDP growth is a means to an end, not an end in itself, there are steps it could take to start paving a new path to prosperity for its people.
Related: Less material consumption is not the end for business
In addition to the basics  restructuring the Greek debt, deep reforms in the public sector to make it more transparent and accountable, and the strengthening of the solidarity economy  I suggest the following:
Greece should go back to a national currency to have more autonomous decision-making with regards to its own economy, which it needs if it wants to pave a more sustainable path. This is not a simple move, so the government will have to have a plan for such a transition, with safety netsto protect the most vulnerable.
The government should nationalise the banks and encourage people to start credit unions. This will re-align the banking sector with the needs of citizens and make the banks more resilient. Credit unions would empower people to take financial matters into their own hands.
Greece should keep for-profit interests from buying up its common wealth. This could be done via land trusts, not-for-profits and amending the constitution to make it unconstitutional for the government to sell off the commons.
The Greek government should start using a wellbeing or happiness index to measure success, as Bhutan does . In this age of inequality, working class people and the unemployed can easily slip through the cracks of GDP growth.
Businesses and the government should shorten the working week and encourage job-sharing , so more people can have part-time employment. This would counter the current problem of some having no work while others work 50 hours a week.
Finally, the government should create legislation and encourage not-for-profit enterprise in every sector to prevent the extraction of profits from the real economy and encourage social entrepreneurs and innovators to start up their own not-for-profits. These enterprises would help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Greece, create a more stable economy and keep the financial surplus in the real economy. By building an economy around social purpose, Greece could usher in the post-capitalist era, rather than fall victim to the unavoidable collapse of capitalism we are witnessing.

Iran nuclear talks continue as deadline looms

World powers are seeking to nail down a nuclear deal to end a 13-year standoff with Iran , hours before another deadline expires.
After talking deep into the night on Monday, foreign ministers from the P5+1 group leading the negotiations met briefly again on Tuesday without the Iranian delegation.
The group  Britain, China, France , Germany, Russia and the US  is seeking to hammer out a final accord to put an atomic bomb out of Irans reach.
But Tuesdays deadline for a deal  the fourth since an interim agreement was struck in November 2013  looks almost certain to be missed, as the ministers grapple with the toughest remaining issues.
Related: Iranian negotiator: deadline? What deadline?
In what has become a high-stakes game of diplomatic poker, the ministers met twice on Monday with the Iranian delegation led by the countrys foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, for a total of almost three hours.
Asked whether Tuesdays deadline might slip, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: I would say that its certainly possible.
State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Washington that Tuesday was not a deadline. It was an extension of basically seven days of the parameters of a 2 April framework accord struck in Lausanne.
But he refused to be drawn on what might happen on Tuesday, insisting: Everybody is still I think rowing on the oars here to try to get a deal done, but its got to be the right deal.
An Iranian official also made it clear on Monday that 7 July, 8 July, we do not consider these dates as those dates we have to finish our job.
Even if we pass 9 July, that will not be the end of the world, the Iranian said, asking not to be identified.

The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is under pressure to present a deal to Congress by Thursday, so American lawmakers have 30 days to debate it. If the accord comes later, then under a new law there will be a 60-day review period.
Despite progress on a series of complicated annexes, negotiations have become bogged down over how to ease sanctions against Iran and how to ensure Iran can continue to have a modest, peaceful nuclear programme.
Seeking to resolve lingering suspicions that Iran before 2003, or maybe after, had sought to develop nuclear arms, UN nuclear monitors were in Tehran on Monday.
The 24-hour visit by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) came after a similar trip last week by its director-general, Yukiya Amano.
Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, said Mondays talks were a major step towards resolving outstanding issues and were constructive and forward-looking.
The second IAEA visit shows the serious determination of both sides to enhance cooperation, he said, quoted by the official Irna news agency.
There was no immediate comment from the IAEA.
Related: Its not like Argo: the trials of a tour guide in Iran
But in what appeared to be a new spanner in the works, the Iranian official said his country also wanted to ensure there was no renewal of a UN arms embargo.
There is no evidence that the arms embargo has any relation with the nuclear issue, the official said. The arms embargo should not be part of the deal under negotiation, he said.
A factsheet put out by the State Department after the April accord said that once any deal is reached there would be a new UN security council resolution to extend important restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles.
Western officials are clearly balking at any notion of allowing Iran to buy conventional weapons at a time when it is accused of fomenting unrest in the Middle East.

The Singapore teenager Quah Zheng Wen has been cleared to compete at the world swimming championships and the 2016 Olympics after the ministry of defence approved a request to defer his mandatory national service.
The 18-year-old, who won 12 medals, including seven golds at last months South-east Asian Games, was in danger of missing both events because he was due to enlist for national service at the end of August.
However, the Armed Forces Council issued a statement on Tuesday saying his enlistment had been delayed for a year, allowing him to compete at next months world championships in Russia and the Olympics in Rio.
Mr Quah has satisfied the conditions for deferment of exceptional sportsmen who can win honour for Singapore, as his recent performances were better than the most recent Olympic Games qualifying times in the 200m butterfly, the statement said.
The AFC has therefore decided to grant deferment to Mr Quah from full-time NS [national service] till 31 August 2016, for him to train and participate in the 2016 Olympic Games.
In 2013, Quahs team-mate Joseph Schooling, who won nine gold medals at the SEA Games, was granted a deferment from national service until after the Rio Olympics. Singapore has never won an Olympic medal in swimming but Schooling and Quah are regarded as the countrys best prospects in years.
The AFC would like to reiterate that the criteria for deferment remain strict and limited to exceptional cases. The criteria for deferment have not changed and both Mr Schooling and Mr Quah met these criteria, the statement said.
Mr Quah will be enlisted for full-time NS when his deferment ends. We wish him success in the 2016 Olympic Games and hope that he will train hard to win a medal for Singapore.

'The west is too paranoid about Russia's information war'
Before stepping up the propaganda arms race America and Europe should realise how clumsy the Kremlins media campaign really is, argues Mark Galeotti

There is something of a panic in the west at the moment over fears that it is losing the information war with Russia .
On one level, this may be true. The Kremlin is undoubtedly engaged in a multi-front, multi-message, multimedia campaign to undermine America and Europe .
Everything from the pre-eminence given tin-hatted conspiracy theorists on the English-language state TV channel RT to the infamous troll houses and the efforts to demonise figures such as US State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki , testify to this.
Related: Inside the Kremlins hall of mirrors | Peter Pomerantsev
But before the west turns to info-warriors of its own, it ought to consider the weaknesses and consequences of the Russian campaign.
It is, primarily, a negative strategy. If anything, opinion polls show dwindling trust in and goodwill towards Russia around the world. Pew Research Center surveys found that between 2013 and 2014 negative views of Russia rose from 54 to 74% in Europe, with the countrys reputation failing to improve in any corner of the globe.
Russias aim, though, is not so much to accumulate its own soft power as to undermine the wests ability to act against it. At that, it has certainly had some success.
Many Nato members are becoming increasingly worried about the risk of being sucked into a wider conflict with the former superpower. At a time when their leaders are talking about the need for a tougher line against Russian expansionism , their electorates are uncomfortable. The sharpest indication of this split is in Germany, where many say they would not want to support a Nato partner facing Russian aggression.
The Russian information war has helped hide the ground truths of Ukraine within a cloud of rumour, innuendo, misinformation and spin. Whatever one may think about the Maidan protests that brought down the former government, the current government in Kiev was elected and is not a neo-fascist junta, as is often suggested
Whatever one may think about the Crimean vote to join Russia , the annexation was illegitimate under international law, and the fact that this continues to be debated attests to the successes of the Russian media campaign.
Related: EU to counter Russian propaganda by promoting 'European values'
But lets not assume that all of the innuendo and debate is a product of the Russian info-war, or that the Kremlin is a grandmaster of the memetic chessboard. These debates also reflect an underlying malaise of politics, leadership and legitimacy in the west.
We are willing to doubt the mainstream not because RT exhorts us to question more, as its slogan goes, but because we are already ready to believe that our leaders, our power structures and even our media lie to us.

We find ourselves exposed to conspiracy theories and sensationalist nonsense not because of the Russians so much as our own competitive media environments and the speed with which a funny, compelling or exciting lie or half-truth can be reposted, retweeted and re-reported around the world  outdistancing any fact-checking or sober analysis.
The most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth
Mark Galeotti
In this climate, the west is simply suffering from its own internal contradictions. The Russians have been able to exploit them but they have also often demonstrated themselves to be counter-productively clumsy.
Those troll farms whose sophistication is often vaunted by western alarmists have become a story in their own right  and anyone wanting to present the Russian perspective in an online forum now runs the risk of being taken for one.
While on the one hand attempts are made to woo German opinion, on the other Russian hackers break into Bundestag computers  probably gaining no more than trivial intelligence but undoing whatever work the media may have done.
In short, neither the Kremlin nor western governments should assume that the info-sphere is a simple battlefield on which disciplined forces wheel and charge. It is, at best, a cacophonous forum where umpteen rival voices struggle to be heard.
Russia may have a megaphone, but this just means that when its message is laughable or offensive it can alienate more people at once.

Now the European Union has launched an East StratCom Team to spread its values within the EU and the so-called eastern neighbourhood countries, including Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and Russia itself. But an organisation currently struggling to sell itself to sceptical audiences from England to Greece should be cautious about entering into full-blown information warfare.
As soon as such organs are created the temptation is to use them to spin and spread messages that edge closer and closer into outright propaganda. This mistake was made in the early years of the cold war, before the west realised that the most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth.
Yet the wests weaknesses are also its strengths: a plurality of opinions, an innately sceptical attitude, a willingness to revisit old assumptions. In the short term these may create vulnerability but in the long term they bring resilience.
The infamous declaration by Dmitry Kiselyov, the journalist who heads the state news agency Rossia Segodnya, that objectivity is a myth that is being imposed on us could stand as the motto of Russias information warfare campaign  or perhaps some day as its epitaph.

North Koreas state-run KCTV network has used the popular  birthday dog  meme that swept the internet in 2010 to criticise America and its extravagances.
As seen in a video released on YouTube , KCTVs talk show Todays World used the picture of Riley during a segment about poor conditions in the US.
KCTV commentator Lee Chung-song claimed in the clip that American billionaires are buying $15,000 dog collars for their pets, paying for dog hotels and spas or even hosting expensive birthday parties for their canines, such as the one enjoyed by Riley, while many homeless people are forced to live in boxes, he said.
None of this is untrue, strictly speaking, but it seems the TV channel may have taken the images a little too literally.
Kim Heung-kwang, director of NK Intellectuals Solidarity, said: I have heard of cases where DPRK media producers used the wrong pictures on a movie or newspaper, but this is the first time seeing it on the internet.
Riley went viral in 2010 after his owner posted the picture on her Facebook page. The picture received thousands of views when a family friend republished it Reddit. Riley became known for his smile, which users said looked like the canine was under the influence of marijuana.
The TV clip also shows images of dogs apparently at a tea party, and another surrounded by glasses of champagne, used by the programme as further evidence of Americas deep inequality.
The current affairs programme emphasises the gap between the rich and poor in America  criticising the country for exploiting the human rights agenda against North Korea while failing to shelter its own homeless population.
This incorrectly used image clearly shows the North Korean TV producers hardship in getting the right data file for their show, Kim said.
If the TV producers cant find the data they want to use, it will lead to miscommunication and mistakes, like using the wrong meme, Kim said.
KCTV also used a picture of Giant George , the worlds tallest dog, though his inclusion shows no clear relation to the shows theme on inequality.

How second-hand clothing donations are creating a dilemma for Kenya
Resale of charity shop rejects has destroyed local textile industry but a proposed ban on the importation of used garments risks putting thousands out of work

When a fire razed East Africas biggest second-hand clothes market in Nairobi last week , the deputy president, William Ruto, rushed to the scene to assure traders that the government would do everything to help them to rebuild their destroyed stalls.
But perhaps a more important question Ruto should have answered is whether Gikomba market will be in business a year from now if a proposed ban on the importation of second-hand clothes into east Africa is approved.
In January, east African head of states suggested that Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania should stop importing used clothes in an effort to revive the local textile industry.
Kenya alone imports around 100,000 tonnes of second-hand clothes, shoes and accessories a year  many of which were originally donated to charity shops in the west. According to Oxfam, more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa .
The items [charity] shops fail to sell or which they reject are considered for resale elsewhere, says Ian Falkingham, who manages an Oxfam-owned outlet in Senegal, Frip Ethique. Items which are in good condition and suitable for warmer climates are exported to Africa.
According to Oxfam , more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa
This second-hand clothes chain sees, for example, a Forever 21 dress once worn by a young woman in London find its way into the wardrobe of a university student in Kenya. University of Oxford sweatshirts, I love London T-shirts, hoodies emblazoned with the star spangled banner or the Union Jack  and even the Confederate flag  are common wear for people who have never set foot in the UK or the United States.
But if the ban goes through, Kenyans will be compelled to buy locally produced clothes, giving textile manufacturers a chance to reclaim the market they lost to cheap imports from abroad.
Death of an industry
The decline of Kenyas textile industry dates back to the early 1980s, when market liberalisation policies spearheaded by the World Bank opened up the local economy to second-hand clothes. Previously, they had been distributed for free among the poor.
But the superior quality and originality of the clothes soon caught the eye of the young urban population, creating a demand that led to the collapse of many of Kenyas once robust textile companies, among them Rift Valley Textiles (Rivertex) and Kisumu Cotton Mills (Kicomi).
According to local media reports , 500,000 people were employed in the textile industry in the 1980s. Today, that number has fallen by more than 96% to around 20,000.
Banning the importation of used clothes is the governments latest effort to save an industry that is all but extinguished  and is intended to try to recover some of those lost jobs.
But, paradoxically, a ban could devastate another group of Kenyans who depend on the second-hand clothes trade to make a living.
William Ngonga, who sells used clothes at Gikomba, is aware of the possible ruling that could destroy the business his family has spent the past two decades building. I am in this business with my parents, I joined them 10 years ago just after finishing university. Its the only work I know, he says.
Ngonga says the business imports an average of two containers of clothes a month, for which they pay 16,700 in tax. The containers are offloaded from ships at the port town of Mombasa from where they are transported by road to Gikomba market.
A glorious, chaotic ecosystem

Gikomba is the ground zero of second-hand clothes in Kenya, and its from here that merchandise is redistributed to retailers all over the country.
Unapologetic for its mess of noise, dust and a confusing maze of timber, iron sheets and cardboard stalls, clothes hang from the stalls in a wild cacophony of colour and design.
If the clothes are not on hangers, they are bundled into giant heaps which the sellers invite buyers to burrow into to find what they are looking for. Often, the best dresses or blouses are buried at the bottom of the pile.
Buyers and sellers jostle for space in the cramped, often muddy, lanes, where the set price of goods is usually so low that it is ridiculous to bargain for anything cheaper. Even so, the more industrious sellers can be heard shouting themselves hoarse, advertising bargains designed to lure even the most reluctant of buyers.
Gikomba pulses with a spirit borne of genuine camaraderie: conversation and laughter punctuate the exchanges between the buyers and sellers.
It is a glorious, chaotic ecosystem that has survived catastrophe after catastrophe, including a terror attack in May last year that killed 12 people and more fires than the traders can count.
Ngonga says he directly employs 15 people, most of whom are casual labourers, and is afraid that they might all be left without a source of income if the East Africa Community goes ahead with the ban.
If these people are deprived of wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city
Charles Kuria
I have a degree in commerce which I have never used, but I might be forced to fall back on it if the ban goes through. I am not particularly excited to have to join the overcrowded job market and become a paper pusher because I really love this job, he says.
And paid employment of another kind is unlikely to match his current earnings: Ngonga reveals that each container imported at 38,574 brings in a profit of over 90%.
Charles Kurias store is one floor above Ngongas. It is bigger, and filled floor to ceiling with bales of clothes.
Kuria has had this store for almost two years, but he has been in the businessmuch longer, starting from the bottom as a hawker selling a few pieces on the streets to a big time wholesaler who now only sells in bales to retailers.
He imports his stock directly from the UK, the US, Canada and Belgium.
Although Kuria is reluctant to discuss his profit margins, he admits to living a comfortable life where money has ceased to be a worry. His is a business that has a sizeable staff, with four people employed permanently and up to 20 casuals each time new stock comes in.
He says the real casualties of a ban would be the casual workers who depend on odd jobs to earn a living.
If these people are deprived of an opportunity to make honest wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city, says Kuria.
Striking a balance
Former Kenya Association of Manufacturers boss Betty Maina is cognisant of the risk that comes with cutting off the second-hand clothes business without a fall back plan for the hundreds of thousands it employs.
In an article for a local media company , Maina says that it is possible to grow the local textile industry without taking jobs from the people who need them the most.
Granted, the mitumba sector is a source of employment and many people earn their livelihood from the business. Measures that would shut down the flourishing trade at a go would not be very welcome.
Related: Europe's secondhand clothes brings mixed blessings to Africa
But why not streamline activities in the sector in such a way that the local textile industry is able to reap the benefits of providing quality products at an affordable price and at the same time providing thousands of jobs directly and millions more in downstream activities? she asks.
The thousands involved in the second hand clothes trade will know their fate once the East Africa leaders meet for the November summit, during which the issue is expected to come up.
In the meantime, it remains to be seen how the government will walk the tightrope of reviving the local textile industry without annihilating Gikomba  and the people that thrive on it.

Nearly 1,400 North Koreans were publicly executed between 2000 and 2013, according to new research, which suggests that the number of these deaths peaked at 160 in 2009. Further increases after 2013 have also been reported.
The Korean Institute for National Unification, funded by the South Korean government, said in its annual white paper on human rights in North Korea that 1,382 executions took place in public in the 13-year period.
The figures, which cannot be independently verified, were said to be based on in-depth interviews with North Korean defectors and confirmed by witnesses in the country. The number of executions carried out away from the public eye is also impossible to ascertain.
North Korean media have reported only two executions in 2014 and none so far this year, according to Cornell Universitys Death Penalty Watch research group. During 2009, only one was officially reported.

But the South Korean newspaper Joongang Daily reported in late 2013 that thousands of North Koreans had been forced to attend executions by firing squad held in stadiums, the first known large-scale public executions under Kim Jong-uns leadership.
Public executions are considered to be a way to keep the population in line. According to witness testimonies from the DPRK, public executions for watching or distributing South Korean films and drug smuggling have increased in recent years, as well sentences for crimes against the regime. Many more are punished by being sent to work-camps, with Amnesty International estimating that 200,000 North Koreans are in prison .
North Korea does not allow access to human rights groups, but an Amnesty report confirms the 2013 spike in executions, claiming that at least 70 death sentences were carried out in the DPRK, from a total of 776 around the world.
Amnesty said the actual number was likely to be far higher, but even without taking this into account North Korea , a country with 0.3% of the worlds people, carries out nearly 10% of its confirmed executions.
This total is still less than Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which account for 80% of the worlds confirmed executions between them. The US executed 761 people between 2000 and 2013, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre , but many countries, most notably China, refuse to reveal the number of people sentenced to death by the state.
Since 1996, the South Korean unification institute has published annual statistics on executions. This years figures were based on testimonies of 221 North Korean defectors, selected based on demographics and background, of the total 1,396 escapees who came to South Korea last year.

Tehrans Valiasr Street is a long, winding road with sycamore trees and streams that were once fed all year round by the cool waters of the Alborz mountains  when there was enough snow, and when there was enough water. Known as the longest street in the Middle East, Valiasr spans the city from south to north, and reminds you that Tehran is almost surrounded by mountains, like a bird in cupped hands, as fragile and as transitory.
To walk up this street on any given day, from the deep south to the posh north, is to see history etched on walls and windows. Tehran is a city that has much to remember  when it is able.
Scattered along Valiasr, in random corners, one can find some of the citys most ignored treasures: 19th-century Qajar and 20th-century Pahlavi-era homes, with their distinctive architecture of colourful gardens and deep basements. But make sure to look in the most unlikely places.

In south Valiasr, north of Mowlavi Street, behind a large sign for the Sheep Butchers Union, is the house of Anis al-Doleh , favourite wife of the Qajar king, Nasser al-Din Shah. Her story is a real-life rags to riches tale: the orphaned daughter of shepherds, the shah met her on a hunting trip and brought her to Tehran. She gradually rose to become the most prominent wife and raees-e andarooni, executive chief of the harem.
While the house was registered as a national landmark in 2002, it still operates as the headquarters of the sheep butchers union, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. At least it has guaranteed the house a life.

The home is not large, but rosy and welcoming. A round blue pool dominates the garden, reflecting the trees and wall carvings  as well as the hideous three-storey building next door. The first floor is sealed off as storage space. The second (and main) floor houses the offices of the union and they kindly allow me inside. Delicate carvings of flowers and birds in pastel colours fill every room, all juxtaposed to the sound of sheep auction schedules and slaughterhouse prices that men are yelling over the phone.
A high aluminium pyramid roof indicates that once not long ago it snowed heavily in this area. These days one forgets the snow that covered the entire city throughout winter, even a decade ago.
Tehran is not associated with ancient history: popular opinion knows it as the city of the Qajars and Pahlavis. But as recent excavations suggest, Tehran was settled 7,000 years ago. Even so, the Qajar and early Pahlavi eras shaped modern Tehran in giving it a distinct architecture. Divergent art once defined Irans cities: from Qeshm, to Kashan, to Astara, each built according to its locality, climate and artisans. Today, Tehran, like those other cities and more, has been disfigured throughout.
In the Tehran of the most recent centuries, elaborate houses had intricate basements underground, and aab anbar  a deeper basement for water storage. No matter how lavish or simple the home, it almost always treasured a blue pool in the yard around which fruit trees were grown. Windows and doors were wooden, and intricate carvings filled the walls with patterns that became more complex the higher the financial standing of the owner.
Few of these homes remain today, unless renovated by a major organisation. The luckier ones were turned into museums and art houses. Few like the home of Anis al-Doleh were the odd in the bunch that were kept intact but overtaken by random associations.
As recently as the 1930s, Deh-e Vanak in northern Tehran was a farming quarter in the midst of the city. Today, nearby Vanak Square is one of citys most congested areas, but walk towards the village, and you will still find homes built in the 1920s, 1930s and even earlier. Why have they not been turned to apartment buildings in this frenzy? One wonders.
Ali Vanaki comes from a family that has lived in the village for hundreds of years. We were farming in this area for centuries, then Reza Shah came along and gave the entire village to his prime minister, Mirza Hassan Mowstofiyol Mamalek. We refused to leave, but many of these homes do not have proper documents, even to this day.
Despite this, they are still sold for up to 17m tomans (3,500) per square metre in the winding streets, and 30m tomans (6,000) for homes with bigger gardens.
Mowstofiyol Mamaleks grandchildren, in Vanak, remain some of the only old royalty that still live in their grandfathers orchards and Qajar-era home. The house is sealed off with high brick walls, but is available for wedding photographs at staggering sums. From the trees that peek out behind the walls, one can only marvel at the history of this place. Mowstofiyol Mamalek sold part of the village land to the industrialist millionaire Gashtasb Firouzgar, who in turn sold it to Tehran municipality.

Mowstofiyol Mamalek came from a long lineage of landlords and government treasurers, so they were awarded that title a century before his birth.
Today, this piece of land is called Baqh-e Irani (the Iranian garden) and is one of the countrys most exquisite open spaces, covering 3.4 hectares. It is a public park but, as its name suggests, with streams and old orchard trees. Tehran municipality spent a billion tomans on the tulips here alone, says Vanaki.
Much of Tehran was once khooneh baqhi (houses within fruit orchards), of which the remaining trees in Vanak village and Valiasr Street are but small reminders. Across north Tehran where the most luscious orchards once prospered, developers for decades now dry trees to turn their property into land for lucrative high-rises.
According to Tehran municipality law, an orchard cannot be built upon. So, they dry the trees and then request building permits. That is how the history of this city is wiped away: by burning the flesh of trees.
But in many street corners you will occasionally find an old home still in use. Usually, its an elderly couple with children abroad. Once the couple die, the house is sold by the heirs, and the tree drying ensues, followed by an apartment block.

A home in Pasdaran Street next to our high school was inhabited by an elderly couple with four children overseas. Once the couple passed away, it became a 15-storey apartment building. Each of the children made millions, a neighbour angrily remarks, dissatisfied with the heavy traffic the building has brought to the once idyllic corner.
In north Tehran, except for those few homes salvaged for museums, skyrocketing real-estate prices have left almost nothing intact. Adding to the confusion, are homes that were confiscated right after the revolution, taken over by various organisations, passed through the hands of one developer after the next, to the extent that past ownership is nearly untraceable. One might live in a high-rise that can cost as much as 70m tomans (14,000) per square metre, not knowing who used to sleep, sit or read on the very grounds upon which the tower was built.

One of north Tehrans most well-known homes, Baq-e Ferdows or the Mohammadieh palace, now serves as the citys cinema museum. The house was constructed in Shemiran, near Tajrish Square, in the mid-19th century, but underwent changes in ownership and architecture many times before the cultural ministry took the reins following the revolution.
Iranian scholar Mahmoud Afshar bought large areas of land around the orchard, and subsequently donated them for academic pursuits (like the Dehkohda language institute ) which stand to this day. Despite these random reminders, most of what stands of old Tehran must be sought after in downtown and southern areas of the city. The north has been mainly lost.
A rather well-maintained Qajar-era home in downtown Tehran is the house of Qavam ol-Saltaneh, prime minister under both the Qajar and Pahlavi monarchies. Qavams house is Abgineh, the glass and pottery museum, which stands on 7000 square metres of land. Wooden windows, long wooden stairways and delicate carvings adorn a building that served both as Qavams house and office. The museum space inside the house was designed by renowned Austrian architect Hans Hollein.
The care taken with Qavams house is in stark contrast to many other places, including another downtown Qajar-era home, Ettehadiyeh House . To the public, it is known as the home of Dayi-jan (dear uncle) in the popular television adaptation of Iraj Pezeshkzads novel My Uncle Napoleon . The historic house sits in ruins, decaying year after year, while Tehrans Beautification Organisation tries to battle developers who see it as prime real east for a mall. It is located in Lalehzar, in the heart of Tehrans financial district.

What can you expect of a city whose many custodians arent even from the city? said architect and urban planner Kamran Safamanesh in a ceremony to remember old Tehran. His remark hinted that many current-day functionaries rose to prominence with the revolution from villages across Iran , and have no understanding of cities, their histories and stories. A citys memories are a citys identity. Wipe them out and nothing remains, said Safamanesh.
Tehran is certainly not the first city to be overtaken by a development boom. In the last few years, gigantic shopping malls have only meant faster destruction: Palladium, the high-end mall recently opened in north Tehran, sits on grounds of an old orchard that was dried to make way for the mall, built with capital primarily invested by a kebab dynasty known as Raftari.
I remember the orchard, a resident says. Now our neighbourhood has become the parking lot of death. He is selling up and leaving, as the traffic has made it impossible for him to live here anymore, he said.
Although not as old as many others, one of Tehrans most disputed old homes is the house of Ostad (master) Behzad, the prominent 20th-century miniaturist. This is where some of the most well-known artists and intellectuals of the last century Tehran once gathered.

Behzads only son bequeathed the house to the Iranian Heritage Organisation in an agreement that would see the house become a museum. But once the papers were signed, the Heritage Organisation may have forgotten its end of the bargain. Today it serves as a library and storage space for the organisation  somewhere for sleepy, middle-aged ladies in office dress codes to sit around and drink tea with biscuits. The old tiles of the masters work have been removed, even the street upon which the house sits, once called Behzad, has for years now been changed to Nofallah.
The old homes of Tehran are not only reminders of this citys past art, but past co-existence. Haroon Yashayayi is a Jewish-Iranian writer who has spent the last few years writing on his beloved Oudlajan, the once predominantly Jewish neighbourhood near the bazaar.
Oudlajan, along with Sanglaj, Arg, Dowlat, Bazaar and Chaleh Meydan were the neighbourhoods that made Tehran-e Asr-e Nasseri, Tehran during the reign of Nasser al-Din Shah, as the dust was rising from a tired, sleepy city journeying to a new, unfamiliar world.
At the time, with nearly 3000 homes, Oudlajan was known as a prosperous place. Today, walking through the back alleyways you would not know this. The overhead domes have been refurbished but it remains deformed and alienated.
I remember when the street was thriving, when Molook Khanom, a local woman, would walk in the streets and wave hello to everybody, Yashayayi says, in a talk he gave on his upcoming book of stories of Oudlajan, to be published in Tehran. The neighbourhood is home to Tehrans oldest synagogues, sealed off to pedestrians, tourists and wanderers.
Home of prominent Zoroastrians also serve as reminders of the citys past: the house of Arbab Homroz, in east Tehran, was most recently launched as the Iranian National Museum of Graphic Arts. In central Tehrans Chahar Rah-e Valiasr (the intersection of Valiasr and Enqelab Street) a shining monument seems out of place: this is the Qajar-era home of Rostam Giv , the Zoroastrian parliament member and industrialist who also headed the Zoroastrian association until his death in 1980.
During the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, the house was bought by Jahad Daneshgahi, an educational organisation, and renovated by the Heritage Organisation. It is now a fully functional building that serves as classroom space.
Not all standing homes had the same fate. The home of Hassan Pirnia is one of the most significant architectural marvels of the Qajar era but sits in ruins , awaiting a shopping centre on some of its grounds. Some of the carvings at the home have been looted.
Pirnia was a lawmaker, historian and prime minister at the end of the Qajar era. This home is not simply a historic artefact . Within its walls, one of 20th century Irans most significant events took place: the writing of the constitution following the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.
These homes connect the memory of Tehran. Qavam did the writing, Pirnia provided the space. The constitution and the house both suffered the same fate: under rubble. A huge hole was dug for the mall - which has not been built - but permanently damaged the main building.
Emarat-e Masoodiyeh, Masoodiyeh palace, constructed on the orders of Zel-ol-Soltan, son of Nasser al-Din Shah, sits on five hectares of orchards. It has a remarkable facade with incredible carvings, disguising the fact it is crumbling from the inside.
Masoodiyeh palace in Tehran, Iran.
The house has garnered mainstream attention unlike any other in Tehran. In 2014, the Tehran autumn music festival was held there and most recently, the popular band Pallett held a ceremony to release their album on the palaces grounds with nearly 1,000 fans in attendance. They also have a song dedicated to Masoudiyeh in their new album: Tehran, Smile. None of this has quickened the pace of promised renovations inside the home, run jointly by Tehrans Beautification Organisation and the Heritage Organisation.
Tehrans Beautification Organisation, an agency that operates under the municipality, but with its own independent budget, walks on shaky ground. On paper, it is responsible for carrying out artistic projects around the city, and in conjunction with the Heritage Organisation, repairing and maintaining the citys monuments. While it employs sociologists, artists and architects who understand the worth of the citys old treasures, it is under the wings of a far larger body, the municipality, that is leading the charge for high-rises and shopping malls.
It often feels like we have to fight our own limbs, says an artist who works for the organisation. The municipality seems lost between the thirst for more and more real estate, which yields revenue, and the need to save what is left of the very things that give the city character. Some of Tehrans most notorious developers sit on the city council, only exacerbating this dilemma.
But so have we, the residents. Our very existence has mutated the shape and look of this city, from 15,000 residents in Qajar times to more than 8 million today. That the rats of Tehran are almost as big as cats not only speaks to the greed of developers, but how cities have come to be in the 21st century. Mass migration from villages and small towns to cities is the fuel driving ever more apartment buildings , more garbage , more waste, the very thirst for more.
A city without a memory may be a city lost. But what makes Tehrans story flit between the tragic and the uplifting is not just what has been lost but what has been salvaged, repaired, somehow maintained. Part of this citys story is this push and pull, this battle of opposing forces.
Tehran is a city with a past, and there are walls, homes and even people here to still remind you. If you look carefully, beyond the malls, and the butcher shops.

With the Womens World Cup final ahead, the soccer world must call for an end to the Islamic republics law against women going to stadiums, say prominent human rights activists

As the world watches Sundays Womens World Cup final, TV cameras will capture the joyful faces of spectators of all ages, races, and genders. Such joy, taken for granted by many people around the world, is unfortunately denied to women in Iran.
Since 1982, the Islamic republic has prohibited women from attending football and other sporting events. Though such discrimination is a blatant violation of the statutes and guiding principles of Fifa, it has counted the Islamic republic of Iran football federation as a member for over 30 years without the slightest reproach. The time has come for the world to call on Fifa, and for Fifa to call on Iran, to put an end to discrimination against women.
Barring women from entering football stadiums is a violation of article three of the Fifa statutes, its governing document, which states: Discrimination of any kind against any Country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.

Gender-based discrimination also violates Fifas objectives, which are set forth in Article 2 of the statutes, include [promoting the game of football] globally in light of its unifying, educational, cultural and humanitarian values, as well as [controlling] every type of Association Football by taking steps to prevent infringements of the Statutes, regulations or decisions of Fifa. Members of Fifa are required to comply fully with the statutes pursuant to article 13. Articles 14 and 15 provide for the suspension or expulsion of any member that seriously violates the Statutes, regulations or decisions of Fifa.
Iranian women  and men  have taken great risks to draw attention to gender apartheid at sporting events. Offside, a 2006 film by acclaimed director Jafar Panahi , chronicles the poignant struggle of several girls who attempt to sneak into a football match by dressing as men. In 2014, a group of women, including 25-year-old Ghoncheh Ghavami , were arrested for trying to attend a volleyball match in Tehran. Ghavami was sentenced to a year in jail, but released after several months due to an international uproar.
In recent months, the movement has taken on a global dimension. Thousands of Iranian men and women have taken to social media and sporting events around the world, including the 2015 Asian Cup matches in Australia in January, the Iran-Sweden football friendly in Stockholm in May, and the FIVB World League volleyball matches in Los Angeles and Tehran in June, to call for an end to the ban on Iranian women in Iranian stadiums. In February, prominent Iranian activists penned a letter to Fifa president Sepp Blatter. Though Blatter expressed public support for their cause, the situation in Iran remains unchanged.
In tackling gender discrimination, Fifa can take example from its strong position against racism. Fifa has promoted widely its Say No to Racism campaign, including at matches and across various media. Fifas Resolution on the Fight against Racism and Discrimination in its 63rd session of the Fifa congress, held in May 2013, established requirements for competition organizers to formulate concrete action plans to fight racism and deploy anti-discrimination officers in every match, and prescribed a stricter application of sanctions in response to violations.
Instead of expelling the Islamic republic of Iran football federation from Fifa - which would crush the spirit of tens of millions of Iranians - similar anti-gender discrimination rules, regulations, programs and publicity campaigns could provide Fifa and the global community of football fans with more effective tools to enforce and promote Fifa policies and bring an end to discrimination against women in the world of football.
Such strong actions are necessary if Fifa is to remain faithful to its statutes and guiding principles, including its commitment to promote football as a unifying force.

North Korea is the best place on the planet  or that is what Hyeonseo Lee believed when she was growing up. It was a rose-tinted vision that faded during the devastating famine that swept through the country in the 1990s.
Hyeonseo became one of thousands of defectors to try to escape across the border to China  a dangerous journey that risks being sent to one of North Koreas infamous prison camps or even death.
Speaking at a Ted talk in 2013, Hyeonseo said she couldnt remember many details of her crossing  apart from the dead bodies floating down the river.
Once she was safely across she went into hiding with her relatives in China before making her way to South Korea , where she now lives and divides her time between her studies and work as a human rights activist.

Eleven years after she left North Korea, Hyeonseo returned to China to help her mother and brother make their own perilous escape .
She wrote of being reunited with her mother in the memoir The Girl With Seven Names: My mind still held the image of her face the night Id last seen her. She was 42 then, and a woman of so much energy she could hardly sit still ... She was far thinner than I remembered, and her mouth was drawn and lined.
Hyeonseo will be talking about her dramatic life story at a Guardian Live event in London from 7-8.30pm (BST) tonight, joined by the Guardians Emma Graham-Harrison , SinoNK s Adam Cathcart and the BBCs John Sweeney .

I have a question for each of the authors regarding their individual stories, if they wouldn't mind talking a little bit about them.
Segun Afolabi: What drew you to the topic of religious revivals and faith healers like Daddy Cool? Did you do any first-hand research on the subject?
Namwali Serpell: I'm so interested in the point-of-view shifts in "The Sack," and how you hold off on revealing the complicated relationship between J. and his bwana until the very end. Could you talk about how you arrived at this structure for the story?
FT Kola: You do such a great job of evoking the awkwardness the Colonel's wife feels at the party, trying to navigate both her husband's excessive pride and her discomfort with her surroundings. I'd love to hear about how you captured such a rich, complicated depiction of her social distress.
Elnathan John: I'm most interested in the resurrections in the story, both for Aunt Keturah in the end, and for Tachio as he considers what his old life must have been like to end up in the refuge home. Could you speak to the connections between Tachio's dream life and the revelations he make from reading the refuge home's records about the histories of the other children?
Masande Ntshanga: One of the things the story foregrounds is the adolescent sexuality of the boys -- developing just as they enter an era in which sex takes on new consequences. What drew you to focusing on young men of this age, and how do their relationships provide a focal point for the larger social changes that the grey man foreshadows?
Thank you all!

Thanks Mr Tibs - I was drawn to the issue of faith healing on several counts including the disappoint of people, post-revival, whose conditions havent improved, and also the tremendous amounts wealth amassed by the pastors who minister to these people - the dichotomy there and the possibility of deep disappointment (or being able to rationalise or even blame oneself because of a lack of faith). And yes, a significant amount of research (but I also go to church from time to time).

Hi Mr Tibs, thank you for taking the time to read our stories and to ask such thoughtful questions! I'm glad the awkwardness comes through in the story - part of my project was to evoke several types of social discomfort and awkwardness, and hopefully to make the reader feel them too.. One type is of course the awkwardness that the greater political situation (occurring in the background) brings about. These are people that are just not comfortable with one another, and they have to talk politely around Apartheid and what it means. But the other is just the very mundane awkwardness of going to a party where you don't know anyone. I wanted the Colonel's wife to be feeling both, and for the two to merge and mingle within her. So part of the writing process for her character was just thinking about all the times I've been to parties and felt awkward, and part of it was imagining the heightened anxiety that engagement between racial groups during Apartheid would cause. For that, I relied on stories from my parents and older relatives. It was then easy to draw the Colonel's wife's focus inwards, into her interior, but of course she simply finds more worries there.
03 July 2015 1:03pm
MrTibs, I'm interested in what you think. Do you find that narrative delay and shifts in perspective are true to life, or distinctly fictional techniques? Do you think they produce a different experience than one would get from interacting with a group of new people? Does time work differently in life, fiction, and dream? Or are they all versions on a continuum?

I was drawn to the age because I wanted to evoke a visceral and physical memory of Bhisho, in which I'd spent some of my childhood years. In writing, I often associate childhood memory with the senses and adult memory with language. I wanted the story to be immersive--to feel more like an experience than a linear narrative.
Their relationships provide a focal point for the larger social changes that the grey man foreshadows insofar as both of them--the group of boys and the country--experience an opening into something unknown: the end of childhood on the one hand, and the end of apartheid--or the shifting of history--on the other.
The link in the narrator's personal discovery of sexuality and the country's re-discovery of the implications and consequences of sex was fortuitous.

We couldn't be more ready, says first African team to enter Tour de France
MTN-Qhubeka will make history tomorrow at start of the worlds biggest bike race. Theyre aggressive, cohesive and ready to compete, says Richard Poplak

Cycling is arguably the most brutal voluntary activity on earth, matching the demands of all other blood sports  war and politics included.
Douglas Ryder , the impresario behind Africas first cycling team MTN-Qhubeka , knows all this. Back in 2007, Ryder founded what had long been considered an impossibility: an African-owned, African-sponsored, African-managed professional cycling team designed to race the Grand Tours in general and the Tour de France in particular.
Related: Africa is coming: how MTN-Qhubeka can blaze a trail at the Tour | Tim Lewis
Dougie, as hes affectionately known in local circles, was smart enough to do away with the politics  Eritreans riding alongside Ethiopians; Rwandan Hutus riding alongside Tutsis; white South Africans riding alongside black South Africans. Ryder was happy to build a pedal-powered scale model of Thabo Mbekis African Renaissance.
And Ryder likes to win: the team he assembled, on the back of significant buy-in from the South African cellular megalith MTN , was more advanced than most of the big names in Europe.
He knew that in the post- Lance Armstrong era, cycling teams had to look and feel clean, and it helped to have a significant corporate social responsibility component.
He paired up with the charity Qhubeka , which provides locally assembled bikes to rural South African children. He hired top-notch scientists and nutritionists; and he placed on his roster hardened vets from Germany and Lithuania and Italy to turn his youngsters into pros.
Soon, his cyclists started to win.
Not just African races, but international events, catching everyones attention. The first big European result came during the 2013 Milan-San Remo spring classic . In weather so foul the race had to be curtailed, the German Gerald Ciolek won in a sprint finish, beating superstar sprinters Peter Sagan and Fabian Cancellara in the process.

The Tour
Suddenly MTN-Qhubeka was a big deal, impossible to write off as a corporate South African whim, and a wildcard berth in the Vuelta a Espaa followed.
Curiously, further 2014 wildcard entries for the Giro dItalia and the Tour de France  which along with the Vuelta constitute cyclings Grand Tours  were not forthcoming. People started to doubt whether MTN would get anywhere in the sport.
But this year, the team has won its entry to the greatest race on earth, as its known, La Grande Boucle  the 2015 Tour de France .
Nine men have been picked for the roster , five of them African, kitted out in Cervlo bicycles, Samsung electronics, and other high-end gadgets.
It was the Critrium du Dauphin , an eight-day stage race that is seen as preparation for the Tour, that tipped Ryders hand somewhat. His superb Eritrean climbing specialist Daniel Teklehaimanot won the polka dot jersey, the honour bestowed for claiming the most points on the hills. The Kenyan-born, South African-bred 2013 Tour de France winner Chris Froome took the general classification for the British team Sky.
There were other encouraging signs too. Louis Meintjes, the 23-year-old South African who is perhaps the best cyclist the country has ever produced, made a courageous bid for a mountain stage win. The team looked cohesive, aggressive, and mature. Nothing slapdash about them. They were world class.
We want African riders to be involved in all the teams in the future
Douglas Ryder
But everything up until the first pedal stroke of the Tour de France counts as nothing more than practice. With this in mind, I phoned Ryder to find out how he was managing expectations. His squad is a canny combination of raw talent and grizzled experience, and includes big names such as Norways Edvald Boasson Hagen and Americas Tyler Farrar, with newbies including Eritreas Merhawi Kudus , who is barely 21.
We couldnt be more ready if we tried, says Ryder.
Unsurprisingly, no one is more bullish on African cyclings future. Do I ever think this team will ever be 100% African? No. The international riders are fast tracking our African riders to success  having a rider like Edvald Boasson Hagen, who has been on two Tour de France winning teams with Froome and [Bradley] Wiggins  you cant buy that experience.
What I do see is that this international group will slowly become the support riders on this team. Also, we want people from all markets to build visibility for this team  our role is to spread the Qhubeka message.
As for this being the beginning of an African era, Ryder did not disagree. Do I think cycling will undergo the major change like marathon running did? Perhaps. But I definitely believe therell be a massive transformation happening in the next five to 10 years. MTN cant sustain all the talent in Africa , but we want African riders to be involved in all the teams in the future. Hopefully over time therell be more investment in African cycling, largely because of our pioneering potential. Its about the sustainability and the growth of it over the continent.

A year after the war, Gaza grieves for its child casualties
At a school where six boys were killed during last summers Israeli offensive, the loss is an open wound. For other young Palestinians, the scars are psychological

The walls of the office of Salim Abu Rous, headmaster of the Doha boys secondary school in Rafah, in the south of the Gaza Strip, are decorated with medals and trophies. He has photo albums of the boys in football teams and other clubs.
About 1,000 pupils attend his school, arriving in two shifts  so many that he struggles to remember the names of all the boys killed in last summers war.
I remember Haitham Abdul Wahab, he says finally, flicking through one of the picture albums to try to find him. He was a good boy. He was well loved in the school. He was killed at his uncles house with his brother and mother.
Six pupils from the Doha school were killed in the war, more than from any other school in Gaza. In total, more than 550 Palestinian children died during the conflict. Across Gaza, schools lost pupils and teachers, and thousands were injured.
Salim Abu Rouss difficulty in remembering all the dead boys is understandable given some had not long transferred into his large school.

But there is another, grimmer, reason. There were so many deaths in the last war, he says  so many it was hard to process them. The consequence is that, on an institutional level at least, it appears as though the boys have been almost erased from the schools memory.
But in their homes in neighbourhoods and villages across the Rafah area  which saw some of the heaviest attacks of the 50-day war  the anguish is still raw.
Anas Muamar was 16 when he was killed on 20 July last year.
It was two oclock in the morning. We werent sleeping here. It was too dangerous. So we were staying in another place we thought was safer, recalls his father, Mahmoud Hussein Mahmoud Muamar, a former employee of the religious affairs ministry.
There was a very loud explosion. Anas had been sleeping but woke up and went to the balcony to see what had happened. After a while they went back inside. Thats when the house was hit again. His two brothers were killed and Anas was injured.

Mahmouds face crumples into tears. We took him to the hospital  but he died. He was a good boy. He was a good student who liked football and followed Barcelona. He was religious, like his brothers. This year he was supposed to have been in the twelfth grade. I wanted him to go to university and become a teacher.
Gazas youngest residents still appear to be bearing the heaviest and most lasting consequences of last summers war. A report published on Monday by Save the Children, entitled A Living Nightmare: Gaza One Year On, says 551 children were killed and 3,436 were injured, of whom 10% suffered permanent disability. One Israeli child was killed during the war, and 270 injured.
Three-quarters of Gazas children experience unusual bedwetting regularly, the report says, while 89% of parents report that their children suffer constant feelings of fear, and more than 70% of children say they are worried about another war. Seven out of 10 children interviewed now suffer regular nightmares.
What is also clear is that the loss of older teenagers  such as the six Doha pupils on the brink of adulthood  has affected younger siblings and parents, compounding a deepening sense of fatalism and hopelessness in a Gaza where the promised reconstruction has barely happened and whose outlook, Palestinians say, seems bleaker than at any time in recent memory.
A green Hamas flag flies above the family compound where Muhammad Behabsa, 17, died, off a sandy lane in the Salaam district of Rafah. There seems little question that the house and five others beside it, occupied by relatives, were the intended Israeli target.
Like many living in areas heavily hit by military strikes during the war, the Behabsa family still live next to the ruins where their family members died. The main house was hit in an air strike that left a crater still visible in the dusty yard. A little later several smaller houses belonging to family members behind the compound were reduced to rubble in a second set of strikes, apparently by artillery fire.
It happened at three oclock in the morning on 2 August, recalls Muhammads father, Shiab Hussein Behabsa, 52. He was on his own, sleeping in the diwan of one of the houses behind this one. An F-16 hit this house with a bomb at first and then three artillery shells hit the five houses behind.
He was cut to pieces.. Five of his cousins were killed in the same incident.

Like Anas, he wanted to go to university, in his case to study law.
His headmaster and other teachers came to pay their condolences. His friends from school still come to visit. He was my second son but he was the dynamo of the family. He liked to joke but he would also help. If I needed anything it would be him who went to fetch it from outside.
Abdullah Qishta, 17, also from the Doha school, died on the same day while returning from a summer job he had found at a dairy farm.
When the war started, he continued working, his father, Naim, says. We moved to a house belonging to a relative of my wife when the ground invasion started. On 2 August the owner called and asked him if he would go and feed the animals. He said the situation near the farm was fine. But it wasnt. When he got there the Israelis were close so the owner said he should sleep there.
He wanted to come home and get some clothes and take a shower. He was calling every 10 minutes. Then the calls stopped. He had been walking back with another worker from the farm when he was hit by a drone missile near the house.
Back at the school, now closed for the summer holidays, Salim Abu Rous describes the aftermath of losing so many of his pupils. In the beginning the education ministry sent people to support the school. We had a mental health programme with plays and films and activities supported by Unicef.
We had a football team named after the boys. Some of their friends still talk about them.
The ministry never told us we had lost the most pupils of all the schools in Gaza. I have no explanation of why we suffered the worst. But the war took place during the school holidays. The boys were with the families. Perhaps that is why so many children died.
Hasan Zeyada, a community psychologist in Gaza, believes that children and young people have been the most affected group, both because of the last war and in the wider context of blockade and conflict that means children over the age of nine will have lived through three wars and continuous economic siege.

Children present problems you would expect. Hyper-vigilance, nightmares, cognitive problems. Teachers complain about falling performance in the classroom. In communication they become aggressive verbally and physically.
A yardstick is the feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness here in Gaza. It affects motivation and depresses the emotions.
Back in Rafah, Suleiman Loulahi, a Bedouin agricultural worker who lost his son Bilel, 17, a pupil at Doha, also on 2 August, reflects the new fatalism that has crept into Gaza.
He has named a new baby after the brother he never knew, killed by a missile while he was returning to his house from a relatives where they were feeding his pigeons.
Loulahi says: I look at my other children, and these days I wonder what the point is encouraging them to go to school, to better themselves and get on, when there will only be another war in a few years. When Ill risk losing them again.

Opening summary
Good morning and welcome to the Guardians live coverage of 7/7 memorial events in London and across the UK.
Its hard to believe a decade has now passed since the devastating attack that claimed the lives of 52 people and injured hundreds more on the capitals public transport network. For many, most clearly for those who survived the terrorist attack or lost loved ones, the coordinated suicide bombings remain as vivid now as if they happened yesterday.
London and the UK would never be quite the same again after the explosions that ripped through through three tube trains and a bus, bringing a cruel end to Londons celebratory mood - the previous day the nation was awarded the 2012 Olympics.
With a significant terrorist assault in London four years after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the US, Britain was embedded even deeper into the so-called war on terror. Community tensions ramped up, anti-terror laws became increasingly archaic, police and security services powers more sweeping.
Today, the country has been asked to observe a minutes silence at 11.30am in memory of the victims of the atrocity as a service at St Pauls Cathedral attended by David Cameron and the Duke of York takes place.
Across Londons public transport network, announcements will be halted and bus drivers asked to bring vehicles to a stop if they can do so safely. Tube services would run as normal but passengers would be asked to observe the silence and platform and other announcements would be paused.
Wreaths will be laid beforehand at the permanent Hyde Park memorial to the tragedy, where a second service, to be attended by the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, will take place later, featuring music, a series of readings and the laying of flowers.
As 7 July 2005 dawned, Prime minister Tony Blair and the Queen were among those leading celebrations after Londons Olympic bid emerged victorious.
But Mohammed Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Jermaine Lindsay, 19, had already set in motion devastating plans that bring the jubilant atmosphere to an end.
The four men met at Luton station that morning where they took a train to Kings Cross in London. They embraced and separated to carry out their deadly missions.
Within three minutes of 8.50am, Tanweer detonated his bomb at Aldgate, Khan set his device off at Edgware Road and Lindsay blew himself up between Kings Cross and Russell Square.
Hussain detonated his device on board the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square at 9.47am.
Twenty-six died in the bombing at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line, six in the bombing at Edgware Road on the Circle Line, seven in the bombing at Aldgate on the Circle Line and 13 in the bombing on the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square. Hundreds more were injured.

Google revs up carpooling with Waze app in Israel trial
RideWith uses technology developed by the Israeli start-up bought by Google to connect drivers with people travelling in same direction
Waze, whose app provides real-time traffic information, is testing a carpooling service in Israel.
Carpooling could be set for a new trip around the block following a decision by Google to test a new app in Israel .
RideWith uses technology developed by Waze , an Israeli start-up bought by Google in 2013 for about $1bn.
Its navigation system, which uses data from users smartphones to give live traffic information, learns the routes drivers most frequently take to work and matches them up with people wanting to travel in the same direction.
It is aimed at people who work for the same company and live reasonably close to each other.
Related: LAPD chief's claim that Waze 'helps criminals' leaves many in blank disbelief
An estimated 200,000 people participate in carpooling in Israel already.
Unlike ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, drivers using RideWith cannot profit from participating and thus the app relies to some degree on goodwill.
They can charge a modest fee that is based on the distance travelled and wear and tear, with a maximum price set. Waze will take a 15% cut.
Drivers will be limited to two journeys a day, with more passengers than drivers expected initially.
Waze said it was conducting a small, private beta test in the greater Tel Aviv area for a carpooling scheme, but had nothing further to announce.
The service is expected to be offered in other parts of Israel if the Tel Aviv trial is successful.
The Waze app is available on Android and iOS and allows users to see friends who are driving to the same destination if connected via Facebook.
The non-profit format of RideWith could improve its chances of being accepted more readily if Google decides to introduce the app in other countries.
Uber is battling opposition from taxi drivers and regulators in numerous markets.
Last week, it shut down the UberPop service , which allowed non-professional drivers to take passengers, in France following the arrest of two executives and protests from taxi drivers.
In May, a court in Milan ordered the company to stop offering the service in Italy .
Uber has not offered the Pop service in the UK, where it operates as a registered minicab company.

        <title>Beer and business: the unexpected benefits of water access in Cameroon</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/07/beer-and-business-the-unexpected-benefits-of-water-access-in-cameroon</Link>

When the government of Cameroon started a solar-powered water distribution system in the north of the country, the objective was to improve access to potable water and to ease irrigation for farmers in an area beset by drought, water-related illnesses and an influx of refugees fleeing Boko Haram attacks.
Related: Access to clean water and sanitation around the world  mapped
But the pioneering $1.3m project has had an unexpected effect: most of the recipients of the water in the local village of Mindif are using it to start small businesses, which they see as the best way of adapting to the increasingly tough climatic conditions and to overcome poverty.
Using the water source to invest in businesses shows how water resources can be used to build resilience among very poor communities, said Zachee Nzoh Ngandembou, the coordinator of the Center for Environment and Rural Transformation (Cerut), a Cameroonian NGO helping local communities, especially women, invest in income-generating activities to fight poverty.
Using the sun to combat the lack of water
In the parched six neighbouring villages - Mindif, Larie, Katchel, Dir Irlagare, Mayo Bahehel and Ouro Dole  many herders had lost nearly all their animals, their main sources of income, as a result of the regions erratic rainfall and drying groundwater supplies.
The new water supply system uses a 2,500 cubic metre water tower, built into the hills 15 km from Mindif. Using power from solar panels, the water is pumped up from an underground reservoir and distributed through a network of pipes to Mindif and the other villages.
Using the overabundance of sunshine, the system pumps more than 40,000 litres of potable water to the villages per day, providing families with water they desperately need, and rendering cases of water-related diseases a thing of the past, says water project engineer Jorel Kom. Experts involved the project are confident that the water will not run out.
Related: Decade of drought: a global tour of seven recent water crises
In the villages, more than 40 water storage containers collect the supplied water, which is delivered into household containers using a low-maintenance hand pump. Just one year after the project, clean drinking water is available to 80% of people in the villages.
Turning water into beer
With support from the government, Cerut gave out small grants of around 1,000 to more than 200 women to invest in businesses such as farming, soft drinks processing and cattle-rearing.
Ayisha Bouba, a farmer in Mindif, says that the new water supply project is a huge help to women who previously had to walk long distances to find water.
More than 60% of the women who benefited from the water supply and grants from Cerut are now involved in one business type or another, especially the brewing of Bil-Bil beer, a popular drink in the Sahel region. Farmers who grow millet used in the beer say better access to water has also improved their business prospects, both in production output and sales. Demand for the drink has become very high, especially in neighbouring northern Nigeria due to scarcity triggered by insecurity from Boko Haram attacks.
My business has since grown bigger, attracting more customers who no longer doubt the source of water used for production, said Bouba. She says that with constant water supply her millet farm has increased production from 20 tonnes to more than 80 tonnes in less than a year.
Government water experts say NGOs such as Plan Cameroon and Unicef spare no efforts to improve conditions around water supply in northern Cameroon communities, where there are recurrent cases of cholera.
The government and many development partners have provided more than 1,000 boreholes to date, says Parfait Ndeme from the Ministry of Mines, Water Resources and Energy . The cost of providing potable water in the Sahel region might be three times more costly than in the rest of Africa. Distance is one major factor that influences cost and the arid climate in the region makes it difficult to have underground water all year round.
Essimi Menye, Cameroons Minister of Agriculture, hopes more solar-powered water distribution projects will be constructed in neighbouring northern Nigeria, Niger and Chad to minimis e water-related diseases.
Related: Farmers versus big business: the politics of irrigation in Tanzania
We will encourage the provision of more water sources that will permit farmers to improve on the quality and quantity of their production and fight against poverty and hunger in the desert-stricken northern region of Cameroon and beyond. says Menye. There can be no development and improvement in livelihood without water.

Ice caves popular with hikers north-east of Seattle partially collapsed, killing one person and leaving at least four others injured, officials said.
Mondays collapse came after authorities warned that the caves were especially dangerous because of warming temperatures.
The person who died remained buried under the debris at the Big Four Ice Caves east of Verlot, Snohomish County sheriffs spokeswoman Shari Ireton said late Monday night. The recovery effort was suspended at nightfall.
All victims were believed accounted for, Ireton said.
Three of the injured, including a 25-year-old man in critical condition, were airlifted to a Seattle trauma center. They included a seriously injured 35-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman in satisfactory condition, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg said. Their injuries included cuts and leg and pelvis fractures.
A fourth person, a juvenile girl with minor injuries, was sent to an Everett, Washington, hospital, Ireton said. Providence regional medical center in Everett also expected a second patient, spokeswoman Diane Torrance said late Monday night.
The ice caves have been closed until further notice.
The first call to emergency services came in about 5.38pm Monday and the collapse probably happened about 45 minutes earlier, Ireton said. There was no cellphone service at the remote cave site.
The US forest service warned hikers in May that the ice caves were in their most dangerous state due to unseasonably warm weather. The caves about 70 miles north-east of Seattle are a popular hiking destination. Temperatures in the area Monday reportedly were in the 80s.
Multiple warning signs have been put up in the past year to indicate the danger, Tracy OToole, a spokeswoman for the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie national forest, told the Daily Herald of Everett.
On Sunday, a hiker filmed a section of the caves tumbling down. Several tourists were inside a cave during that collapse, but there were no reported injuries.
The caves are formed by avalanches that cascade down from nearby Big Four Mountain during winter and spring. Most years, one or more caves form as the ice melts.
In July 2010, an 11-year-old girl was killed near the caves by a bouncing chunk of ice. She never even went inside the caves.
Chloe Jakubowski, 18, told the Seattle Times that she and three friends drove about 15 miles to a pay phone to alert emergency crews to the injuries.
Everybody there, we grabbed everybody out and helped as best we could, she said.
Jakubowski told the Times she and a handful of others were in the cave when she heard a loud crack, then ice and debris cascaded down. She said she covered her head with her arms and crouched behind a giant rock of ice.
When she stood up, a woman next to her lay unconscious. Others nearby had cuts and broken bones.
It was extremely gruesome, honestly, said Jakubowski, who suffered scratches and other minor injuries. She said she saw the warning signs outside but went in anyway, adding she didnt see anything that seemed to point toward a collapse, and others already were in the cave.

        <title>Puerto Ricans have a message for the US: 'Give us the tools to help ourselves'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/puerto-rico-statehood-sovereign-rights-debt-crisis</Link>
        <Description/>

The word colony conjures images of conquistadors and pilgrims, slavery and imperialism. But in Puerto Rico the supposed anachronism slips into daily conversations about the unstable present and an uncertain future.
Since the April day in 1899 when Americans formally took over the island, Puerto Ricans have felt uneasy about their status within the United States.
And as the island faces a debt crisis that has cratered its economy and sent its leaders to Washington to plead for more sovereign powers, the issue has taken on a new urgency.
Unique among US territories, Puerto Rico has a state-like government but is not a state: it draws all its authorities from Washington DC and is restricted in ways states are not. The islands ports can only do business with US ships, for instance, and the territory depends heavily on federal aid.
Most pressingly, however, the island lacks authority to either file for bankruptcy or restructure its $72bn municipal debt.
Governor Alejandro Garca Padilla argues that in its current form the debt is unpayable and that greater austerity will exacerbate already difficult living conditions . Padilla has stopped short of endorsing statehood, instead trying to focus on limited new powers.
But other politicians have been bolder. In April, Republican presidential frontrunner Jeb Bush endorsed statehood for Puerto Rico , the homeland of tens of thousands of recent migrants to Florida, the former governors home state.
Puerto Rican citizens ought to have the right to determine whether they want to be a state, he said. I think statehood is the best path, personally. To get the full benefits and responsibilities of citizenship, being a state is the only way to make that happen.
Proponents of statehood argue that its a simple matter of fairness. The islands Democratic delegate in Congress, Pedro Pierluisi , introduced a bill in February that could make Puerto Rico a state by 2021 should a majority of Puerto Ricans vote for statehood  as 61% did in a non-binding referendum in 2012.
One of the top fundraisers for Barack Obamas presidential campaigns, Andrs Lpez, has argued that the status quo is not only unequal but unsustainable.

But the issue has found virtually no traction in Congress, and even appeals over bankruptcy powers have divided the House.
Many Puerto Ricans are skeptical of statehood, saying formal inclusion in the union would do almost nothing to ameliorate pressing issues of unemployment, healthcare and housing.
Antonio Cuarro, a shop owner in Rio Piedras, said the debate amounted to empty rhetoric. Each government just uses one side or the other to get elected, he said. Its all the same.
San Juan legislator Luis Gallardo agreed, saying the campaign exists only in the imagination of our statehood politicians. A lot of people have tried to piggyback on the issue.
Gallardo said he was ambivalent: I dont know whats worse, not having federal bankruptcy powers or having federal income taxes on top of the highest local taxes in the country.
Others balked at becoming the 51st state. Attorney Manuel Rodriguez said statehood could help Puerto Ricans with access to the justice system, bankruptcy options and federal intervention, but its no magic solution and would not necessarily mean progress. Theres also no chance it will happen, given Congress.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans
Senator Ramn Nieves
A minority tapped into long-simmering nationalism and suggested more drastic changes  not quite the violent separatism of the 1960s and 70s, but a crusade for greater independence nonetheless.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation, said senator Ramn Nieves. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans.
What Puerto Rico needs is more powers in its relationship with the US, and eventually a new relationship with the US.
Nieves said Puerto Rico should follow the model of the Marshall Islands, which entered into a compact association with the US in order to retain some rights but also to move toward sovereign nationhood.
We value our history and relationship with the US  thousands of Puerto Ricans have died in foreign wars for a century  but the traditional options of statehood or independence dont help us right now, he said.
Washington has done close to nothing to help, Nieves said, suggesting exemptions from trade restrictions, or guarantees on some bonds: The Treasury always says it will provide technical assistance but that doesnt mean anything.
I dont mean that they should hand us a check for $72bn, but if they cannot be a little more active or willing to help us, they should give us the tools to help ourselves.
Sovereignty is not the same as independence, Nieves concluded. All independent nations are sovereign, but not all sovereign nations are independent.
In casual conversation many Puerto Ricans refer to the territory as a country, and occasionally as a colony. Monuments to Spanish and Latin American history and culture dominate San Juan: Miguel de Cervantes, Juan Ponce de Len and Simon Bolvar all stand tall in the city. References to the US are rarer: a statue of Abraham Lincoln in the old city, the outposts of federal agencies and tourists.
The relationship with the US has aggravated our problems, said Ataveyra Hernandez, a former adviser to the governor. Puerto Ricans are hugely dependent on the government, which depends on federal money. Its a structural problem, and theres an urgent need to renegotiate the relationship.
The Caribbean is full of countries that are small just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies.
The Caribbean is full of countries just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies
Ataveyra Hernandez
But with constant movement to and from the mainland, the close ties of families, and a continuing military presence on the island, emotional ties to the US remain strong for Puerto Ricans born on both shores. Both flags dot homes in San Juan.
Some view the question of independence more dispassionately. A metro employee at the Rio Piedras stop simply waved her hand toward the desolate plaza nearby.
Look at where we are, she said. Were not ready for that, no way.
In practical terms, Puerto Ricans already enjoy most of the same perks as other Americans, including US passports and billions in welfare from the federal government, though their semi-autonomous government is restricted by and depends heavily on the US. They cannot vote for president and lack a congressional representative who can vote outside of House committees.
But new arrivals to the US who change their residency will be able to vote in the 2016 presidential election, and they could potentially sway key states such as Florida.

        <title>Malcolm Turnbull: we must not amplify threat of Isis</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/07/malcolm-turnbull-we-must-not-amplify-threat-of-isis</Link>

Malcolm Turnbull has warned against over-hyping the threat posed by Islamic State, arguing it is important not to lend any credibility or currency to the grandiose delusions of the jihadists.
The communications minister used a speech delivered at the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night to make a plea for civility, calm and proportionality in Australias national security debate.
Tony Abbott has recently delivered an explicit warning that the Daesh death cult is coming for us, however, Turnbull argued it was important not to get sucked into the Isis strategy and ourselves become amplifiers of their wickedness and significance.
The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has previously made a direct comparison between the rise of Isis and the rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, but Turnbull reasoned Daesh was not Hitlers Germany, Tojos Japan or Stalins Russia.
Turnbull said on Tuesday night it was vital not to underestimate the security threat posed by Isis, but it was important also to preserve a sense of perspective given the organisations resorting to Hollywood techniques to amplify its significance.
Its leaders dream that they, like the Arab armies of the seventh and eighth century, will sweep across the Middle East into Europe itself, the communications minister said on Tuesday night.
They predict that before long they will be stabling their horses in the Vatican. Well Idi Amin wasnt the King of Scotland either.
We should be careful not to say or do things which can be seen to add credibility to those delusions.

In addition to the coming for us reference, the prime minister used the occasion of a Magna Carta lecture delivered in late June to note that Isis currently dominates an area about the size of Italy with eight million people. In the same outing, Abbott added that: Islamist terrorism confronts the world with a chilling choice: submit or die.
Turnbulls intervention at the Sydney Institute was a wide-ranging contribution which traversed the importance of the rule of law and also revisited some of the philosophical territory he invoked during the governments recent internal debate about its citizenship-stripping proposal .
An ambition by the prime minister and the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to bypass the courts and allow citizenships to be revoked at the discretion of a minister ran aground when a number of cabinet ministers, including Turnbull, objected to that proposal on the basis that it was likely to be unconstitutional.
Turnbull referred to the recent dispute explicitly, noting the government in the end chose to build on existing legal provisions instead of proceeding with a proposal which would give the minister the discretion to revoke Australian citizenship if he believed the person affected had engaged in terrorist activities.
The rule of law is respected because a person whose citizenship ceases in those circumstances has full recourse to the Australian courts under the constitution to contest the matter on its merits, he said.

The communications minister opened his address by arguing that in a policy sense, the Abbott government had got the balance between security and individual liberty right.

But he cautioned the national conversation about security policy needed to proceed in a considered manner respectful of the views and experience of others.
Echoing the principles he articulated during the citizenship policy debate, Turnbull told the Sydney Institute the Australian constitution empowered the courts for good reason.
To further nail the point, he quoted the founder of the Liberal party , Robert Menzies, from a speech from 1942, making the point that the law exists to protect individual freedom  even in a time of war.
If the day is to come when the courts are to be closed to the aggrieved citizen, when the Kings writ is not to run because popular uproar wills it so, when the appeal to the law is to be an occasion of scoffing, then that day will cast a black shadow across British freedom, Turnbull quotes Menzies as saying. The laws greatest benefits are for the minority man  the individual.
The communications minister noted that it could be hard to strike the right balance between the imperatives of delivering security for the citizenry and ensuring basic rights and liberties were not comprised.
We need to recognise that getting the balance right is not easy, not least because the balance may shift over time, and we are more likely to do so if there is a thoughtful and well informed public debate weighing up the reality of the national security threat, the effectiveness of particular proposed measures and then asking whether those measures do infringe on our traditional freedoms and if so whether the infringement is justifiable, Turnbull said.
It is important to remember that people and societies with an equal determination to defeat terrorism can have different views on what is the right balance and, indeed, what the right measures are.
Turnbull noted it was stupid to brand critics terrorist sympathisers if they questioned the effectiveness of national security policies  a description as stupid as describing those who advocate them as proto-fascists.
He said security and liberty were a complex balancing act, not an easy left/right divide.

On Tuesday evening, Turnbull was yet to rule out appearing on the next edition of Q&amp;A program.
Despite a ban on Coalition MPs from appearing on the show, Turnbull is scheduled to take part in next weeks panel and says whether he does will depend on the circumstances.
Time will tell  stay tuned, he said.

        <title>What Greek, and German, history can teach us about today's crisis</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/what-greek-and-german-history-can-teach-us-about-todays-crisis</Link>
        <Description/>

In an arty cinema at the end of the 60s I watched Costa-Gavrass stylish political thriller Z which satirised the brutal military regime then ruling Greece . When the film ended the audience enthusiastically applauded, something I had never previously seen in a cinema, and have rarely seen since.
As Europes acknowledged home of political philosophy and practice, Greece of the hated military dictatorship had a special place in the hearts of many Europeans, as it did for Lord Byron when he went off to fight (and die) for Greek independence in 1824. This weekends Solidarity with Greece demonstrations, in small villages as well as major cities, shows it still does.
In its showdown with creditors, the Greek government of Alexis Tsipras exploits this romantic attachment. And why not? Small countries have to use the assets at their disposal in a big world.
But sentiment alone is rarely an adequate guide to action, is it? The Greeks have a case against the counter-productive and excessive severity imposed on them by their creditors. But the creditors also have a case against the Greeks.
Foreigners did not make their government fiddle the entry qualifications to join the eurozone, rack up debts or force citizens to evade their taxes, unless you count the legacy of the rackety Ottoman empire which ruled Greece from 1453 to 1821.
But the very concept of Greece has always been both powerful and fragile, its existence more usually sustained by foreign or domestic tyranny than by sophisticated philosophies from the 4th and 5th centuries BC. Disunity and rebellion have also been characteristic features of Greek politics and identity.
After defeating successive invasions launched by the mighty Persian empire at Marathon (490BC), at Thermopylae (sort of), at Salamis, Plataea and Mycale, did not the Greek city states soon succumb to civil war which ended in Athenss defeat by militaristic Sparta? Yes.
And so it went on. Domination by Macedonia meant that the spread of Greek culture across the Mediterranean  previously led by the soft power of trade and settlement  was expanded east and south by the conquests of Alexander the Great (356BC to 323BC). The Romans later conquered, but deferred (though captured, Greece took its wild conqueror capture, wrote Horace the poet) to the Greeks, much as the Americans did towards Britain for a while. We are the Greeks to their Romans, the future PM, Harold Macmillan, once told a colleague.
In the western Roman empire Rome duly fell (476AD) to barbarian invasions. The eastern half, though battered, morphed into the Christian Byzantine empire which staggered on, a Greek entity, for 1,000 years before Constantinople finally fell to the Muslim Ottomans after the great siege of 1453.
Does any of this matter to the bean counters in Brussels or Berlin this summer? It should.
So should the bean borrowers of Athens acknowledge that German fear of excessive debt and a debauched currency is rooted in troubled German history, the Weimar Republic which led to the Nazi coup, and the fragility of a national identity ravaged by the brutal thirty years war (1618-48).
When Greece restored national sovereignty and unity in 1832, Germany was still 40 years away from doing the same.
If Greeks see themselves as victims, so do Germans, who have picked up the bill to rescue East Germany well within living memory and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans).
This is psychologically risky territory as Angela Merkel and her advisers decide what Germany  and the EU  must do to rescue Greece from its own brinkmanship and save Europe from its lackadaisical management of the crisis.
Germans picked up the bill to rescue East Germany and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans)
But rebellion comes more naturally to Greeks than to Germans who have often traded liberty for security, not always wisely, but understandable with fluid frontiers which an island people like us should gratefully acknowledge.
In the Ottoman centuries the Greeks had an instinct to side with the Caliphs enemies, rising in revolt many times and usually being hammered for their pains. The fact that Venetian Corfu remained free and prosperous and that Crete held out until 1670 (the long siege was a fashionable cause for years) only fed an appetite for defiance which broke into open, ultimately successful revolt in 1821. Cue Lord Byron.
Two further points are worth registering here.
Greeces successive 19th- and 20th-century wars to regain its historic territory, usually involving neighbouring Turkey (as the Ottoman successor state became after defeat in the first world war), were bloody, traumatic affairs. We hear a lot about the Turkish Armenian massacres (were they genocide?), less about the one million Greeks living abroad (resident for centuries) who may have died during waves of displacement and expulsion from Asia Minor. In invading Turkey in 1919, Greece was a part-author of its own misfortune: it lost.
None of this is good for people. Greece had rival governments, once pro-German, once pro-British, during the first world war and remained divided during the inter-war years. Greeks fought like tigers against the invading Italians in 1940 who had to be rescued by the Germans. Even Hitler acknowledged the courage of the Greek resistance which continued long after defeat.
Related: A brief history of German-Greek relations
But the German occupation was savage, both to Greeks and their economy. Many starved. Worse, the European peace of 1945 was followed by the Greek civil war of 1946 to 1949 in which Britain and the US backed the Greek government and the Greek communists were backed by Titos government in next-door Yugoslavia.
Stalin had agreed to leave Greece in the western sphere of influences in his percentages agreement with Churchill at the Kremlin in 1944. He just forgot to tell the Greek comrades. After yet another savage war, they lost, Greece joined Nato  much as it did the EU in 1981 after the Greek colonels were ousted when again the Turks invaded Cyprus (1974)  and Greek democracy was restored.
So the divided legacy of modern Greece remains and is vivid well within living memory  royalist and republican, left and right, urban and rural. The Syriza coalition, led by Tsipras, represents the defeated side in the civil war as Tsipras, a youthful communist of bourgeois stock, explicitly acknowledged in gestures made when he became prime minister in January.
Geographical determinists, the people who argue we are primarily shaped by our environment, might argue that a country with Europes longest coastline  more than 8,000 miles and 2,000 islands (mostly unpopulated)  is bound to be fractious.
In one of his Outliers essays, Malcolm Gladwell, made the point differently when he argued that herdsmen who tend sheep and goats on marginal land  in Greece, Sicily, Ireland or Tennessee  have to have short fuses or their neighbours will steal their animals. Hence the importance of the blood feud which persists. Arable farmers dont have them, its harder to steal wheat.
Be that as it may, Tsipras has his new mandate to negotiate with Brussels and Berlin on an emphatic 60% no vote from a deeply divided nation. Its not hard to see how things could get nasty quickly. And remember, those Germans feel hard done by and put upon too.

A car carrying a suicide bomber hit a vehicle containing foreign forces in Kabul on Tuesday, wounding at least two people, the second such attack by the Taliban within a week.
Elsewhere in the capital, gunfire and an explosion were heard as insurgents entered a building close to an installation used by Afghanistans intelligence agency, a police official said on Tuesday. No further details were immediately available.
Taliban militants and other insurgents have stepped up attacks on Afghan and foreign forces this year, following the withdrawal of most foreign troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2014.
As security has deteriorated across the country, some districts have fallen under Taliban control. The growing presence of forces loyal to Islamic State has fuelled concern that parts of the country are slipping out of Kabuls grasp.
An Afghan security official at the scene of the convoy attack said the vehicle carrying foreign forces caught fire after the explosion in the Shah Shaheed area of eastern Kabul.
The blast blew the vehicle off course and into a wall, leaving behind an empty charred hulk.
I can confirm that a suicide car bomber targeted foreign forces, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told Reuters.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. Last Tuesday, a suicide bomber struck a convoy of US. troops.
There were no fatalities in the latest attack apart from the bomber, the coalition said in a statement, declining to give details.
In this incident, one foreigner and one bystander were wounded, police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi said.
Gunfire and an explosion were reported from a second attack in the city, he added. We have reports that insurgents have entered a building, Karimi said, adding that the attack site was near an installation used by the intelligence agency.
About 9,800 U.S troops remain in Afghanistan, down from a peak of around 100,000 in 2011. The majority are training Afghan forces but a few thousand are still engaged in combat operations against the Taliban and others.
On a visit to Kabul on Saturday, US senator John McCain called for American troops to stay longer than planned to prevent gains by the militants.
The current schedule is for the military to draw down to an embassy presence by the end of 2016.

Nobody knows exactly when or why the witnesses and small-time crooks caught up in one of Indias biggest-ever corruption scandals began dying under mysterious circumstances. But in the past two years, thats whats happened to more than two dozen people implicated in a $1bn test-rigging scheme.
Even by standards in India, where corruption is routine , the scale of the scam in the central state of Madhya Pradesh is mind-boggling. Police say that since 2007, tens of thousands of people have paid hefty bribes to middlemen, bureaucrats and politicians to rig test results for medical schools and government jobs. Around 2,000 people have been arrested and more than 500 are on the run. Hundreds of medical students are in prison  along with several bureaucrats and the states education minister. Even the governor has been implicated.
Police have had their hands full racing to meet a deadline in the criminal probe. And now they are faced with the deaths of more witnesses and suspects. Last week, police said, one of those accused died after having chest pains in prison, another drowned in a village pond and a third died of a liver infection.
The police say they keep coming up against a wall in their investigation every time someone is found dead
Last Saturday, television reporter Akshay Singh died while investigating a suspects death. Singh sipped tea during an interview and began coughing and foaming at the mouth, according to media reports. He was rushed to hospital, where doctors said he had suffered a heart attack. Police said the initial examination did not reveal anything suspicious.
The states government, run by the Bharatiya Janata party, has said that no conspiracy was found in the recent deaths. But others involved in the case fear otherwise. The states chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said last Sunday that his mind is in agony and pain and promised that all the deaths will be investigated.
The police say they keep coming up against a wall in their investigation every time someone is found dead, said Chandresh Bhushan, chairman of the special investigation team that was appointed by the state court to monitor the police probe. We ask them, Why are so many dying in road accidents in this case? Does this have any link to the scam? There is no evidence of a link yet, but we cannot overrule it, either.
Cheating on school and college tests is commonplace in India. A few months ago, photographs of parents hanging precariously from school windows to throw cheat sheets to their children caused nationwide outrage.
But in Madhya Pradesh, cheating on tests became a sophisticated racket using various approaches. High-scoring students from around the country toting fake identity cards were brought in to impersonate applicants taking tests. Applicants would be told to leave their answer sheets blank so that scorers could fill them out in a separate room. And scores would be manipulated by testing board officials to favour bribe-paying candidates.
In July 2013, after a tipoff from whistleblowers, police arrested eight impersonators taking the medical school test in Indore. Police say that the scheme was operated by a syndicate of agents, doctors, officials and politicians across five states and that there was no single ringleader.
There is so much information with the investigators that it could bring the government down, said Ashish Chaturvedi, 26, one of the whistleblowers. He has been attacked 14 times by unknown assailants, he said. Six of the assaults took place in front of a police officer assigned by a court to protect him last year.
But so far they have just gone after students, middlemen and lower officials, Chaturvedi said. They are not even probing the roles of the big fish in the state.
The news portal the Wire called the scam one of the most complex, multi-layered scandals affecting public life in India, one that is fast acquiring the shades of a macabre crime thriller.
Many of the mysteriously dead are young  either students who paid money and made it into medical schools or job seekers trying to take tests to become police officers, schoolteachers, forest rangers and food inspectors.
Bribes for admission to medical schools ranged from $15,000 to $40,000
Some of the accused, called racketeers in police files, have died from poison. Others died in freak road accidents, or by consuming too much alcohol, or by hanging. One medical college dean died in a fire. A medical student was found dead on railway tracks. The son of the state governor was found dead at his fathers home in March, ostensibly from a brain haemorrhage.
Last week, Narendra Singh Tomar, a 29-year-old veterinarian who was in prison on charges of arranging impersonators for medical school applicants, complained of chest pain, police said, and died soon after in a hospital. His family told reporters that they suspected Tomar was murdered.
A day later, a 40-year-old assistant professor at a medical college, Rajendra Arya, who was out on bail after being charged in the case, died of a heart attack.
My father had switched his cellphone off for the last six days, said Rahul Arya, his 18-year-old son. He was getting some calls that caused a lot of stress to him. If indeed there [is] no foul play in these deaths, someone needs to ask why so many people are dying of natural causes in this case.
Everybody was making money, said Vivek Tankha, a lawyer representing the whistleblowers in the supreme court. It is no wonder that we are now witnessing one of the biggest cover-up operations in Indian corruption history.
Bribes for admission to medical schools ranged from $15,000 to $40,000.
On a recent sultry morning, Chaturvedi, the whistleblower, rode his bicycle down the narrow lane in Gwalior, followed by a police constable on another cycle, sweating and panting. The guard is supposed to trail him wherever he goes, but sometimes the officer fails to show up.
I worry about my safety because my task is not finished yet, Chaturvedi said as he pedalled. If I am not careful now, my whole battle of the last five years will go to waste.

When I wrote about Georgios and Barbara Karvouniaris , destitute but dignified Greeks who had lost jobs and home, and now live in a donated caravan on food hand-outs, I realised it was a powerful story that put a human face on Greeces tragedy.
What I had not anticipated was the number of Guardian readers, from all corners of the globe, who got in touch asking how they could help: from a businessman keen to commit to a monthly stipend of 100 a month, to a family wanting to send a cheque for $300.
It is impossible for people in the UK to hear stories like this, so close to home, and do nothing at all, one reader wrote. Thanks for highlighting whats happening to the little people  the stories of institutions, broad-stroke decisions and the mistakes of bureaucrats simply dont paint a true picture of whats happening.
Another said he was very moved by the plight of the Karvouniarises, and would like to donate a few dollars, while a third said she found the story so tragic and moving  is there any way at all that I can contribute something to help make their lives easier?
I was even contacted by a group of renewable energy researchers at a leading British university who wanted  if it was logistically possible  to explore the idea of donating and installing a solar panel for Georgios and Barbaras caravan, which is not connected to the grid.
The Guardian suspects there are similar cases of private charity helping ease the pain for countless Greeks in their hour of need.
Do you know of any similar initiatives? We would like to hear from anyone who is involved in, or who knows of, grassroots efforts by foreign individuals or groups to help families or communities in Greece affected by the crisis  examples of citizen solidarity?

French authorities are investigating the theft of roughly 200 detonators plus grenades and plastic explosives from a military site in southern France .
The thefts at the Miramas site, which is operated by a combination of military services west of Marseille, appeared to have taken place overnight from Sunday to Monday. The break-in came with France on its highest level of alert for terrorism following deadly attacks in January and June.
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said an investigation had begun into charges of theft with break-in carried out by a criminal group and fraudulent entry into a military compound.
An official with the gendarmerie police force, which generally runs law enforcement in more rural areas of France, said the thief or thieves appeared to have cut through a fence to enter the high-security site.
The defence ministry and a spokesman for the French military did not immediately respond to calls and text messages from the Associated Press seeking details.
The mayor of Miramas, Frederic Vigouroux, said he did not know precisely what was stolen, but said it was the first theft at the site. He said the outer fences were broken into, and that nine storehouses were affected.
It wasnt cotton candy that was stolen, he said. These are dangerous munitions. Everything is inherently dangerous.
The 200-hectare (500-acre) base sits on the outskirts of the town of 30,000 and stocks munitions of the type used in French military operations in Mali and Afghanistan.

The trial of Burmese migrant workers accused of killing British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao island last September is to start this week. The high-profile case has thrown the spotlight on Thailands legal failings and distressed the grieving families.
The criminal trial of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo will begin on Wednesday at a court on the nearby and larger island of Koh Samui and is expected to end on 25 September. A verdict is expected in October.
The legal team representing the 22-year-old bar and restaurant workers is made up of pro-bono lawyers and human rights activists who accuse Thai police of improperly collecting evidence at the crime scene, intimidation and abuse of witnesses and suspects, and not sharing key forensic evidence with the defence, a move they say seriously impedes a fair trial.
Thai police have denied any wrongdoing.
The court in April ordered that DNA and other physical evidence linking the Burmese migrant workers to the murder could be independently checked, a move the suspects lawyers said could help ensure justice is served. But the defence was later told the court would only answer these requests on the first day of the trial.

The defence has also accused the UK Foreign Office of being complicit in ensuring the men will not receive a fair trial after officials in London also refused to share any details about the prosecutions case. Their lawyers say this information is vital to allow the two men to defend themselves.
Metropolitan police detectives were sent to Thailand last year to look over the case and report back to officials and the families.
In the runup to the trial, the Guardian has learned that UK authorities have now provided some information to the defence.
There has been a lot more advance disclosure from the British side, said Andy Hall, a migrants rights activist from Britain who is working for the defence.
Weve also had positive cooperation from UK-based witnesses, Hall said.

Hall refused to detail what information had been provided, which agency provided it or how it would affect the trial. A UK Foreign Office spokeswomen also refused to comment on that issue but said consular officers provided support and assistance to the families of Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Miller, 24, from Jersey.
We want to see whoever committed these murders brought to justice through a fair and transparent process, the spokeswoman said.
Hall said he and the lead defence lawyer, Nakhon Chompuchat, were working with the defence to ensure justice though a fair trial to all involved, including the families of Witheridge and Miller.
Retracted confessions
During a frantic two-week investigation last year, Thailands prime minister, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, said he believed migrant workers were the culprits. Soon afterwards, the two young Burmese men were arrested.
The men initially admitted to the murder of Miller, who suffered head injuries and drowned in shallow water, and the rape and murder of Witheridge, who died from severe head injuries. Police said they were motivated by sexual jealousy after seeing the Britons together on the beach.

They were taken to the crime scene at the beach by the police  handcuffed and wearing body armour and helmets  to make a very public reenactment of the crime. But they then retracted their confessions, saying they had been tortured and threatened with death by their interrogators.
Human rights groups including Amnesty International have become involved, noting that Burmese migrant workers, of whom there are around 2.5 million, have previously been wrongly accused of crimes by Thai police.
Rights group Reprieve has also expressed alarm that British police might have provided evidence to Thai authorities who are seeking a death sentence. Under a British government protocol, British police and officials should not normally provide evidence when defendants face capital punishment in a foreign jurisdiction without getting assurances that a death sentence will not be carried out.
[UK authorities] must ensure that the Thai authorities comply with their international human rights obligations, Maya Foa, director of Reprieves death penalty team, told the Guardian.
The start of the trial will last three days, in which the prosecution is expected to call on witnesses who first came across the bodies.
Witheridges family said in the joint statement in December that UK detectives who travelled to Thailand cooperated with Thai police.
We would like to stress that as a family we are confident in the work that has been carried out into these atrocious crimes and want to remind both press and public that they do not have the full facts to report and make comment on at this stage, the family said.
Millers family said evidence collected by the Royal Thai police will be presented at court and we hope the suspects are granted a fair and transparent trial. We are thankful of the oversight of pressure groups such as Reprieve and Amnesty.
From what we have seen, the suspects have a difficult case to answer. The evidence against them appears to be powerful and convincing, they said.
Please remember that this is above all a story of two wonderful young people, David and Hannah, killed in the prime of their lives in a senseless and brutal way.

Extreme climate events of drought, erratic rainfall and violent winds are destroying crops and worsening living standards

One afternoon towards the end of May a violent wind howled through Bogand, the main town in Gnagna province, in eastern Burkina Faso . Raising a storm of dust and sand, it plunged the streets into semi-darkness, driving roaming goats crazy. In villages across Gnagna people connect these extreme climate events with deteriorating living standards. They explain how these increasingly frequent red winds wreak havoc, burying their crops in sand, destroying their homes, and spreading disease among their flocks.
In late May, on the great Gnagna plain, the earth is dry, with deep cracks. An occasional tree  usually red acacia (Vachellia seyal)  stands out as a patch of green. In the villages, most of the wells have dried up. It is the toughest part of the year, when reserves from the previous harvest run low and the next one is not yet ripe. And still there is no rain.
In 2014, just 538mm of rain fell here. Over the past 30 years, average annual rainfall has dropped by 200mm. The Sahel climate zone is steadily spreading further south. Bogand used to enjoy a Sudanese-Sahelian climate, but it is now borderline, says Claire Gaillardou, head of the risks and disasters department at the Action Against Hunger (ACF) mission in Burkina Faso. Since 1975 the [average] temperature has risen by 0.8C.
Tnidano Tissa, 78, remembers how the village looked when he was a child. There were great African mahogany, locust bean, fig and shi trees, all of which produced fruit. In the rainy season, long grass protected the ground. All year long there was a bit of plant cover. Wed see antelopes, big savannah monitors and hyenas, he says, drawing a smile from the youngest members of his audience, who have never seen such creatures.
The plant cover has vanished, and trees are now a rarity. With diminishing rainfall, the soil is blown away by winds that grow ever more violent. There are no longer any trees to slow them down, says Lankoand Diagnogou, 38, a neighbour of Tissas.
At Tindandou, 45km away, Diawari Barbibil, 63, is equally desperate. The loss of plant cover has speeded up soil degradation, and the rainy season is very short, he says.
The rain comes later and is interspersed with long periods of drought. Across the region, rainfall is increasingly erratic and increasingly intense. The rain cuts into the ground and washes away the little humus  which is essential to the fertility of the earth  it contains.
That, in turn, can cause flooding, because water has difficulty penetrating bone-dry earth. Some years the run-off rate can be as high as 40%, Gaillardou explains. ACF is trying to help communities adapt to these extreme climate events, which seem to get steadily worse. Assistance involves learning farming techniques that keep the water in the soil and reduce the effects of erosion.
This year Barbibil prepared three one-hectare fields, digging semi-circular hollows along the contour lines to trap as much rain as possible and create better conditions for sowing. He hopes this technique will yield a bigger crop.
Ten years ago, Barbibil was still harvesting five cartloads of grain. We could live very nicely on what I grew, and I could sell the surplus, he says. But in the last few years the soil has become so poor that I dont have anything to sell. The two cartloads I bring home are barely enough to feed the family. The rest of the crop is only fit for cattle-feed.
His 34-year-old son works with him now, and in all there are 16 mouths to feed. The rain stops before the millet has even had time to fully ripen. If theres no rain what you grow is worthless, Barbibil says. Due to the unpredictable rainfall he has had to give up the traditional crop of sorghum, which takes longer to ripen. He prefers to use white sorghum and pearl millet, with a shorter crop cycle.
In Burkina Faso in late May, as they waited anxiously for the next crop, more than 330,000 people faced food insecurity . In Gnagna province, with an average of seven people in each household, the situation is far worse than in the rest of the country. Farmers are producing less than half the food they need to survive. After four to six months their reserves run out. In the worst years, they have no option but to sell part or all of their livestock  if they have any  or run up debts.
When we run short of food, we have to turn to one of our neighbours in the village who has sufficient resources to lend us food, says Andr Dori, 38, who lives in Kongaye, in Gnagna province. Dori, who has four children, says he too can no longer meet his familys needs. These loans are in kind. With a 100% interest rate: for one sack of grain borrowed, I must pay back two. I am deep in debt, because my crops dont ripen properly, due to the climate. He has been unable to pay off any of his debts in recent years.
Dori hopes things will get better through the use of improved techniques. With more bountiful harvests, he says, he could feed his family and even buy livestock.

        <title>Bill Cosby: court documents open window into legal problems</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems</Link>

The release of documents on Monday from a civil lawsuit against Bill Cosby in 2005 offers the first glimpse inside the comics protracted legal problems involving allegations of sexual assaults raised over many years.
The case, brought by a former head of womens basketball at Temple University in Philadelphia, Cosbys alma mater, is the only legal proceeding relating to sexual assault allegations against Cosby that has ever been brought to conclusion, despite numerous accusations that have been brought against him by multiple women. Andrea Constand claimed that she had been drugged and molested by Cosby at his home in January 2005, but following a private settlement in the case, all documents relating to it were sealed, casting the whole matter under a deep layer of secrecy.

Constand herself has never spoken directly about the case since the settlement was reached in 2006.
Now, with the opening of the files following a federal court case brought by the Associated Press, a window has been opened into Cosbys behaviour under his own admission. It marks the first time that the actor has been heard, in his own words, directly referring to purchasing drugs for use in a sexual context.
The court documents include transcripts of the deposition of Cosby on 27 and 28 September 2005. In the course of the depositions, the comic was asked several questions about his purchasing of drugs, leading to tense exchanges between his lawyer Patrick OConnor and a lawyer for Constand, Dolores Troiani.
During the deposition, Cosby said that he had obtained seven prescriptions for the sedative quaalude.
You gave them to other people? he was asked.
Yes, he replied.
When Troiani tried to elicit from Cosby whether he had given the drug to other people knowing that to be illegal, OConnor intervened, instructing his client not to answer.
When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women you wanted to have sex with? asked Troiani.
Yes, replied Cosby.
Asked whether he had given young women the drug without their knowledge, the lawyer again intervened, advising him not to answer.
Cosby told the deposition that he got the quaaludes prescriptions in the 1970s and then kept them for several years.
The documents also include details of questions Cosby was asked under deposition about another woman, one of the so-called Jane Does who were called anonymously to give evidence in the Constand case. The woman told lawyers that at the age of 19 she met with Cosby and had sex with him after he gave her quaaludes.
In his deposition, Cosby said he met the witness in Las Vegas: She meets me backstage. I give her quaaludes. We then have sex. Cosby then goes on to say: I cant judge at this time what she knows about herself for 19 years, a passive personality.
Cosby adds that the witness was sweet in her personality. As far as I was concerned was well-mannered, didnt demand or give a feeling that she was above anyone. If anything, I think she may very well have been very happy to be around the showbusiness surroundings.
Starstruck? he was asked.
Youll have to ask her, Cosby replied.
The public opening of the documents comes at the end of a tough legal struggle for the Associated Press. On 17 June, lawyers representing the news agency delivered a motion to the federal courthouse for the eastern district of Pennsylvania requesting that they be included as an interested party for the unsealing of the court documents, including Cosbys testimony.
Cosbys lawyers argued that the unsealing of the documents would be terribly embarrassing for their client, the AP reported in June. But, on Monday, their request was granted by judge Eduardo Robreno.
Explaining his decision to release the papers, Robreno is scathing about Cosbys claim that he had a right to privacy. He said that Cosby had donned the mantle of public moralist and mounted the proverbial electronic or print soap box to volunteer his views on, among other things, childrearing, family life, education, and crime. To the extent that Defendant has freely entered the public square and thrust himself into the vortex of th[ese] public issues he has voluntarily narrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim.
Robreno said the public had a significant interest in the stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct.
The judge concludes: The nature of the allegations  sex, drugs, seduction, etc  do not cloak this case, including the depositions of one of the parties, with an automatic, or per se, seal of silence.
Since the allegations of sexual misconduct resurfaced last year, the comic has faced renewed legal actions against him. But so far all of them have floundered on the rock of time  the statute of limitations that restricts the period after an alleged crime in which prosecutions can be brought.

A Thai military court on Tuesday released 14 students held for almost two weeks for holding anti-coup protests in defiance of a ban on public gatherings, but the charges against them have not been dropped.
There had been growing calls for their release, including from the United Nations and the European Union, and public shows of support for the 14 have taken place across Thailand and among the Thai diaspora over the past few days.
Thailands military overthrew the previous democratic government last year after months of political unrest. The junta has since stifled dissent, barring political gatherings and debate.

Police asked to extend the students detention but today the court threw out that request, said Kisadang Nutjarat, a lawyer for the students.
They have released the kids from prison today. There are no conditions and there was no bail, he said, adding that charges against the students had not been dropped.
The students, part of a coalition of university groups from around Thailand, held street demonstrations across Bangkok against the ruling junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order.
They were arrested last month and charged with sedition.
Scores gathered outside a military court in Bangkok, shouting slogans and holding signs, to show their support for the students as 150 police officers stood guard nearby.

        <title>Australia's neighbours battle food security, deforestation: UN report</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/un-report-prompts-calls-for-australia-to-increase-foreign-aid-in-our-region</Link>

Some of Australias closest neighbours are struggling to address malnourishment, deforestation and sanitation, the United Nations final report on its millennium development goals shows, prompting aid organisations to call on the federal government to boost foreign aid.
The report released on Tuesday revealed progress towards food security in Oceania  which includes Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Nauru  had been slow, largely because of a heavy dependence on food imports by the small islands of the region.
Food security in this region is also hampered by natural and human-caused disasters, which often result in volatile prices and sudden and unpredictable changes in the availability of important staple foods, the report found.
Oceania also reported a net loss of forest in the first decade of the 15-year agenda, largely due to severe drought and forest fires in Australia, the report found.
Asia, on the other hand, registered a net gain of around 2.2m hectares annually between 2000 and 2010 following a net loss in the 1990s, it said.
This gain, mostly due to large-scale afforestation programs in China, offsets continued high rates of net loss in many countries in southern and south-eastern Asia.
The rate of new HIV infections has stagnated in south-east Asia and Oceania, the report showed, though stopped short of declining, while sanitation also remained a problem in areas of the Asia-Pacific region.
Australian Medical Association [AMA] vice president, Dr Stephen Parnis, said the Asia-Pacific region and in particular, Papua New Guinea, had among the lowest rates of access to safe sanitation in the world. A considerable number of Indigenous communities in Australia also lacked proper access to clean water and functioning sewerage services, he said.
Parnis reiterated previous calls for Australian and other world leaders to ensure that sanitation and easy access to safe water formed a key component when the next round of goals, called the sustainable development goals , were negotiated in September.
The Australian Council for International Development head of policy, Beth Sargent, said the report showed the millennium development goals had been a galvanising force for world leaders to come together to address poverty, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, disease, the environment and global partnership.
And while it showed the goals had led to progress in many of these areas, with the likelihood of a child dying before age five halved and a narrowing of disparities between boys and girls in education, there was much room for improvement in Australias region, Sargent said.
Australia needs to take away from this the need to boost our aid program and strongly focus on our region across a number of areas, she said.
We must look at issues of sustainable development, take strong action against climate change and play a fair role in refugee policy.
The UNICEF Australia head of advocacy, Aivee Robinson, said of the bad news from the report, too much of it was close to home and affected children.
In Indonesia, there were still more than 1.3m primary-school aged children not in school, she said. At current rates of progress and given projected population growth, it was estimated 68m more children under five would die from mostly preventable causes by 2030, while an estimated 119m children would be chronically malnourished.
So for all the progress we have made, we have still failed millions of children, she said.
The millennium development goals were amazing because they brought countries of the world together but, at the same time, required countries to focus on improving national averages.
In the rush to meet these national goals, many countries focused on easy-to-reach children rather than those in greatest need.
On the plus side, there had been a staggering improvement to the number of women in Indonesia with access to a skilled birth attendant, she said.
The report highlighted the responsibility Australia had to its neighbours. Were a member of the global community and we have a moral responsibilty to contribute adequate levels of overseas assistance, she said.
The repeated cuts weve seen to the overseas development aid budget, with 1bn cut this financial year , are not only deeply disappointing, but they will have real impact on childrens lives.
Guardian Australia has requested comment from the office of the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop.

International pressure is mounting on Greece and its European creditors to reach agreement and steer the eurozone away from a potentially disastrous Grexit.
The US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, told Greeces prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , and its new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, that Washington looked forward to a swift resolution to the crisis unfolding in Europe.
Tsipras told the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that Greece would bring a new proposal to the table at an emergency eurozone summit on Tuesday, days after Greeks voted overwhelmingly to reject the conditions of a previous bailout plan proposed by the countrys creditors.
Lew said he hoped a resolution would allow Greece to make difficult but necessary fiscal and structural reforms, return to growth, and achieve debt sustainability within the eurozone, a US treasury statement said.
Japans economics minister, Akira Amari, called on Greece and the EU to do everything possible to contain the fallout from the crisis, which on Monday sent share prices tumbling around Asia and saw losses for the euro.
Amari said all parties should strive towards a win-win deal that would keep Greece in the single currency, despite Greek voters rejection of austerity.
Greece has already done a lot to restore fiscal discipline, such as cutting pensions and wages, he told reporters. I understand why the Greek people are venting their frustration. Fiscal consolidation is not making progress. They are in deflation. The world expects Greece and the EU to cooperate on a final bail out plan.
Asian markets stabilised on Tuesday after suffering significant losses across the board the previous day, but investors remain cautious as long as doubts hang over the future of Greeces membership of the eurozone.
Their concerns centre on the volatility in financial markets and harm to economic growth that could follow a messy Greek exit from the eurozone.
Greece is in a difficult condition. Although there is volatility in the short term and discussion will be rough, I still expect a solution to be found to avoid a very nasty situation in the end, said Alain Bokobza, the Paris-based head of global asset allocation at Societe Generale, who is on a visit to Tokyo.
On Tuesday Japans Nikkei share index had risen 1.4% by mid-morning, having fallen by 1.2% the previous day. MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which fell to six-month low on Monday, was up 0.3%.
The euro rebounded from Mondays one-week low to fetch $1.1044.
Greece aside, Asian stocks are also being hit by rising concerns over huge losses on Chinese mainland stock markets in recent weeks.
Emergency liquidity measures introduced by Beijing over the weekend failed to halt volatile market movements, as Chinese shares fell again on Tuesday, casting doubt on the governments ability to stabilize markets in the worlds second-biggest economy.
We need to continue monitoring China shares carefully because to Japan, China could be a real risk if its market falls further, said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
Fujito warned that prolonged turmoil in Chinese stocks could lead to a slowdown in domestic consumption, which would adversely impact Japanese shares that are most exposed to movements in the Chinese economy.

The worlds oldest man, Sakari Momoi, who cited healthy eating and a good nights sleep as the secrets to a very long life, has died aged 112, Japanese media said.
Momoi, whose was born in Fukushima on 5 February 1903, was not alone in Japan in enjoying remarkable longevity : his successor is a compatriot, Yasutaro Koide, who was born just over a month later.
Momoi was born the year the teddy bear was introduced and the Wright brothers made their first powered flight. He was 42 when the second world war ended.
Local media said Momoi died at a care home in Tokyo where he had lived for many years.
We heard from his family ... that his health worsened one or two weeks ago, a local official said.
Momoi fell short of his longevity goal, revealed when he was awarded a plaque by Guinness World Records to mark his status as the worlds oldest man in August 2014.
Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and silver tie, he told reporters: I want to live for about two more years.
The former high school principal remained active well into his twilight years, practising calligraphy and joining in recreational activities at the hospital where he lived.
The title of the worlds oldest man now belongs to Koide, a resident of the central Japanese city of Nagoya, who was born in March 1903, according to the health ministry.
The worlds oldest person, New York resident Susannah Mushatt Jones, celebrated her 116th birthday on Monday. Born on 6 July 1899, the former housekeeper is known simply as T to her 100 nieces and nephews.
A recent holder of that title was another Japanese, Misao Okawa , who died in April this year, weeks after celebrating her 117th birthday.
Like Momoi, Okawa put her long life down to plenty of sleep and a varied diet .
She ate mackerel sushi at least once a month, but also enjoyed occasional bowls of ramen noodles, which many would consider less healthy.
Japan is home to more than 58,000 people aged 100 or over, 87% of whom are women, according to official statistics.
The countrys elderly population is expected to soar in the coming decades. A quarter of its 126 million people are 65 or over, according to the most recent census , and the proportion is expected to grow to about 40% by the middle of the century.

        <title>Nueva Londres: where Paraguay, Australia and Great Britain converge</title>

The sign outside town bears the Union flag and the Southern Cross. The streets are named after the Smiths and Kennedy families, and the blue-eyed locals could easily pass for stockmen on an Australian cattle station.
But the grizzled ranch hands wear straw sombreros, not akubra bush hats; instead of English, they speak Spanish and the South American indigenous language Guarani.
This is Nueva Londres, 9,000 miles away from Australia, in the heart of Paraguay .

Latin America has a long history of seemingly outlandish experiments in migration: Welsh miners in Patagonia , Scottish merchants in Panama , Spanish visionaries in Santa Fe. Paraguay has had its fair share of settlers from far away: Japanese, Mennonites, Ukrainians and Aryan supremacists all helped repopulate the country after its catastrophic wars (one conflict, against Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, cost Paraguay 70% of its male population).
But the case of Nueva Londres (New London) is one of the strangest tales of them all.
It was founded as Nueva Australia in 1893 by a handful of families, escaping an economic depression and a crackdown on sheep shearers unions to carve out a teetotal, whites-only communist utopia in the jungle.
They played Paraguays first cricket match, winning by one run after their English opponents enjoyed a boozy lunch, and the settlements women tied fireflies in their hair at the village dances. But the Queensland bushmen soon discovered a weakness for sugarcane rum and the cigar-smoking Guarani women, and within nine months, the colony had split in two.
New arrivals  like the Smiths of London  injected an invigorating dose of capitalism. My great-grandfather, Henry Alfred Smith, came here with his sons, explains Henry Smith. They were businessmen: they brought merchandise from Villarrica and sold it here. That was their shop across the street, he says, indicating one of the ornate plaster buildings that dot the town.
The Smiths began a cattle empire, gave their name to one of the two main streets, and now seem to employ half its residents. The other street is named after the Kennedy family, who apparently employ the other half of the townspeople.
I only remember a few words of English that my grandmother taught me: Howareyou, nicetomeetyou, says Iris Kennedy, 75, who runs the stationery shop. But that generation are all gone. There are lots of things I want to know, but theres no one left to ask.
Her grandfather was James Kennedy, an Ayrshire farmer who ran away with his maid, Sarah, and named his ranch after her. Big cats stole their chickens, and they were prey to insects like the pique, which burrows into the soles of the foot to lay its eggs. I sometimes wonder how my grandfather put up with this climate, Iris adds, as a passing cow peers into the shop.
Those who endured started families with Paraguayan-born neighbours. A few fought in the first world war; others died for Paraguay in the 1932-5 Chaco war: a cenotaph among the plazas orange trees lists Santiago Drakeford, Douglas Kennedy, and Enrique Jones amid the Aguilars and Escobars.
When was the other war? 1945? Well, they didnt even ask for us. They didnt want a bunch of lost kangaroos, says Iris. When Juan Kennedy, her uncle, wrote to Australia to rename the town Nueva Canberra, the letter was never answered  so they went for London instead.
Malcolm McCreen is descended from one of the few Australians who werent swallowed up by the British interlopers. My land isnt huge: Ive got 40 cows, pigs, sheep. I have horses, but its quicker to get around by motorbike, he says, before asking: Whats the work like in Australia?

Still living in the wooden house built by her ancestors, sheep shearers from Muttaburra in Central West Queensland, Blanca Murray holds on to some antipodean customs. They sat down to the table to eat on the dot. There was a fixed time to eat, to wash, to sleep. And giving their word meant a lot to them, she says.
Murray, 55, produces a shoebox of dog-eared black-and-white photos: forgotten Victorians in regimental uniform, posing beside a steam train, nameless family friends in carts bringing their meagre belongings to Nueva Australia. Memories of the towns beginnings are beginning to fade, but a new generation are showing an interest in their history.
Sonia Uldera, Henrys wife, has been piecing the story together for 20 years from birth certificates, government documents and letters. Ive found a lot of surprises. Its not like how people tell you, says Sonia, a primary school teacher. Everyone says their relatives were the ones that made the town. But in reality, it was a group. They worked in a team.
The New Australians may have failed to create a paradise, but Paraguay today, despite its problems, regularly ranks as the happiest nation in the world . And as the sun sets over the grasslands, and a sleepy silence settles over the town, it doesnt seem like such a bad place for a bunch of lost kangaroos to end up.

Closing summary: Last chance for Greek deal looms
Were been live-blogging the reaction to Sundays Greek referendum for around 21 hours now. Its time to wrap up and give the Guardian web servers a rest.
So, a final recap.
Greece and the eurozone will make one last, desperate attempt to make progress towards an urgently needed bailout deal on Tuesday.
Leaders, and finance ministers, will both hold crucial meetings in Brussels, after Sundays referendum result raised the risks of Grexit to new heights. Its a final chance for Greece to propose a new reform plan that could start the ball rolling towards a new aid package, but the journey looks perilous.
The leaders of France and Germany are scrambling to reach a consensus tonight in Paris, at a top-level meeting about Greece ( photos here ).
Greeces prime minister has held telephone calls with the heads of the International Monetary Fund and also the European Central Bank . Alexis Tsipras told Mario Draghi that the capital controls in Greece need to be lifted, but was told by Christine Lagarde that the IMF cannot released more funds now Athens is in arrears.
Earlier, Francois Hollande insisted that there was time to reach a deal. Angela Merkel sounded less optimistic, though, warning that there was currently no basis for an agreement. Press conference highlights start here .

Spains PM warned that time was now very short , while Dutch leader Mark Rutte said Greece must accept deep reforms to keep its place in the eurozone.
Analysts arent convinced that progress will be made tomorrow....
 Alex White (@AlexWhite1812) July 6, 2015
Vital for ECB not to have fingerprints on Grexit. Summit will be chance for leaders to say 'no deal'. ECB then has cover to do what it must
The European Central Bank has tightened the rules for giving emergency funding to Greek banks tonight . It is now imposing tougher haircuts on the assets they hand over, restricting their ability to access the funding.
The ECB also reportedly rejected a request for 3bn in extra ELA support:

#ECB said to have rejected Greek additional #ELA request for 3bn. (BBG) pic.twitter.com/7wi0b2qnJ6
This means Greek banks will remain shut for at least two more days, after capital controls were extended until the end of Wednesday.
Theres talk of a new mood of national unity , but it could be swiftly shattered.
Tsipras has also passed the honour/poisoned chalice of being Greeces finance minister to Euclid Tsakalotos, following Yanis Varoufakiss resignation this morning.
Tsakalotos was sworn in tonight , and will represent Greece at Tuesdays eurogroup meeting. Hes unlikely to don a tie for the occasion, though. Heres our profile of Euclid .
Varoufakis has denied tonight that he was a sacrifical lamb, having exited the finance ministry in classic style today:

In the UK, George Osborne has warned that the risks to the UK are rising . Britain is already providing more consular support in Greece for expats and holidaymakers, and help for businesses struggling to trade with Greek firms.

Ill pop back into the blog if there are any major developments -- otherwise, please tune in tomorrow morning for more. Thanks, and goodnight. GW

Garrick Club votes to continue with ban on female members
Bid to let women join fails at the AGM of the London gentlemens club  as one member says keeping it men only allows for camaraderie and banter

The Garrick Club, one of Londons last remaining gentlemens clubs, has voted to continue its policy of not admitting women as members. At the clubs annual general meeting at the Palace theatre on Tottenham Court Road, 50.5% voted in favour of allowing females to join. The club requires a two-thirds majority before rules can be changed.

The decision to continue to exclude women is significant because the Garrick Club has a place at the heart of the British establishment, with supreme court judges, cabinet ministers, academics, senior civil servants, diplomats and journalists among its members, as well as well-known actors.
The motion, put forward by former Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews, proposed: For the avoidance of doubt it shall be a rule of the club that membership shall not be subject to any quota system based on ethnicity, gender, beliefs or otherwise.
Members such as the actors Stephen Fry, Damian Lewis and Hugh Bonneville had indicated before the poll that they were in favour of extending membership to women, as had the justice secretary, Michael Gove, former justice secretary Ken Clarke and broadcasters Sir Trevor McDonald, Melvyn Bragg and Jeremy Paxman.
But those in favour of admitting women failed to get the required 66% of votes. Three former Conservative MPs and 11 QCs were among those who said they would vote to continue to exclude women members.
Lewis said he had voted in favour of letting women in and was disappointed at the result. Broadcaster John Simpson shrugged and said: What can you do? Nobody in the Garrick feels this is the end of the road.
But there was some optimism from pro-female members that for the first
time there had been a majority in favour. Several members said they expected the issue to be raised again in the near future.
More than 500 of the clubs members queued in the full summer heat outside the Palace theatre to vote in a secret ballot, via electronic handsets. Some men came looking dapper in a 1950s way, in rumpled cream suits with panama hats and umbrellas or walking sticks. Many came wearing the clubs salmon pink and cucumber tie or bow tie, accessorising the look with socks and handkerchiefs in the clubs colours.
The average age of those in the club is 69, according to one member. Arriving at the theatre to vote, Paxman looked at the queue and said: Bunch of old men. Im in the right place then.

Sir Eric Ash said he was voting for women, adding: It seems absolutely absurd that they arent in already.
Sir John Weston also said he was supporting the call for women to be allowed to join. About time, too. I think women will do a lot for the good sense of the club, he said.
Another member said he had been undecided about how to vote. He asked: Im a huge supporter of all things anti-racist, non-gender and anti-ageist but why shouldnt we have one or two places where chaps can get together?
The Garrick is one of a handful of gentlemens clubs in London that still refuses to allow women members, along with Whites  where David Cameron was a member until he became leader of the Conservative party  Pratts, Boodles, Brookss, the Turf Club and the Travellers Club. At various points over the past 30 years, establishments such as the Reform Club, the Athenaeum and the Carlton Club have voted to admit women.
When the 2010 Equality Act was drafted, there was some discussion by Labour MPs of whether the legislation could be used to make these clubs illegal, but this proved impossible without simultaneously making it illegal to have, for example, women-only swimming clubs. The act banned clubs from excluding people on the basis of colour but allowed them to continue excluding women.

With a large number of members well past retirement age, many Garrick members protest that the club is no longer a bastion of male influence where crucial networking takes place, preferring to cast it as a gentle backwater, where people go to relax and retreat from their professional lives. Only a few concede that it is still an important place for making informal but useful work-related connections.
But there has been growing antipathy among women in the legal profession towards a club that welcomes so many male QCs and judges, yet excludes women. Baroness Hale, Britains most senior female judge, the first and only woman among 12 supreme court judges (several of whom are Garrick club members), has expressed outrage at the clubs continued exclusion of women. I regard it as quite shocking that so many of my colleagues belong to the Garrick, but they dont see what all the fuss is about, she told a law diversity forum. She said judges should be committed to the principle of equality for all.
Trying to explain why the club was better without women, one member said: Men behave differently if there are no women there. There is camaraderie, banter  the knowledge that you can say anything you want and have a jolly good discussion about anything in a completely egalitarian atmosphere in which no one is trying to impress anyone else.
Related: Time, gentlemen: when will the last all-male clubs admit women? | Amelia Gentleman
Thats my main objection to having women members  its not against women, but the idea that some men would not be able to resist showing off to impress the women, that is an innate male characteristic, whether you are a bird or an animal. At the moment, any sort of pomposity or self-importance is punctured. You dont need to show off, you can be yourself, have uninhibited conversation, indulge in flights of fantasy. Having women members would change the nature of the club.
Women are allowed to enter the Garrick as guests of members, but there are places within the building where they (as non-members) are not permitted to go.
Club officials said there would be no comment on the vote. Members left the theatre to walk to the club building in nearby Covent Garden for an all-club dinner.

It started with the ATMs. At 11pm on Saturday, several simply stopped dispensing cash. Perplexed at first, Mahi Papaconstantinou moved from one to the next, her blood pressure rising a little as she discovered that each one was blocked.
Panicked, the retired civil servant then got in her car and headed across Athens towards home. This time she was lucky. I thought, thank God, 50, she said, shaking her head in disbelief.
Related: Greek referendum: optimism fades as eurozone says gulf has widened
The Greek economy is dying, dying before the eyes of its people. A credit squeeze that began with the imposition of capital controls has, eight days on, assumed the terrifying spectre of cash reserves drying up. In less than a week, banknotes of 5, 10 and 20 have become almost extinct; so, too, have 1 coins. There are a lot of us out there now walking the streets in tears, said Papaconstantinou. We just cant believe that at this stage of our lives this is what we have come to.
The restrictions, enforced to prevent a collapse of the banking system, were meant to end along with the closure of Greek banks on Tuesday. But at 7pm on Monday, barely 24 hours after the nation rebuffed the idea of further austerity in a referendum that has sent shockwaves through Europe , the Greek Bank Association announced that neither would happen. The cap on ATM withdrawals  a 60 limit reduced to 50 because of smaller denominations running out  would also remain.

Our economy is slowly dying, it is in intensive care, the economist Dimitris Athanasopoulos told SKAI TV amid fears that Greece was now heading for a fully fledged banking crisis. On every level it is sub-functioning.
From the flower markets of Thessaloniki to the beach bars of Crete, the effects, are being felt. Weve seen a huge drop [in trade] and because money is so scarce, credit cards are almost always being used, said Dimitris Vgengopoulos, cap on head, smile to the ready as he served customers in Meliartos, a pie shop within view of the Acropolis. The bill might be 1 in total but they still use their cards.
The dramatic drop in consumption has brought production to a halt. An inability to source supplies because of the ban on bank transfers has had a devastating effect on imports. Factories have shut, shops have closed and companies are increasingly electing to put staff on enforced leave.
Issuing a dramatic cri de coeur, the head of the National Confederation of Hellenic Commerce implored the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to save Greece. As the umbrella organisation representing some 280,000 small- and medium-sized businesses, the confederation has been especially hard hit by the controls.
The damage that has occurred with the closure of banks is incalculable, wrote Vasilis Korkidis in a letter released on Monday.
He appealed for the leftist-led government to agree to a solution that would stave off insolvency in the form of a financial lifeline from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
The economy is sinking, as one Greek to another, I am sending you a heartfelt message of anguish, he wrote. Ignore the voices in your party  respect the sacrifices of the Greek people  and at all costs save the country from bankruptcy.
Time is now of the essence. If banks collapse, the economy goes with them. On Friday, three days before his resignation, the countrys flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, acknowledged that paper money would start to be a problem as of this week. Many worry that with credit card overload, the system could crash.
A preliminary agreement really needs to be signed in the next two to three days, said Nikos Vettas, general director of the Foundation of Economic and Industrial Research. If it is not signed, the cash will run out because the ECB [European Central Bank] wont be able to keep up emergency liquidity assistance. People have been very calm, very civilised, but if they go to the supermarket and cannot find food to put on the table for their families the likelihood is they will become less so.
Panic buying has already caused shortages in drugs and foodstuffs nationwide, prompting Greeks to rush to buy up staple products.
Ive stocked up on coffee and pulses and rice, batteries and soap, said Papaconstantinou. After the no vote everyone I know is fearful of the worst; euro exit now looks so possible.
Pharmacies in central Athens on Monday reported shortages in drugs, including cancer medication.
Growing numbers now speak of survival instincts creating a siege mentality.
The tourist industry  Greeces biggest foreign exchange earner, bringing in more than 30bn a year  has experienced cancellations and a large drop in last-minute bookings. In a country suffering from record levels of unemployment, the sector is vital for jobs, employing one in five over the summer months.
This time last year we had around 120,000 last-minute bookings a day. Now, with all this, we are down to around 70,000, said Xenophon Petropoulos at the Greek Tourism Confederation. As soon as there is an agreement it will turn around but right now theres concern.
Hoteliers are not taking any chances, with many of them stockpiling too.
It is like being in a war without weapons, sighed Alex Aggelopoulos, who runs the Aldemar resort, a chain of hotels in Crete, Rhodes and the Peloponnese. Weve stocked up on meat in particular as 70% of it comes from abroad, and food and beverages, he said. Were keeping our suppliers happy with cash. Were not taking any chances.

Tokyo readies for the rise of the 'guerrilla rainstorm'
Japans capital may be known for its earthquake resilience strategies, but a recent increase in intense, sudden storms poses another threat  one that the citys flood protection systems may not be able to manage

When people speak of natural disasters in Tokyo , they usually mean the major earthquake that seismologists say will eventually strike the Japanese capital. But for the local government, weather-related disasters are as much if not more of an immediate worry. The citys coastal location puts it in the path of the Asia-Pacific regions most violent typhoons  and there has been a measurable increase in the strength of rainstorms in recent years.
Tokyos rainfall in 2014 was about 20% above normal, but the kind of storms that have struck the capital lately are different than they were in the past. Many are caused by huge cumulus clouds that form quickly and in succession when moist air from the ocean comes up against the warm air trapped among tall, closely packed buildings. Locally, these sudden, intense downpours are called guerrilla storms, because they seem to attack out of nowhere.
Two years ago, four workers who were reinforcing storm sewers drowned when such a storm hit unexpectedly. The main problem in these situations is that Tokyo is covered with concrete and has many levels of underground infrastructure: there is no ground soil to absorb water. The city has two sewer systems, one for runoff and one for sewage, and when rainfall exceeds 50mm/hour the water is diverted automatically into the sewage channels, which fill up and have to be diverted into the sea, meaning raw sewage ends up in the environment without being treated. Last year, during one storm, Taito Ward in eastern Tokyo received 150mm in one hour.

Tokyo is covered with concrete  there is no ground soil to absorb water
About 30% of the prefectures population lives below sea level, mostly along Tokyo Bay or the many rivers that feed into it. The levees that were built roughly 300 years ago to protect the downstream areas havent always been sufficient. In 1948, Typhoon Kathleen submerged most of the northwestern portion of the city under three metres of water when the Tone River breached its banks. More than 1,000 people died and 31,000 homes were destroyed. The storm was considered a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, and the low-lying areas have become even more populated in the intervening years, with landfill extending far into the bay. Levees have been reinforced, but the metropolitan government knows it is not enough.
One of the biggest recent flood prevention projects is an underground discharge channel that was completed six years ago about 25 miles north of the city in Kasukabe. The structure feeds overflow from five rivers into a man-made underground reservoir through a huge shaft and a tunnel more than 4 miles in length. Four pumps can handle as much as 200 cubic metres of water a second. The mechanism goes a long way toward diverting excess water that flows down from the upper reaches of the Kanto Plain, but may have less effect in the event of heavy rains that fall directly on the city.

Ward governments have asked private property owners to build special runoff systems under their land so that when there is excess rain it can be absorbed into the soil, alleviating the citys burden for runoff. Some even offer to subsidise such construction, but without regulations that compel landowners to do so, few have undertaken the work.
Experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms
Another flood-prevention project is the super levees that the central government is attempting to build along 540 miles of six rivers. The work involves increasing the elevation of existing levees. But if they are made higher, the base has to be widened in order for them to maintain their structural integrity, and since tightly packed residential neighbourhoods are already situated along the levees, houses have to be condemned and residents forced to move when the work is carried out. Japan has a very weak concept of eminent domain, and between the late 1980s when the project began and 2012 when it was suspended temporarily due to budget concerns, only 5.4% of the planned work had been done. At that rate it will take 400 years to complete, and many people in and out of the government believe the project is merely a public works boondoggle that has more to do with enriching construction companies than with saving lives.
In any case, experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms. This spring, Japans public broadcaster, NHK, aired a series of special programmes on mega-disasters, one of which addressed guerrilla rainstorms and super typhoons. Worst case scenarios were simulated using computer graphics, showing how subways and underground spaces would be completely inundated and streets submerged under at least three metres of water. Though such a situation would be rare, it is also seen as inevitable. Consequently, more research has gone into predicting heavy rainfall, especially when its focused on a small area.

As NHK pointed out, the best way to save lives is to make sure residents know when a storm is coming and what they can expect in their area. Local governments distribute hazard maps that tell residents whether or not their localities are subject to inundation, whether by overwhelmed sewers or by overflowing tributaries. Combined with a storm prediction system, residents can evacuate when a warning is given. This summer, a system devised by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism that predicts rain storms of more than 30mm/hour is being tested that can give ten minute warnings to affected areas.
Ten minutes isnt much time, but if people decide to evacuate, where do they go, especially if they live in a neighbourhood thats below sea level? Local governments designate evacuation points in multi-story public buildings, such as schools, but depending on where a resident lives it could be a long walk  and authorities warn against moving around outside during a flood. Some communities are making their own arrangements. Yoshii Ishii, the 83-year-old head of the neighbourhood association of Minami Senju, a cramped warren of wooden houses located near the Sumida River, told us three years ago that he had come to an understanding with several high-rise condominiums that had been built in the area since 2000. We had a meeting, he said. They said we can use their building in the event of an emergency.
The proliferation of tower condos in recent years has been controversial for their performance in earthquakes, but tall buildings also exacerbate the heat island phenomenon that contributes to guerrilla storms. For the residents of Minami Senju, however, skyscrapers make up for the flooding they could be indirectly causing by providing higher, drier ground.

On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina , one of the US deadliest hurricanes, reached New Orleans. What followed crippled the city, causing loss of life and destroying peoples homes. The levee system designed to protect the city from storm surges failed disastrously and the large majority of Greater New Orleans was severely flooded. Less than a month later, Hurricane Rita added insult to injury.
Recovery and rebuilding efforts drew mass attention, not least for their celebrity spearheading . As well as repairing the damage and restoring the city, projects have tried to ensure greater resilience for the future . One currently in progress is a hurricane-proof hospital , designed upside-down so the emergency room is above the flood line.
It is now approaching 10 years since Hurricane Katrina. No one wants another major natural disaster to hit, but if it did, what would be its impact? Is New Orleans now stronger and better protected? Is each neighbourhood as prepared as the next?
If you live in New Orleans, share your thoughts, stories, images and videos on whether the city feels stronger since Katrina. What has been done to increase disaster preparedness? Do you feel more protected than before Katrina? What else would you like to see happen to make New Orleans more resilient?

        <title>Radioactive city: how Johannesburg’s townships are paying for its mining past</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/06/radioactive-city-how-johannesburgs-townships-are-paying-for-its-mining-past</Link>

Johannesburgs mine dumps look strangely beautiful from a distance. Lustrously yellow in the sun, blazing red at dusk, their huge molehill shapes provide the city with its distinctive skyline.
Up close, its a different story. Rasalind Plaatjies has lived in the shadow of a tailing  as these piles of mine waste are known  all her adult life. Today, the 62-year-old grandmother from the citys Riverlea district suffers severe respiratory problems. For 16 hours a day, she is hooked up to an oxygen tank, her lungs debilitated by dust from the waste heap.
Sometimes I dont have the energy to get up. I just have to stay in bed and do nothing, she says. She feels fortunate, though. A number of her elderly neighbours have died from respiratory disease.
Plaatjies is one of tens of thousands in Johannesburgs impoverished townships who are paying a high cost for the citys rich mining past. More than 600 abandoned mines surround South Africas largest city, with much of their waste now piled up high next to residential communities  most of which are poor and black.

Residents here fear the wind most. When it blows, fine particles from these man-made dumps are carried up into the air and deposited on to residents homes. It is no ordinary dust, either: the residue of decades of mining, it can contain traces of everything from copper and lead to cyanide and arsenic .
During August and September, the dust is terrible. You stop cleaning the floor after a while. Its just useless, says Plaatjies.
In the local clinic, respiratory cases such as tuberculosis and asthma are ubiquitous across all age groups, says Musa Mbatha, chairman of the clinics civic committee. Rashes and skins diseases are commonplace, too.
People cant afford to buy food every day, so they leave the food and it gets contaminated, Mbatha adds. The government said that it would do a survey of the health impacts of the mining dust, but until today it hasnt happened.
Johannesburg is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world
Dr Antony Turton
An even more dangerous pollutant is lurking in Johannesburgs mine dumps, however: radioactive waste. According to one university study, an estimated 600,000 metric tonnes of radioactive uranium are buried in waste rock in and around Johannesburg  around three times what was exported during the Cold War .
[Johannesburg] is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world, says Dr Antony Turton, a professor at the University of Free States Centre for Environmental Management.
Uranium naturally occurs in reefs alongside gold, meaning the two are often excavated at the same time. For every tonne of gold mined in the Witwatersrand gold fields  the southern sections of which border western Johannesburg  between 10 and 100 tonnes of uranium were also mined .

For most of the gold mines, uranium was merely a waste product and therefore dumped without being recovered. Those tailing disposal facilities therefore have a relatively high uranium concentration today, Turton says.
Without the proper precautions in place, ore-bearing uranium leaches from the tailings and enters as run-off into surrounding streams and wetlands. A similar process occurs in abandoned mines underground, with polluted water seeping through porous rock as the mines flood.
Despite its vast reserves of groundwater, Johannesburg pumps most of its drinking water from Lesotho  more than 380km away  because its own water reserves are too polluted.

Mine waste is also removed illegally from tailings for use in the manufacture of bricks and for other construction purposes, some environment groups allege. Potentially, the physical infrastructure of Johannesburg could be becoming radioactive as well.
The release of uranium in dust form can be exacerbated by the re-mining of tailings  a process that happens in various locations across the city. The companies involved in this re-mining maintain that they are providing an environmental service by removing waste and depositing it in modern tailings that are better regulated.
David van Wyk, chief researcher at the Bench Marks Foundation , a church-funded non-profit based in Johannesburg, is sceptical about mining companies environmental practices. When the uranium price is very low, the mining companies simply dump it. Thats why the dust is yellow. We call it yellow cake, he says.
Bench Marks, which receives support from UK charity Christian Aid , is mid-way through a three-year impact assessment of pollution levels in an around Johannesburgs Soweto district. By systematically tracking air and water contamination, Bench Marks hopes to provide a scientific basis for the alleged health impacts of the tailings.
A handful of randomised spot-checks reveal the extent of the pollution problem. For example, in a narrow run-off canal immediately opposite Soccer City, site of the 2010 Fifa World Cup final, van Wyk picks out the colours along the bank: red for iron, white for sulphur, green for copper, yellow for uranium, and so on.
The pH level measures 4.6: within the range for acid rain (neutral water has a pH level of 7). The figure for Total Dissolved Solids (a measure of minerals, metals and other insoluble materials), meanwhile, is 2,000 parts per million  four times higher than the guideline amount in the US .

When it floods, this just goes straight into the river. Youd expect the government to check that the mine water isnt spilling into local watercourses, but they are not, van Wyk says. This is happening in the centre of South Africas largest city, close to the Department of Environmental Affairs s main office. If they cant regulate so close to their headquarters, just imagine how bad it is elsewhere?
A few miles away, the township of Diepkloof in Soweto catches the run-off from several large tailings. A few hundred feet from residents front doors, a run-off canal has burst its banks. A hardened white wasteland now stands where reeds and plants used to grow. A lifeless stream runs next to it. The soils surface, meanwhile, is scuffed with the imprint of cattle hoofs and childrens feet. The soil has a pH of 2.67  more acidic than vinegar.
Just downstream, an evangelical church carries out full-immersion baptisms in the water, points out Charles van der Merme, a representative of the non-profit Mining and Environmental Justice Community Network of South Africa . They think they are cleansing themselves, he says. Who knows? Perhaps it kills all the devils in you.

Bench Marks does not currently have a Geiger counter, but even the Chamber of Mines of South Africa admits that radioactive contamination is a major problem.
Five years ago, the government identified 36 priority areas affected by radioactive acid mine drainage for remediation . Today, not a single one of these sites has a feasible implementation strategy in place. According to the Cancer Association of South Africa , the health of up to 400,000 people could be affected.
Its totally inappropriate that communities live on waste that is widely accepted to be toxic and radioactive, says Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment .

According to the Chamber of Mines, all current re-mining meets regulations that prohibit radioactive contamination run-off. The problem lies instead with the owners of historic dumps that cannot be traced or are not in a position to take responsibility for the required remedial measures, the industry body states.
For its part, DRD Gold, which is currently involved in secondary gold mining of the Diepkloof tailing, says it is constantly searching for new methods of dust suppression. Among the measures it is currently using are netting and vegetation growth . Neither were visible on the Diepkloof dump, however.
According to the company, DRD Gold spends up to R48m (2.5m) a year managing the environmental impacts of its operations, which stretch over 70km around the city. Any [pollution] readings that exceed the legal limits are automatically flagged and managed in terms of an automated action list, a company spokesperson stated.
For those living in the shadow of the dumps, a sense of hopelessness pervades. Sixty-two-year-old Stella Adams, a long-term resident of Diepkloof, has written to numerous government departments to complain about the high levels of dust in her home. All I am asking for is some vegetation [on the tailing]. I am just asking for the most basic thing, she says. But nobody has ever given me a hearing  so I have lost hope.

Adamss grandson developed asthma shortly after moving into her home six years ago. Her sister recently died from lung cancer, despite never having smoked. Adams assumed the cancer was hereditary, so made no mention to doctors of the nearby tailing. Now I wonder if it had to do with the mine after all.
As well as cancer, high radioactive levels are linked to other health risks such as Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers, neurotoxic syndromes and growth deficiencies. Even so, residents in Johannesburgs poor townships have little choice but to stick it out.
In the Soweto district of Meadowlands, for example, hundreds of government-built houses are currently going up in the Fleurhof extension community. Mine dumps tower above the development on all sides. Yet, despite knowing the dangers, 41-year-old Charles van der Merme says he would move there in a flash.
One of the millions of unemployed residents in this city of 4.8 million, he and his family currently live with his parents-in-law in the township of Riverlea. I applied for a government house in 2000 and Im still homeless, van der Merme says. Despite all the ills from the mine dumps, I would like a house of my own. Where else can I go?

        <title>The human cost of the Tbilisi floods: 'The truth is, I'd really lost all hope'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/03/tbilisi-floods-georgia-capital-destroyed-zoo-wild-animals</Link>

While viewers around the world were entranced by TV images of wild animals wandering free in the streets of Tbilisi, residents of the Georgian capital faced up to the human and material cost of the floods that hit on 13 June. The flooding, which left 19 people dead and caused damage put at $50 million (32m), was the biggest natural disaster to befall the city in living memory.
With the painful and slow cleanup operation still ongoing, Tbilisis residents are now asking whether this disaster was a freak, unpredictable occurrence  or whether its location and history of poor urban planning has left this city of 1.1 million people more vulnerable than they had realised.
Georgias environment minister, Gigla Agulashvili, stands on the edge of the Tskneti-Betania road in the hills above Tbilisi . This is the site where, during a night of exceptionally heavy rains, up to a million cubic metres of earth slid down the cliff into the Vere valley, sending a massive torrent of mud and tree trunks storming into the heart of the city.
About 60% of the land mass remains on the hillside, Agulashvili tells me. A lawyer by education, the minister of the environment has become intimately familiar with the geology of the city since the disaster struck. In heavy rains it could start to move again  but were not expecting such huge precipitation in the near future.

Behind where the minister is speaking, the ground has fallen away into a gaping pit of rocks, earth and broken trees that goes on for four kilometres. In the distance, a group of geology students huddles around a ministry official who is elucidating the workings of a new landslide early-warning system being installed in the area.
Within minutes of the Vere river breaking its banks, the flood waters had filled Keti Kurashvilis first-floor apartment up to 25cm from the ceiling. She made a narrow escape by forcing open the front door and clinging to the iron bars on the window. I just kept thinking, how can I die in all this mud? A dead dog floated up to me and touched my legs, but I kicked it with my foot and the current took it away.
Sitting with her granddaughter in her hotel accommodation, Kurashvili pauses half way through her story and starts to cry. In the corner of the room, donations of food and clothing are stuffed into thin plastic bags. To tell you the truth, Id really lost all hope, she says. I thought: OK, thats it  its over.
Generally, were seeing post-traumatic stress, anxiety and extreme neurosis, says psychotherapist Maia Begashvili, wearily drawing on a cigarette in the lobby of the modest hotel that is temporarily housing Kurashvili and other homeless flood victims. Along with her colleagues from the local mental health NGO Dendroni, Begashvili has been providing free visits to displaced families since the floods hit. Given the extent of the trauma, she says, she expects to be working with some of the children for at least a year.

The citys authorities have faced criticism for the lack of an emergency response plan
Begashvili lists the problems facing those who have lost their homes: The change in living space, the change in economic situation, the change in social environment ... this is all stressful, she says. Its hard for them to get over it. If they dont get treatment, they could develop the clinical symptoms of various illnesses.
The citys authorities have faced criticism for not having an emergency response plan in place. Some have pointed out they could have at least closed the Vere valley road upon hearing about the massive landslide outside the city. Others have accused the emergency services of responding slowly to the incident. When I first rang the emergency number, no one was there, Kurashvili tells me, and when I called again later, there was still no answer. Do you call that prepared?
Many of those affected are asking why they were not told about the risks of living close to the Vere river  which, for most of the year, is no more than a shallow stream. Much of the criticism is focused on the construction tunnels built to channel the river around the zoo from 1960s onwards. Further tunnels, built under a new arterial road in the Vere valley in 2012, became clogged with debris during the flooding, directing the surging flood waters towards adjacent residential areas.
When they built tunnels around the area of the zoo, even after the floods in the 1960s, its clear the wrong decisions were made, Agulashvili says. They kept building these tunnels and illegally issuing building permits to private individuals without considering the risks.
The future of Tbilisis zoo itself hangs in the balance. According to the zoos director, about half of the animals died in the flooding, and those that survived or were rescued from the citys streets are being housed in enclosures on higher ground.
The location of the zoo in a river valley next to several major intersections was long questioned by animal rights campaigners, but plans to relocate the zoo were dropped after a change of government in 2012. The billionaire businessman and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, has offered to finance the zoos move to a new location outside of the city, but there have also been calls for it to be scrapped altogether.

Svanidze Street in the citys Vake district was the first populated area to be hit by the flood. Here, the full force of the deluge hit homes built on cheap land next to the river 50 or so years ago. Absolutely nothing is left, says Murman Chanturashvili as he sorts pieces of broken furniture and sodden books into piles, ready to be removed by the soldiers and volunteers that are cleaning this area.
Chanturashvilis first-floor flat is caked with mud up to the ceiling and in places, the soaked parquet floor bulges underfoot. Fortunately, his wife was in Moscow at the time of the flood with their grandchildren. We were up to our necks in mud. Even the things I can wash down are useless now. Basically, everything was destroyed.
Not quite everything. Picking through the kitchen, Chanturashvili finds that his stash of homemade wine  sealed in plastic bottles and large glass jars in the cellar  are untouched. Smiling, he rinses the mud off one of the bottles with a hose outside and offers it as a present. Wine is a big deal in Georgia: a tangible link to their fertile land, their unique culture and their deep roots. Despite having to start almost from scratch, Chanturashvili is adamant that he wants to stay here.
What should I be afraid of? he asks. This house has been here for 40 years and nothing like this has happened before. Whoever thinks this place it at risk, let him think so! Our parents lived here and our children will be fine here too.
Poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen

Experts, however, maintain that there are still significant risks. Geologist Claudio Margottini is a Unesco expert and vice-president of the International Consortium on Landslides. Since the flooding, he has been working with the Georgian Ministry of Environment Protection to assess the immediate risk to the city and develop a long-term plan of action.
Although the amount of rain that fell on the night of June 13 was rare, Margottini says that global climate change is making these extreme weather events more and more frequent. In the long-term, the city needs to develop a land-use plan taking into account maximum precipitation. This needs to be the basis of future town planning, in order to reduce the impact of these phenomena.
While officials are keen not to exaggerate the risks of future flooding, for many residents, poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen.
Tamriko Kadagidze rushed to help when she saw the disaster unfold on Svanidze Street from her nearby apartment. In other parts of the city, theyre pulling down trees and cutting through cliffs to build apartment blocks, she says. If they keep doing this, the same kind of disaster could hit us again.

        <title>Making sense of Miami: what America's refuge city says about the US's future</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/02/miami-florida-cuba-multicultural-metropolis-diversity-hispanic-haiti</Link>
        <Description/>

Just off Miamis busy Calle Ocho, the thoroughfare that is the beating cultural heart of the citys Cuban community, there rises a splendid ceiba tree whose roots erupt from the ground like waves from the sea, and whose vast branches throw shade far to either side.
All around the gnarled roots and tucked into the trees hidden crevices, one finds the offerings of the faithful: candles, bags of food, feathers, bones. In this modern metropolis, whose vaulting skyscrapers a mile away reflect the near-blinding sun, the saturnalia surrounding the ceiba attests to the lifeblood of the Afro-Cuban religion of santera, and Miamis eternal place in the imagination of el exilio, as the Cuban community is often referred to.
Ive lived in Miami off and on since the mid-1990s. As much as anywhere in the United States  my native country with which I have an often conflicted relationship  it counts as home. Landing back in Florida from Haiti, Paris or elsewhere, Miami always seems to offer the singular trick of providing some of the efficiency and convenience of living in the US while never seeming entirely a part of it.
Miami has long been a kind of quasi city-state that evokes strong reactions from visitors, especially those from more anglicised parts of the country who cannot make themselves understood in English to a large part of the local population  an experience that annoys and alarms them.
The strangest city in what is perhaps Americas strangest state, Miami is now home not just to Cubans but to thousands of Argentines, Brazilians, Colombians, Haitians, Jamaicans, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and practically every other Latin American nationality, with sizeable populations of Russians, Indians, Persians and Orthodox Jews as well.

The city has become so micronised that what is commonly thought of as Miami in the popular imagination is, in fact, a series of semi-independent small cities  some only a few blocks long  within the urban sprawl of Miami-Dade County (population 2.6 million). It fronts a long sweep of the blue-green Atlantic to the east and finally peters out in the miasma of the Everglades swamp to the west and the necklace of the Florida Keys to the south.
A young city (it was only incorporated in 1896 in what was then mostly wilderness), Miami is often said to have been founded on bootleg liquor and built its skyline on an infusion of cocaine money in the 70s and 80s (at the height of its cocaine wars in 1980 to 1981, the city had the worlds highest murder rate). Nearly 30 years ago, the crime writer Edna Buchanan wrote that Miami had been a sleepy resort that had transformed to attract year-round ... concentrations of everything corrupt, bizarre or dangerous from everywhere in the world.
Above all, Miami is a place of exile where newcomers try to construct a new life. Upon arriving from Cuba in 1980, the author Reinaldo Arenas  who as a teenaged barbudo had fought with Castros forces but was then imprisoned and tortured both for being an independent intellectual and gay  declared Miami a barren and pestiferous peninsula ... trying to become for a million exiles, the dream of a tropical island.
No fan of the city, Arenas quickly decamped to New York, where he committed suicide in 1990. Miami, however, continued to percolate like a spoonful of Caf Bustelo coffee from the cafe colada that residents traditionally drink every afternoon at 3:05 (the citys area code). And it has become something more interesting than many had thought possible.

In his office in West Miami near the citys airport  a few blocks away from a branch of the citys El Palacio de los Jugos Cuban eateries where the pan con lechn hints at the divine  Armando Valladares sits surrounded by photos of himself with political leaders: Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Florida senator (and Miami native and presidential candidate) Marco Rubio. Now white-haired, bespectacled and elegant, Valladares spent 22 years in Cuban prisons for  among other perceived offences  refusing to put an Im with Fidel sign on his desk at the Ministry of Communications in 1960. Upon his release in 1982, he became a United States Ambassador to the United Nations. After residing in Washington for many years, he moved to Miami about 15 years ago.
The Cubans have demonstrated their ability and their quality of work here, Valladares says. Its a unique case in the history of the United States where the identity of a city was born, in a sense, in another country.
The Cuban aspects of Miamis identity appear to be far less monolithic than they once were, though. Many younger Cuban-Americans support the easing of relations with Cuba that US president Barack Obama has been pursuing with the islands rulers. Events such as the O Miami poetry festival bring Cuban cultural groups such as Omni Zona Franca (from eastern Havanas housing estates) to Miami on a regular basis, demonstrating that the citys Latin vibe is more than Hoy Como Ayer (Today Like Yesterday), as one long-standing club wistfully calls itself.

If Miami represents a refuge for Cubans, it serves as no less of one for Haitians who, fleeing a downward economic spiral and the tyranny of some of the countrys leaders, have made a profound impact on Miamis cultural life over the last several decades.
Along a once-neglected stretch of Northeast 2nd Avenue in the heart of the Haitian immigrant community, a cultural flowering has taken place that has seen the opening of the Little Haiti Cultural Center and its Caribbean Marketplace  a replica of the famed March en fer (Iron Market) in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince . Exuberantly coloured murals by local artists adorn walls, and every Friday night the Rara Lakay band marches through the neighbourhood , beating on drums and blowing on plangent bamboo vaksin trumpets, whose bleat more evokes the deep Haitian countryside than an American city.
I have seen this city grow culturally, says the Haitian painter Edouard Duval Carri , who arrived in Miami from Paris in 1992. When I moved here it was really a [cultural] desert. That has changed.

Carri maintains his studio in Little Haiti. Famous for his painting of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in a wedding dress (an image that did not endear him to the regime), his space now seems a precursor of the areas renaissance. What was once a district many outsiders approached with trepidation now attracts hundreds of people to the outdoor concerts of its monthly Big Night in Little Haiti .
This is the doorway to the United States, Carri says. The particularity of Miami is that it has this very ebullient immigration that makes it quite fascinating.
But Miamis growth into the multicultural metropolis it is today has had a sinister side, too. In the 1960s, the city built the southern extension of Interstate 95 directly through the heart of the Overtown district, an area that had been a cultural mecca for black culture in the south. Overtown was a very pleasant place, says Enid Pinkney, the 83-year-old daughter of an immigrant from the Bahamas (one of the first non-indigenous communities to settle in Miami).
Dispersed to other areas of the city, black residents often found themselves met with hostility. After the 1980 acquittal of four white and Latino police officers for the murder of black businessman Arthur McDuffie, at least 18 people died in rioting and property destruction topped $100m. Fatal police shootings touched off riots in the city at three other points during that decade.
Police departments throughout the county gained a reputation for violence and corruption that intervening years have done little to diminish, with Miami Beach police famously fatally tasering teenage Colombian-American graffiti artist Israel Hernandez in 2013. That same year, a report by the US Justice Department found that City of Miami police had  engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and that the department was tainted by deficient tactics, improper actions by specialised units, as well as egregious delays and substantive deficiencies in deadly force investigations.

Outside observers often remain mystified by Miami. Three years ago, the author Tom Wolfe attempted to capture it as he had 1980s New York in The Bonfire of the Vanities , and instead spewed forth a right-wing caricature titled Back to Blood that showed no grasp of the place the city has become. Such misconceptions are helped along by gaffe- and scandal-prone local politicians, whose peccadillos include everything from floating the idea to shut down all the citys libraries to close a budget gap, to the by-now standard (for Miami) cash-for-favours schemes.
In some areas, things have gone over the top. In South Beach  once a slum for retirees and poor immigrants, now a gay mecca and nightlife hotspot  crass commercialisation has resulted in a kind of Vegas-by-the-sea ambiance, with even the famed Lincoln Road, once a redoubt of local restaurants and retailers, now housing little more than chain stores and the bewildered tourists they prey upon. The preponderance of juniors (a derisive term for the rich scions of Latin Americas economic elite) in the city can be somewhat off-putting, as it seems not only the language and music of that elite is being imported, but their class system, as well.
The city has blossomed and has a new cultural heritage
But the city has blossomed from the place that Reinaldo Arenas despised. The great Cuban poet and anthropologist Lydia Cabrera , who was during her lifetime one of the worlds foremost authorities on Afro-Cuban religion, spent the latter part of her life based in Miami, and donated her abundant collection of papers to the university here. It was home, too, for one of Haitis greatest poets, Flix Morisseau-Leroy , for the last 17 years of his life. And, as testament to the citys new cultural heritage, a new major institution, the Prez Art Museum Miami , opened next to the waters of Biscayne Bay in 2013; the Art Basel festival attracts thousands to the city every year; and the Miami Book Fair is an autumn staple of the literary calendar.
Perhaps more representative of the city than South Beach today are the northern reaches of Miami Beach, an area that is still home to many working-class residents despite spiralling property prices, where the lilting, almost Italianate sound of Argentine Spanish mixes with the caressing sounds of Brazilian Portuguese in the bodegas and on the beach. The Buenos Aires Bakery &amp; Cafe  an establishment on Collins Avenue, only steps away from the sea  sells a variety of pastries that would make any porteo misty-eyed with nostalgia as well as several different kinds of the leafy, highly caffeinated mate beloved in South America, and does a brisk business.

When one drives south towards the Florida Keys  where the last island, Key West, is a mere 90 miles from Cuba  the county begins to descend into farmland. It was here that, in the early part of the 20th century, a Latvian-born eccentric named Edward Leedskalnin created an extraordinary structure known as the Coral Castle , out of coral-formed limestone. As he worked alone and without advanced equipment, just how Leedskalnin created his castle remains something of a mystery  with explanations ranging from some secret mastery of the Earths magnetic field to telekinesis.
Today, other dreams are played out in Miami-Dades fields, and exist in the imaginings of the many migrant workers who toil here, scant miles from the glittering high-rises of downtown Miami. Surrounded by fields of squash, okra, beans and tomatoes, the community of Homestead, despite its tropical locale, evokes the somnolent Midwestern communities of a Ray Bradbury story. Low-rise buildings, train tracks and empty playground swings greet the visitor, and in the street one hears the melange of accents and dialects from the agricultural workers here: Mexican, Guatemalan, Haitian, Jamaican.
In the offices of the immigrant support group WeCount! just off of North Krome Avenue (which shares its name with one of the USs most infamous immigration detention centres located nearby), the connection between Homesteads rural lushness and the city rising only a few miles away seems obvious.
The Mexicans are the ones that put the food on Miamis table, says Catalina Santiago, an 18-year-old high school student who came to the US with her agricultural-worker parents from the Mexican state of Oaxaca a decade ago. But they are always spoken of in a condescending manner.
Related: Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away
On the street below, where Santiago sits with her brother and a number of other immigrants, dusk falls and Homestead sees Mexican families gathering for Sunday-night dinner at restaurants such as Casita Tejas. When they rise for work early the following morning, some will be met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and local police, who will be waiting to check their immigration status and arrest them for probable deportation if they are undocumented (as many are, a state of affairs on which Floridas agriculture depends).
Perhaps it is impending apocalypse, natural and man-made, that makes Miamis frivolity all the more poignant. If climate change predictions are to be believed, large parts of Miami  Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Virginia Key  will be under water in coming years, a phenomenon helped along by the fact that many Florida politicians, including Governor Rick Scott and the aforementioned Senator Rubio, deny that climate change can be linked to human activity.
Driving home north along US1, the skyline of Miami rises above the flat land, its concrete and steel wrapped in the warmth of the tropical sunset. A city of outsiders, refugees and immigrants that  in its reflection of present-day Americas diversity  feels in many ways more American than the 1950s small-town Americana that some politicians and commentators are perpetually nostalgic for.

        <title>Calcutta's architecture is unique. Its destruction is a disaster for the city</title>

I was born in Calcutta, but we moved to Bombay when I was one and a half years old, maybe in early 1964. The company my father worked in had relocated its head office in the face of growing labour unrest; the move was part of the general egress of industry from the city.
We continued to visit Calcutta once, sometimes twice, a year. My mothers brother lived there with his family in Pratapaditya Road, in the historic neighbourhood of Bhowanipore, South Calcutta. He is a Jadavpur University graduate and German-trained civil engineer. By the time I got to know him as a child, hed abandoned his job and set out with friends, establishing a factory that made machines in Howrah, Calcuttas industrial district across the river Hooghly. Given the political turbulence of the 1960s, the business was a long-drawn-out failure. My uncle, however, never wavered from his faith in the Left.
In 1977, the Left Front was elected to form the government in the state of West Bengal; it then won eight successive elections until finally being voted out of power in 2011. The tenure of the Left in West Bengal was marked by genuine achievements and plenty of failures. Perhaps one of its legacies was to create a microcosm that was entirely out of tune with the free-market zeitgeist whose vanguard assumed power in other parts of the world soon after the Left came to power in Bengal: one thinks of Margaret Thatchers election victory in 1979, and Ronald Reagans in 1981. India itself embraced free-market deregulation in 1991. Of course, theres no reason why Bengal shouldnt have explored an alternative path on its own terms; its just that actual faith in what these terms might be was, by the 80s, lacking.
I learnt two things from my visits to Calcutta in the 1960s and 70s, and to my uncles house in particular. The first was that there was an alternative to the corporate world I inhabited in Bombay. Culture did not have to be anglophone to be exciting or sophisticated. In fact in India at that time, it seemed sophistication and excitement often lay outside the realm of the anglophone. Second, it appeared that culture and learning did not have to be exclusive to privileged, stable or well-to-do lives. In my uncles house, the opposite seemed true: the energy I encountered in it as a child was a remnant of a cultural and political force-field that began to come into existence in the city in the 19th century.
My uncle's house contained an interior narrative whose echoes I'd discover later in other parts of the world

This house was the only piece of property my uncle owned, and it had been gifted to him by his father-in-law. My family came from Sylhet, now in Bangladesh, and theyd lost whatever land or property they might have owned with Partition. This was one of the reasons I never associated the sort of house of my uncle lived in with privilege. Also, Pratapaditya Road had become a slightly disturbed and down-at-heel area by the 1960s. Nevertheless, the house itself contained space and life, and an interior narrative whose echoes Id discover later in other parts of the world, but never their exact prototype.
These were the houses features: a porch on the ground floor; red oxidised stone floors; slatted Venetian or French-style windows painted green; round knockers on doors; horizontal wooden bars to lock doors; an open rooftop terrace; a long first-floor verandah with patterned cast-iron railings; intricately worked cornices; and ventilators the size of an open palm, carved as intricate perforations into walls. (Some houses built in the 1940s also incorporate perky art-deco elements: semi-circular balconies; a long, vertical strip comprising glass panes for the stairwell; porthole-shaped windows; and the famous sunrise motif on grilles and gates.)
My uncles house no longer stands. It came down as part of the property boom that happened in Calcutta in the 1990s, in anticipation of the Left Front governments resolve to bring industry to Bengal  a belated stirring of ambition arising from a desire not to miss out on the apparent benefits of economic deregulation that were transforming cities like Bombay, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore. The destruction of these houses would also be a consequence of the house-owners inability to maintain property in an economically depressed city.
Industry never came, partly because of the complex issue of land acquisition as well as the insurmountable populism of West Bengals politics. But existing houses and neighbourhoods continued to be destroyed because of the ethos created by developers  a euphemism, often, for a new breed of land sharks. This ethos dictated that houses on prime land needed to be bought up and immediately destroyed for the price of the land they stood on. So the houses were never put on the market, and their market value was never determined.

Among the principal candidates for buying the new condos were non-resident Indians: Bengalis settled abroad, mainly in America. They never thought to purchase these houses to live in, though they would, of course, be open to buying such houses to inhabit in London, Marrakech or Goa. Family-owned houses that could no longer be maintained were, meanwhile, frequently sold to developers by non-resident Indians.
Soon, the near-simultaneous purchase and destruction of a house seemed like an inevitability. So, paradoxically, did the acquisition of the accoutrements of globalisation: industry and investment didnt come to Bengal, but the ancillary features of a deregulated economy  shopping malls, new five-star hotels, multiplexes, gated properties  began to adorn Calcutta.
These days, the prices of new properties here are fuelled mainly by speculation. This means that new housing is hardly a response to demand; its an invitation to investors whod previously have put their money in equity. Advertisements are a reliable integer of the desires of the new well-to-do: in Calcutta (officially Kolkata since 2001), adverts for gold jewellery  an attractive form of investment  are ubiquitous. Yet in the last 10 years, Id hazard a guess that these have been overtaken by adverts for apartments in tower blocks and improbably named (Highland Park, Diamond City ) gated enclaves. Rival newspapers carry full-page ads for the same construction on their front pages. Until 2013, property seemed a less volatile form of investment than the market.
But property prices in Calcutta have now reached a plateau, and the only people making money off new flats are developers and estate agents. In fact, they seem to be almost the only people making money in Calcutta at all. A newspaper report revealed two months ago that there has been a dramatic and counter-intuitive surge in dollar multimillionaires in this city. The report noted that nearly all of them were making money in real estate.

It was during my travels in Europe in the last 20 years that I realised the neighbourhoods we confront there not only represent the history that produced them, but a history involving communities resisting their disappearance . Without such resistance, no vestiges of the great urban churning of the last two centuries would remain in the world today  in Europe, Australia, the United States and even Latin America. Calcutta, too, was powerfully and uniquely a part of this urban churning (I say uniquely because the neighbourhoods and type of house Ive described above have echoes, but no counterpart, in any other city  in India or abroad).
When we speak of Calcuttas architecture, we usually mean the colonial institutions that the British erected, or the aristocratic mansions of North Calcutta (once called the Black Town by the English) built by Bengali landowners. But the houses Im speaking of were built by anonymous builders for middle-class Bengali professionals: lawyers, doctors, civil servants and professors. Theyre to be found throughout the city, from north to south, in Bhowanipore, Sarat Bose Road, Lake Road, Southern Avenue, Hindustan Park, Bakul Bagan, Paddapukur, Kidderpore, Ahiritola and more.
They all possess the family resemblances Ive enumerated above, to do with slatted windows, cornices, open rooftops and red floors. What is remarkable, though, is that no two houses are identical: a house with a broad facade might stand next to a thin house, both sharing various characteristics  and there are many other ways in which each house you encounter is a fresh conjuring-up or experiment. This makes for an unprecedented, sui generis variety in a single lane or neighbourhood; a variety I have seen nowhere else (think, in contrast, of the identical Victorian houses on a London street). And the style  which can only be described as Bengali-European  is neither renaissance (hardly any Corinthian pillars, as you might spot in the North Calcutta villas) nor neo-Gothic (as Bombays colonial buildings are) nor Indo-Saracenic, which expresses a utopian idea of what a mish-mash of Renaissance, Hindu and Moghul features might be. Its a style that is, to use Amartya Sen s word, eccentric and beautiful, and entirely the Bengali middle classs.

Old is a misnomer for these buildings: theyre the products of the new Calcutta, the Calcutta of modernity and modernism that arose in the 19th century and took on a new identity in the 20th; a Calcutta that evaded, became a counterpoint to, took from, and was far richer than both the British-created city and any idea of the Black Town.
In a way, many of these buildings, which came up from the early 20th-century onwards, testify to why Calcutta continued to be a political, and especially a cultural, hub in India long after the British took away its status as capital city to contain its revolutionary nationalism in 1911  and even a century after the Renaissance, the efflorescence in Bengali culture in the middle of the 19th century. Its this Calcutta whose buildings are poised to vanish, and whose survival some of us are arguing for. Two letters were sent in May to the chief-minister of West Bengal: one signed by 15 people who cut across party lines and persuasions; the other by Amartya Sen, addressed to me and written in support of the project.
Among the ideas that have been put to the government is that of transfer of development rights  which would see a house-owner sell the developer rights equivalent to the price of the land on which his or her house stands, which could then be used by the developer to extend constructions to a commensurate value in another location. Whether or not this model will work cannot be ascertained unless its adopted.
The letter also refers to the MIT economist Esther Duflos observation  glaringly obvious to the outsider who knows a bit about Calcuttas cultural history, but perhaps not so to the resident who is inured to their city  that, properly showcased, these neighbourhoods (Duflo compares them to Pragues) could make Calcutta a tourist destination, and bring it the revenue it so badly needs. The ensuing danger of gentrification is a real one, but a fine line divides it from genuine cultural reinvention.
The basic aims of our campaign are these: first, to work towards and arrive at a working solution, however improbable this seems; second, to find new ways of looking at, and discussing whats important about, these houses and neighbourhoods. Although it would appear that the problem needs to be addressed primarily by the heritage commissions in the city, its also clear that heritage, as a notion and definition, is part of the problem.
In Calcutta, 'heritage' means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings

In Calcutta, a heritage building is a landmark that is important for either being a significant institutional building, or because a famous person frequented it or lived there. The architectural distinctiveness of the building is a secondary concern, or is a pre-ordained, generic feature of the structure: that is, we already know it qualifies as a heritage structure because it adheres to our idea of what a heritage colonial building looks like.
In Calcutta, heritage means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings and precincts. We dont periodise, falling back on catch-all terms like colonial; or historicise; or describe; or define. Simply put, heritage means we dont see, or think about, buildings. (And yet, even as a rubric to be blindly followed, heritage is ignored astonishingly in Calcutta: iconic peoples houses are unmarked and repeatedly destroyed; grade-A listed structures are torn down.)
In July, Mamata Banerjee, the chief-minister of West Bengal, whose government succeeded the Left Fronts in 2011, will make her first trip to London. It will be an intriguing event, as Ms Banerjees fascination with the British capital is well-known, and has caused mirth in the past. On assuming power, one of her first startling remarks had to do with her desire to turn Calcutta into London. She clarified later that what she meant was that both cities had grown alongside rivers, and that Calcutta could do much more with its riverfront.
If she studies her surroundings on this trip, shell discover that Calcutta doesnt actually look very much like London. The main reason has to do with the two cities notably different architectural styles: Londons elegant Victorian, Gothic, Georgian and Edwardian buildings (jealously protected from destruction, on the whole, by conservation laws) are shaped by a distinct Puritanism very unlike the slatted, openness-loving, loiterer-friendly Bengali-European style of, say, Bhowanipore. This disjunction is another reminder of why Calcuttas neighbourhoods cant be reduced to colonial history, and must be understood in terms of their own peculiar, cross-referencing cosmopolitanism.
Related: The Writers' Building, Kolkata: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 13
To move on this matter hasnt been easy, and not only because of governmental inaction and the absence of actual powers where the West Bengal Heritage Commission and the Kolkata Municipal Corporations Heritage Committee are concerned. Whats more difficult is peoples inability to recognise the architectural legacy theyve taken for granted for more than a century, and their mysterious disconnect from the history that produced these neighbourhoods.
This is the reason I provided the short personal note at the beginning: to explain my outsiders point of view. It may be why I see these buildings as I do, without that special Bengali nostalgia that expresses itself, generically, in songs by Bangla bands and in recent Bengali films, which occasionally conflate North Calcutta and any one of its decaying mansions with a sentimental idea of the citys true heritage. Theres a certain quietism, a sweet apathy, in such nostalgia that I feel even more distant from than the moral superiority Ive had to confront from people who feel this architecture is too minor and remote an issue for intelligent people to be concerned with.
Whats at stake here is a discussion on urban regeneration  which is connected to, but distinct from, economic revival. For the urban revival of any city, its a prerequisite that citizens engage with the spaces, buildings and histories that characterise it, rather than deny those features; that they understand and reuse them. Calcutta, in the last two decades, has largely failed to do this. But the narrative of every great city must contain such episodes of failure, before it begins to look at itself anew.

From Waze for crowds to Uber for street food  MIT innovations at Kumbh Mela
For the spiritual among the 30 million people descending on the Indian city of Nashik for this Augusts tri-annual Hindu festival, the event is a catharsis. For urban planners it is an opportunity to analyse city problems on a huge scale

This August an expected 30 million religious devotees, ascetics and tourists will congregate in the Indian city of Nashik for the Kumbh Mela  a 20-day Hindu festival which is one of the largest public gatherings in the world.
The mass pilgrimage of faith takes place every three years on a rotational basis in four alternating cities, and will be returning to Nashik after a gap of 12 years. For the spiritual, the event is a catharsis, where one can purge oneself of sin by taking a dip in the holy water of the sacred rivers. But for technologists, social innovators and urban planners, the staggering increase in human density is a golden opportunity to identify, analyse and study pop-up city problems at scale.
Ramesh Raskar, who spearheads the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Kumbhathon venture, is head of MITs Camera Culture group, conducting multidisciplinary research in optics, sensors, probes and software processing. The Kumbhathon was conceived as a sandbox initiative to create a prototype ecosystem with the broader vision of game-changing innovation at its core, he explains. The challenges of the 2015 Kumbh Nashik will be mapped to help address similar issues in refugee camps, concerts such as Burning Man in the Nevada desert and in emerging cities across the world.
The Kumbhathon project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology
Ramesh Raskar, MIT
Raskar worked with local innovators, students, city officials, civic groups, the police and historians in his hometown of Nashik to draw up a shortlist of key concerns, from a list of more than 500 issues received through an open crowdsourced platform, for the team to address. The project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology, said Raskar.
Over the past year, the Kumbhathon team has held three-monthly workshops and innovation camps to discuss, test and implement a range of smart solutions  from the hi-tech to the decidedly low-tech  to address challenges in the areas of access to healthcare, transportation, food and sanitation, housing and crowd control.

One hi-tech idea is an app to manage crowds and avoid stampedes  a regular problem at the festival, with at least 39 people killed in a stampede in 2003, the last time Nashik was host city. Modelled on the lines of the worlds largest community-based real time traffic and navigation app, Waze, the app uses mobile phone location data to help local police redirect pedestrians away from saturated areas.
Meanwhile, an online platform, LiveNashik, will dynamically gather and analyse data on taxis, train and bus schedules, free rooms in hostels, and the availability of hospital beds, ambulances and blood stocks. Within that citywide project, a person tracking app, called Milap, aims to address the major problem of children and others being lost during the frenzy of the festival. Under the scheme, individuals can be registered at entry points via a barcode that serves as an identification tool. If someone is lost, they can visit a store, where the shopkeeper can read their barcode with a smartphone  and a match with the missing persons database can be made.
Other hi-tech initiatives include the Epidemic Tracker, which is a combination of a mobile app and cloud-based backend analytical engine to monitor the health of festival attendees in real time. Not only does this serve as a check on potential outbreaks of disease, but also helps medics offer relevant prescriptions and medication.
However well constructed the technology, it depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace
Tarun Khanna, Harvard
Another challenge being tackled is food distribution, where the team has devised an Uber -like logistical network that connects festival-goers with quality and hygienic food suppliers. This enables customers to have access to information about when and where the food was cooked and make more informed decisions about consumption. According to the Kumbhathon team, this model could be expanded into a multibillion-dollar nationwide service.
Its about tapping into smart citizens to make smart cities, said Raskar. Citizens watch more TV, carry smartphones and are highly mobile and connected. Their participation is crucial.

The ability of low-tech innovations to bring about greater social impact has been an eye-opening experience for the team. WikiNasik, is one such example, where more than 300 volunteers worked to update Nashiks Wikipedia page, so that outsiders had access to up-to-date and comprehensive information about the city. Students took cameras and used pictures to document the heritage and history of the city, said Raskar. Personal compilations can help enhance the experience for visitors and can also add value in the tourism sector in building an extensive city guide for the future, he added.
Another low-tech solution with high social outcome is a Shops Online portal that displays detailed information about retailers in the city. From specifics on the owner, the nature of the business and the hours of operation, to the location and a profile of the surrounding area, the platform could open up wide-ranging data-mining possibilities. The repository of data is key for potential investors who want to start a business during the Kumbh Mela.

Participants at a Kumbathon workshop talk MITs John Werner through their idea
While citizen participation on the ground in Nashik has been significant, the correlation between technology and the public acceptance of that technology must be kept in mind, according to Tarun Khanna, director of the South Asia Institute at Harvard University. As part of a team mapping the Allahabad Kumbh in 2013, he was surprised to find that a person-tracking app using photos wasnt as effective as the age-old solution of setting off a balloon in the air when a person was lost. However well constructed the technology, it all depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace, he said.
Rahul Mehrotra, chair of the Urban Planning and Design department at Harvard, who led the venture for the Allahabad Kumbh, said that technology should not be considered a fix in itself. Cities are broader, more sensitive and more complex ecosystems in which technology is just one instrument and cannot be treated as an end in itself, he said.

If a city could embody a rainbow, it would be San Francisco . It is home both to the LGBT pride flag  which was first used in the citys 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade  and a wealth of architecture and street art in multicolour.
For photographer Kristen Simar ( @home_schooling ), the character of the city is bound up with this multitude of colours. San Franciscos lifeblood is in its neighbourhoods. Each colourful house is a celebration of the citys history and the people who have chosen to call San Francisco home. No two houses are the same and each story is unique.
As the closest major city to Silicon Valley, the city has become the urban home of the tech scene, bringing with it a significant dose of gentrification  and change . San Francisco, historically home to trailblazing movements, has become a city of wealth, which has forced out many who cant keep up financially, including artists and activists. The old quirkiness and character is slowly being washed away, Kristen explains. Im trying to capture every bit of beauty, colour and individuality while its still there.

Building a real city from scratch isnt like playing Minecraft , Civilization or SimCity . Well, it is a little. But problems arise in reality that dont come up in cyberspace, including vainglorious dictators, pompous architects, bureaucratic impedimenta and the fact that much of the best land is already inhabited by those intractable objects: pesky humans.
Nevertheless, after studying several urban planning projects around the world, weve mastered the step-by-step process of how to build your very own real city.
Part 1: steps one to five
Step 1: Choose a location
Before you begin, you need a spot. Deserts, undeveloped jungles and uninhabited islands are popular: you dont want to sink your budget into detoxifying brownfield sites, bulldozing slums or fighting legal battles over ancestral land rights. Plus, very few camels attend planning meetings, still less are they capable of forming coherent objections to your masterplan for a desert metropolis.
Tajikistans president, Emomali Rahmon, recently laid the foundation stone for Saihoon , a new city for 250,000 people on a 14,000-hectare (34,580-acre) desert site. When complete, it will have 19 residential districts, 50 schools, 40 sports centres, shopping centres and bazaars  and, my favourite design feature, 7,000 hectares (17,290 acres) of orchards blooming in the former desert. Egypts new capital, too, is going to be built on sand  to the east of Cairo, its functionally inadequate predecessor. Meanwhile, President Teodoro Obiang is currently overseeing the creation of Oyala as his new capital deep in the jungle of Equatorial Guinea , remote from the seaborne assaults that have menaced the dictator and his government in the existing capital. Crystal Island was to be built on a river island near Moscow.
If you dont have a desert or uninhabited island to hand, build one. Songdo, the new city near Seoul in South Korea, is built on land reclaimed from the Yellow Sea. In the early 1960s, Buckminster Fuller dreamed up a giant floating pyramid in Tokyo Bay which would have housed 1 million people  in part as a response to the problem of acquiring building land in Japan. Perhaps sadly, it never got built.
Step 2: Ensure a reliable water supply
This may sound elementary, but consider what happened to the city of Fatehpur Sikri . The Mughal emperor Akbar commenced the construction of this walled city in 1569, to serve as the Mughal capital. Over the next 15 years, he and his lackeys built royal palaces, harems, courts, mosques and private quarters, all from locally available red sandstone. Shortly after completion, however, Akbar abandoned Fatehpur  in part because of inadequate water supplies.
Today, Rawabi  the first Israeli city built for Palestinians  has a similar problem. Work started in 2011 and, when complete, it will have homes for 40,000 residents, as well as cinemas, shopping malls, schools, landscaped walkways, office blocks, a conference centre, restaurants and cafes. But, until as recently as this spring, apartments stood empty because negotiations failed with Israeli authorities over connecting the city to the countrys water grid .
Egypts as-yet-unnamed new capital is set to be built in the desert  a popular choice for planned cities
Step 3: Ensure a reliable money supply
Again this may sound elementary, but you dont want to run out of liquidity halfway through building the high-speed train link to the financial quarter. There are various options available to you when it comes to securing the cash. Rawabi, denounced by some Palestinians for normalising Israeli occupation and by some Israelis for the possibility of providing a base for terrorists, has drawn a third of its $1bn (640m) investment from the private Palestinian conglomerate Massar International, and the rest from Qatar .
Oyala has been described as  a multibillion-dollar plaything for Africas longest-serving dictator  and is funded chiefly by oil, timber and gas revenues. Equatorial Guinea is the third largest sub-Saharan oil producer, and much of that money is being lavished on the new capital, which will have a championship golf course, the Library of Central Africa (which looks like a spaceship docked in a jungle clearing), a luxury hotel and a presidential villa. Meanwhile, according to the International Business Times,  the people are starving .
In Egypt, the nameless 700 sq km city that is set to replace Cairo as the countrys capital will be partly funded by Emirati businessman Mostafa Madbouly, who recently unveiled the 30bn projects plans. He told Guardian Cities that he already has the money to build at least 100 sq km of the new capital, including a new parliament. But he needs more: which is why he invited kings, presidents, 30 visiting emirs and hundreds of would-be investors to the March launch at Sharm el-Sheikh.
Step 4: Think about jobs
If your city is to be economically sustainable, it needs jobs. Herbert Girardet, author of Creating Sustainable Cities, argues that Egypts planned new capital has a better chance of success than other purpose-built Egyptian cities, mainly because the vast government will be relocated there. Indeed, many of the most famous planned cities were new capitals  Brasilia, Canberra, Abuja, Canberra, Ottawa, New Delhi  that, whatever their other shortcomings, benefited from the employment opportunities and economic uplift of being a national administrative hub.
The first three of 100 smart cities that prime minister Narendra Modi is planning in India will be built as part of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, which the government aims will be a  global manufacturing and trading hub . At Lavasa in Maharashtra, theyre planning animation and film studios, software-development companies, biotech labs, and law and architectural firms, focusing the knowledge industries at the heart of the new India.
Step 5: Do not alienate locals
Dont do what they did in Lavasa. The developers of the 12,500-acre site have been accused of intimidating indigenous farmers into selling their land at rock-bottom prices. They have also been accused of cutting down millions of trees. Human rights activists have reported that up to 5,000 original settlers have been forced to leave. In 2010, the Indian Environment and Forests ministry ordered that construction on Lavasa cease because the project violated environmental laws.
Step 6: Devise a masterplan
Part 2: steps six to 10
You dont even need to set foot in the country where your plans will be realised. For example, Garsdale Design, which specialises in masterplans for war-ravaged cities in Iraq, is a family practice operating out of a converted barn in the Yorkshire Dales. Such 3D modelling applications as Esri CityEngine make it possible to devise city masterplans for homes, sewerage, water and electrical systems and integrated public transport, and then to amend these plans according to the needs on the ground. Increasingly, too, masterplans involve setting out Wi-Fi hotspots, fibre-optic grids and sensors (more on this below).
Step 7: Integrate transport
Narendra Modis 100 planned cities in India all involve integrated transport with bus rapid transport (or BRT, a sort of overground metro system), suburban trains and cycle networks. Smart transport might well mean digital parking meters that text you when a parking space opens up, or real-time transport displays that give data about traffic jams, availability of buses and train services. Helsinki  admittedly not a planned city, but a good model to follow  is going so far in the integrated transport direction as to say that private cars may soon be obsolete .
The proposed Lusail Iconic Stadium in Lusail City - part of Qatars 2022 World Cup bid
Step 8: Consider banning cars
Speaking of private cars being obsolete, Masdar City  designed by architects Fosters + Partners and being built by the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company  has banned cars within its walls. Similarly, Dubais Ziggurat Pyramid , a metropolis planned in 2008 to house 1 million people, would have made cars redundant  its public transportation system, which would run horizontally and vertically, would be more efficient than private vehicles. (Sadly, since 2008 weve heard little of this putatively carbon neutral pyramid.)
Step 9: Make rubbish clever
Forget bin lorries, fetid dumpsters and the excrescence that is the wheelie bin. At Lusail City in Qatar , theyre planning a system of pneumatic tubes to transport rubbish to a central location for processing. At Songdo in South Korea, similarly, there are no rubbish trucks or bins in the street: all household waste is sucked into a vast underground network of tunnels and dispatched to waste-treatment centres where it is sorted and deodorised. Alternatively, information and communications technology can involve sensors that detect when waste disposal pickups are needed, or to measure energy consumption and emissions. Citizens may question whether they want ICT sensors checking their emissions. Ignore them. Whose city is this, anyway?
Step 10: Maximise connectivity
Broadband infrastructure that combines cable, optical fibre, and wireless networks is a basic requirement in such hi-tech cities as Songdo. Whats more, if youre serious about creating a smart city, then youll need so much fibreoptic cabling that its not even funny  not enough just to ensure high-speed access to the internet, but also so that the sensors that are key to the development of intelligent solutions for the city can work properly. Otherwise youll have created not so much a smart city as a stupid one.
Part 3: Steps 11 to 15
Step 11: Aspire to carbon neutrality
Destiny, the Florida city that developer Anthony Pugilese wanted to be a Silicon Valley of green technology, was, for a while, held up as a model: it aimed to reduce waste to close to zero and to meet its energy needs entirely through renewable sources including solar, wind, geothermal and the worlds largest hydrogen power plant. The city never got built: Florida authorities nixed the development, arguing that the ostensibly green and pleasant city amounted to urban sprawl .
Step 12: Start again, clown, youve forgotten parks
Look at your masterplan. Is it all sprawl and mall, dazzling plate glass, and more cloverleaf junctions than you can shake a stick at? Of course it is: most masterplans are. Humans cant flourish in that environment, as good planners increasingly realise. Lavasa, for instance, is the first Indian city to be planned according to the principles of New Urbanism , which advocates walkable cities that commingle business and residential development, offer mixed-income housing, and preserve green space. Songdo has been planned around a central park, and designed so that every resident can walk to work in the business district  a big draw for attracting new residents. Sixty per cent of Great City , a high-density metropolis outside Chengdu in China, will consist of buffer areas of gardens and greenery that are at most 10 minutes walk from the city centre. And Egypts planned new capital will have a park double the size of New Yorks Central Park.
Step 13:  and culture
Abu Dhabi has splashed its oil cash on a cultural city called Saadiyat Island , a few miles off the coast. It features a branch of the Louvre , due to open this year, and before 2020 will also see a Guggenheim museum  designed, like the one in Bilbao, by Frank Gehry  and a Performing Arts Centre by Zaha Hadid . Just along the coast in Dubai, theyre playing catchup with D3 (short for Dubai Design District), in tacit recognition of the fact that shopping malls and gyms arent enough to make a city a decent place to live. Wags are already comparing the industrial Al Quoz area  which now has more than 30 galleries among its 1970s and 80s warehouses  to Shoreditch or Williamsburg. Just dont expect any illegal raves or warehouse parties. Meanwhile, in the Congolese jungle, the Dutch artist Renzo Martens is trying something similar  to create an arts scene in one of the most impoverished parts of the world and thereby gentrify the jungle .

Step 14: Please, not another funny-shaped island
Does the world really need another state-of-the-art golf course? (At Lavasa they obviously think so: along with the medical campus, luxury hotels, boarding schools and sports academies, there is a Nick Faldodesigned golf course .) The worry about new cities built from scratch is that, as anthropologist Nick Simcik Arese of the Oxford Programme for the Future of Cities puts it , they offer a secessionary envelope for the rich  a form of class apartheid. He argues that new cities often fail to provide enough jobs for poorer residents or affordable transport to areas where they could find more work.
Its an important point. Around the world, new cities often exclude all but the wealthiest. For instance, the least expensive apartments in Lavasa now sell for between $17,000 and $36,000  well out of reach for most middle-class Indians. The developer says it has modified its plans to offer affordable rental apartments for young professionals. New cities are thus often confounded by the inverse relationship between maximising real-estate proceeds and making new cities livable. Or, to put it another way, if you want your new city to become something other than a ghost town or a large-scale gated community, it must be socially diverse.
What the world doesnt need is any more unimaginatively shaped developments for those with more money than sense, such as the Palm Islands in Dubai . The entire point of the islands is that you can see them from space. On the ground, however, it means long spits of land that dont connect to each other and leave you in a kind of endless residential street hellscape. Besides, what must our alien neighbours think?
Part 4: Steps 16 to 20
Step 15: Make a statement
The Palm Islands might be ridiculous, but who wouldnt want to live in the worlds first inhabited volcano? When, in 2008, Norman Foster unveiled plans for a new city on an island on the outskirts of Moscow, the centrepiece was to be (at that point) the tallest building in the world: 450m high, covering almost half a million square metres and with a total floor area of 2.5 million square metres, housing theatres, exhibition spaces, 3,000 hotel rooms, 900 serviced apartments and a school.  Crystal Island is one of the worlds most ambitious building projects , and it represents a milestone in the 40-year history of the practice, he said. But the economic crisis put paid to the grandiose scheme, which is perhaps a shame. After all, whats the fun in building a new city if it doesnt look cool?
Step 16: Treat workers with respect
In 2013, Nepalese migrants working in Lusail City in Qatar told the Guardian that their employers were making them work long hours in the heat and were withholding pay to keep them from running away. The International Trade Union Confederation estimates that 4,000 workers will die in Qatar by 2022 . The countrys kafala system  where employers exercise broad power and influence over the lives of their workers  has been called modern-day slavery by human rights watchers. It doesnt have to be this way. Building a new city from scratch can be socially beneficial. For instance, perhaps one of at the most heartening features about the Palestinian new city of Rawabi is that one third of its engineers and architects are women , a gender balance without precedent in the Arab world.
Step 17: Build fast. No, faster 
Egypts new capital city, according to the developers brochure , will have exactly 21 residential districts housing 5 million residents, span 700 sq km (a space almost as big as Singapore), with 663 hospitals and clinics, 1,250 mosques and churches, and 1.1m homes. Oh yes, and according to the brochure  it will be built within the next five to seven years. No pressure.
Lavasa in India
Step 18: Re-educate your new urbanites
In Kangabashi, a new city for one million people in the Ordos region of Inner Mongolia, China, new residents are handed a welcome pack that includes fans and a list of instructions : Dont spit, dont throw rubbish on the streets, dont play loud music, dont drive on the pavement, says the introductory brochure. The thinking is that most of the residents are country dwellers from nearby villages who dont know how to behave in cities. I know what youre thinking: when are the urbanites of London, New York and Paris going to get forcibly re-educated so they dont continue to befoul their built environment with their phlegm and unspeakable music?
When work started on Kangbashi five years ago, it was derided as a ghost city. But rural workers are now indeed moving into the citys new high-rises, lured by generous compensation packages. The Chinese authorities idea is that such cities help diversify the countrys economy: subsistence farming was becoming less economically worthwhile, owing to poor soils and increasing water shortages. The enormous wealth of the regions coal industry helped pay for much of the citys infrastructure, and there was cheap land to build on. Kangbashi is just the beginning: a test run for Beijings plans to urbanise the vast rural interior of China, and relocate 250 million farmers over the next two decades  a social experiment as much as an economic one.
Step 19: If you build it, they will come
As any planner knows, it doesnt matter how sophisticated your 3D-imaging software or how smart your urban vision. The test will be when the hookers come there, when the gay pride parade is flagged off on the promenade, and an organisation of deviants has its annual convention in town, Ajit Gulabchand, the developer of Lavasa, has said . I dont want to plan for that, but Ill be happy if it happens. Quite so: one of the pleasures of creating a city from scratch must surely be that it goes rogue and becomes something other than you imagined.
Step 20: Oh, yes  give it a name
The planned new capital of Egypt doesnt yet have a name, though the safe money says it wont be called Mubarakville, Cairo 2.0 or Sisi City  though I kind of like the last one. And what of the new city rising on the coast of the Red Sea? It has a lot of things going for it. It will house one of the largest sea ports in the world. It will provide more than a million jobs. And, if construction sticks to schedule, it will be complete by 2020. Only one problem: its called King Abdullah Economic City . Perhaps it sounds nicer in Arabic.

The goal of free, high-speed internet for everyone in New York City has jumped much closer: Sidewalk Labs , the new Google-backed startup that was created last month to improve city life though technological innovation, has announced it is investing in a project to turn the citys payphones into Wi-Fi hotspots.
The company is among a group of investors acquiring two New York-based firms that have been leading the effort to turn disused payphones into 10,000 Wi-Fi hotspots and information kiosks, beginning later this year. In a stroke, it puts Sidewalk Labs  and, by proxy, Google  in the lead of the worlds highest-profile rollout of free, citywide Wi-Fi.
The project, LinkNYC , was the winning entry in the Reinvent Payphones Design Challenge , a competition that solicited innovative ideas for reusing some of the citys roughly 11,000 public payphones. The service contracts for those phones expired in 2014, and LinkNYC  which launched in November 2014  envisioned converting the disused phone booths into 21st-century information portals. They would provide free Wi-Fi to a radius of up to 150ft, mobile device chargers, and an interactive screen that would itself offer internet access, free nationwide phone calls and access to local services and information.
The kiosks will also hold large digital advertisement screens, which will pay for the project and augment the citys coffers.
By integrating new technologies into existing infrastructure, cities can reinvent these assets  providing not just more modern, free services to citizens but even more revenue to cities, said Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff, who previously served as a deputy mayor of New York from 2001 to 2008.
Intersection says it can help other cities update ageing infrastructure, such as old street lights and bus shelters
Sidewalk Labs was launched earlier this month , with money from Google and a broad mandate to foster urban innovation. The goal, according to Google CEO Larry Pages announcement, is to develop and grow civic technologies that can reduce the cost of living, make transportation more efficient and reduce overall energy usage. Hes likened Sidewalk Labs to Google X, the lab within the company focusing on so-called moonshot projects like autonomous cars and a network of internet-connected balloons that can provide service to far-flung areas.
As the concept of the tech-enabled smart city edges closer to reality, Google sees opportunity to apply its technological expertise to the complex and often interrelated issues of the city  and to make some money along the way. In Doctoroff, Google has an experienced businessman and city official who helped enable New Yorks popular and successful High Line park and led its ultimately failed bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. Fancy parks and mega-events, however, dont rank highly on the list of day-to-day concerns in the worlds growing cities. As Page put it, the general purview of Sidewalk Labs is to find technological solutions to help transform cities to be more livable, flexible and vibrant.
Until the recent announcement, it was unclear what Googles new focus on cities might mean. But  by taking a small stake in Control Group, the company providing the interfaces for LinkNYCs kiosks, and Titan, which helps run the advertising side  Sidewalk Labs has shown it is interested in finding existing projects and speeding them up. The two firms will merge into a new company, Intersection, with Doctoroff as chairman. Again, exactly what that means  and how much influence Sidewalk Labs and Google will have  is unclear. Neither Sidewalk Labs nor Intersection representatives were available to comment.
Related: Will Google's $5m plan make cycling in the rest of Silicon Valley easier?
With 10,000 kiosks being converted over the next 12 years, the LinkNYC project is estimated to cost about $200m. CityBridge, the partnership of companies that will build, install and operate the kiosks, estimates that advertising will generate at least $500m in revenue for the city over that 12-year period, roughly half of the projects anticipated gross revenue.
New York is only the beginning: Sidewalk Labs envisions spreading this concept to other cities. The model is scalable, according to company officials. And Intersection says it will help other cities update ageing infrastructure, such as old street lights and bus shelters, to create a cohesive network of dynamic messaging across these assets  including emergency notifications, real-time transit information and wayfinding.
Making such information widely accessible alongside advertisements aligns neatly with Googles main strengths  indexing the internet and serving ads  so its not hard to see why the company, through Sidewalk Labs, would be investing in this realm. For its part, Sidewalk Labs claims to be less interested in Googles ad business and more focused on exploring how technology can be used to change the ways people experience and interact with cities, and to make them more efficient, responsive, flexible and resilient.

Why developing countries need to toughen up on taxes
Dutch minister Lilianne Ploumen explains how implementing a fairer, more transparent tax system will be vital in the financing of the SDGs

Next week, the UN financing conference in Addis Ababa will take decisions that will have a profound impact on the global community over the next 15 years and beyond. Tax collection in developing countries will determine whether the sustainable development goals can rival the success of the millennium development goals , which expire this year.
For most developing countries, tax revenue lies somewhere between 10% and 15% of gross domestic product. Thats low compared with an average of about 35% for developed countries. In historical terms, however, its not that low. Throughout the 19th century, in all western countries tax revenue was below 10%. In his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century , Thomas Piketty shows us that it was only after 1910 that tax revenue slowly started rising.
Low tax revenues meant that governments were able to fund only the most basic services, such as policing, the courts and the armed forces. Universal access to healthcare or education, infrastructure and a social safety net  in short, the foundations for decent, prosperous lives  call for much higher tax revenues.

This goal can be achieved, perhaps sooner than many of us ever dared dream. Success in the fight against hunger and poverty, under the banner of the MDGs, has changed our perception of what is possible. Now, the worlds bold new ambition is to leave no one behind.
To achieve this, we will have to, at last, realise the full potential of developing countries. This is known as domestic resource mobilisation, and it all starts with higher rates of tax revenue collection.
In order to be able to finance their share of the SDGs, developing countries will have to increase tax revenue collection to about 20% of GDP, according to the UN . I see three main areas for action.
First, ensure fair taxation. The urgency here is overwhelming. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that multinationals avoid $100bn worth of corporation tax in developing countries. Governments and international institutions now have to make good on promises to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion.
Second, strengthen tax inspectors. Developing countries need support to broaden their tax base and build tax collection capacity. Two years ago, the Netherlands started giving technical assistance to developing countries, and we now plan to double our current contribution. Today, we are active in 10 countries and we are starting an initiative to generate extra resources for building tax collection capacity.
I believe this is a good investment, because internationally the rate of return on such support is way over a factor of 10. We plan to launch this initiative at the Addis summit.
Countries that want to use these extra resources will need to express the political will to reform their tax systems. In developing countries, tax systems often have a regressive effect because they tend to rely heavily on consumption taxes, like VAT and excise duty, or on import levies. The poor end up paying a relatively high amount of tax because they spend all their income on goods subject to VAT, such as groceries and phone credit. And they pay import levies on their mobiles. There is no tax-free shopping for the poor.
Third, broaden the tax base. Developing countries need more capacity to administer and collect more complex forms of tax, like income and wealth taxes. Apart from VAT, countries need a progressive income tax regime. Because the poor are often hit harder by income tax too.
In Zambia, for instance, the sugar picker and the woman with a market stall pay more tax than the sugar factory itself. Businesses can use smart tax arrangements  tax avoidance tactics, in other words  to ensure they pay less than 1% in tax. While the market seller has to pay four times that rate on the couple of dollars she earns. That is not only wrong from a gender perspective; its completely unfair.
Thats why I am delighted that we have already agreed with five countries to revise our tax treaties. We have signed a new treaty with Malawi, and signed an amendment with Ethiopia, and we are holding discussions with seven other countries on updating treaties.
In total, we are looking to revise our treaties with 23 countries. Anti-abuse provisions  defining which companies get access to the treaty benefits  will ensure that the Netherlands is no longer an attractive option for companies that use tax avoidance tactics. Theirs is the kind of business we would rather do without.
These anti-abuse provisions are meant to exclude companies that only establish themselves in a third state to benefit from tax treaty advantages through that country, without having any other activities in that third state.
Finally, we regularly urge developing countries to be more discerning when awarding tax exemptions. The Netherlands is now putting its money where its mouth is. Along with other countries, we are prepared to forgo tax exemptions on goods and services that fall under official development assistance.
The task before us is daunting. The leap from the billions we needed for the MDGs to the trillions we will need to make the SDGs a success is a big one. But just consider what weve achieved already.
Ending hunger is within the grasp of this generation  a feat that seemed inconceivable only a generation ago. We must redouble our efforts if we want to do the same with poverty. It is possible to make the billions we provide in official development assistance spark the trillions that we need in private sector resources.
Above all, I see ways for developing countries to increase their tax revenues. That will enable them to unleash their full potential at last.

The goals were intended to serve as a precise, memorable and measurable way to focus development policy in the first years of the 21st century and to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the worlds poorest people.
Underlying them, however, was a simple if stunning ambition; an epochal call to arms.
We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected, ran the Millennium Declaration that was adopted at the summit.
We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want.
Related: UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people
If progress on the MDGs has been mixed  and the final report plainly admits that it has  then their architects can at least claim that progress on ending extreme poverty has been spectacular: between 1990 and this year, the number of those living in extreme poverty has fallen from 1.9 billion to 836 million.
Improvements in many other areas have been less impressive, however. Last year, the the UN deputy secretary general, Jan Eliasson, bemoaned the lack of action on clean water and sanitation , warning that the slow progress in building toilets and ending open defecation was having a staggering effect on the health, safety, education, prosperity and dignity of 2.5 billion people.
His comments came two months after Unesco admitted that there was no chance whatsoever that the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015 would be met.
The MDGs have often been criticised for their naivety, their narrow interpretation of the ethos behind the millennium declaration and for their lack of focus on longterm, sustainable development. But they are at least acknowledged to have concentrated global attention on their separate eight areas.
Many fear that the MDGs replacements  the sustainable development goals , which will be agreed by the UN in September  will struggle to do even that.
Whereas the MDGs consisted of eight goals supported by 21 specific targets and 60 indicators, there are currently 17 SDGs comprising 169 targets. The number of indicators has yet to be set but there are likely to be hundreds .
The sheer number of goals, targets and indicators has prompted some to worry that the SDGs will be a hard sell.
The British prime minister, David Cameron, has made it clear that he favours fewer.
I dont believe they will cut it at 17, he said last year . There are too many to communicate effectively. Theres a real danger they will end up sitting on a bookshelf, gathering dust.
Despite this, the numbers look unlikely to change as reaching agreement even on 17 has been a long, hard slog.
But the UN is acutely aware of the need to grab peoples attention with the SDGs, which will set the development agenda until 2030. During last years SDG negotiations, the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, grouped the goals into six essential elements: dignity, people, planet, prosperity, justice and partnership.
If the numerous SDGs are to make an impression on the global consciousness, they will need careful packaging and a simple, unifying message.
As Helen Clark, the head of the UN Development Programme , put it in January : We need to catch peoples imagination with this because if you just say sustainable development, eyes glaze. If you say, 17 goals, it takes a genius to recite the 17.

Bullets banish books in South Sudan as education becomes a casualty of war
Slim progress on education is set back as soldiers requisition school buildings and fighting forces children to flee, but some are returning to the classroom

At the end of a school day in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, young girls in light brown uniforms walk home, chatting in the late-afternoon sun. The scene should be repeated all over the country but over the past year and a half the civil war has forced hundreds of thousands of children out of school nationwide.
Education is one of the hidden casualties of South Sudans latest conflict, which began in December 2013 and shows little sign of ending. School buildings have been requisitioned by soldiers, pupils and their teachers have been press-ganged into armed groups, and an estimated 400,000 children have been forced out of school.
In the three worst affected states, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity, 70% of the 1,200 schools have been closed. In some counties, not a single school is open.

The education sector was a concern even before the war broke out: the national literacy rate of 27% was one of the lowest in the world, and primary school enrolment (47%) and completion (10%) rates were also unimpressive, though better than they had been during the long years of conflict before South Sudan seceded from Sudan.
At independence four years ago this week, South Sudan was one of the least developed countries in the world, and the new schools created in peace time were often extremely basic. Nevertheless, some progress was made. The countrys subsequent rapid descent into civil war reversed many of those slight gains.
Aliza Ruai knows what that feels like. She had been a student in Lich primary school, in Unity state, when the war began. In June 2014, she was forced to flee as the violence surged towards her home.
We could only move at night, says the 17-year-old. I couldnt see the fighting but I heard the guns. I was feeling very bad. I was afraid. My father was taken in April before we fled. I have not seen him since.
She missed her exams because of the fighting, and spent more time out of school as she looked after younger siblings. Now, though, she is studying again, at a makeshift school in the UN camp where she lives on the outskirts of Bentiu, the state capital.
Because I want a good life, I will study, she says. Maybe I can be a doctor or a teacher.
Samuel Liom is at the same school. He was 14 before he first went to school, since there wasnt one in his village. At first, he found it difficult to be in a class with much younger children, but he enjoyed learning so much that he overcame his embarrassment.
My favourite subject is social science because you learn how other countries are doing on justice and social issues
Samuel Liom
Like Aliza, Samuel was forced to flee the fighting in Unity state  what he calls the shooting and lootings  and dead bodies by the side of the road. At first, he wasnt sure whether it was worth going to school in the camp, but sitting around doing nothing became frustrating. Now he is back at school, and hopes to get a job with the UN. The civil war has sharpened the focus of his studies.
My favourite subject is social science because you will learn the world story  how other countries are doing in terms of justice and social issues, he says. If you do social studies, you know the heart of the country.
South Sudan needs peace, Samuel says, to allow him and others to lead normal lives.
Both Aliza and Samuel are studying at a school supported by Unicef as part of its Back to Learning Campaign , which has reached 121,000 children and hopes to help three times as many. Funding, though, is in short supply.

When a war breaks out, education sinks down the list of priorities. In 2014, around 1% of humanitarian spending went on education.
As the world meets in Oslo this week for a Summit on Education for Development , Unicef will argue for a higher priority for education in humanitarian emergencies.
We have to keep in mind that conflicts today, like in South Sudan, are lasting much longer, so we have to rethink the way traditional humanitarian assistance is provided, says Phuong T Nguyen from Unicef, in South Sudan.
Aspects of education are life-saving: how to protect yourself from cholera, the use of clean water, how to protect yourself from gender-based violence. Its not in the same sense as food but it is life-saving.
Many in South Sudan would agree. Edmund Yakani is a prominent activist who organises programmes to help provide schooling for children affected by conflict. Hes concerned that an entire generation is growing up without a proper education  making South Sudans future prospects even bleaker.
Even areas not directly affected by conflict are overwhelmed, he says. Class sizes have grown from around 45 to well over 100 in many cases, reducing the quality of education. And many teachers are getting work as humanitarians because the money is better. The educational cost of this war is high.

        <title>UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/united-nations-extreme-poverty-millennium-development-goals</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
The millennium development goals (MDGs) have driven the most successful anti-poverty movement in history and brought more than a billion people out of extreme penury , but their achievements have been mixed and the world remains deeply riven by inequality, the UN s final report on the goals has concluded.
Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general, said that while the 15-year push to meet the eight goals  on poverty , education , gender equality , child mortality , maternal health , disease , the environment and global partnership  had yielded some astonishing results, it had left too many people behind.
MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet, he said.
Yet for all the remarkable gains, I am keenly aware that inequalities persist and that progress has been uneven.
While the world has reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed.
Between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of undernourished people fell from 23.3% to 12.9%. Current estimates suggest around 795 million people are undernourished  the overwhelming majority of them in developing regions. Progress has been hindered by higher food and energy prices, extreme weather, natural disasters, political instability, humanitarian crises and the economic recession of the late 1990s and in 2008-2009.
Ban noted that in 2011, nearly 60% of the worlds extremely poor people lived in five countries  India, Nigeria, China, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo  and that familiar divisions and inequities were as stark as ever.
Too many women continue to die during pregnancy or from childbirth-related complications, he said. Progress tends to bypass women and those who are lowest on the economic ladder or are disadvantaged because of their age, disability or ethnicity. Disparities between rural and urban areas remain pronounced.
MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education
Progress on education has been mixed: the goal of achieving universal primary education has also just been missed, with the net enrolment rate rising from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year. The literacy rate for those aged 15 to 24 showed an identical rise, while the number of out-of-school children fell from 100 million 15 years ago to 57 million today.
Despite having to contend with a rising population, high levels of poverty and armed conflicts, sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment of all the developing regions, with its rate growing from 52% in 1990 to 78% in 2012.
Related: Sustainable development goals will be hard sell for United Nations
The push for gender equality and to empower women has led to about two-thirds of developing countries achieving gender parity in primary education  underlining the fact that the aspiration of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education has not been met.
When it comes to employment outside the agricultural sector, women now constitute 41% of paid workers, up from 35% in 1990. Although the proportion of women in parliament has nearly doubled over the past 20 years, only one in every five seats is held by a woman. Efforts to narrow the gender divide continue to be stymied by discrimination in law and practice, violence against women and girls, unequal employment opportunities and unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work.
While the child mortality rate has declined by more than half over the past 25 years  falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births  it has not declined by the MDG aim of two-thirds. Vaccination helped to prevent nearly 15.6m deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013, but that progress has slowed since 2010, with an estimated 21.6 million infants not receiving the vaccine in 2013. The biggest preventable causes of death for children under five are pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, which between them claim 16,000 lives a day.
MDG 4: Reduce child mortality
The aspiration of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters has not been realised, with the ratio falling by nearly half (from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births to 210). Today, only half of pregnant women in developing regions receive the recommended minimum of four antenatal visits, and a quarter of babies worldwide are delivered without skilled care. Postpartum haemorrhage accounted for 27% of maternal deaths in developing regions between 2003 and 2009; other major complications were high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery and unsafe abortion.
Progress on combating HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases has also varied. The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013, from 3.5 million cases to 2.1 million. The fight is being hindered by risky sexual behaviour and a lack of basic knowledge about HIV among young people in many countries.
The target of halting and reversing the incidence of malaria has been achieved thanks to a tenfold increase in international financing since 2000 and sustained malaria prevention and treatment initiatives. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying, diagnostic testing and the use of effective drugs have helped prevent more than 6.2m deaths from the disease between 2000 and 2015. The global malaria incidence rate has fallen by more than a third and the mortality rate by more than half. Significant progress has been made in the fight against tuberculosis: improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment saved an estimated 37m lives between 2000 and 2013.
The push for environmental sustainability has brought some 2.6 billion people access to improved drinking water since 1990, meaning that the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010  five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million are still without improved drinking water.
MDG 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Efforts on sanitation have fared far less well: 2.1 billion people have gained access to improved sanitation (a toilet that hygienically separates faeces from human contact) since 1990, leaving the target of halving the number of people without access to basic sanitation short by nearly 700 million people.
Some 2.4 billion people in developing countries  a third of humanity  still lack access to improved sanitation facilities, while 946 million people still practise open defecation.
The differences between rural and urban areas are often considerable. While four out of five people in urban areas have access to piped drinking water, the figure for those in rural areas is just one in three. Nearly half of those in rural areas lack access to improved sanitation facilities compared with less than a fifth of those in urban areas.
Moves to improve the way the world works together on development have been aided by an increase in the amount of official development assistance (ODA) that rich countries give to developing nations. Between 2000 and 2014, ODA increased by 66% in real terms and hit a record high of $134.8bn (80.3bn) in 2013 .
Ban said that lessons had to be learned from the MDGs as the world prepares to agree their successors, the sustainable development goals , which will set the agenda for the next 15 years.
We need to tackle root causes and do more to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, he said.
Reflecting on the MDGs and looking ahead to the next 15 years, there is no question that we can deliver on our shared responsibility to end poverty, leave no one behind and create a world of dignity for all.

The new Ebola outbreak in Liberia last week was not unexpected, and more like it may occur, according to the UN special envoy on Ebola, Dr David Nabarro.
The 17-year-old whose death signalled the outbreak in Liberia may have come into contact with an infected animal or picked up the virus from a person in whom it had lingered beyond the 21-day quarantine period, experts believe.

Two more people from the teenagers village have fallen ill since the boys death last Sunday, but although the new cases have dismayed the government, population and health experts, Nabarro said that because of the large amount of virus that has been in circulation, this could be the pattern for some time to come.
Were still pretty confident it is going to end, in a period which is not unreasonable, but I dont think the end will necessarily be the end. There will be subsequent mini flare-ups occurring all over the place, he said.
How the teenager became infected is the subject of rumour and speculation, because he is not thought to have come into contact with anybody from Sierra Leone or Guinea, where there are still cases.
But, said Nabarro, there has been an awful lot of virus around. Some of it may have gone back into the animal kingdom. That could mean the virus occurring in animals in locations where there was none in the past, increasing the chances of disease if people eat or are in physical contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats.
This epidemic has also shown that the virus can linger beyond the 21-day quarantine period in the prostate in men and in the eyes in both men and women, he said. It has been found in amniotic fluid and in the foetuses of women who were pregnant when they became infected with Ebola but survived.
We dont know yet whether they are an undetected chain of transmission, because Margibi [the county where the cases occurred] was one of the last parts of Liberia to be declared Ebola-free, or whether they are the result of some kind of perpetuation of the virus, survivors that we hadnt known about, or whether they represent a brand-new arrival of the virus from outside the human race  a new Ebola appearance  and that answer will not be known for some time, Nabarro said.
Examination of past Ebola outbreaks since the disease was first identified four decades ago shows a 50% probability of isolated mini outbreaks within a year after the main one has been declared over, he said. While there is not absolute clarity on this, it appeared that the reasons were perpetuation of the virus in survivors or re-introduction from animals which may have picked it up from infected humans.
Nabarro praised the calm and confident Liberian response to the new cases, as well as the handling of the continuing epidemic in the other affected countries. The communities in Sierra Leone and Guinea where there are still cases now need to be approached with great sensitivity, said Nabarro.
These are communities that want to be left alone, with their cultural values and traditions undisturbed, he said. It was important to focus on individual households in a quiet and non-aggressive way and listen to them. People are very, very scared, he said. They are scared they are going to get into trouble with the authorities but they are scared that they will get into trouble with the spiritual world if they dont do their burials right. It needs a very sensitive response.
Nabarro was speaking before a major UN conference aimed at encouraging donations to help the three hard-hit west African countries recover from the damage of the epidemic.
At the secretary generals international conference on early recovery, which begins on Friday in New York, donors are expected to offer help with restoring health and education systems, but it is thought likely the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will hope for more assistance to rebuild their economies.

        <title>Make poverty history? A decade on from Gleneagles, it is a genuine possibility | Adrian Lovett</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/make-poverty-history-campaign-gleneagles-sustainable-development-goals</Link>

It is hard to believe that, when world leaders met at Gleneagles 10 years ago on Monday , nobody on the planet had an iPhone, YouTube was preparing to open its first office above a Silicon Valley pizza house, and tweeting was confined to birds. But looking back on that day, when the Make Poverty History campaign reached its climax at the G8 summit, it is clear the world has changed in many more ways.
On 6 July 2005 I was in Edinburgh, preparing to head to Gleneagles to make our case. Days earlier, we had mobilised half a million people at the huge Edinburgh Make Poverty History rally  the largest in Scottish history  and at the Live 8 concerts in London and around the world. Seven million white campaign wristbands had been worn in the UK, and tens of millions more worldwide, challenging leaders to act. The G8s answer included a promise of $48bn (31bn) in new aid  half of it to Africa  and outright debt cancellation for many of the worlds poorest countries.
It wasnt everything the campaign had asked for, and it hasnt all been plain sailing since. Shamefully, some of the richest countries have reneged on the promises they made that day. But the deal done at Gleneagles, unlike the faded Nokia 3310 I clutched back then, has looked better with the passing of time. Those who kept their word, along with strong political leadership from within Africa itself, have helped transform the world since.
Related: What can G7's dwindling anti-poverty protesters learn from climate activists?
The change becomes real when seen up close. A while ago I visited a government health clinic supported by Save the Children in South Wollo, Ethiopia, eight hours drive from the capital. With increased aid and its own resources, the Ethiopian government has been able to extend the treatment of deadly childhood illnesses like diarrhoea and pneumonia, with a new army of equipped and empowered community health workers.
I was shown a meticulously maintained record book listing each patient that came in  mainly children  with names, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. The final column on the ledger was headed outcome; in each row, the entry almost invariably contained a single word: better. The same was true in one clinic after another. Seeing that combination of real, micro-level data with demonstrable success and progress was exhilarating. I wished that every white-band wearer in the world could have stood there too and read that roll call of hope.
Perhaps the most profound change is in the perceived achievability of Make Poverty Historys mission. In 2005, despite Nelson Mandelas insistence that extreme poverty could be overcome just like slavery and apartheid, many observers  and even some campaigners  assumed it was an unreachable pipedream.
Related: Financing the sustainable development goals  podcast
Ten years on, that aim of ensuring that nobody should live in absolute poverty by 2030 is set to be enshrined in the sustainable development goals , which will be signed by world leaders at the UN this September. The campaign slogan has become the first item on the worlds to-do list. And the reason for that new sense of possibility? Were halfway there.
The extreme poverty figure has dropped from 43% of the worlds people in 1990 to 21% in 2010 . And its continuing to fall. The virtual elimination of extreme poverty in the next 15 years wont be easy  in fact, it will be an increasingly hard slog. But nobody now says it cannot be done. The question is whether we will choose to do it.
Policymakers need to start to answer that question this month when they gather for the financing for development summit due to be held, neatly, in Addis Ababa  capital city of the country that became a byword for famine 30 years ago and is now at the frontline of the data-driven fight to end hunger and extreme poverty for good.
If the map of poverty and development has transformed in 10 years, the way we run campaigns has changed almost as much  and thats a change for the better, too. Networks like Avaaz and change.org , unheard of in 2005, have harnessed internet and social media platforms to put power in peoples hands and turn leadership pyramids upside down.
A growing movement of global citizens is forming. And that movement is more authentic and representative than ever, no longer directed from Washington, New York or London. One s membership of nearly 7 million people includes 2 million from Africa. After watching 250 One youth ambassadors from across Europe and beyond, who came (with some very big balloons) to southern Germany for last months G7 summit , I know we are in great shape for the fight ahead. These are smart, savvy, passionate advocates who know their facts. They also know that facts are nothing without activism  and activism means little unless we take it to where decisions are made, get them changed, and hold decision-makers accountable.
Not so different from Make Poverty History perhaps, at its best. But  I hope  more global, more sustainable and more empowering. Oh, and now we can tweet about it too.

        <MainBody>Financing for Development
In global healthcare, quality and access are what matters  not who delivers it
In fragile states, private sector healthcare is vital in plugging the gaps in public services. We need to engage with it  like it or not, it may be the only option

When the UN financing for development conference begins in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, theres likely to be a big elephant in the room: the private sector.
Some commentators have warned of the possible implications of pursuing ultra-free market ideologies that see private companies as key providers of basic public services. Ignoring the private sector rather than working with it would seem like the most morally defensible approach when faced with the prospect of large corporations selling health and education services with the sole objective of turning a profit.
Related: Health sustainable development goal must tackle inequity head on to succeed
Sometimes, though  whether we like it or not  the private sector might be our only option. Take fragile and conflict-affected states: the World Bank estimates that more than 1.2 billion people live in countries affected by widespread conflict and political unrest. The UK Department for International Development and other donors have flagged these countries as a priority category.
Given their vulnerability, fragile and conflict-affected states simply do not have access to the large amounts of state expenditure needed to provide widespread coverage of basic services. World Health Organisation data from 2013 shows that in Afghanistan, government expenditure on health amounted to just 21% of total health expenditure (compared with 84% in the UK).
Donors are also unlikely to commit to long-term aid funding where they cant easily link this expenditure to immediate, tangible outcomes  an unrealistic expectation in fragile states where, by definition, the focus needs to be on long-term systemic change.
In these contexts, it is hardly surprising that privately run services step in to plug the gap. In Somalia, despite the population having one of the lowest rates of GDP per capita in the world , the private sector delivers more than 60% of the countrys healthcare services . In these situations, where the private sector is already a fixture, the question is not how to prevent companies from filling the gap left by ineffective state structures, but rather how to work with these companies to ensure the gap-filling is good enough to promote positive, lasting impact.
Related: Financing the sustainable development goals  podcast
There are some fundamental areas that need addressing.
First, a lack of regulatory frameworks and inspection procedures can result in huge negative social and economic consequences. Our work , investigating private healthcare provision in Somalia, highlighted some disturbing results: the proliferation and sale of unregulated and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical products not only puts patients at risk but is also likely to lead to a greater burden on public health services when remedial treatments are needed further down the line.
Poor market oversight can also make life difficult for businesses trying to tailor their products and services to appropriate customer bases. In Somalia, the unfettered boom in hospitals and smaller clinics has made it difficult for enterprises to differentiate themselves, resulting in negative competition that benefits neither the business nor the customer.
The public sector has a key role to play in addressing these issues, helping to ensure the introduction and enforcement of minimum standards and accreditations. This will necessitate meaningful collaboration between the sectors  working with, rather than against, private enterprises. In some cases, NGOs are stepping in to fill the void. In Somaliland, PSI s network of recognisable BulshoKaab Pharmacies is a good example of a successful attempt to give credibility to quality services in an ever-expanding marketplace.
In Somaliland and Puntland, we are seeing the emergence of informal referral systems whereby the private sector sends emergency cases to the public sector, and public sector facilities pass on cases requiring specialist skills and equipment to their private sector counterparts. We found a general desire among health workers to formalise these relationships to help improve basic efficiencies  for example, by establishing systems allowing data on the availability of beds to be shared.
In critically vulnerable environments, it is clearly important that we work with what is already in place to support the delivery of basic services. Private sector facilities spring up to plug the gap left behind by weak public institutions and a lack of capacity and funding. Their continued existence is testament to the demand for them. While this might not be to everyones ideological taste, it is sometimes the reality on the ground. In fragile and conflict-affected states, it is often the only reality.
The public sector has an important role to play in promoting the regulation and oversight of these services, ensuring they are really working for the customers they aim  and claim  to serve. Sustainable development goal 17 talks of engaging with the private sector to help strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development.
It is time to catch up with private service providers to ensure this engagement is truly sustainable. What should matter is quality and access. Not who delivers it.

The gangland murder of four youths in a notorious slum in the south of Buenos Aires came as little surprise to residents. The victims of last Aprils attack had each been shot in the head by hitmen amid an ongoing turf war between rival gangs.
Known as  villas miserias   literally, slums of misery  the sprawls of redbrick shacks that punctuate the Parisian-style architecture of the Argentinian capital have become synonymous with violence.
These marginal neighbourhoods have little or no state presence to oppose the growing influence of drug cartels. Despite often being located in urban centres, most residents do not have access to mains electricity, running water or sewers.
In 2013, the NGO Techo identified 1,834 of these informal settlements across Argentina, saying they were home to 500,000 families. In Buenos Aires alone, the number of people living in villas miserias grew by about 50% between 2001 and 2010.
These fringe communities have become the focal point of the fight against poverty in the South American country, with investment from the government and NGOs focused on providing basic services and integrating them into wider society.
After Argentinas devastating debt default in 2001/2, a boom in social security spending did much to sustain high growth rates. But the success of these social programmes has been threatened by another default and an inflation-inducing currency devaluation last year.
This bleak picture seems to sound a false note given the governments claims that Argentina has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world.
At a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation summit in Rome in June, President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner said the poverty rate was now lower than 5%, compared with a crippling 54% in 2003.
When Anbal Fernndez, head of the Argentine cabinet, was later asked on national radio if the country had truly achieved a poverty rate lower than, say, Norway, Denmark and Germany, he replied: Yes, although you might not like it and it is difficult for you to accept. Countries like Germany are having a difficult time with poverty.
Even discounting the fact that poverty rates in Germany and other European countries are based on different calculations, the validity of figures published by Argentinas Indec statistics agency has long been challenged.
In terms of fiddling the figures, the [Fernndez presidency] has considerable form  from cooking the books on inflation, to massaging growth data and  fudging poverty data, said Colin M Lewis, professor emeritus and Argentina expert at the London School of Economics .
A regime that presents itself as a champion of the poor has even more reason than most for making exaggerated claims about poverty reduction, particularly as inflation accelerates and a decline in the rate of inequality appears to be stalling, he added.

It is widely acknowledged that Indec has long published an artificially low consumer price index (CPI). Private economists estimate inflation at more than 25% , while the government has said it is about 15%.
But despite evidence of creative accounting, there has also been real progress in tackling poverty, some analysts say.
The reason why the president has high approval ratings of around 50% is that many people have seen their living standards rise  unemployment is low and average wages have risen faster than prices during her tenure, even when you use the estimates of inflation favoured by the opposition, said Paul Segal, a senior economics lecturer at Kings College London .
Argentina measures its poverty rate by calculating the number of people who cannot afford a basic basket of goods and services, such as education and housing. This basket is directly linked to the CPI, which statisticians say can lead to abuse.
If inflation is high, the basket value increases, and therefore poverty increases. This is politically inexpedient for a president whose election, and continued popularity, is partially grounded in a promise to reduce poverty, said Christopher Wylde, associate professor of international relations at Richmond, the American International University in London .
Manipulating the official inflation rate serves a wider set of priorities, and its impact on poverty data could be interpreted as somewhat tangential. These wider priorities include: lower repayments on inflation-indexed bonds, better gross domestic product data  the impact on the real effective exchange rate and the concomitant impact on balance of payments through the trade channel, and a better bargaining position with unions, who use inflation data to negotiate pay increases, Wylde said.
An independent study by the Universidad Catlica Argentina , released in April last year and using more realistic CPI data, reported a poverty rate of roughly 26% in 2013.
Away from the rarefied air of pure statistics, in the low shacks of the villas miserias, people echo the charges of official exaggeration and manipulation, grounding their anger in daily deprivations.
In our neighbourhoods, entire families are homeless and theres no drinkable water. Where is this reduction in poverty? said Viviana, an NGO advocate who works in a slum in the gentrified barrio of Retiro in Buenos Aires. She did not want to give her last name for fear of harassment by the authorities.
Its a joke that the president would announce that [poverty rate] to the world. That number, so untenable to the Argentine eye, is something shed never say to the people who live in las villas miserias. Thats only something she could have said in Rome.
Indec has agreed to reform its methodology on measuring inflation and poverty but, given that no fresh data on poverty has been published since December 2013, it seems unlikely anything will change before legislative and presidential elections in October. Fernndez, whose Front for Victory party has held power since 2003, is barred from standing for a third consecutive term .
With persistent economic instability, fears about the prevalence of drug cartels and a creeping fiscal deficit , the ghosts of 2001 haunt every Argentine politician.

Yemen's humanitarian crisis leaves a million people in dire straits  in pictures
The UN has declared its highest-level humanitarian emergency in Yemen, where months of fighting and a blockade by a Saudi-led coalition have left about 80% of the population in need of aid. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has called for a pause in hostilities until the end of Ramadan so that assistance can be delivered. But a senior UN official warns the country is one step from famine

She has not been able to pay rent for two months, and can hardly afford cooking gas and transport. Her husband used to work as a cleaner in a hospital but was dismissed three months ago.
I am stuck here, she says. If I could go back to Ethiopia I would, but I would get killed as we fled for political reasons  I get very afraid with the constant shelling. The children are afraid. But what can we do?

On Wednesday, a Saudi Arabian billionaire, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, announced he would donate his $32bn (20bn) fortune to charity over the coming years . The decision, he said, had been motivated by his life-long commitment to helping to build a more peaceful, equitable and sustainable world for generations to come.
If the money were split equally among the eight programmes the prince suggested  with $4bn going to each  what might it achieve? Here are some of the options.
Modernisation and infrastructure
The full $32bn, meanwhile, could take energy supplies to more than half the places off the grid in Africa (source: Overseas Development Institute ).
Poverty alleviation
A $4bn windfall would go about 80% of the way to ensuring every person in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  one of the poorest countries on the planet  has access to basic services such as health and education (source: ONE campaign ).
The same sum would cover the funding gap for essential health and education services for everyone in Tanzania , Zambia and Liberia (source: ONE campaign).
Disaster relief
$4bn would cover the total bill to help the Syrian refugees who have fled to nearby countries , providing essentials like clean water, adequate shelter and food assistance (source: Oxfam ).
A $4bn injection would fully fund roughly 20% of the current worldwide humanitarian needs. Or, more specifically, it would just about cover the gap in funding for the entire Syrian regional refugee response and the funding gap on South Sudan combined (source: Care International).
The same sum would almost cover the funding gap for 12 other ongoing humanitarian crises around the world (source: Care International).
Education and empowering children
With support worth $4bn, the 58 million children left behind by the millennium development goal on education would be able to go to primary school (source: Care International ).
Just $500,000 could enable 1,000 schools in Pakistan to use the latest technology to plan, prepare and manage against the risk of attacks, enabling children to attend school more safely. The sum would cover the creation of school safety strategies using analytical software, and working with communities to implement them (source: Unicef ).
A $1,000,000 investment would enable 10,000 nomadic children in Eritrea to go to school. This could include establishing new nomadic learning centres, expanding existing ones, and training teachers to enable the most marginalised children to access their right to a quality education for the long term (source: Unicef).
$3.2bn would feed the 66 million school-aged children who go hungry . Being well-nourished would give poorer children a far greater chance of getting an education and bringing themselves out of poverty through better paid work (source: Oxfam ).
Promotion of health
For $4bn, more than 12 million people could be provided with antiretroviral drugs  more than the total number of people living with HIV/Aids across the least developed countries. Alternatively, the money would pay for 190 million children to be fully vaccinated, saving more than 6 million lives (source: One campaign).
Spending $4bn on water and sanitation services would also go a long way to relieving a health crisis that kills 1,400 children every day (source: WaterAid ).
A $4bn investment would also build 666m basic pit latrines, or 111m improved latrines  which include a ventilation pipe and mesh to reduce odours  to serve 555 million people (source: WaterAid).
With $4bn, it would also be possible to reach as many as 167 million of the 179 million people living in the 17 countries worst off for access to clean water. Assuming there were no other obstacles, that means every person who right now lives without water in Angola , Chad , DRC, Guinea , Eritrea, Ethiopia , Haiti , Madagascar , Mauritania , Mozambique , Niger , Tanzania and Papua New Guinea (source: WaterAid).
Empowering women
Given that the median income of womens rights organisations worldwide is $20,000 a year, $4bn would fund 10,000 womens rights organisations for 20 years (source: Mama Cash ).

The slow unfolding of the sustainable development goals continued last month with the unveiling of the zero draft that will be negotiated in the runup to the summit in New York in September.
How does the draft of 17 goals look from the perspective of an organisation dedicated to helping countries to strengthen democracy? The answer is not bad, but not good.
Related: Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption
On the plus side, it is good that there is a goal 16 at all. The draft goal reads: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
There was no equivalent in the millennium development goals (MDGs), and it is welcome that goal 16 includes a target of ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.
I like all those words, which embody a commendable set of ambitions. The target of effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels is a good transposition of text from the UN high-level panel report on the post-2015 development agenda co-chaired by the presidents of Liberia and Indonesia and the British prime minister, which included all three adjectives.
On the minus side, there are two main gaps.
First, the word democracy itself has not been used, nor any variant such as democratic accountability. That is disappointing but not surprising, even though the Millennium Declaration , which formed the basis of the MDGs, did make specific calls for these conditions to be included.
Perhaps the word democracy is less popular than 15 years ago and it was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics
My guess is that the word democracy, perhaps less popular now than it was 15 years ago, was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics.
The second gap is the failure to address the key instruments of representative democracy, namely parliaments or political parties. Again, this is disappointing but not surprising. There is a presumption in the text that the executive are the main actors, rather than the representatives of citizens. Indeed, the high-level panel called for someone (implicitly governments) to grant rights (such as freedom of speech) to people, rather than for people to act to curb the powers of the executive.
So what should be the response of those interested in strengthening democracy? We need to do two things.
First, we should demystify democracy. Democracy is not a western plot, it is a universal value. Virtually all countries have aspects of democratic culture in place to some degree, and absolutely every country has room to strengthen the quality of their democracy.
I would like to build common ground about the aspects of democracy that are important regardless of region or political grouping. That would make work on achieving the targets in goal 16 much more useful.
Related: Nigeria's free and fair elections are an inspiration for nascent democracies | Kofi Annan
Second, the Millennium Declaration is still relevant when it says that we should work collectively for more inclusive political processes, allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all our countries. We should rebalance our thinking about national responsibilities, taking up that challenge of putting people and their representatives first. This links back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The central task of the declaration, and of the Magna Carta for that matter, was to curb the power of the executive  which, unchecked, tends to be abused.
In the vast majority of countries, we should look at the role of parliaments, the judiciary, civil society and the media, as well as the executive, when considering how to secure objectives encapsulated in goal 16.
A report by Civicus called for new forms of representation and oversight, such as citizens panels. Institutions should be tested on their ability to respond to and achieve progress on issues identified by people rather than just governments, it added.
The sentiment certainly reflects the level of concern many people feel about traditional representative institutions. Building common ground on what democracy means, and helping to improve the quality of representation in our countries, go hand in hand and are both worth pursuing.
Goal 16 is imperfect and is almost at the bottom of the list of proposed SDGs. But the glass is half full. Politics and the development community have been uncomfortable partners in many ways, and this is a chance to work together to help political systems do a better job. If we succeed, then we will have fulfilled the promise of the Millennium Declaration  citizens of all countries working together to put sustainable development at the centre of the agenda and hold governments to account for their actions.

Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, the founder of Brac , the largest non-governmental organisation on the planet, has been awarded the 2015 World Food prize for his unparalleled work on reducing poverty in Bangladesh and 10 other countries.
Abed established Brac  formerly known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee  in 1972 as a relief operation to help the country recover from its war of independence with Pakistan and the destruction wrought by a tropical cyclone.
The organisations focus soon switched to finding new ways to tackle poverty and empower women socially and economically, and it is estimated to have brought nearly 150 million people out of poverty since its foundation.
Today, it has a staff of 110,000 and works in 11 countries: Bangladesh, Afghanistan , Pakistan , the Philippines , Sri Lanka , Liberia , Sierra Leone , South Sudan , Tanzania , Uganda and Haiti .
Dr MS Swaminathan, chair of the World Food prize selection committee and the first World Food prize laureate in 1987, described Abed as a strategic thinker, and a man with a future vision. He also praised the NGO for its constant innovation and bold use of funding.
It's a great satisfaction for us to to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years
Fazle Hasan Abed
While funding was important, Abed realised that the organisation needed some internal financial resources in order to steer its course, rather than become diverted by donor agendas, he said.
He therefore set up a considerable number of commercial enterprises as part of the Brac brand. These include printing presses, manufacturing industries, a hotel, conference facilities, retail outlets and the private Brac University, among others. Surpluses from these enterprises go into supporting Bracs development programmes.
Abed, who was knighted by the Queen in 2010, described the award as a tremendous honour, adding: Im sure this will be a great joy for our staff and energise them even more. Its a great satisfaction for us to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years.
He said he was particularly proud of Bracs work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s, which saw the number of deaths halved over a decade.
Brac's work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s saw the number of deaths halved over a decade
We went to every household in Bangladesh teaching mothers how to make oral rehydration fluid at home to combat diarrhoeal deaths, he said. That also made it possible for Brac to become a very large organisation very quickly and to expand our programmes throughout the country.
Equally productive, he said, had been Bracs push to raise the rates of child immunisation in the last few years of the same decade. Between 1986 and 1990, the proportion of immunised Bangladeshi children rose from 2% to 70% . In the areas where Brac works, he added, the immunisation rate is now at 95%.
Abed said that although Bracs approach is multifaceted, it was founded on a simple principle.
We have worked on many different aspects of poverty: mortality reduction; maternal mortality and health; family planning; financial services for women; womens empowerment; agriculture, and all kinds of livelihoods for poor people so that they could come out of extreme poverty and malnutrition, he said.
Everything we did in Bangladesh we did with one focus: getting poor people out of poverty because we feel that poverty is dehumanising.
With the world preparing to adopt the sustainable development goals  which will replace the millennium development goals and set the global development agenda for the next 15 years  Abed called for a renewed focus on eliminating extreme poverty.
He said that Bracs work with the poorest 8% of Bangladeshis had shown that even the ultra-poor could be reached if sufficient resources and commitment were available. Bracs two-year programme, designed to help those who are too poor for microfinance loans, involves using grants, monthly stipends and health services to support families while they learn about making money and household budgeting.
The programme has since been rolled out in several countries  Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Honduras and Peru where it has also proved successful.
Taking people out of extreme poverty can be done but you need the commitment to do it in every country throughout the world, said Abed.
Thats the problem  do we have the commitment in every country to take the extreme poor out of their misery? Do we have good governance in every country? There are many factors that affect development and hopefully these will also be part of the sustainable development goals: good governance and the eradication of corruption from societies.

Girls' education will only make the grade when intuition gives way to information
With education increasingly in the global spotlight, research must be undertaken to pinpoint the factors that cause girls to struggle or drop out

Schools have the potential to transform girls lives, unlocking the door to future opportunities, better health and greater autonomy. But in many places, schooling falls short of that aspiration.
In May, global educators gathered at the World Education Forum in Korea to agree on a post-2015 global education agenda. In June, the US first lady Michelle Obama visited the UK to help launch a UK/US partnership that will invest nearly $200m (128m) in supporting girls education in countries affected by conflict, starting with the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Next week, global educators will gather again, this time in Norway at the Oslo summit on education for development . There, they will work to strengthen and renew political commitments on education and improving learning outcomes for children worldwide.
And in September, world leaders will gather at the UN general assembly in New York to adopt the sustainable development goals , which will replace the millennium development goals and shape the international development agenda until 2030.
Given this growing momentum, now is clearly the time to ensure global organisations are committed to using rigorous evidence to improve education.
Girls face more barriers to learning than boys, particularly around the time of puberty . Understanding the relationship between events in girls lives and their ability to succeed in school will be key to achieving not only the post-2015 education goals but arguably the other development goals as well.
Over the past 25 years, access to school has increased dramatically. The gender gap has narrowed. More girls than ever are in school, and they are staying in school longer. Even in the developing world, adolescent girls are more likely to be in school than out of school. We need to celebrate that success.
But as girls stay in education longer, the challenges they face outside school have the potential to disrupt their education. Factors including early pregnancy , sexually transmitted infections, child marriage and sexual and gender-based violence all pose challenges. Many girls are grappling with these issues today  and those in the education sector need to know how to respond.
For decades, the Population Council and others have been studying disparities in education  disparities between girls and boys, between the poorest and most vulnerable populations and those who are better off. We have looked at what works in girls education, and analysed what girls need to complete primary school, and to gain access to a high-quality, safe secondary school where they can complete their education. We have looked at how to ensure girls learn in school and go on to become healthy, productive adults.
One thing we have noticed is just how difficult it is to pinpoint what causes girls to struggle in school or to drop out during adolescence. So many life changes happen during this time. A lot can depend on where a girl lives, how she is doing in school, and what pressures her family is facing.
But while it is difficult to tease out the exact reasons girls leave school, its crucial that we do try, because the causes determine the solutions. Pregnancy and early marriage are not necessarily the only issues. We must look deeper at which girls are most likely to become pregnant, get married or leave school prematurely. For example, if a girls family is poor and unable or unwilling to pay school fees, she may not have the support she needs to continue her education. Her parents may decide marriage is a better option for her future security.
In 2009, we conducted a review of more than 300 adolescent girls education programmes from around the world. The study revealed that the majority of these programmes were not based on evidence and were not evaluated to demonstrate whether or not they were achieving their goals.
Of the 11 most common programme interventions for adolescent girls, only two having female teachers and providing financial help  had been proven to be effective.
Too often, the scarce resources invested in girls education are going to programmes that lack evidence-based proof of success. These programmes are not being rigorously evaluated to see if they help girls stay in school longer, retain skills, and live healthy, productive lives.
To reap the benefits for girls and societies, we need evidence, not just intuition, to guide our efforts. Donors and policymakers must commit to using evidence  about the problem and what works to address it  when developing policies and deciding on funding.
Donors and implementing organisations should hold themselves to high standards: let no programme be implemented or funded without a solid base of evidence behind it, or a significant commitment to evaluation within it.
As world leaders put the final touches to the post-2015 education goals, a commitment to rigorous evidence must be a top priority. We are heartened by the new US/UK investment in education, because the agreement includes a welcome commitment of 10m from the UK to build the evidence base around adolescent girls education. We encourage others to follow this example.

The millennium development goals have driven the most successful anti-poverty movement in history , the UN said in its final report before the targets expire. While the MDGs have ended extreme poverty for more than a billion people since they began in 2000, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon warned that inequalities persist and progress has been uneven.
The EU must plan 25 years ahead in its strategy for dealing with surging numbers of refugees and migrants , warned Franois Crpeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. Crpeau said increasing aid spending to help stabilise turbulent countries would not immediately help stem the flow of migrants and refugees.

Opinion
The sustainable development goals may not mention democracy, but their focus on the accountability of political institutions will be key to improved governance , argues Anthony Smith, chief executive of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy .

On the piece, Democracy is not a mystifying western plot  it is a universal value , MartinMellish wrote:
I live in China. Its not a democracy, and most people have no particularly strong desire that it should be one. The present system of government is working well for them, the economy is still growing at an extraordinary rate. Peoples lives are better than their parents, and far better than their grandparents. That is what is important to them. Should the economy go South, then I imagine there might be a revived interest in democracy, but that would be as a means to an end (prosperity) rather than as a goal in itself.
So - no, democracy is not a universal value, and it is highly dangerous to treat it as such. Trying to impose democracy on people who have no desire for it leads to chaos, bloodshed, and racial and ethnic strife, as many recent examples (Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Libya) unfortunately prove.

The millennium development goals have targeted eight key areas  poverty , education , gender equality , child mortality , maternal health , disease , the environment and global partnership . Each goal is supported by 21 specific targets and more than 60 indicators. Below, weve looked at what has been achieved on some of the targets within each goal.
MDG 1: The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day has been reduced from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, although the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed.
MDG 2: Primary school enrolment figures have shown an impressive rise, but the goal of achieving universal primary education has just been missed, with the net enrolment rate increasing from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year.
MDG 3: About two-thirds of developing countries have achieved gender parity in primary education.
MDG 4: The child mortality rate has reduced by more than half over the past 25 years  falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births  but it has failed to meet the MDG target of a drop of two-thirds.
MDG 5: The global maternal mortality ratio has fallen by nearly half  short of the two-thirds reduction the MDGs aimed for.
MDG 6: The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013.
MDG 7: Some 2.6 billion people have gained access to improved drinking water since 1990, so the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010  five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million people across the world still do not have access to improved drinking water.
MDG 8: Between 2000 and 2014, overseas development assistance from rich nations to developing countries increased by 66% in real terms, and in 2013 reached the record figure of $134.8bn (80.3bn).

        <title>Greek referendum: smart response from Tsipras, but triumph may be brief</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/greek-referendum-alexis-tsipras-moment-triumph-may-be-brief</Link>
        <Description/>

Alexis Tsiprass response to the Greek referendum was smart. A dumber politician might have been tempted to turn up the volume following the thumping victory for the no side in the referendum. But instead of striking macho poses, the Greek prime minister was emollient. He said Greece wanted to resume talks with its creditors, and backed up his words by getting rid of his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who relished being a figure of hate in Brussels.
Emollient and realistic, because, without question, Tsipras is in an uncomfortable position. The Greek economy is even closer to seizing up than it was before Sundays vote. The banks remain shut and it looks as if the cashpoints will run out of cash within the next 48 hours. Even if a deal is done in the next few days, Greece is in the early stages of another deep and painful recession.
All that said, Tsipras is better placed than he might have feared in the middle of last week, when it looked possible that the gamble of holding a referendum would blow up in his face.
Winning the vote decisively has refreshed the anti-austerity mandate he got from the Greek people at the general election in January. Far from securing the regime change they were seeking, the creditors now find that Syriza is being supported by all Greek political parties apart from the communists and the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn. By demonstrating that he wants to reopen negotiations, he has put the onus on Greeces 18 single-currency partners to respond.
Abrupt changes of tack have been a feature of the way Tsipras has behaved in the past five months. David Marsh, of the thinktank OMFIF, said: The failure of the creditor countries, led by Germany and the Netherlands, to recognise a central maxim of guerrilla fighting  the enemy will always surprise  provides a key reason for the Oxi win. If youre outnumbered, practise the unorthodox. Tearing up the rules of Brussels conduct, Tspiras and Varoufakis, his finance minister-cum-field marshal, have outmanoeuvred and divided the surplus states by constantly re-engaging, over five months, from unexpected, demanding and outrageous battle positions.
It is, of course, possible that Tsipras has overplayed his hand. Rebuilding trust with the other eurozone members may require a lot more than simply removing Varoufakis, such is the ill-feeling towards Greece. Marsh, for one, thinks Tsiprass moment of triumph will be brief.
The fruits of victory will turn sour, Marsh said. Varoufakiss decision to resign from the finance ministry  saying he will wear the creditors loathing with pride  seems sensible. Creditors and debtors alike will be punished. Greece faces a wrenching period of infighting and pain, during which devaluation-stamped banknotes, rationing of high street goods and exchange controls enforced by armed police will be only the least of the ills.
There are now only three outcomes from the crisis: Greece stays in the euro on slightly more advantageous terms that were on offer before the referendum; Greece and the troika stitch up a short-term funding deal in the hope that a lasting solution to the crisis can be found later; or the creditors reject the olive branch held out by Tsipras and force Greece out of the euro.
If it is the first, Tsipras will be seen as a hero in Greece. If it is the second, he will be able to say he forced the troika to blink first. If it is the third, he can say he did everything in his power to avoid a return to the drachma, but was left with no choice due to creditor intransigence.

Value of Taser use remains uncertain amid lack of transparency
Home Office says stun guns are important tactical option but lack of data over use of potentially lethal weapon worries rights campaigners

At the last count 33 people a week were shot with Taser stun guns in England and Wales. Children as young as 14 and pensioners as old as 82 were among those to feel the shock of the Metropolitan polices X26 Tasers last year.
According to one former police weapons expert the overwhelming pain of the pulsing charge from the device, which hooks into your flesh, floods every area of your consciousness.
But as the use of Tasers steadily grows, opinions about their value remain dramatically divided. The Home Office describes them as an important tactical option to help specially trained police officers resolve potentially violent situations safely. While Amnesty International says they are a potentially lethal weapon, which should be withdrawn from use by non-specialist firearms officers, many of whom currently carry them.
Related: Police Taser shooting contributed to man's death, jury finds
The inquest into the death of Jordan Begley, who died in Manchester after being hit by a police Taser, is just the latest to have asked whether Tasers kill. The jury concluded it did contribute to the 23-year-olds death in 2013. Between 2004 and 2013, the Independent Police Complaints Commission received 11 referrals about Taser use where someone died. In none of them was the use of a Taser found to have directly caused a death.
Inquests have been carried out into the deaths of Taser targets, Martin Baskeyfield and Andrew Pimlott. Baskeyfield was admitted to hospital days after he was Tasered in Stoke-on-Trent and died three months later. The coroner concluded he died of natural causes and said an investigation determined that the deployment of the Taser did not impact upon [his] death. Pimlott burst into flames after he was hit by a taser in Plymouth having already covered himself in petrol. He appeared to be striking a match to set himself alight and the police officer Tasered him to try to stop him. It sparked a fireball and Pimlott died from severe burns.
Concerns about their use are now being exacerbated by a lack of up-to-date information. The home secretary, Theresa May, has suspended the publication of Taser data after her officials uncovered inaccuracies in the data held on the Home Office Taser database and in the polices own recorded data.
The last national figures are for the first six months of 2014 and show that Tasers were drawn on 5,107 occasions and fired 826 times, but May has ordered an in-depth review of the publication of Taser data and other use of force by police officers, according to a spokesperson, who added: It is vital that its use is appropriate and proportionate, and transparent to the public.
It is expected that the publication of statistics will resume on 9 July and overall Taser use is likely to have increased again. Across England and Wales, Taser use has risen around five-fold since the start of 2009, according to the latest data .
But the recent lack of information over the use of the weapon has worried human rights campaigners. Amnesty International UK said it was concerned about ongoing problems with records about Taser use and transparency.
Amnesty has been calling for a consistent approach to the way Taser use is recorded, said spokesman Niall Couper. The group saidd that without proper records it was impossible to give the British public confidence that Tasers are being used appropriately and only in response to the most serious incidents.
In a report on Taser use (pdf) last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission warned of mission creep and said it was important to ensure that Tasers were not being used inappropriately or as a default choice where other tactical options, including communication, could be effective.
There are big variations in their usage, IPCC data shows . In 2013 police in Staffordshire used Tasers three times more per 100 officers than their counterparts in Lancashire.
The pain of being hit by a Taser is difficult to describe, according to one expert in police use of restraint and pain techniques.
It totally and utterly floods every area of your consciousness, he said, on condition of anonymity.
It really is extreme. I suffered the typical effects of going quite rigid. It is like your muscles contract into one mass. Immediately I could feel myself starting to fall. When the current was switched off, the muscles relaxed again. With the Taser your body is flooded with a painful sensation.
Data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act shows that in London, the police force area where Tasers are most often used, officers drew Tasers 1,934 times in 2014 and fired them 215 times.
Of those stunned, 11 were children, aged under 18. Officers also fired them at two 85-year-olds in 2013 and one 82-year-old in 2014.

With a return to the drachma unwanted, could Greece just print its own euros?

Faced with shuttered banks and ATMs all but drained of cash, but with most of its citizens saying they would rather stay in the eurozone than revert to the drachma, could Greece simply decide to print its own euro notes?
It is certainly physically capable of doing so: the Greek central bank owns a press in Holargos, a suburb of Athens, that once printed drachma and is currently one of 14 high-security currency printing works across the eurozone producing euro banknotes.
But actually going ahead and printing unauthorised notes would amount to a declaration of war on the European Central Bank .
Since the currencys introduction in 2002, all euro banknotes have been produced jointly by the national central banks of the eurozone area according to a strict schedule. According to the ECB, each national bank takes charge of  and pays for  a fixed proportion of the total annual production of one or more denominations of notes, which are then shipped to their destinations as required.
Volumes for the years ahead are set in advance using forecasts provided by each of the national banks combined with a central forecast made by the ECB. The overall number and denominations of notes produced then has to be approved each year by the ECBs governing council, and must be enough to meet expected and unexpected increases in demand and to replace worn notes.
Aside from moral and legal questions that would undoubtedly arise if Greece were to go ahead and print more of its own euros, however, there is another issue that makes this scenario highly unlikely: according to the ECBs website , the Greek press is only set up to print 10 notes. It would need to print tens of billions of those to produce enough money to meet its needs.

'The Greek blokes resigned. Hes run rings round em'
UK analyst predicts Yanis Varoufakiss departure may help in Greek crisis talks but, as the City will admit, no one really knows what will occur next

The Greek blokes resigned. Hes run rings round em.
Those words were how one City trader was overheard explaining the resignation of Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis , as he chatted on the phone in early trading, following the Greek referendum.
It represented what was a brief hum of excitement in the City as the markets opened on Monday morning, for the first time since the Hellenic Republic voted no. Like eurozone officials, the Square Mile had been expecting that last weeks taster of capital controls would spook the country into a yes vote in the countrys austerity referendum, and financial spread-betting firm IG Group last week priced a no vote as having only a 40% chance.
So what now? Monday mornings initial dips in the value of the euro and the worlds stock markets have been swiftly reversed  the euro is now down less than 1% against the dollar, while the FTSE is off by even less  as investors quickly started to buy again in the hope of a deal.
Related: Yanis Varoufakis: Angela Merkel has a red and a yellow button. One ends the crisis. Which does she push?
Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG, said: [Stock markets] opened down but are surging back - much like they did last Monday and much like the euro is doing. The markets are coming back on Varoufakiss resignation - possibly more in hope than expectation, but if you take out the most irritating man in the room then you might get a more reasonable response from Germany and France.
That could happen but, the City will also admit, so could almost anything else. Despite Greece being the worlds biggest financial story since the last time Greece was the worlds biggest financial story, there was surprisingly little activity in the equity markets, where volumes remained stubbornly low. The explanation from the trading floors was that this was because the City doesnt like uncertainty (or turning up for work during the summer), while nobody really seems to know what is going to happen next.
Related: Greek referendum: what happens now after the no vote?
IGs Alastair McCaig added: Ask politicians what is happening with Greece and they say, I dont know. Markets are the same. Greece has surprised at every opportunity. Last week they surprised by calling a referendum. This week they surprised by voting no. They have the propensity to surprise again.
Still, there are some in the City with unequivocal views about how they believe this will all play out  and if you desire a firm prediction, intertwined with multilingual wordplay, then you need some French analysis.
Simon French, that is, the chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, who is heroically eschewing his professions love of fence-sitting and prices the chances of a Grexit at 100%. Or, as the economist drolly puts it, its a feta-ccompli.
