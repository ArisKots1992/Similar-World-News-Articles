Angelique Chrisafis gauges the immediate political reaction in Paris.
The French political class, still reeling from the bloody terrorist attacks on the magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Paris Kosher supermarket nearly six months ago, has for months been engaged in heated debate on surveillance powers and national security.
Both the right and left had been stressing the ongoing terrorist threat and the countrys security services had been on high-alert. Todays attack on the factory in Isre brought immediate political reaction, with all parties stressing France should not give in to fear.
On the right, Alain Jupp, a former prime minister from Nicolas Sarkozys right-wing Les Rpublicains, who is challenging Sarkozy to be 2017 presidential candidate, tweeted The terrorist threat is at maximum. The Isere attacks is alas a reminder. The state must do everything to protect its citizens.
 Alain Jupp (@alainjuppe) June 26, 2015
La menace terroriste est maximum. L'attentat en Isre nous le rappelle hlas! L'Etat doit tout mettre en uvre pour protger ses citoyens.
Sarkozy later issued a statement saying The Republic will never give in to terrorist barbarism.
The Socialist party leader Jean-Christophe Cambadlis tweeted his great emotion after the attack and the way in which it happened. He said Lets stay united, We must not play on fears.
 Jean-Chr. Cambadlis (@jccambadelis) June 26, 2015
Grande motion devant cet attentat et son mode opratoire. Restons unis. Pas d'amalgames. Ne jouons pas sur les peurs. #Isre
The far-right Front National leader Marine Le Pen immediately demanded strong measures to combat islamism.

        <title>Mediterranean migrants: EU leaders agree voluntary intake after heated talks</title>

The national leaders of Europe have engaged in one of their most bitter rows in years over how to respond to the influx of refugees from across the Mediterranean after they scrapped plans for a quota system to share out the resettlement.
The meeting descended into name-calling and recrimination as the leaders fought over a modest scheme to share the intake of 60,000 Syrian and Eritrean asylum seekers between their countries over two years.
A summit that also had to grapple with the Greek debt crisis and the British referendum on whether to stay in the EU was almost entirely consumed until 3am on Friday by the blazing row over a scheme criticised by humanitarian agencies as risibly inadequate for the scale of the problem.
Italy and Lithuania traded barbed insults, while two EU presidents  Donald Tusk, chairing the summit, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European commission  fought for hours over the wording of the summit statement, which could not be agreed.

The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaite, told Matteo Renzi, the prime minister of Italy, which is on the frontline of the refugee crisis, that she had no intention of contributing to any solution. Renzi accused government chiefs of wasting time and was said to reply: If this is your idea of Europe , you can keep it.
Friday mornings Italian newspapers spoke of a savage battle between the two countries.
Juncker emerged bleary eyed shortly after 3am to attack Tusk, saying: I protest against this working method. Its a modest effort, lets be honest.
His proposal for a system of mandatory quotas for countries to take in migrants had come under sustained assault for hours. I dont give a damn, he said.
If there was a conflict between us, it would never be presented as a conflict, he said of the row with Tusk.
Angela Merkel of Germany, which takes in far more asylum seekers than any other country, described the immigration crisis as the biggest challenge I have seen in European affairs in my time as chancellor.
During those 10 years, Merkel has been the key figure in five years of eurozone crisis and is the lead European trying to deal with Russias military partition of Ukraine.
Britain stayed on the sidelines of the dispute since it is not part of the EUs passport-free Schengen zone, has opted out of EU asylum policy and has said it will not take part in the proposed refugee-sharing scheme.
The bad-tempered exchanges are certain to be repeated as EU interior ministers attempt over the next month to agree on how to share out the resettlement of the 60,000 asylum seekers.
Effectively telling Brussels to mind its own business on the politically toxic issue of immigration, the summit buried calls for a more equitable system across the 28 countries.
We have no consensus among member states on mandatory quotas for migrants, Tusk said. It will take much time to build a new European consensus on migration.
Instead of discussing measures for a more organised and equitable system of taking people in, the leaders focused on how to keep people out and deport those who get in.
First and foremost, we need to contain illegal migration and this should be our priority. All those who are not legitimate asylum seekers will have no guarantee that they will stay in Europe, Tusk said.
Faced with an influx of migrants through the Balkans, Hungary has started building a four-metre-high wire fence along its border with Serbia, while Italy is struggling to cope with the the tens of thousands reaching its southern shores after risking their lives in unseaworthy vessels to cross the Mediterranean from Libya.
Of the proposed quota system, a senior EU official said: The idea that Brussels imposes quotas is not going to fly. It will never gather the support of the member states.
But Juncker refused to accept the rejection and fought on for hours. The argument focused on the form of words used to describe the decisions taken by the summit, with Tusk adding the word voluntary to the text and seeking to change the decision-taking basis for the policy from one of majority voting to unanimity, meaning that any country would have a veto on the issue.
The decision to distribute 40,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece and to take in 20,000 Syrians and Eritreans who have fled their countries but not reached the EU was a token gesture to Italy.
The summit defined the 40,000 scheme as temporary and exceptional, to be spread over two years. It will have little impact on the overall numbers, given that more than 600,000 people sought asylum in the EU last year. The figures for new arrivals this year are much higher.
According to the latest figures from Frontex, the EUs border agency, the number of migrants arriving at the EUs external borders has risen by a factor of 2.5 this year compared with 2014, from 61,500 to 153,000. The numbers coming through the Balkans were nearly nine times higher than last year.
Mediterranean crossings last month were 29% up on April, and there has been a five-fold increase so far this year in those using the eastern Mediterranean route compared with the same period in 2014.
The number of first-time asylum seekers in the EU in the first quarter of 2015 almost doubled compared with the first three months of 2014, according to Eurostat, the EU statistics agency. About 40% of the claims were lodged in Germany compared with only 4% in Britain.
The summit decided on a number of measures aimed at speeding up asylum processing and expelling those whose claims are turned down.
EU development funds, trade agreements and diplomatic pressure would be deployed as leverage on the migrants countries of origin to encourage them to sign readmission agreements with the EU.
All tools shall be mobilised to promote readmission, the summit decided.
Structured border zones or hotspots would be established in southern Italy to quarantine those arriving, fingerprint and register them and expedite the deportation of those deemed to have entered illegally or to be economic migrants.
European police and border agencies would be granted new powers for implementing policies that until now have been the sole remit of national authorities.
Syrians and Eritreans arriving in the EU in high numbers can seldom be repatriated because of the risk to their lives at home. Their treatment in the asylum regime would remain unchanged and their cases would remain in the relevant national systems as before.
Britains refusal to take part has been widely criticised. Peter Sutherland, the UN secretary generals special representative for international migration, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that Britains decision had forced countries such as Greece and Italy to take on an unfair burden of responsibility.
All member states, incidentally, should participate in the voluntary settlement, including Britain, Ireland and Denmark. There is absolutely no reason, if this is not compulsory, why they should feel they can opt out, he said.
This is a question, basically, of European solidarity. Why should Greece and Italy in particular take this unfair burden of responsibility for people who are refugees escaping from persecution?
Sutherland acknowledged that Britain had been playing a role by rescuing some of the refugees in the Mediterranean. Asked if that was not enough, he said: Absolutely not, sure. There is a massive degree of support from other countries in regard to helping people in the Mediterranean and saving lives. This is a separate issue. It is the issue of the fair distribution amongst the EU on the basis of solidarity of people who are refugees.
He said EU leaders should have agreed a compulsory programme on the resettlement of migrants, and that the overnight deal was
a mistake.
It could have been more ambitious. There is no doubt that it reflects limited progress nonetheless. We can only judge it when we see what countries come up with.

        <title>Greece's rich: insulated against an EU exit</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/25/greeces-rich-insulated-against-an-eu-exit</Link>

The security guard wrinkled his brow at the sight of an unfamiliar face. But when he found the name of the Guardians correspondent, left at the gate by a member, his demeanour changed.
Parakalo, he said with a warm smile, handing over a card to open the turnstile. Either side, the walls were thick and high.
The country club, on the outskirts of Athens, was laid out with an extravagance in the use of space that you seldom find outside the Americas. In the clubhouse, set amid towering pines, there were corridors as wide as rooms, and rooms the size of basketball courts. But perhaps the most striking thing about the club was that it was opened after the onset of Greeces never-ending financial emergency.
Since then, Greece has become notorious for deprivation. According to EU figures , 23% of Greeks were poor or at risk of poverty in 2012, the last year for which comparative statistics were available. It was the highest proportion in the EU and has almost certainly risen since.
Yet the Hellenic world has also been famed throughout history for the wealth of individuals: from Croesus, the semi-legendary king of Lydia, to the Golden Greeks, the shipping magnates Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis.
This is the first time that Greeks of all classes are really worried that it could end badly
The statistics indicate that income distribution is more unequal in Greece than in any EU country except Spain. But, said Andreas Paterakis, the idea that it is packed with plutocrats is mistaken.
Its a myth coming from the days of Onassis and the other shipping billionaires, said Paterakis, the regional president for south-eastern Europe of the security firm G4S. There are 10 or 15 families who control the media, banks and insurance. There are things that could improve, notably the relations of these people with the tax authorities. But I really dont think they are a priority for the Greek government.

Paterakis said his company provided physical and property protection for some high net worth individuals. But, he said, it is only a small part of our business.
The latest annual list of the worlds richest men and women produced by the magazine Forbes seems to bear out this view. It contains just three Greeks  one fewer than in 2008 before the onset of the crisis. The highest placed is Philip Niarchos, Stavross son, and with a fortune of $2.5bn, he only ranks 737th.
But earlier this year Bloomberg estimated that at least four more Greek citizens  all shipping owners  had assets of more than a billion.
Crisis-stricken Greece still has the worlds largest merchant fleet and shipping has long been the prime source of its super-rich. What makes them especially controversial is that, under rules incorporated in the constitution, they pay no tax on international earnings brought into Greece .
On Monday, several captains of industry and finance were spotted at a demonstration in Athenss main square to call for continued membership of the euro.
I recognised several CEOs there, said Vagelis Tsogkas, a corporate communications consultant. There was a mix of young, well-educated Greeks and members of the financial elite. I think that this is the first time since the start of the crisis that Greeks of all classes are really worried that it could end badly.
Membership Event: Guardian Newsroom: Can Greece be saved?
But, while the CEOs who improbably rallied in Syntagma Square dread the prospect of their firms being shut out of the single currency zone if the talks fail, the ship owners could see their businesses jeopardised if the negotiations succeed. A leaked draft of the proposals tabled by Greeces creditors includes a demand that the government phase out special tax treatments of the shipping industry.
At a personal level, Grexit would hit the finances of even the wealthiest. Reintroduction of the drachma could mean that overnight their property and other assets in Greece were reduced in value by as much as 50%. But they long ago took steps to ensure that those Greek-based assets were reduced to a minimum.
A senior banker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that after 2008 when the collapse of Lehman Brothers threatened to spark a global financial meltdown, large numbers of wealthy Greeks withdrew money from the private banking arms of global banks and paid it into the Greek system.
But as the crisis focused increasingly on Greece, the flow reversed. And it did so long before the panic withdrawals that were last week draining the banks of around 1bn a day.
Between 2010 and 2012, we lost deposits to the tune of 80bn, said the banker. We estimate that, of that, 20bn was high net worth individuals sending their money abroad. The smart money was the first to leave the country.

        <title>Japan joins with former foes to flex its muscles as it eyes China's rise</title>

It was American soldiers held captive by Japanese troops during the second world war who first dug through the thick, damp mud to build an airstrip on the Philippine island of Palawan.
Now, in 2015, two spy planes, one Japanese and one American, stand side by side on that same runway.
Conducting joint training activities with the US-supported Philippine Navy this month, the Japanese have finally made it back  this time with smiles and handshakes  to join up with their former enemies and resist a common foe: China .
Map graphic
All three countries contest Beijings land reclamation on islands in the disputed South China Sea, where it has built military installations to help bolster its claim. The Philippines argues it owns some of these islands while Tokyo and Washington fear Chinas expanding influence in the region  and the potential for it to block a key sea route for roughly 3.17tn in trade.
These fears have brought 21 sweating Japanese pilots and engineers in grass-green jumpsuits back to Palawan this week, where they mingled and posed for selfies on the runway with their Filipino counterparts, in darker, greyer attire at Antonio Bautista air base.
It was first time the Japanese military had conducted training operations in the south-east Asian country since Imperial Japan surrendered in 1945 following a three-year occupation of the Philippines. Their troops were pushed out by Americans allied with guerrilla Filipino resistance forces.
A joint-mission in a Japanese P3-C Orion surveillance plane with a smaller Philippine Navy Islander aircraft over the South China Sea on Tuesday was sold by Philippines Lieutenant Commander Lued Lincuna as practice for potential humanitarian coordination, not to resist China.
But the message to Beijing is clear  a symbolic and historic partnership against Chinas role in waters 80 miles off the west coast of Palawan, an island state in the Philippines on the edge of the South China Sea.
We are conducting this exercise to enhance our interoperability, which means once we are joined, we go together, Lincuna said at the air base, surrounded by dense tropical forrest. It is the first time we fly together, he said, adding that the exercise was conducted outside territorial waters west of Palawan. That means the South China Sea.

China is furious and the state news agency Xinhua this week ran an editorial piece calling Japans arrival in the Philippines as the latest sequel to Tokyos meddling in the South China Sea.
By muddying the waters in the South China Sea, Tokyo also aims to divert increasingly intensive global attention on Japans lack of remorse over its atrocities during World War II, nearly 70 years after its surrender, it said.
Japan, which is not a party to the disputes in South China Sea, should abandon all attempts to stir waves in the area.
But in the Philippines, where the older generation remembers hiding in the jungle from passing battalions of Japanese troops and vine-covered stone plaques honour those killed in massacres, the presence of Japanese boots has, interestingly, not stirred similar outrage.
We Filipinos have very short memories, joked one woman in Puerto Princesa, the town where the air base is located. Some also have Japanese blood  the children of Filipino women and Japanese soldiers who were based here.
As the Allies retook the Philippines, isolated Japanese soldiers fled into the dense, mountainous jungle and only emerged years later. On Palawan island, locals joke there might still be some hiding, waiting for the world to move on while unaware of the the fact that it has.
And with the military complaining that it is one of the weakest in Asia, the Philippines feels it needs Tokyo as a buffer against China, two months before the 70th anniversary of Japans surrender.
In Puerto Princesa, locals wear t-shirts stating The Spratlys will never be conquered, referring to the band of islands closest to the Philippines where Chinese warships now patrol.

Jennifer Berto, who works in a clothes and jewellery shop, says her graphic design artist made Spratly t-shirts following high demand from locals and American tourists.
This is our new design, she said at her shop in Puerto Princesa, holding a t-shirt with Spratly belongs to us written on it.
People on Palawan support the navy because the islands are in the west Philippine sea, she said.
She had not heard of the Japanese operation but was pleased they were here. How nice, she said, smiling.
The Philippine defence secretary, Voltaire Gazmin, said this week that Japan should become further involved with Manilas military, arguing for a visiting forces agreement which would allow Japanese troops to be stationed in the Philippines, similar to a deal with Washington, which has naval ships in Filipino ports.
It would be ironic if we cannot do exercises with Japanese forces when Japan is one of the only two countries  the other one being the United States  which are strategic partners of the Philippines, Gazmin said on Wednesday.
An end to Japanese pacifism
For Japan, its militarised return to the world stage is a cautious one. After its defeat, Japans 1947 constitution  which was largely written by US occupation officials  forbade the formation of a traditional military force. The country has a self defence force which is restricted to protecting the mainland. This has been used only when conflicts abroad are considered a potential threat at home and Japan has deployed troops to Afghanistan and Iraq.
The push to restart its military after so many years of pacifism is down to one man: Japans prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who defied public opinion a year ago to overturn the countrys defence policy and make it easier for troops to fight overseas .
Abe and his supporters want to go even further, arguing for a more active military in the wake of Chinas assertiveness . China and Japan have their own dispute over the Senkakus  known in China as the Diaoyu Islands  in the East China Sea. And although Japan does not claim any islands in the South China Sea it wants to make sure the area is not controlled by Beijing.
Ian Storey, from Singapores Institute of South East Asian Studies, says roughly 85% to 90% of Japans energy supplies come through the South China Sea which Tokyo fears could be blocked by Beijing.
Any threat to the maritime trade through the South China Sea seems existential to the Japanese, he said on the phone from Singapore.
Well see a continuation of this trend. This dispute is a long way from being resolved. Japan will continue to step up its support for the Philippines and Vietnam and maybe some other countries in south-east Asia.

Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan also claim islands in the South China Sea, while China claims most. The naval corridor is thought to have oil and gas reserves. And Tokyo has also promised patrol boats to Vietnam, which itself is looking to pump up its military hardware to deter China.
The Japanese can honestly say this is not about the South China Sea, this about south-east Asian nations improving their maritime security. But of course, its really about improving their capacity to be able to know whats going on, Storey says.
A New War of Bravado
Japans return to the South China Sea, where the carcasses of world war two ships lie in its reefs, has compounded a crisis that has led to the militarisation of all countries involved.
The risk of conflict is significant. Seventy Vietnamese soldiers were killed in a 1988 naval battle with China over the Johnson South Reef. And in 2001, a Chinese F-8 fighter collided with a US Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane. In May this year, Chinese and Vietnamese ships collided as Beijing tried to set up an oil rig.
Oil survey ships operating in Reed Bank, close to the Philippines, have increasingly been harassed by Chinese vessels and Manila is beefing up its military in the area, increasing the threat of conflict.
At the forefront of this is Oyster Bay, a naturally protected cove with a deep harbour capable of hosting large warships. On the western side of Palawan, the bays biggest selling point is that it opens directly into the South China Sea. President Benigno Aquino has called the area the frontline of our territorial defence operations.

Philippine officials say the bay, which is protected from the monsoons by its high mountains, will be used to host the countrys two large warships and act as a strategic base for the United States to rotate troops and ships, who are presently stuck on the other side of the island.
A new security pact signed during a visit by the US president, Barack Obama, last year should also allow a greater American military presence on Filipino soil, including on expanded bases.
Oyster Bay is only accessible by sea but once a connecting road is complete, officials say the major work can be done.
Fishermen who live deep in a mangrove-lined inlet took the Guardian out into Ulugan Bay, which leads to Oyster Bay. They did this in small pump boats, a 15-foot canoe with two stabilising bamboo stalk, fish in the area which is full of coral reefs and protected waters.
The fishermen say the navy has warned them not to approach the inlet, although several still anchor nearby to catch fish living in the cove. Two Philippine Navy patrol boats cruised in the area during the trip.
Inside Oyster Bay, a concrete jetty and landing platform stretches out into the deepest waters in order for bigger ships to dock. A boathouse and a water tank are all that have been built until the road is finished and construction can begin. A snake hung from a overhanging tree and birds skimmed the calm water.

Further back in the dense jungle the Guardian found a number of workmen.
Cement trucks roared down the roughly three miles of paved road, and labourers, wiping their faces with dusty t-shirts, mixed concrete while furiously pushing ahead to complete the road so Oyster Bay naval base can be built.
This appears to be a race against time.
A hundred miles out to sea, China is working fast, dredging thousands of tonnes of sand from the seabed to create islands.
The Philippines and its allies have been showing their strength this week, flying over the South China Sea and conducting military exercises. Many hope that is remains just a show but the militarisation of the area is a tinder box.
If we see more Japanese aircraft and ships operating in the area, says Yoel Sano, Head of Political Risk at BMI Research, then there will  mainly by law of numbers  be a greater likelihood of some sort of incident or clash between them and their Chinese counterparts.

Funerals for Charleston shooting victims begin with 'message of love'
We are stronger because we are together as a community, said Emanuel AME interim pastor Norvell Goff at the service for Ethel Lance in North Charleston
Services take place on Thursday for two of the nine victims of a massacre at a historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina
Thursday 25 June 2015 20.33BST
Last modified on Friday 26 June 2015 00.16BST
The first funerals for victims of the Charleston shooting were held on Thursday, as the community honored the nine people who were gunned down at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church by an alleged white supremacist.
Funerals are scheduled into next week.
I am here to tell you that we are stronger because we are together as a community, Norvell Goff, Emanuel AMEs interim pastor, said at the service for Ethel Lance at Royal Missionary Baptist church in North Charleston.
On Wednesday night, Goff led the weekly Bible study class where Lance and eight others were killed exactly a week before. Hundreds gathered in the churchs basement.
Many of our hearts our broken, but only God can fix a broken heart, Goff said at the gathering. Thats my testimony.

Marjorie McIver, whose sister Myra Thompson died in the attack, attended Bible study, according to the Post and Courier . Thompsons funeral will be held on Monday at the church.
God loves us, McIver said. Hes forgiven us of our sins. It behooves us to forgive others. That message of love, even for your enemies, even for those who use you, who despise you  thats a powerful message.
Later on Thursday, the funeral for Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, a mother of three, was held at Mt Moriah Missionary Baptist church in North Charleston. Charlestons mayor, Joe Riley, said Singleton was one of those extraordinary people, a coach who taught life lessons.
On Wednesday, thousands visited the state house rotunda, where Clementa Pinckney lay in state. Lawmakers paid their respects to the state senator and Emanuel AME pastor, as did his wife, Jennifer, and two daughters, Eliana and Malana.
A large, black curtain hung in front of a window in the state house lobby, blocking from sight the Confederate flag that flies over a monument on the grounds. The push to take down the flag, and stop states from allowing it on license plates or flying it on government land, has gathered momentum since the shooting, which police say was racially motivated.
Apple has removed war games with the Confederate flag from its app store, and the National Park Service said on Thursday it would remove all items that depict only the Confederate flag from its stores.
Many of the lawmakers who worked with Pinckney have said they want the flag taken down, but to do so would require a two-thirds majority vote from the legislature. Governor Nikki Haley has said she supports taking down the flag. Haley said on Twitter earlier this week : July 4th is just around the corner. It will be fitting that our state Capitol will soon fly the flags of our country &amp; state, and no other.
President Barack Obama, who said the flag belongs in a museum, is scheduled to deliver the eulogy at the funeral for Pinckney on Friday. The ceremony will take place at the College of Charleston, which can hold 5,400 people. The first lady, Michelle Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, are also set to attend.
Funerals for the other victims are scheduled into next week at Emanuel AME and in the state capital, Columbia, where the funeral of Daniel Simmons will be held. Funerals for Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders and his great aunt Susie Jackson will be held at Emanuel AME on Saturday.
On Thursday, the Charleston County council voted to rename the library Hurd managed in her honor. All 16 branches of the Charleston library will close for her funeral, so workers can attend the service.
The funeral for DePayne Middleton-Doctor, who was known for her talents as a singer and preacher, will be held at Emanuel AME on Sunday.

Obamacare upheld by US supreme court as conservative justices rescue law
Six-to-three decision on federal subsidies all but guarantees Obamacare will survive intact until at least the 2016 election in major victory for Barack Obama

Barack Obama celebrated a decisive victory for his healthcare reforms after the US supreme court threw out a Republican-led legal challenge that could have gutted the legislation and stripped millions of Americans of their health insurance.
This was a good day for America, the president said at the White House, marking a decisive turning point in his administrations battle to reduce the number of uninsured Americans.
The Affordable Care Act is here to stay, he added, claiming that as the dust has settled, there can be no doubt that this law is working.

The decision in the high-stakes case of King v Burwell all but guarantees that the law, more commonly known as Obamacare, will survive intact until at least the 2016 election, giving its supporters hope that the reforms will become impossible to reverse  even if a Republican is elected to the White House.
The case, which turned on the meaning of four words  established by the state  was brought by Virginia limousine driver David King, who sued the health secretary, Sylvia Burwell, on the grounds that insurance subsidies erroneously paid to those on low to middle incomes forced him to take out cover against his will by pushing him above an affordability threshold.
Kings lawyer argued that states like Virginia, which chose not to set up their own Obamacare exchanges and rely on a federal system instead, were not meant to receive such subsidies under a precise reading of the legislation which suggested it only applied in states that had their own exchanges.
But six of the nine justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, sided with the government in agreeing that other parts of the legislation made the broader meaning clear and allowed subsidies to be paid to exchanges run by states or the federal government.
Given that the text is ambiguous, we must turn to the broader structure of the act to determine the meaning, wrote Roberts in a passage that represents a huge victory for the Obama administration .
The decision prompted a withering response from conservative justice Antonin Scalia , who wrote a dissent on behalf of the three who opposed the decision.
This court, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest of the Act from working as well as hoped, wrote Scalia. So it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUScare.
The ruling is the second time that Roberts, appointed by President George W Bush and usually known as a conservative, has supported the presidents flagship healthcare reforms against legal assault.
In 2012, the chief justice was the swing vote in supporting the governments ability to levy fines against those who can afford health insurance but refused to take it out.
This time, Roberts argued that under the narrow reading of the legislation urged by lawyers for Burwell, the system of insurance exchanges would have had to change unrecognisably and would again represent a constitutional challenge to the power of the legislature.
In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the people, Roberts said.
Our role is more confined  to say what the law is, he added, quoting from a case dating back to 1803.
Though not completely unexpected given the sceptical reception from a number of justices to initial arguments made in the case , the language in Roberts opinion gives a very clear rebuttal to those who have used the loose language to unpick the whole law.
In every case we must respect the role of the legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done. A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan, wrote the chief justice.
Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter. [The disputed] Section 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congresss plan, and that is the reading we adopt.
As well as all four of the traditionally liberal justices, Roberts was also supported by Anthony Kennedy, who is often the swing vote in contentious cases, so the ruling was not as close as some healthcare supporters had feared.
Nevertheless, the emphatic endorsement of the chief justice adds to the scale of the victory for Obama, who would have struggled to shepherd a fix to the legislation through the Republican-controlled House and Senate.
It also capped a strong week for a presidency that had begun to look dangerously beleaguered in the face of a Democratic party rebellion on trade that was successfully quelled on Tuesday .
Critics of Obamacare, which has been a rallying point for Republicans since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2009, were quick to jump on the decision.
I disagree with the courts ruling and believe they have once again erred in trying to correct the mistakes made by President Obama and Congress in forcing Obamacare on the American people, said presidential candidate Marco Rubio.
Despite the courts decision, Obamacare is still a bad law that is having a negative impact on our country and on millions of Americans. I remain committed to repealing this bad law, he added.
Former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee took an even stronger stance, blasting the decision as an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny.
Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton however praised the courts decision, tweeting : SCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts &amp; under the law: Health insurance should be affordable &amp; available to all.
Fellow presidential candidate and leftwing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders praised the court for recognizing the common-sense reading of the Affordable Care Act, but went on to call for replacing Obamacare with a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system.

Islamic State militants killed dozens of people in and around the Syrian border town of Kobani on Thursday after launching a counter-offensive under the cover of darkness.
The militants - disguised as fighters from the Free Syrian Army - drove five vehicles into the town in the early hours of Thursday and used a suicide bomber to blow up a border crossing with Turkey. A civilian inside Kobani said: No one can go out of their home, the streets are not safe  Isis fighters are getting inside houses and killing everyone [they find].
At least 35 civilians and Kurdish fighters were killed along with eight IS militants, monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A further 23 Syrian Kurds , among them women and children, were shot dead in the nearby village of Barkh Butan, the group said.
Isis withdrew from the village after US-led coalition strikes on its outskirts of the village and the arrival of Kurdish forces, but fighting continued in Kobani through Thursday.
Around the same time as the Kobani attack, the group launched an assault on the north-eastern city of Hasakah, aided by militias previously aligned with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Western districts were seized and the Syrian army pushed into the city centre.
The surprise, two-pronged offensive came as Isis reels from several high-profile defeats near Raqqa , the capital of its self-declared caliphate and its seat of power in Syria.

The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) militia and an alliance of rebels known as the Euphrates Volcano  backed US-led coalition air strikes  have seized swaths of territory from Isis, including the strategic border town of Tal Abyad . In recent days they also wrested control of Brigade 93, a strategic base seized by Isis from the Syrian regime, and the town of Ain Issa, bringing them within 30 miles of Raqqa itself.
Islamic States morale has collapsed after the advance in the Raqqa countryside, said Redur Xelil, the YPG spokesman who provided the accounts of the latest Isis offensive. They are trying to raise the morale of their fighters and supporters, and show that they still have strength and can strike out elsewhere.
He also said that another goal of the Isis offensive may be to draw Kurdish troops away from the frontline to defend other territories.
Xelil said the militants who entered Kobani numbered between 30 and 40, and were holed up in buildings in the city after killing dozens of people. The YPG, backed by the Kurdish Asayish security forces, were combing the area and he was confident they would defeat the militants.
We will destroy this group that entered the city, he said.

Late last year, Isis was on the verge of conquering Kobani, an enclave on the Turkish border, but Kurdish fighters backed by the US-led coalition ultimately succeeded in reversing the militants advance and liberating the city , killing over a thousand Isis fighters in a months-long battle that emerged as a symbol of the Kurds defiance.
Many refugees who fled the city have since returned to their homes, many of which had been levelled during the fighting.
The joint Kurdish-rebel advance in recent weeks has provided a glimmer of hope in the fight against Isis. Last month, Isis seized the historic city of Palmyra in Homs province and Ramadi , the provincial capital of Anbar in Iraq, casting doubt on the entire strategy to contain the group.

The more serious threat is the Isis assault  its fourth  on Hasakah, a city divided between the Assad regime and the Kurds. Around midnight, Isis launched an offensive that has so far claimed the lives of 30 pro-regime troops and 20 militants, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group with a wide range of contacts inside Syria .
The attack triggered the flight of civilians from the area, and the regime has responded with a series of air strikes on militant positions south of the city. Isis used suicide bombers to soften up regime positions.
In a statement circulated on social media, Isis said it took control of western neighbourhoods and forced the regimes troops to retreat to the city centre, seemingly in shock at what the militants described as a daring operation.
Xelil, who said the Kurds were not yet involved in the battle for Hasakah, said Isis had succeeded in winning the allegiance of members of the pro-Assad National Defence Forces  local militias that support the regime  allowing them to prepare the ground for the assault on the city.
The tactic is in keeping with the traditional Isis modus operandi of infiltrating areas prior to launching major assaults.
In a separate, major offensive in Syrias south on Thursday, about 51 rebel groups joined together to attack regime-held areas of Deraa city, where insurgents have dealt Assads forces significant blows in recent months.
The southern rebels, including the al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front and groups that do not share its jihadi ideology, have long said they aim to expel Syrian government forces from Deraa. Syrian state TV said the army had repelled attacks against a number of military positions in the south of the country.

After four days combing through the rain-drenched jungle and swollen rivers, the rescue party was on the verge of calling off the search.
They had discovered the remains of the small plane which had smashed into a remote mountainside in north-west Colombia . They had found the body of the pilot  and a few tantalising clues suggesting that at least one person had survived the devastating impact.
But there was no trace of the missing passengers, and the emergency workers were starting to discuss ending their mission.
They decided to push on and a few minutes later, just 500 metres from the crash site but hidden by a dense wall of vegetation, they discovered a crude shelter.
Inside was the young mother who with her baby son had walked away from the plane wreck and survived for days in the one of the most inhospitable corners of the earth.
Authorities in Colombia have described the survival of 18-year-old Mara Nelly Murillo and her eight-month-old son Yudier Moreno as a miracle, after their Cessna 303 plane crashed into trees in the north-west of the country.
It is a very wild area and it was a catastrophic accident, Colonel Hctor Carrascal of the Colombian air force told AFP.
Murillo was pictured on Thursday looking exhausted, with burns on her arms, and clinging to a rescue worker after she was lifted from a rescue helicopter.
Mother and baby are now in hospital, with Murillo suffering minor burns, a fractured ankle and dehydration. Her son is in good health, the air force said in a statement. His mothers spirit must have given him strength to survive, Carrascal said.
The body of the planes pilot, Captain Carlos Mario Ceballos, was found three days ago in the ruined aircraft in the Serrana del Baud mountain range.
The plane had been flying from the Pacific coastal town of Nuqu to Quibd, the capital of Choc region in the west of the country. Just 20 minutes into the flight, the plane disappeared from the radar of civil aviation authorities. The cause of the crash is not yet known.
It took rescuers two days to locate the crash site, in an area teeming with both poisonous snakes and armed groups battling for control of coca plantations, illegal gold mines and lucrative drug smuggling routes to the Pacific ocean.
Threaded by rivers and drenched with rain throughout the year, the region is one of the wettest on Earth. It is also one of the poorest and least-developed parts of Colombia.

When rescuers found the plane, the doors of the plane were open, said Carrascal. There was no sign of Murillo and her baby, both of whom had been on the passenger list. We started to worry  we had no idea what could have happened to them. They could be lost in the jungle and trying to survive or could have died already, he told the news magazine Semana.
But they also saw a reason for hope in the open door. The door had been opened from the inside, suggesting one of two things: either it had opened on impact or someone had opened it to get out, said Carrascal.
There were other clues suggesting Murillo and her baby had survived the crash, said Rafael Caviedes of the Colombian air force. We found the remains of food at the site, a few peeled coconuts as if they had been used for water and food. And we didnt see her body anywhere or any traces of blood, he told El Tiempo.
As the formal search and rescue operation got under way, rescuers continued to find clues left behind by Murillo, from a discarded flip-flop to the babys birth certificate sitting next to a tree in the jungle.
As coconut shells turned up and even mobile phones that someone had apparently tried to use, rescue workers began to assume Murillo was leaving a trail so that she could be located in the impenetrable jungle and tangle of rivers that make up the area.
Meanwhile aviation experts studied the plane wreckage and noted that, while the pilots cabin had been destroyed, the rest of the plane was in decent shape. The planes cargo of coconuts and fish had helped cushion part of the plane from the shock of the crash.
A 14-man team scoured the dense jungle for two days without finding the mother and child, before finally resorting to using loudspeakers to broadcast their presence and instruct Murillo to stay as close to the plane wreckage as possible.
Meanwhile, said Caviedes, Murillo had made her way about 500 metres from the site of the crash to the banks of a creek where she fashioned a shelter for her and her son, and survived on unripe coconuts.
Speaking to local media from her hospital bed in Quibd, Murillo said she and her son also drank rainwater. When it rained, Id get up and gather water from the few leaves that had water on them and Id drink it with the boy, she said.
Red Cross volunteer Acisclo Rentera told Blu Radio that after failing to find the missing passengers, the rescue party had been debating whether to call off the search for the day. They decided to push on for a few more minutes, and a few minutes later, he spotted a swarm of flies circling above something on the ground.
As he approached, he realised it was Murillo, who began shouting and trying to get to her feet, Rentera told the Associated Press. She was in a state of near-starvation and apparent shock, but not seriously injured.
Rescuers gave Murillo first aid, and spent the next four hours feeding her water and crackers while waiting for an airlift. Meanwhile, Rentera comforted the baby.
The 38-year-old rescuer, who is unemployed and displaced from his hometown by Colombias five-decade civil war, described the rescue as a blessing
I thanked my God for allowing me to save these two people, he said.
The moment he spotted Murillo, he said, he was overcome with emotion. Its tremendous. Its a feeling that cant be explained.

David Attenborough and Barack Obama face-to-face in TV interview
In unexpected turn of events, US president interviewed naturalist during visit to White House in May  though Attenborough asks toughest questions
US president Barack Obama discusses climate change and the future of life on Earth with Sir David Attenborough

It sounds like a scenario from a fantasy dinner party: the most powerful man on the planet interviewing one of the worlds most beloved naturalists about his life story, about climate change and the future of life on Earth.
But in May, it has emerged, this encounter did happen, when Barack Obama invited Sir David Attenborough to the White House for a televised discussion  in which he, the US president, was to ask the questions of the broadcaster, not the other way round.
In the interview, to be broadcast simultaneously in the UK and US on BBC1 and BBC America on Sunday, Obama tells Attenborough: Ive been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time  youve been a great educator as well as a great naturalist.
But it is Attenborough, on the day in which he marked his 89th birthday, who poses the most probing questions of their encounter, asking the president why he cannot show a commitment to tackling climate change in the same way previous presidents had strived to put people on the moon.
Challenged by the naturalist, Obama says: Were not moving as fast as we need to and part of what I know from watching your programmes, and all the great work youve done, is that these ecosystems are all interconnected. If just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not, then were not going to solve the problem, were going to have to have a global solution to this.
What were seeing are global trends that depends on the entire world working together, and sadly we havent made as much progress as we need to on climate change.
Attenborough says that being invited to meet the president on his 89th birthday  the first time in his long career he had ever visited the White House  had been a considerable surprise. He says he found the president friendly, hospitable and genuine.
The president tells Attenborough that he grew up watching his programmes. Attenborough presented his first natural history programme for the BBC in 1954. The pair discuss the broadcasters career, his recent trip to dive in the Great Barrier Reef, ( which he has called the most magical thing he has ever seen ), and what he believes needs to be done about pressing issues such as the rising population, climate change and renewable energy.
I believe [if] we find ways of generating and storing power from renewable resources we will make the problem with oil and coal disappear, Attenborough tells the president, because economically, well wish to use these other methods. If we do that, a huge step will be taken in solving the problems of the Earth. I think whats required is an understanding and a gut feeling that the natural world is part of your inheritance. This is the only planet weve got and weve got to protect it. And people do feel that, deeply and instinctively, it is after all where you go in moments of celebration and in moments of grief.
Obama, in turn, talks about his paternal roots in Kenya as well as his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, and how travelling across the world throughout his life had shaped his thoughts on the environment.
Related: Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal
Attenborough has previously said he believed Obama was very much in favour of tackling climate change  [but] of course, as we also know, he is coming to the end of his last presidency.
The broadcaster recently helped launch the Global Apollo Programme , which aims to double the amount of money being spent on research and development of renewable energy, calling on world leaders to spend 0.02% of GDP on developing clean-energy technologies.

The director of the board of trustees of Spains Alhambra palace is under investigation for alleged embezzlement of public funds at the top tourist site.
Interior ministry official Santiago Lopez said Alhambra director Maria del Mar Villafranca was detained on Thursday and brought in for questioning. She was later released, but remains under investigation.
Villafranca and four other board officials are said to be suspected of misappropriating public money assigned for contracting visitor audio guide systems for the palace, which is in the mountains on the outskirts of the southern city of Granada.
Villafranca told reporters she would immediately resign from her position if she ended up being named as an official suspect in the investigation.
The board has acted with absolute integrity, transparency and a sense of responsibility, she said, before refusing to answer any further questions on the case.
Considered a gem of Muslim architecture, the royal residence of Alhambra (the name means the red in Arabic) was completed in the 14th century and is enclosed by huge, fortified walls. Now a Unesco world heritage site, it is Spains most visited tourist attraction, receiving thousands of visitors every day.

HIV epidemic will rebound dramatically without more funding, warn experts
Analysis by UNAids and Lancet Commission highlights fragile window of opportunity to maintain progress on curbing deaths and infections

The world could see the HIV epidemic rebound dramatically if countries fail to increase funding and expand access to drugs in the next five years, according to a major report.
The analysis, by the UNAids and Lancet Commission , highlights a fragile window of opportunity for maintaining progress on curbing deaths and infections and suggests that progress made during the past decade could easily be reversed.
We must face hard truths  if the current rate of new HIV infections continues, merely sustaining the major efforts we already have in place will not be enough to stop deaths from Aids increasing within five years in many countries, said Prof Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and lead author of the report.
Child mortality has fallen dramatically since the UN set a the goal of reducing under-fives deaths worldwide by two-thirds, and the spread of HIV infections has fallen by 44% in the last decade. However, the report highlights instances of complacency and even the reversal of progress in some countries.
In Indonesia , the incidence of HIV rose by 50% between 2005 and 2013, while in Uganda, new infections rose from 90,000 in 1999 to 170,000 in 2011  a return to levels seen two decades previously.
Recent studies have also found clear evidence of resurgent HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men in western Europe, North America, and Asia, caused by risky sexual behaviour.
Expanding sustainable access to treatment is essential, but we will not treat ourselves out of the Aids epidemic, said Piot. We must also reinvigorate HIV prevention efforts, particularly among populations at highest risk, while removing legal and societal discrimination.
Elsewhere, the rate of new HIV infections is not falling fast enough and this, combined with rapid population growth in some of the most affected countries, is increasing the number of people living with HIV who will need antiretroviral therapy to stay alive.
We have to act now. The next five years provide a fragile window of opportunity to fast-track the response and end the Aids epidemic by 2030, said Michel Sidib, executive director of UNAIDS. If we dont, the human and financial consequences will be catastrophic.
Sustaining current HIV treatment and prevention efforts would require investments of up to 2% of GDP, and at least a third of total government health expenditure, in the most affected African countries to fund HIV programmes until 2030. The report calls for international funding to be urgently ramped up to support Aids efforts in low-income countries with a high rates of HIV.
At present, the high level of efforts costs $19bn annually, whereas it will take $36bn annually to achieve the UN goal to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, concludes the report, published in the Lancet .
Dr Eric Goosby, special envoy on malaria and former US global Aids coordinator, said: If we do not continue to invest, three decades of remarkable progress in the fight against Aids will be in jeopardy. And that will have a resounding effect across the global health spectrum.

How Egyptian media has become a mouthpiece for the military state
With imprisonment of journalists at an all-time high, Nour Youssef speaks to leading journalists about their inability to criticise the government

Nour Youssef in Cairo
When Tahrir Square was flooded with Egyptians calling for former president Hosni Mubaraks downfall , journalists were divided: jump ship, or defend the president?
Some, like Ibrahim Eissa, joined the calls of the protesters, co-founding the daily newspaper El-Tahrir (The Liberation). Others, like then-state TV presenter Khairy Ramadan, turned on demonstrators, suggesting they were funded by foreign conspirators.
But today even Eissa , among many others, is a defender of the new military government run by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi . Having shed any pretence of revolutionary fervour or objectivity, Egypts journalists are reluctant to even suggest that more than 36 people died in the 2011 uprising, when independent estimates say more than 900 were killed .

I would say anything the military tells me
Today, many of Egypts top TV presenters and journalists are remarkably candid about their willingness to act as government mouthpieces.
I would say anything the military tells me to say out of duty and respect for the institution, says Ahmed Moussa, one of the most popular TV presenters in Egypt .
Moussa has no qualms admitting on air his relationship with the authorities  and his vocation to serve them. He claims he would also extend the same courtesy to the police, he said but he might stop and think a little first.
Sharing Moussas sense of duty towards the military is the veteran talk show host Mahmoud Saad, from Al-Nahar TV. The military should never, ever, ever be covered, he says, shaking his head. You have to let them decide what to say and when to say it. You dont know what will hurt national security.
But its also the power to influence people that appeals to him, he says. Its a beautiful feeling knowing that when you swing right, he says as he swivels his upper body right, the people will swing right. And when you swing left, he goes on, swivelling in the opposite direction the people will swing left.

The official story makes people feel better
Before 2011, there was an unspoken rule among broadcasters and newspapers: criticise everyone except the president and his immediate family. To some, this silence extended to the defence and interior ministers.
El-Watan reporter Ahmed Ghoniem says owning media outlets comes in handy if you get into any kind of trouble and have to pressure the government. But no owner completely unleashes his journalists on the government, he says.
But after Mubaraks fall from power, the media exploded in congratulations, apologies and promises to never return to the days of humiliation that were Mubaraks reign, as popular TV host Amr Adeeb tearfully declared on ONtv.
We [talk show hosts] were cowards... The authorities used to call all the shows to dictate content, said Adeeb, who had once claimed that Mubarak had personally protected his freedom of expression  and indeed that of all journalists.
The media is not free, but better be controlled by Sisi and not the west
Ahmed Abdullah
Television presenters continue to be the undisputed leaders of public opinion in Egypt, where over a quarter of the population is illiterate . But where once they openly criticised the military and the government  most notably for killing protesters during the months of revolution in early 2011  now their role in public debate is much less clear.
Given this climate of well-known government pressure, many younger Egyptians are deeply cynical about the media, but older viewers have a softer view. So what if they paid respect to Mubarak? Everyone did, says 63-year-old retired teacher, Amal el-Tahry.
Ahmed Abdullah, who owns a shop in the capital, is also ambivalent: The media is not free, but better be controlled by Sisi and not the west, says the 55-year-old.
The government sanctioned narrative offers a sweeter pill, claims TV producer Sherief Badie el-Nour: People believe the official story because it makes them feel better, he says. It requires less work from them as individuals.
What can the viewer do about it? Change the channel? He will find another host saying the same thing, he says.

Self-censorship
This pervasive pressure from government has prompted journalists to police themselves more rigorously.
Dot Masr reporter Mohamed Abu Asay says in the past he could never report on the budget deficit in Egypt and the Saudi-Egyptian military operation in Yemen in the same piece. I cant tie the idea that the government doesnt have money, but is abandoning its war on terror to go fight in Yemen, in the readers mind, he says. It might stir public opinion and that is not good for the regime or the funders. Abu Asay knows that if he doesnt self-censor, his editors simply wont run it.
At Al Masry Al Youm, reporters also say they know which topics to avoid. No one can question how [well] trained the soldiers we have thrown to face the insurgency in Sinai, says website editor Ahmed Ragab.
Even when the newspaper published a report on police abuse partly showing the authorities in positive light and showcasing their heroism in the war on terrorism , its journalists were still referred to the public prosecutor after the Ministry of Interior issued a statement promising to sue the paper for what it claimed was an unprofessional report.
The viewer is tired
Mahmoud Saad
No one has ever made me say something I didnt want to say, but they have made me not say what I wanted to say, says the TV presenter Mahmoud Saad.
Lighting a cigarette, Saad reflects on the many phone conversations he says he had with Mubaraks minister of information, Anas el-Fiqqi, arguing about the topics he was allowed to discuss, whom to interview, and for how long. He called me to tell me to say that the 25 January protests in 2011 were [organised by the rival] Muslim Brotherhood. I refused and I didnt go on air, he recalls.
Saad no longer has that fighting spirit. I am an old man, he says. I just want to spend my time here in quiet  of which there is plenty in his brightly lit villa in a gated community in Giza.
I dont want to ruin anyones day, he says. The viewer is tired. He doesnt want to hear about corruption and theft. This desire to please is clear on Saads show, where all he had to say on the day a court dropped charges of killing protesters against Mubarak was : Is it really important that we get into details? I think not.

Claims of oppression are just a trend
Despite many journalists first hand experience of censorship and corruption in the countrys media, many stop short of holding president the government directly responsible.
Claims of oppression are just a trend, CBCs Khairy Ramadan says. Anyone who says they are under pressure is a liar.
ONtvs Youssef el-Husseiny goes further, claiming that the authorities would like the press to be balanced , but its journalists themselves who are the ones resisting. Sisi, el-Husseiny claims, personally asked him where his governments opposition is: Where are the other voices? Is everyone a supporter [of mine]?
We are tools, not journalists. The media owners use us to attack the regime when they want and support it when they want
Ahmed Amir, journalist
But frustration amongst journalists is also growing, and not everyone is resigned to become beholden to the governments narrative. Some have some have quit their jobs, but many also keep their head down to make ends meet.
Give me a nine to five job and I will quit tomorrow, says young journalist Ahmed Amir. Amir works on Ahmed Moussas TV talk show on Sada el-Balad TV.
We are tools, not journalists. The media owners use us to attack the regime when they want and support it when they want, he says. This is the profession of those with no conscience.

A French woman accused of suffocating eight of her newborn babies told investigators she feared they were the children of an incestuous relationship with her father.
Dominique Cottrez is on trial charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder of minors. She faces life in prison if found guilty by a jury in the northern city of Douai.
The infanticide case stunned the country when the bodies were discovered in and around her home in 2010 .
Cottrez, 51, who has two adult daughters, told investigators that over more than a decade, she carried several babies to term and then killed them. Cottrezs obesity appeared to hide the pregnancies, which went unnoticed by her husband, children, neighbours, colleagues and even doctors at a nearby hospital.
Dozens of forensic and psychiatric experts, police investigators and witnesses, including her husband, daughters and siblings, are scheduled to testify in the trial, which started on Thursday.
Cottrez told investigators she was raped by her father, first when she was eight and repeatedly through her childhood and teenage years, according to judicial documents. She later entered a long, incestuous relationship with him as an adult, including after she married. She said it became consenting, and she was in love with her father more than with her husband. Her father died in 2007.
One of the first witnesses called to the stand on Thursday was Leonard Meriaux, who bought the Cottrez family house and discovered the first corpse in the garden in 2010. He called police, who found another in the garden and six more in the garage of the house.
Investigators soon turned their suspicions to Cottrez, who quickly confessed. She told the investigating judge that she had never used contraception or had an abortion because of a phobia of doctors. She also said she did not keep the babies because she was afraid that they were the results of her incestuous relations with her father. She said the killing had become a means of contraception, according to the judicial documents.
The verdict is expected next Thursday.

Burmas parliament has voted against proposed constitutional amendments, ensuring that the militarys veto power remains intact and that opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi cannot become president in an election this year.
The legislature ended a three-day debate on Thursday on proposed changes to the 2008 constitution.
The constitution bars the Nobel peace prize winner from seeking the presidency and gives the military an effective veto over constitutional amendments. Changes to both those clauses were rejected on Thursday.
Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy (NLD) is expected to make large gains against the ruling Union Solidarity and Development party in the polls.
The NLD swept the last free general election in 1990 but the then-ruling military junta ignored the results and kept her under house arrest for years.

South Africas deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has been cleared of responsibility for the police massacre of 34 striking mineworkers at the Marikana mine by a judicial commission of inquiry.
Other ministers do not have a case to answer either, according to the long-awaited report. But it says inquiries should be held into the fitness of the national police chief, Riah Phiyega, to hold office, and into ascertaining the criminal liability of all police involved in the tragedy.
The killings at the British-owned Lonmin mine in the platinum belt on 16 August 2012 marked the bloodiest massacre by South African security forces since the end of racial apartheid.
On Thursday the South African president, Jacob Zuma, read a summary of the 600-page report on television, saying: The Marikana incident was a horrendous tragedy that has no place in a democracy.
His deputy, Ramaphosa, a stalwart of the liberation struggle, was a Lonmin board member at the time and has been accused of encouraging the violent police action. But the report said: The commission has found that it cannot be said Mr Ramaphosa was the cause of the massacre, and the accusations against him are groundless.
In another finding likely to disappoint many families and campaigners, it also cleared Nathi Mthethwa, the police minister at the time. The commission found that the executive played no role in the decision of the police to implement the tactical option on 16 August 2012.
The commission was far more critical of the police, however, noting that a plan to encircle the strikers with barbed wire was abandoned and replaced with a tactical option which was defective in a number of respects.
It said: The tactical option was implemented at about 15.40 that day, resulting in the deaths of strikers at scene 1 and scene 2. The commission found the police operation should not have taken place on 16 August because of the defects of the plan. It would have been impossible to disarm and disperse the strikers without significant bloodshed on the afternoon of 16 August. The police should have waited until the following day when the original ensettlement plan, which was substantially risk free, could have been implemented.
The report continued: The commission also found that the operation should have been stopped after the shooting at scene 1 and there was also a complete lack of command and control at scene 2.
The commission has also questioned the conduct of the police management during the inquiry. The police leadership did not initially disclose to the commission the fact the original plan was not capable of being implemented on the first date and had been abandoned, it said. In addition police leadership did not inform the commission that the decision to go ahead with the tactical option  was taken at the national management forum on 15 August. Instead they informed the commission the decision was taken on 16 August and only after the situation had escalated.
The report added: The commission has also raised serious concerns that there was a delay of about an hour in getting medical assistance to the strikers who were injured at scene 1 and accepts that at least one striker might have survived if he had been treated timeously.
Phiyegas position as national police commissioner appears untenable after the commission recommended an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. Zuma said: I have written to the national commissioner to inform her of the recommendations pertaining to her.
The massacre was captured on multiple TV cameras and shown around the world. Many were shocked to see the police of a black majority government opening fire on black mineworkers, apparently to defend the interests of London-based mining company.
The tragedy also highlighted the squalid living conditions of mineworkers who had been pleading with wealthy executives for decent pay.
The commission criticised the conduct of two trade unions that were engaged in a turf war at the mine but was also scathing about Lonmin saying: The commission has found that Lonmin did not use its best endeavours to resolve the disputes that arose between itself and its workers who participated in the unprotected strike on the one hand, and between the strikers and those workers who did not participate in the strike.
It also did not respond appropriately to the threat of, and the outbreak of, violence. Lonmin also failed to employ sufficient safeguards and measures to ensure the safety of its employees. Lonmin also insisted that its employees who were not striking should come to work despite the fact it knew that it was not in a position to protect them from attacks by strikers.
South African news media reported a mood of profound disappointment in Marikana itself over what they saw as the commissions failure to hold senior politicians to account. Some were critical of the abrupt timing of the reports release at 7pm with little notice for them to prepare.
James Nichol, a British lawyer who represented the families of dead mineworkers during the commission hearings, said: Its outrageous really the fact we are nearly three years on and we are no closer to understanding why hundreds of police officers fired machine guns at miners that day.
The report suggests it was a bungled job and they should have known better  thats just not good enough. Why did those police officers open fire? We dont know that.
Nichol added: It was a whitewash for the government and ministers including Cyril Ramaphosa. Not even one of them is held responsible.
As far as Lonmin is concerned, its they should have done better but theres no suggestion of them paying compensation. All in all, its a shambles.
Rehad Desai, a member of the Marikana Support Campaign, said: Shockingly bad is an understatement. Its terrible that it only recommends an inquiry into the national police commissioners fitness for office rather than her dismissal.
Lonmin welcomed the report but declined to tackle specific criticisms. Ben Magara, its chief executive, said: Lonmin gave its full support to the commission. Its findings will need our detailed consideration before we take further action and before we provide our considered responses.
We as a company have already moved a long way towards building a more open, transparent and mutually trusting environment. I cannot say that we have fully achieved this yet, but I can say that we have made progress, and we will continue to do so in conjunction with other stakeholders.
He added: While the report will generate painful memories for many people, it is all of our responsibility not to lose sight of our common humanity, not to destroy the good work already done, to conduct ourselves respectfully and with due restraint and empathy, and to provide support to those who need it.
The report was fiercely attacked by an opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which expressed deep sadness, disappointment and shock. Based on the summary, it said, the report has basically declared this cold winter evening the saddest since the dawn of democracy in 1994.
The party said: In essence, 34 mineworkers were massacred in full view of the world and there is no recommendation of prosecution and someone to be held accountable.
The report has not put any blame on anyone; it has not called on anyone to apologise and it has not recommended reparations for any of the lives lost. One is left to wonder if the Farlam Commission was actually investigating the same Marikana Massacre we all witnessed on 16 August 2012.
The EFF said it had assembled legal experts to study the report and its leaders would soon meet to establish a way forward. We can guarantee all South Africans that EFF will never rest until those responsible, particularly the political elite that presided over the police, including Cyril Ramaphosa, are prosecuted and sent to jail.
Mmusi Maimaine, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said: The DA will call for nothing less than the dismissal of national police commissioner Riah Phiyega, who is clearly unfit for office.
The report has plainly found that Riah Phiyega and the SAPS [police] leadership took a decision that they knew would result in bloodshed. They never stopped the operation when the shootings began, and they left miners to die in the dust for a full hour before medical help was called in.
We are deeply disappointed that the then police minister, Nathi Mthethwa, was absolved from any wrongdoing whereas, as the political head of the police service, he needed to accept due responsibility as would have been the case in any normal democracy.

About 100 university students in Burundi are in the US embassys parking lot seeking refuge amid the countrys political turmoil, an embassy statement confirmed Thursday.
The students had been camping at a construction site adjacent to the embassy grounds after their university was closed on 30 April due to political turmoil. Police persuaded them to leave the site and some went to the embassys parking lot, the statement said. Four people received minor injuries during the incident, the embassy said.
The students said they fear aggression after violent demonstrations against President Pierre Nkurunzizas efforts to run for a third term in elections in July.
Landry Ndikuriyo, a history major at the National University of Burundi , said the police threatened the use of force to evict them from the building site causing a melee as students scampered for safety.
In Washington, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said some of the students were starting to leave and that all the embassy workers were safe.
There was no violent action against the embassy. This wasnt directed at the United States, Kirby told reporters. There was never any penetration of the actual embassy compound, and none of our State Department employees were under any physical threat whatsoever.
At least 77 people have died in street protests against Nkurunzizas bid for a third term in the 15 July presidential elections, according to rights activists.
Burundis second vice president said on Thursday he fled the country fearing for his life after opposing the presidents controversial effort to extend his time in power that sparked off violent protests in the capital in recent weeks.
Gervais Rufyikiri, who went to Belgium last week, said in an interview on Radio France International that he has not officially resigned. He is the most senior government official to publicly oppose Nkurunzizas efforts to stay in power. Dozens of opposition and civil society activists, government officials and journalists have gone into exile after opposing the presidents candidacy for another term.
Critics say Nkurunzizas push for another term violates the two-term limit for presidents set by the constitution.
The street protests started 26 April, after the announcement of Nkurunzizas candidacy. The demonstrations triggered an attempted coup in mid-May that was quickly put down.

BB Kings longtime business manager has been named sole executor of his estate Thursday despite objections from a lawyer for four of the late blues musicians daughters.
Clark county District Judge Gloria Sturman first refused to let attorneys Benjamin Crump and Jose Baez contest Kings will on behalf of daughters Karen Williams, Patty King, Rita Washington and Barbara Winfree.
The will, filed in January 2007, puts Laverne Toney alone in charge of administering Kings assets, his property and his trust. The trust documents have not been filed publicly.
The judge then rejected efforts by Las Vegas attorney Larissa Drohobyczer to cast Toney as having misused her power of attorney while BB King was alive to move about $1m from personal to joint bank accounts to which she had access, and to block relatives from visiting King in his dying days.
A million dollars is a big deal, Sturman said, but she left the argument for another day.
Im not saying there may not be other issues or that we may not need outside assistance, she said. But he had a plan. I dont see anything before me at this point in time that he wanted that changed.
Attorney Brent Bryson, lawyer for the estate and Toney, said claims by the daughters that Toney stole from their father, isolated him and poisoned him before his 14 May death at age 89 had no basis in fact. The family members had provided no evidence that a competing will existed, he said.
There has to be more to the objections than hollow allegations and innuendo, Bryson said.
Sturman said several times she admired that BB King continued to play hundreds of concerts a year until October when he collapsed during a concert in Chicago.
He worked his entire life to provide for his family, the judge told the daughters as she named Toney as executor. The thing he left for you is his amazing body of work. Somebody has got to make sure that his legacy is protected.
King has 11 surviving adult children, and family members count 35 grandchildren.
The will was filed on 20 May under Kings birth name, Riley B King. It leaves everything to the estate and Toney, who managed Kings road show business for 39 years.
It lists one daughter, Riletta Mitchell, as second to Toney as executor, but Mitchell died in September. Her son, Eric Mitchell II, was represented in court on Thursday by Las Vegas attorney Bradley Richardson, who asked the judge to protect Kings intellectual property and royalty rights for his heirs.
Its far past time to pull this out of the public eye, Mitchell said by telephone from Chicago. The concern is that my grandfather was a private person and wouldnt have wanted this. Its time for the wild accusations to stop.
Bryson and Toney declined outside court to estimate the value of Kings estate. Drohobyczer has said she thinks the estate is worth between $5m and $10m.
Crump and Baez said on Thursday they would continue investigating whether King was properly cared for before he died.

China has uncovered widespread misappropriation of 16.9bn yuan (1.7bn) of funds from its state lottery programme, underscoring the extent of official corruption, which the government is trying to root out.
Funds were misappropriated through the buying and building of office buildings and hotels or embezzled, Chinas national audit office said in a report on its website.
The state auditor said the irregularities accounted for a quarter of the total of lottery funds received in its 2012-14 investigation, which spanned 18 provinces. It said 17 provinces had flouted the law by engaging in lottery sales over the internet without approval from the finance ministry.
In another case, 32 lottery shops had used 3.1bn yuan to construct office buildings, training centres and hotels, the report said.
Spurred by rising disposable income, a strong appetite for gambling and more sophisticated games, Chinas lottery market has boomed, with customers splurging billions of dollars. China is expected to overtake the United States as the worlds biggest lottery market this year.
The government has so far contained casino gambling to Macau, in part because of social concerns. Experts say officials consider the lottery system more sanitised, with fewer negative effects on citizens.
The review comes as President Xi Jinpings government wages a fight against corruption, warning that the problem is so bad it could affect the Communist partys grip on power.
Lottery products are typically sold in the form of paper tickets from authorised outlets throughout the country. These range from dedicated lottery stores to counters in supermarkets, post offices and petrol stations.
Unlike the US and Europe, where prizes can climb into the hundreds of millions of dollars, China caps jackpots at 10m yuan. Tickets sell for 2 yuan to 200 yuan, with proceeds supporting sports and welfare charities.

        <MainBody>Whitney Houstons daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown has been moved to hospice care after months in hospital, and a lawsuit has been brought against her partner.
In a statement on Wednesday, her aunt Pat Houston said Browns condition had worsened.
Despite the great medical care at numerous facilities, Bobbi Kristina Browns condition has continued to deteriorate, the statement read. As of today, she has been moved into hospice care.
Brown, 22, was found face down and unresponsive in the bath at her home in the Atlanta area on 31 January.
We thank everyone for their support and prayers. She is in Gods hands now, the statement read.
A lawsuit brought on Wednesday against Browns partner, Nick Gordon, accuses him of being physically and emotionally abusive, misrepresenting the nature of their relationship and taking money from her without authorisation.
Bedilia Hargrove, a court-appointed conservator for Brown, is seeking at least $10m (6.4m) in damages. Gordon is accused of assault, battery, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, unjust enrichment and conversion.
The complaint says after that Brown was placed in a medically induced coma, he stole more than $11,000 from her bank account. Calls to Gordons lawyer were not returned.
Brown is also the daughter of the singer Bobby Brown. He, along with Pat Houston, were appointed her co-guardians last month.
Whitney Houston was found unresponsive in a hotel bath on in February 2012 and died shortly after. Pat Houston, her sister-in-law and manager, was appointed administrator of the trust fund she had set up for her daughter.

        <title>The solidarity fridge: Spanish town's cool way to cut food waste</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/25/solidarity-fridge-spanish-town-cut-food-waste-galdakao</Link>

The large white fridge sits prominently on a pavement in Galdakao, a small city on the outskirts of Bilbao.
A wooden fence has been built around it, in the hope of conveying the idea that this is not an abandoned appliance, but a pioneering project aimed at tackling food wastage.
For the past seven weeks, Galdakao, population 29,000, has been home to Spains first solidarity fridge, in which residents and restaurants can drop off leftover or unused food otherwise destined for the bin. Anything left in the fridge can be picked up by anyone who wants it. I would guess weve saved between 200 and 300kg from the rubbish bin, said organiser lvaro Saiz. A typical day might see leftover lentils, a few sandwiches and unopened milk cartons left in the fridge.
Related: France to force big supermarkets to give unsold food to charities
The idea came about as Saiz and other members of the citys volunteer association were reflecting on the sheer amount of food being thrown out by supermarkets. We started to think that if even just one of their rubbish bins was replaced with a fridge, people could take advantage of these items. After an online search revealed a network of shared fridges in Berlin, he said. We realised we could do this  so we did.
It took about a month to wade through the paperwork needed for the project, including securing a permit from the city to use public space and obtaining the right legal documents to ensure organisers wouldnt be held liable should anything go wrong with food taken from the fridge.

As his group pushed forward with the idea, they heard all sorts of opinions from city residents, said the 36-year-old. I realised that the people who dont support it, its because they dont understand what were doing.
The goal, according to Saiz, isnt to feed people in need. This isnt charity. Its about making use of food that would otherwise end up in the bin, he said. It doesnt matter who takes it  Julio Iglesias could stop by and take the food  at the end of the day its about recovering the value of food products and fighting against waste.
There are strict rules for anyone leaving food in the fridge: no raw fish, meat or eggs, packaged or canned goods cannot be past their use-by date and anything prepared at home must include a label detailing when it was made.
Related: World leaders urged to tackle food waste to save billions and cut emissions
Volunteers keep an eye on the fridge to throw out anything past its use-by date or homemade dishes that are more than four days old. But thats in theory: so far all food has been taken on a daily basis.
All sorts of people have dropped by so far, said Saiz, including those in need who make a special trip to the fridge from nearby towns and a construction worker who took an ice-cream bar  dropped off with just a few days left before its best-before date  during his lunch break.
Last week the city of Murcia, some 400 miles away in the the south of Spain , copied the idea and became the second Spanish city to host a solidarity fridge. Saiz has received calls from communities across the country  and from as far as Bolivia  from people interested in setting up similar operations.
The fridge has also allowed local restaurants to alleviate guilt over their food wastage, said lvaro Llonin of Topa restaurant. Before we used to throw away a lot of food  and it was food that was fine to eat.
He and the staff at the busy restaurant in the centre of Galdakaonow regularly make time to drop off their leftovers in the fridge. You know someone is enjoying it, he said. Its like giving our food a second chance to end up in someones stomach.

Nstor was 14 when a local drug trafficker first hired him to help bring in the harvest. They need 20 to 30 people, because you have to harvest an entire hectare in two or three days while theres a gap in the rains, he says. When the marijuanas ready, you cant leave it for long.
Growing up on the outskirts of Pedro Juan Caballero, a lawless town on Paraguays north-eastern border with Brazil, wasnt easy. His father, a ranch manager, was away from home for three months at a time. His mother washed clothes to put food on the table.
Then they approach you, and say theyre going to pay you 80,000 guaranes [9.56; $15] a day, with an advance. You know how much your family is in need, so youre forced to take it. And then youre committed. Thats why everyone gets corrupted and goes to work there.
Thirty years later, Nstor  not his real name  is still in the business. He has his own plantation up in the mountains, the low fists of red sandstone that punch through the jungle of Amambay department. He employs a clutch of workers to live there, growing, guarding, and harvesting the crop. They are farmers who sold their small plots of land out of economic desperation, according to Nstor. They jump on the offer of any work, even if it means cultivating illegal crops.
Nstors small house in Pedro Juan is dotted with souvenirs from his plantation. A feral baby jaguarundi scurries out from underneath a wardrobe to snatch chunks of meat from his wifes hand. A pair of parrots sit on a tree out back, and watch as he brings out six bricks of pressed hashish  the potent, THC-heavy resin of the cannabis plant  weighing a kilo each.

It is a fraction of what Nstor can produce from Paraguays fertile red soil in two harvests a year. The landlocked nation of 7 million inhabitants is Latin Americas biggest producer of the narcotic after Mexico, and 80% of the countrys marijuana ends up in the megacities of Brazil, transported by criminal enterprises like Rios Red Command . Paraguay also increasingly serves as a corridor for Colombian, Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine bound for Brazil, Africa and Europe.
The marijuana and cocaine trades are fuelled by the underdevelopment that has dogged Paraguay since independence. Over the past 10 years, successive modernising administrations have produced a GDP boom by supplying Brazil with beef, wheat and soybean. But mechanised agribusiness has left many of Paraguays rural communities behind.
Paraguay is a rich country, but full of poor people, says Eladio Flecha, general secretary of the Partido Paraguay Pyahura (PPP; Party for a New Paraguay), a new political movement made up of several leftwing groups. The distribution of wealth is very unequal: 80% of land is held by 2.5% of the population, and 161 people control 90% of the wealth of our country. Sure, the economy is growing fast, but it doesnt reach the most vulnerable groups.
His partys name is a mix of Spanish and Guaran, the indigenous language spoken by more than 90% of the population, and as a first language by many. Lack of Spanish, the formal language of politics and business, joins other obstacles  such as low levels of education, poor communications and dirt roads that quickly turn to mud in the rain  to isolate rural communities.
Flecha says small-scale farmers scarcely earn 8,000 guaranes for a 70kg sack of the Paraguayan staple manioc. Over the past decade, more than 1 million small farmers and their families have migrated to informal jobs on the edges of towns, easy prey to the temptation offered by traffickers.
Stemming the flow of marijuana
Eradication operations are the only real way of diminishing the supply of drugs and financially hitting the plantation owners. Here, in a single day, I can take up to 150,000kg of marijuana out of circulation, says Captain Oscar Chamorro, from Paraguays overstretched National Anti-Drugs Secretariat ( Senad ), as 60 special forces troops line up in a hangar on the edge of Pedro Juan at dawn.
They check their weapons, pile into cars, trucks and helicopters, and make their way out to a rendezvous in the mountains. On the way, Chamorro  who has 21 years of military experience, with 10 in Senad  dismisses the notion that Paraguayans are turning to pot to escape poverty.
They dont do it to survive, they do it to earn money. Marijuana producers will tell you, No, I dont have anything else I can do. But in reality, if the campesino cultivated his 10 hectares of land well, or put 10 cows on it, hes going to earn enough to live on, Chamorro says.
Theyre just looking to boost their income. Theres not a single small farmer who doesnt have his cell phone, his motorbike. They can earn more with narcotrafficking, but I dont believe this is a valid excuse.
It is day three of a nine-day operation. Reconnaissance flights have already identified the marijuana plantations, dotted among private forest reserves. The helicopters drop off teams of six among the green stalks, where they work until the midday heat becomes too oppressive. Major Aldo Pintos jumps out and heads for a camp in the trees. A couple of tarpaulins cover a sleeping area, filled with colorful duvets and sacks of marijuana. A few toothbrushes are in a jar tied to a tree, and a pot sits over some glowing embers.

They hide when they hear the rotors. Theyre probably still nearby, says Pintos, cradling his assault rifle in one hand. With the other, he pours cooking oil over the tents and touches a match to the plastic. In the next valley, the soldiers burn presses used to make the bricks of marijuana. Then, they form a loose line and take out their machetes, walking forward and hacking the plants to the ground.
Chamorros men are highly motivated and disciplined: one of his officers was trained at Sandhurst, others by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which paid for the base in Pedro Juan. As they zoom around the hills, a casual observer might dismiss them as cowboys  Chamorros ringtone is Danger Zone from the movie Top Gun  but Senad put in the most hours of all of Paraguays public employees. It is, says Chamorro, a vocation.
You feel very proud knowing that youre preventing these drugs going out on the streets. We all have a friend, a relative whos living with the problem of drugs, and we know how much damage it does to society, says Chamorro. But we have a more modern drugs policy than many developed countries: we dont lock up the user, but treat it as a health problem.
Eradication eats into the traffickers profits, he explains, and prevents them from moving into the cocaine trade: a trend borne out by Nstor, who has spent time behind bars in Uruguay and Brazil for transporting the powder. Senad agents periodically swoop on hidden airstrips, light aircraft and makeshift laboratories used to bulk up Andean cocaine paste and export it across the invisible border.
The rivalry this lucrative business creates plays out to gory effect in Pedro Juan, says Cndido Figueredo, who has two decades experience reporting for the national daily ABC Color from his home town. Here, a life is worth absolutely nothing, he says. The police sometimes find a body near the border in the morning, and they dump it on the other side. Its less paperwork.
According to police figures, an annual average of 105 homicides occured in Pedro Juan between 2009 and 2014.
Drug trafficking was a familiar feature under the military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. Drug money has further infected national politics since the return to democracy, contributing to endemic corruption and a culture of silence.
Loads of politicians, especially ones from the border, are 100% contaminated by the mafia and receive mafia support for their campaigns. In this country, if you have money, you can buy anyone: from a journalist to a minister, Figueredo laments.
The few independent journalists who speak out do so at their peril: disgruntled narcos have twice riddled Figueredos bungalow in Pedro Juan with machine-gun fire, forcing him to accept round-the-clock police protection. He also carries a 9mm pistol whenever he leaves the house with his guards.
The mafia has killed four journalists since May 2014, including two within metres of the border between Pedro Juan and Brazils Ponta Por. In October, when gunmen shot Pablo Medina , Figueredos colleague, national soul-searching gave rise to a new term: narcopolitica. It emerged that a marijuana-trafficking local mayor, allegedly protected by a congresswoman, had given the order.
Before Pablo Medina died, we believed we were on the right track. We ignored the fact that the marijuana business had grown, and occupied political space, says Senad minister Luis Rojas in his office in Asuncin, Paraguays capital.

We realised that we couldnt just continue with the strategy of cutting and burning marijuana. We had to investigate the structures behind it, just like with cocaine  And we had to realise that we dont know how much marijuana there is in Paraguay . We dont know about its economic and social impact. We dont know anything.
Senad has since paid more attention to capturing and getting information from the kingpins. Rojas is creating a centre for research into marijuana trafficking, and is boosting rehabilitation and education efforts. The next challenge is to pass laws on campaign finance and property forfeiture, preventing drug bosses from controlling politicians and operating from jail. Its painful to admit the reality, but its the only way to build intelligent public policies. The rest is bullshit, says Rojas.
For the PPPs Flecha, the changes  if delivered  will not come a moment too soon. But he disagrees with the claim that poor farmers turning to drug cultivation for survival is a thing of the past, and with the militarisation of the countryside.
The Paraguayan campesinos form of subsistence is under attack from the big latifundistas [landowners] and agricultural exporters, says Flecha. Theres no escape, and so he falls under the control of the mafia. To genuinely combat the narcotraffickers, the government should have a policy for small producers, and strengthen traditional production.
Supporting smallholder farmers
The southern department of Alto Paran represents the problem in microcosm. While international agricultural firms show off gleaming rows of tractors and pesticide sprayers at a local trade fair , Francisco Pereira drives around the backroads, engaged in a tireless struggle to encourage local communities to hold on to their lands and forests and resist what he calls the soybean-isation of the countryside.
Pereira, policy director of the World Wildlife Funds Paraguayan chapter , points out the fields of the stunted crop, creeping up on both sides of the road and planted within two metres of a local schools windows, liberally sprayed with pesticides thanks to minimal restrictions by the state. From the production perspective, soy brings greater earnings for Paraguay, he agrees. But from the point of view of the schools, of the families who are left with the soil, its a problem. Theres a real risk of the misuse of agrotoxins having a severe effect on campesino and indigenous communities.
The health concerns and economic pressures prove too much for many farmers, who sell up and move to the towns.

But Pereira and a handful of local NGOs are helping communities diversify into small-scale production for local sale and export. Farmers can secure significant returns from medicinal plants, and crops like watermelon and yerba mate  the bitter leaf drunk nationwide. And such products provide employment for the whole community, planting the seedlings in the village nursery, transferring them to the fields, and eventually harvesting them.
Four years of encouragement from the WWF has turned things around in the village of Tavapy, says resident Simeon Luis. All these trees that are here now are proof, and the houses too. Before there wasnt anything. Were thinking about moving into floriculture, and weve planted over 200,000 yerba plants. Within three or four years, theyll begin making money. And then well be able to breathe.
Restoring optimism and technical knowhow to Paraguays small farming communities so they can support themselves is the missing component in tackling marijuana cultivation, Chamorro admits. The government is already investing more in schools, but improvements will take time. And for some, changing the habits of a lifetime will be hard.
Nstor is just getting started again after leaving jail. I know a guy who owns a favela in Rio. There, a kilogram of marijuana gets 1,000 reais ($300; 191), so a thousand kilograms will earn me a million reais. Then Ill be back in business, he says.
 This article was amended on 26 June to clarify that hashish is made using the resin of the cannabis plant rather than the sap, as originally stated.

Barack Obama had a heckler thrown out of a gay pride reception at the White House on Wednesday evening, telling her shame on you for interrupting him. Jennicet Gutirrez, a transgender woman, disrupted the US presidents speech by shouting , saying his administration should release lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender immigrants from detention.
President Obama, stop the torture and abuse of trans women in detention centres, cried Gutirrez, one of the founders of the Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement , who is supported by the LGBT advocacy group GetEqual .
Obama, who was giving a speech about civil rights for lesbian, gay and transsexual Americans, responded by shaking his head, wagging his finger, and repeatedly saying no. Then, pointing to Gutirrez, he said: Hey. Listen. Youre in my house  You know what? Its not respectful when you get invited to somebodys 
Before asking security guards to escort Gutirrez outside, he said: Youre not going to get a good response from me by interrupting me like this. Im sorry. Im sorry  Shame on you, you shouldnt be doing this.
Gutirrez has said she is an undocumented immigrant. Campaigners have expressed alarm at the conditions transgender people face in immigration detention following reports of sexual assault and a lack of medical care.
Familia said that as a transgender woman who was undocumented in the US, Gutirrez felt she could not celebrate Gay Pride Month while 75 transgender detainees were still being exposed to assault and abuse. The group said she went to the US from Mexico, seeking safety and economic opportunities.
After the incident Gutirrez said: There is no pride in how LGBTQ and transgender immigrants are treated in this country. If the president wants to celebrate with us, he should release the LGBTQ immigrants locked up in detention centres immediately. LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (or queer).
In his address, Obama said that regardless of how the supreme court would rule on same-sex marriage, there had been an undeniable shift in attitudes across the country. He said he was watching for the courts decisions in the coming days, including one concerning a case that could affirm the right of same-sex couples nationwide to marry. The president singled out discrimination against transgender Americans as an area where more progress was needed.

        <title>Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: 'I am guilty and I am sorry'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/24/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-boston-marathon-bombing-survivors-speak</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
Convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has given his first public statement since carrying out the April 2013 terrorist attack.
I would like to now apologize to the victims, to the survivors, he told a Boston court shortly before being formally sentenced to death for the bombing. I want to ask forgiveness of Allah and his creation.
He added: I am sorry for the lives I have taken, for the suffering that I have caused you, for the damage I have done  irreparable damage.
In case there is any doubt, I am guilty of this attack, along with my brother, Tsarnaev said, standing at the defense table, referring to his older brother Tamerlan, killed during the manhunt that followed the bombing.
To the victims attending the hearing at the US district court, he said: I pray for your relief, for your healing.
Tsarnaevs voice occasionally faltered as he spoke, and he left meaningful pauses after each apology to the victims of the 2013 bombing and manhunt, which left four dead and more than 260 injured.
He also thanked nearly everyone who had been involved in the trial: his attorneys, his family, everyone who testified with dignity about their unbearable hardships.
He also touched on the accusation that he showed no remorse during the trial, saying: I learned [victims] stories, their names and that he learned more faces with every hearing. His attorney, Judy Clarke, also mentioned the accusations of lacking remorse, saying her client had offered to resolve the case without trial in 2014. US attorney Carmen Ortiz cast doubt on the statement. Clarkes statement as it was made in court was not completely accurate and it was not complete, Ortiz said.
Quoting the prophet Muhammad, Tsarnaev said there would be no mercy for those who showed none.
Judge George OToole invoked Shakespeare to Tsarnaev: When your name is mentioned all that will be remembered is the evil you have done.
Tsarnaevs statement came after an emotional morning of testimony during which survivors and family members of the victims faced the bomber and made a series of defiant and moving speeches to the court.

Tsarnaev met their anger and anguish with the same implacable blankness that he wore throughout his long trial. Dressed in a black suit, the 21-year-old sat impassive next to his lawyers.
He folded and refolded his hands, rested his chin on a fist, and occasionally scratched his beard or head. He tilted his gaze to the ground, and only rarely looked at the speakers as they described injuries, nightmares and lost loved ones.
In contrast, many of the survivors and victims families and friends made direct remarks to Tsarnaev, often in voices shaking with emotion.
Jennifer Rogers, the sister of Sean Collier, an MIT police officer killed by the Tsarnaev brothers after the bombing, vented years of anger at Tsarnaev.
I will never have a complete family ever again, Rogers said before describing her brother as a gregarious, generous man, whose love of the small moments was stolen by Tsarnaev. She said there was at least some solace in knowing Tsarnaev would not know the joy of those moments.
He is a coward and a liar, she said. He is a leech abusing the privileges of American freedom.
OToole was required to uphold the jurys May recommendation that Tsarnaev be sentenced to death, but Rogers urged him to place exceptional restrictions on Tsarnaevs incarceration wherever possible.

Elizabeth Bourgault, a runner who survived the blasts with injuries, also called Tsarnaev a coward.
Whatever God that the defendant believes in is not going to welcome his actions, she said. The defendants God will condemn him to an eternity of suffering.
Intense sadness mingled with the anger. Bill Richard, who lost his eight-year-old son Martin to the bombing, said: Theres nothing we can say that will change anything for us.
Tsarnaev could have stopped his brother, he could have changed his mind, Richard said. He chose hate, he chose destruction, he chose death.
But Richard said of he and his wife Denise: We choose love, and reiterated their opposition to the death penalty.
We prefer he have a lifetime to reconcile himself with what he did that day, [but] he will not live that long, said Richard.
The bombing killed three people, Krystle Marie Campbell, 29, Lu Lingzi, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard.
Days later Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan killed Collier as federal and state law enforcement hunted them down in the Boston area.
This was an extraordinary case, OToole said. We will never forget the victims of these crimes and their stories.
You had to forget your own humanity, the common humanity you shared with your brother Martin, your sister Lingzi Lu, he continued. It is tragic, for your victims and now for you.
OToole also repudiated the extremist rationale that inspired the Tsarnaev brothers: Surely someone who believes God smiles on and rewards the killing of innocents believes in a cruel god. This is not and cannot be the god of Islam.
At 21, Tsarnaev now becomes the youngest person on death row in the United States. Following the hearing, he will be taken from custody in Massachusetts to a federal prison in Indiana. He probably faces over a decade of appeals before his execution could take place.
OToole said no one would remember that Tsarnaevs teachers or friends were fond of him. He said what they what remember was that Tsarnaev murdered and maimed innocent people and did it willfully and intentionally.
Tsarnaev looked down and rubbed his hands together as the judge sentenced him. An appeal is automatic in death penalty cases.
During the testimony, police arrested a man outside the Moakley federal courthouse when he drove up in a Honda and took a large knife out of his license plate holder.

A handful of survivors spoke of forgiveness, and a few even mentioned closure. But many spoke of fighting for their future and of recovering despite the rippling consequences of the attack: medical costs, nightmares, children growing up without limbs, friends who no longer know how to communicate, and terror at the sounds of doors and sirens.
Survivor Johanna Hantel said that the trial has not been healing for her: I do not believe in closure.
But she did express pity for Tsarnaev, and was among a minority who asked him to try to do something good with the time he has left. In contrast, Michael Chase, a first responder who described the horror on Boylston Street in graphic detail, said: I dont want to speak to him. Im here to say were OK.
Stephanie Benz, whose left side had frozen as a result of injuries sustained in the bombing, said that she still had hope despite daily pain. Heather Abbott, an amputee, said that she did not care about Tsarnaevs fate. I care about what lies ahead for me and the other survivors and loved ones, she said.
Rebecca Gregory, a double amputee, stood before Tsarnaev defiant. To deliver a victim impact statement, Id have to be someones victim. And Im definitely not yours, she said.
Gregory said she hoped Tsarnaev could be shown the bigger picture of his actions.

Terrorists like you do two things in this world. One, they create mass destruction, but the second is quite interesting, Gregory said. Because do you know what mass destruction really does? It brings people together. We are Boston strong and we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea.
Hows that for your victim impact statement?
Meghan Zipin, another survivor, summed up a sentiment felt by many of her fellows who have struggled to piece their lives together and make sense of the prolonged trial.
She said that while sitting in court she had reflected on her future  going home to her husband, doing yoga and having pizza  contrasted with Tsarnaevs future in prison and the courts. I realized Im the one whos alive. The defendant, hes already dead.
After OToole sentenced Tsarnaev, most of the men and women who testified to their experiences left the court without responding to questions from the media. Three remained to field questions, including Lynn Julian, who described Tsarnaevs statement as an Oscar-type speech.
I regret having ever wanted him to speak, she said, adding that she heard no remorse in his voice. There was nothing simple about what he said and there was nothing sincere.
US attorney Carmen Ortiz said that the hearing was a day for the victims to have a voice and that her team of prosecutors are all feeling very gratified by the hearing.
She said that she was struck less by Tsarnaevs surprise speech than by what he didnt say.
He didnt renounce violence, she said. He didnt renounce terrorism.

Qatar eyes fast track to soft power with Formula One stake
Latest target of fast changing nations investment fund is part of long-term drive to invest in world sport at top level

Next month, well-heeled punters will flock to the Qatar Goodwood Festival for one of the highlights of the British horse racing calendar. Meanwhile in Paris, a once down-at-heel football club that became home to David Beckham and Zlatan Ibrahimovic is undergoing a metamorphosis into one of the top 10 sporting brands in the world.
In Doha, construction work is well under way on stadiums built to host an endlessly controversial World Cup in November 2022, including the showpiece Lusail Iconic stadium that nestles in a city built from scratch on the outskirts of the Qatari capital. Now, though, the tiny gulf state could be about to add another prime target to its global trolley dash: a major stake in Formula One .
A controlling stake in the sport, built over four decades by Bernie Ecclestone into a global money-spinning machine, has been the subject of rumoured interest over the years from a variety of suitors, including Rupert Murdoch.
But the Guardian understands that a mooted $7bn-plus bid from Qatar Sports Investments (QSI)  which also owns Paris St Germain (PSG) and the global sports broadcasting network beIN Sports  and a billionaire-backed US group is the most serious yet.
QSI is the sports arm of the Qatar investment fund that owns London landmarks including the Shard, Canary Wharf and the Olympic Village. Ecclestones 5% share in F1 would be sold alongside 35.5% owned by a venture capital firm CVC, but he would probably stay on in the short-term to run the sport. One of the most immediate motives for such a move might be to ensure that Qatar had its own F1 race in a calendar that includes events in neighbouring Abu Dhabi and nearby Bahrain.
In Britain, a similar rationale has underpinned huge Qatari investment in horse racing. Sheikh Joaan Al Thani, a son of the former emir of Qatar, retains Frankie Dettori to ride his string of horses and now sponsors the festival more commonly known as Glorious Goodwood. Sheikh Fahad Al Thani, meanwhile, established Qatar Racing and Qatar Bloodstock as subsidiaries of the private investment company Qipco, in 2011.
Qipco this year unveiled a 50m sponsorship deal with British racing to underwrite the Champions Series, taking in the biggest flat races of the season, until 2024.
As with Qatars other investments, from substantial stakes in Sainsburys and Barclays to its push into landmark London properties, the rationale is twofold. As outlined in its 2030 Vision document, the gas-rich state is attempting to prepare for a future beyond its bounteous natural resources and invest globally in industries that can provide an ongoing return.
But it has also chosen some of the most eyecatching brands and properties in the world as a means of putting the country on the map, and projecting soft power in an unstable region built on constantly shifting political alliances with its neighbours and the west.
While senior sources in Doha are keen to underline the differences between the investment funds and businesses that have bought into world sport on multiple levels, in a feudal monarchy with a single source of huge wealth the lines inevitably become blurred.
In 2010, Qatar agreed a deal for its charitable Qatar Foundation to take over Barcelonas sponsorship from Unicef, before a deal for Qatar Airways took effect that has since been renewed.
Sport presses emotional buttons that other investments cannot reach and the strategy is far from haphazard as far as QSI is concerned.
PSG were seized upon by QSI for the untapped potential of the biggest one-club city in Europe. Since then, partly through acquisitions including Beckham, Ibrahimovic, and Edinson Cavani  plus major investment in the stadium and infrastructure  the club has been successfully rebranded. A once down-on-its luck side has been transformed into an upmarket lifestyle choice.
The beIN Sports network, formerly al-Jazeera Sport, has bought up sports rights and launched channels around the world, including the US, and would provide a ready-made outlet for F1. It is the potential prize of combining ownership of a sport with the means of distribution that has attracted interest from Murdoch and others.
It is in this context of a web of complementary investments that the prospective F1 deal should be viewed. Where neighbouring countries have focused on retail or tourism, Qatar (like near neighbour Abu Dhabi, owner of Manchester City) has alighted upon sport and culture as a means of asserting its place in the world.
Sport is also seen as a means of bringing together a fast changing nation that is virtually unrecognisable from a generation ago and where the indigenous population enjoys the highest per capita income in the world, but are outnumbered seven to one by migrant labourers fuelling a construction boom.
Hand in hand with its global investments in sport, Qatars then-emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, succeeded by his son Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani in 2013, agreed to a push to bring the biggest global sporting events to the country. Bids for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics failed at the shortlisting stage.
But despite the climactic challenges in a country, where summer temperatures regularly top 50 degrees, it will host the world cycling road racing championships in 2016 and the world athletics championships in 2019, following money-no-object bids.
Most controversially of all, in December 2010 Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup in a vote that caused shockwaves that are still reverberating. While there is now believed to be some concern at the highest levels over the scrutiny that the World Cup has brought, it has clearly not damaged Qatars determination to buy into world sport at the highest level.

US prosecutors have launched an investigation into the balcony collapse in Berkeley, California , that killed six students as the family of the final victim to be buried revealed that a postcard from him had arrived home after his death.
Lorcan Millers father, Ken, showed the card to mourners at Rathmichael parish church in Shankill south, County Dublin, on Thursday.
On its front was the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, where the 21-year-old medical student had started work this summer. It only arrived on Tuesday, almost a week after he was killed.
The postcard read: As part of my job I have to talk with customers and I always tell them about my amazing brother and sisters and how much I miss them. Miller had signed the card with 12 kisses.
During the funeral, Ken Miller broke down as he paid an emotional tribute to his truly remarkable son. Lorcan was an extrovert who loved life and wasnt afraid to try new things, he told the congregation. He threw everything he had into everything he did.
Meanwhile, Conor Flynn, a 22-year-old Dublin student injured in the incident, was released from the John Muir medical centre in Walnut Creek, California. Flynn will remain in the San Francisco Bay area for a few weeks until he is able to fly home.

Six young people fell 12 metres (40ft) to their deaths while seven were hurt when the balcony they were on came away from the exterior wall of an apartment block on the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Five of the dead were Irish students; one had dual US-Irish nationality.
Berkeley city officials played down the prospects of criminal charges being pursued, but Alameda Countys deputy district attorney, Teresa Drenick, told Reuters that prosecutors would continue to investigate.
Potential targets could include the general contractor for the apartment building or the company that applied a waterproof membrane to the balcony, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
On Wednesday, one of the survivors posted a message on Facebook saying she may never walk again. Clodagh Cogley, 21, from Dublin, said she had sustained two collapsed lungs, a broken shoulder, a broken knee, five broken ribs and a broken spinal cord.
Life is short and I intend to honour those who died by living the happiest and most fulfilling life possible, she wrote. Who knows, maybe legs have been holding me back all these years and Ill realise my talent for wheelchair basketball.
The American environmental activist Erin Brockovich has offered her support and campaign advice to the families of th ose who died.
In a statement released on Facebook, the campaigner  who helped bring a case against a California utilities company in 1993 for poisoning a towns water for more than 30 years  said she was prepared to meet and assist the families.

Brockovich said she had linked up with Dublin law firm Phelim ONeill to help any family members as they begin their search for answers, explanations and justice.
I urge immediate action on the costs for Berkeley families. The company behind the construction of the Berkeley apartment block should take action to ensure that the families of those involved in the balcony collapse disaster are not left with enormous medical bills as a result of the faulty construction, she said.
Some of those injured would need extensive care before being able to return home, and it was essential the families did not face what Brockovich called the additional nightmare of mounting medical bills.
Brockovich added: As a Californian, I am devastated that these young visitors to our shores were caught up in this horrific situation. My heart goes out to their families, friends and loved ones, and along with all of the people of California, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the people of Ireland.

Google's action on revenge porn opens the door on right to be forgotten in US

Googles recent decision to delist revenge porn from its search results is a big deal, and not just for victims. Beyond opposing harmful conduct that disproportionately targets women , Google has essentially demonstrated how something akin to the European Unions right to be forgotten can, and should, work in the US.
Some Americans have panicked over Europes woefully misnamed right to be forgotten, anxious at the thought of the  biggest threat to free speech online erasing history and breaking the internet. But such a right doesnt have to exact an exorbitant price tag, and it can come about in many different ways .
In the case of the right to be forgotten, Google has shown that the world wont be knocked off its axis if the company goes beyond protecting financially relevant information ( copyrighted works , social security numbers, and bank information), and takes aggressive steps to remove links to socially relevant information that can harm autonomy, reputation, and emotional well-being.
As the debate over online privacy in the US advances, there are three important things to keep in mind.
1) Both government and industry must invest in data protection rights
The First Amendment restricts the ways the US government can oblige companies to provide citizens with data protection rights. The corporate free speech interests of Google and others will likely ensure that the US cannot mimic data correction and erasure rights in the EU. What this means is that the public must demand that Google  along with other online intermediaries  exerts leadership and avoids adopting a mentality thats concerned more with legal compliance than social good .
Even cynics must admit that Google made a voluntary choice to take action against revenge porn at a global level. This is the case even if the policy deflects some attention away from the tougher questions raised by delisting requests from EU citizens, and even if it follows moves by Reddit , Twitter , and other prominent companies in responding to online harassment. Evidence now suggests that if the public keeps applying pressure, industry and government can be partners in ensuring that it is hard for undesirable parties to obtain some of the information we have privacy interests in.
Seen from this perspective , good can come from the fact that Google is not legally required to make free speech exceptions for links to information some would deem newsworthy. Even countries with broader privacy rights like those in the EU could benefit from an invested industry.
2) Personal data rights will evolve through information-specific categories
The entire regulatory framework for protecting privacy in the US is fragmented and largely focused on safeguarding specific kinds of sensitive information, like health , financial , and education records. The right to be forgotten in the US will not be any different.
To be sure, a category-based approach to privacy has its drawbacks. It fuels an incremental orientation towards privacy protection, and every victory puts us at risk of being too complacent to go further and take up far-reaching and robust reforms.
But a category-based approach also has numerous advantages. Different solutions, ranging from expunging a minors criminal record to deleting stale credit history and delisting non-consensual pornography, can be worked out independently of one another. Clear justifications can be given for why special types of information are so problematic they should be obfuscated or removed from different systems. At the end of the day, categories of information that clearly do not belong in the wrong hands, such as non-consensual pornography, can be handled with comparative ease. Meanwhile, grey areas, like what to do about privacy-invasive public records, can be addressed later on as the discourse surrounding them matures.
Googles calculus for delisting seems to target information that is both harmful and without legitimate value to the public. This is a useful criterion, and the cases it covers can be expanded. As new technologies evolve and we become clearer about which categories of information should not be ripe for the picking, company policy or law might obscure additional classifications, such as biometrics and mugshots used to exploit people.
3) The right to be forgotten in the US will be, in effect, the right to obscurity
The entire history of forgetting in the US is really about making things hard to find. A minors criminal records and a persons outdated credit activity arent obliterated; indeed, many people know about them. In effect, then, what Googles new policy does is give people a limited right to obscurity .
Obscurity protections are not perfect and, as Google acknowledges , revenge porn will remain available on websites. But delisting it from search engines can make information harder to access and interpret. Such a burden can effectively deter many people from doing harmful things. According to University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks, given Googles global dominance, delisting revenge porn  will mean fewer victims of revenge porn in the future .
The ideals driving the poorly-described right to be forgotten are about striking the right balance between information availability and obscurity. Although Google claims that its stance on revenge porn is but  narrow and limited policy , the company is actually paving the way towards something far more substantial in the US.

Earlier this year, leaked emails from the Sony hack revealed that the Oscar-winner had requested details of his ancestry be suppressed after it was discovered that his background included a history of slave-owning . After producers complied, it caused controversy and it now puts the shows future at risk.
PBS and WNET have determined that the series co-producers violated PBS standards by failing to shield the creative and editorial process from improper influence, and by failing to inform PBS or WNET of Mr Afflecks efforts to affect program content, broadcaster PBS said in a statement.
The third season has now been postponed and the decision over a fourth season is yet to be made. PBS stated that it needs to be satisfied that the editorial standards of the series have been successfully raised to a level in which we can have confidence before saying yes.

The public network has also requested that if the show does move forward, the makers will need to employ another fact-checker and an independent geneaologist. Additionally, the Ben Affleck episode will be removed from circulation.
After the details emerged of Afflecks request, the star admitted that he was ashamed of what was discovered.
I didnt want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves, Affleck said in a statement posted to Facebook in April. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.

Migrants and police were engaged in an uneasy standoff on the motorways around Calais on Wednesday, as groups of young men tried to exploit the continuing disruption to climb on trucks bound for the UK.
Several hundred lorries were still queueing on the main roads leading to the ferry port and Eurotunnel, following Tuesdays strike by French ferry workers.
On the motorway above the main migrant camp  home to 3,000 people  there were regular skirmishes in the afternoon. Each time a queue of lorries formed, the migrants  many of whom have fled war and persecution in the Middle East and east Africa  abandoned what they were doing and ran up the bank to try and break into them.

French police tried to stop them and at one point officers drew their batons and hit out at a group of young men before using pepper spray on them.
Watching from the edge of the camp, Teddy, 20, from Eritrea said it had been a very difficult 24 hours. Lots and lots of people have been trying because of the lorry queues and some of them have made it, but it is very dangerous. The police have been very aggressive and many people have been injured trying to jump on the underside of lorries.
An Afghan man nearby held out his injured hand and said a police dog bit him last night. Are there any doctors? he asked.  Many people have been hurt but what else to do? We have to keep trying because this is no place to stay.
In the UK, the home secretary, Theresa May, said British and French authorities had stopped significant numbers of migrants climbing aboard lorries in Calais and entering the UK in the last two days. She said the UK border force had put in place tried and tested contingency plans to deal with chaotic scenes that led to the Channel tunnel being closed.
David Cameron moved to ease tensions with France over the migrant crisis in Calais, calling for an end to the finger pointing over who is to blame and signalling that Britain is prepared to contribute more resources if necessary. The prime minister described totally unacceptable scenes in Calais.

Asked what Britain was planning to do about the crisis, Cameron said it must work more closely with the French, tackle the people-smuggling gangs in north Africa and do more to make the UK a less attractive place for migrants.
The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart , told French radio on Tuesday that Britain had not offered a penny to help the authorities in Calais ease the pressure caused by the increasing number of migrants arriving in the town, as they attempt to travel to Britain.
But Cameron, speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, struck a conciliatory tone. This is a strong partnership that we have in place and we should keep it that way.
He said the UK would provide more security assistance to French authorities if necessary, including sending more personnel and sniffer dog teams. He also said more needed to be done with other EU countries to prevent migrants from attempting the journey to Europe in the first place. Thirdly, weve got to do more to make sure Britain is a less easy place for illegal migrants to come to and work in. Thats what our immigration bill is all about.

The heightened diplomatic tension came amid disruption caused by striking employees of the French firm MyFerryLink, whose industrial action forced the closure of the Channel tunnel and led to the cancellation of train and ferry services. Travel chaos was subsiding on Wednesday as cross-Channel services resumed but authorities in Calais continued to grapple with desperate migrants seeking to take advantage of the disruption.
One group of young men  some as young as 15  were chased away by a lorry driver as they tried to break into hisvehicle. This is terrible, worse than its ever been, said the driver from Poland, as the queue inched forward. It has been like this all night, it has been very difficult.
Another migrant managed to break the cord on the back of a nearby truck and was trying to clamber on board before he was confronted by the French driver. Neither man wanted to talk. A 17-year-old Eritrean man sitting by the side of the motorway slip road said he and his friends had been up all night trying to get into lorries bound for the UK. Many people have been trying, but it is very difficult. We are very tired now.
Emmanuel Agius, a deputy at Calais town hall, claimed that the British PM was in danger of sparking a diplomatic incident. David Cameron says he does not want these migrants, he doesnt want to take responsibility but the UK is part of the EU and it cannot continue to try and play two roles.
It is not acceptable to say: we are insular, we are an island and we will only be part of Europe how and when we want  you Europeans just deal with it. That is too easy. If he continues to speak in that way then he is in danger of creating a diplomatic incident.

For there to be a lasting solution to the crisis Europe had to work together, and that included the UK, Agius added. If the UK and Mr Cameron want to leave Europe, then at least the situation would be clear and precise and in that case the British could have their border back in the UK instead of here in Calais, he said.
Agius said migrants have one idea in their heads and that is to cross the 30km to Dover for a better life in the UK. He said the UK needs to stop ignoring that reality and take responsibility.

Nato, in an echo of the cold war, is preparing to re-evaluate its nuclear weapons strategy in response to growing tension with Russia over Ukraine, sources at the organisation have said.
Updating Natos nuclear policy would amount to an escalation in tit-for-tat exchanges with Russia since the Ukraine crisis erupted last year. Expressing concern over President Vladimir Putins announcement last week that Russia was to buy 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles, Nato officials also said there was alarm over Russian rhetoric on nuclear weapons and the extent to which such weapons are involved in military exercises.
A Nato diplomat said: There is very real concern about the way in which Russia publicly bandies around nuclear stuff. So there are quite a lot of deliberations in the alliance about nuclear [weapons], but it is being done very slowly and deliberately. We need to do due diligence on where we are.
The issue is being discussed on the margins of a two-day Nato ministerial meeting that began in Brussels on Wednesday. But the US is keen to get the issue on the table and a meeting of Natos ministerial nuclear planning group is likely to be held later this year  earlier than planned  to discuss refreshing the nuclear doctrine.

Among potential topics is an enhanced role for nuclear weapons in Nato military exercises. Also up for discussion would be how to better interpret Russian warnings about nuclear weapons: whether they should be taken seriously or whether these amount to no more than rhetoric.
Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, British defence secretary Michael Fallon said Russias nuclear messaging is not helpful. He added: It is important we understand its implications for the alliance.
Since the peak of the cold war, the US and Russia have slashed their nuclear arsenals but Russia still has an estimated 1,582 strategic warheads deployed on 515 missiles and bombers, while the US has 1,597 deployed on 785. There is no suggestion at Nato headquarters of a return to the days of nuclear arms races and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, and the US has specifically ruled out returning cruise missiles to Europe .
But Nato officials, military and diplomats are raising worries that the US-led alliances existing nuclear posture reflects the thinking of a decade ago when Russia was viewed as a potential partner. That strategy badly needed to be refreshed, they suggested. Although Nato nuclear exercises are classified, the organisation does, like Russia, conduct them. The concern at Nato is that the role of nuclear weapons in such exercises needs to be upgraded to take account of the changed relationship with Moscow.
Natos secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, said the nuclear issue was serious and had to be treated with caution. The nuclear activities, the investments of Russia in new nuclear capabilities, and the exercise activities by Russia in the nuclear domain is part of the global picture where we see a more assertive Russia.
The American ambassador to Nato, Douglas Lute, briefing journalists in Brussels on Tuesday, said: There is a general assessment under way in Washington and a parallel assessment here in Nato to look at all the possible implications of what Russia says about nuclear weapons, its doctrine and so forth, its pronouncements, its rhetoric, and what we actually see on the ground in terms of development and deployment. Nato, he added, had not yet reached any conclusions or decided on what are the actions that are implied in our response.

Putin last week announced plans to purchase 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles and complained of US acts in eastern Europe as amounting to the most aggressive since the cold war. Russia argues that the expansion of Nato into eastern Europe and its courting of Ukraine has been a repeated provocation.
A Nato official said: Deterrence, based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities is a core element of our overall strategy. We cannot go into detail on our nuclear discussions. These are internal, sensitive and classified matters. What I can say is that Nato continuously assess all aspects of Russias military activities, including Russias nuclear rhetoric.
A second Nato official said: The Russian leadership is rhetorically lowering the threshold when it comes to nuclear weapons and this is something which should not be done. It largely wasnt done even during the cold war.
This kind of nuclear threat was something which we found quite surprising, quite negative and is something we believe should be avoided but we are closely examining it carefully as part of the overall examination of Russias activities in Europe and how we at least in Nato must unfortunately react.
Fallon announced on Wednesday evening that the UK is to double its spending on training Ukrainian troops from 3m to 6m.

British intelligence agency GCHQ is facing fresh calls to reveal the extent of its involvement in the US targeted killing programme after details of a fatal drone strike in Yemen were included in a top secret memo circulated to agency staff.
A leading barrister asked by the Guardian to review a number of classified GCHQ documents said they raised questions about British complicity in US strikes outside recognised war zones and demonstrated the need for the government to come clean about the UKs role.
The documents, provided to the Guardian by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and reported in partnership with the New York Times , discuss how a joint US, UK and Australian programme codenamed Overhead supported the strike in Yemen in 2012.
The files also show GCHQ and Overhead developed their ability to track the location of individuals  essential for the targeted killing programme  in both Yemen and Pakistan. The legality of the USs lethal operations in both countries has been questioned by international lawyers and human rights groups.
Jemima Stratford QC, who reviewed the Snowden documents for the Guardian, said: Assuming that the documents which I have seen are genuine, in my view they raise questions about the extent to which UK officials may have had knowledge of, or helped to facilitate, certain US drone strikes which were not carried out in the context of an international armed conflict, she said.
These documents underline why greater transparency as to UK official policies would help to ensure legality from a domestic and international law perspective.
Stratford published a legal opinion last year warning that UK intelligence support for lethal strikes outside traditional battlefields  such as Iraq and Afghanistan  was likely to be illegal. In our view, if GCHQ transferred data to the NSA in the knowledge that it would or might be used for targeting drone strikes that transfer is probably unlawful, she wrote.

British officials and ministers follow a strict policy of refusing to confirm or deny any support to the targeted killing programme, and evidence has been so scant that legal challenges have been launched on the basis of single paragraphs in news stories.
Commenting on the new information, Conservative MP David Davis said: Its no good the government hiding behind its standard security line that they never comment on security matters. The phrase extra-judicial killing is a euphemism. What we are talking about here is murder. It may be that you are murdering terrorists and the people are villains, but it is still murder. We dont countenance murdering criminals in Britain. Why should we countenance murdering them in Yemen or anywhere else?
It is important the government makes plain: what are the limitations it puts on the use of its intelligence, and under what statutes and on whose approval this information is shared?
Even a former head of GCHQ has objected to Britains continuing secrecy over the issue. David Omand joined Davis and fellow MP Tom Watson in signing a letter last November calling on the government to disclose its guidance on intelligence-sharing where individuals may be targeted by covert strikes.
The release of the information, they wrote, would underline the distinction between Reaper strikes by our armed forces in Afghanistan, and now Iraq, and those of other states elsewhere.
Watson told the Guardian: The government has always maintained we are not complicit in targeted extra-judicial killings. Any note of ambiguity identified by these documents has to be thoroughly investigated.
The new documents include a regular series of newsletters  titled Comet News  which are used to update GCHQ personnel on the work of Overhead, an operation based on satellite, radio and some phone collection of intelligence. Overhead began as a US operation but has operated for decades as a partnership with GCHQ and, more recently, Australian intelligence.
The GCHQ memos, which span a two-year period, set out how Yemen became a surveillance priority for Overhead in 2010, in part at the urging of the NSA, shortly after the failed 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot in which Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his underpants on a transatlantic flight.
Ten months later a sophisticated plot to smuggle explosives on to aircraft concealed in printer cartridges was foiled at East Midlands airport. Both plots were the work of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the Yemen-based al-Qaida offshoot.
GCHQ noted in the memos that the NSAs focus on Yemen was a great opportunity for UK agents to focus on any leads they had in the country. Given the domestic terror threat to the UK as well as internal conflicts in the country, GCHQ has multiple reasons to be monitoring individuals in the country.
One Comet News update reveals how Overheads surveillance networks supported an air strike in Yemen that killed two men on 30 March 2012. The men are both described as AQAP members.
In the memo, one of the dead men is identified as Khalid Usama  who has never before been publicly named  a doctor who pioneered using surgically implanted explosives. The other is not identified.
In the two years of memos seen by the Guardian, this was the only specific strike detailed, raising questions as to why GCHQs team decided to notify staff about this particular strike among hundreds.

The Guardian asked GCHQ whether this was because UK personnel or bases were involved in the operation. The agency declined to comment, and offered no explanation as to why British staff were briefed on this particular strike.
US officials confirmed to Reuters in 2012 that there had been a single drone strike in Yemen on 30 March of that year. According to a database of drone strikes maintained by the not-for-profit Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the only incident in Yemen on that date targeted AQAP militants, causing between six and nine civilian casualties, including six children wounded by shrapnel.
Asked whether the strike described in the GCHQ documents was the same one as recorded in the Bureaus database, GCHQ declined to comment.
The incident is one of more than 500 covert drone strikes and other attacks launched by the CIA and US special forces since 2002 in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia  which are not internationally recognised battlefields.
The GCHQ documents also suggest the UK was working to build similar location-tracking capabilities in Pakistan, the country that has seen the majority of covert strikes, to support military operations in-theatre.
A June 2009 document indicates that GCHQ appeared to accept the expanded US definition of combat zones, referring to the agencys ability to provide tactical and strategic SIGINT [signals intelligence] support to military operations in-theatre, notably Iraq and Afghanistan, but increasingly Pakistan. The document adds that in Pakistan, new requirements are yet to be confirmed, but are both imminent and high priority.

The note was written months after Barack Obama entered the White House and escalated the use of drones in Pakistan, conducting more strikes in his first year in office than George W Bush had in the previous four years.
By this point NSA and GCHQ staff working within the UK had already prioritised surveillance of Pakistans tribal areas, where the majority of US covert drone strikes have been carried out. A 2008 memo lists surveillance of two specific sites and an overview of satellite-phone communications of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, in which nearly all Pakistan drone strikes have taken place, among its key projects.
British intelligence-gathering in Pakistan is likely to have taken place for a number of reasons, not least because UK troops in Afghanistan were based in Helmand, on the Pakistani border.
One of the teams involved in the geo-location of surveillance targets was codenamed Widowmaker, whose task was to discover communications intelligence gaps in support of the global war on terror, a note explains.

Illustrating the close links between the UK, US and Australian intelligence services, Widowmaker personnel are based at Menwith Hill in the north of England, in Denver, Colorado, and in Alice Springs in Australias Northern Territory.
Other Snowden documents discuss the difficult legal issues raised by intelligence sharing with the US.
A secret 2009 legal briefing suggests that British military lawyers believe that some US operations beyond traditional battlefields may be unlawful  a document that also highlights GCHQs efforts to operate within the bounds of the law in a complex and challenging environment.
The briefing prepared for GCHQ personnel sharing target intelligence in Afghanistan instructed them to refer to senior compliance staff before sharing information with the US if they believed it may be used for a detention or cross-border operation.
This, the documents states, was because the US forces were operating under Operation Enduring Freedom rules, which are less restrictive than the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force rules governing UK personnel. As a result, sharing intelligence may result in unlawful activity by GCHQ staff.
The Guardian contacted GCHQ with the information contained in this article, and asked a series of questions on the extent of intelligence sharing with the US in connection with targeted killing, and the legal framework for any such activities. The agency declined to comment on specifics.
The Guardian asked Downing Street why it refused to clarify any UK role in US drone strikes. A government spokesperson said: It is the longstanding policy of successive UK governments not to comment on intelligence operations. We expect all states concerned to act in accordance with international law and take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties when conducting any form of military or counter-terrorist operations.
Asked last year about the Britains role in US operations outside traditional war zones, defence minister Mark Francois told parliament that strikes against terrorist targets in Yemen are a matter for the Yemeni and US governments. Ministers including Sayeeda Warsi have used similar language when discussing drone strikes in Pakistan.
The UK has faced previous legal challenges over the issue. In 2012, the family of a tribal elder killed in Pakistan, Noor Khan, launched a court case in England in which barristers claimed GCHQ agents who shared targeting intelligence for covert strikes could be accessory to murder. Judges twice refused to rule on the issue on the grounds it could harm the UKs international relations.

Vancouver has approved new rules to license and regulate illegal marijuana stores, making it the first city in Canada to attempt to control the burgeoning market  and setting it on a collision course with the countrys federal government.
After four days of public hearings, the city council approved regulations that will set zoning controls and hefty licence fees for Vancouvers many pot shops: the city of 600,000 is thought to have more marijuana stores than its 109 Starbucks locations.
Neon green cannabis leafs have sprouted in shop windows across the city, and many shops employ in-house naturopaths available for quasi-medical consultations.

The boom has come amid a haze of legal ambiguity: the supreme court has forced the Canadian government to allow access to medical marijuana for those with prescriptions, but it remains illegal to sell pot products from a retail storefront. Meanwhile, the Vancouver police department has stated that a crackdown on pot shops is not a priority for them.
In an attempt to resolve the contradiction, the council launched public consultations on regulation in April.
The proposal prompted a furious attack from Ottawa. Federal health minister Rona Ambrose wrote to Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson suggesting that any attempt to regulate the pot shops would mean legitimizing an illegal activity. She called on council to reject the proposal and close the stores down.
Vancouver councilor Geoff Meggs said Ambroses comments showed that she was completely out of touch with the realities on the ground.
Addressing council before the vote, Meggs said he believes Vancouvers approach will make a difference across the country.
I think its going to be a significant decision. I think it will have widespread impact.
Many Canadians  including the federal Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, local police departments and health authorities  have argued that the time has come to legalize, control and tax marijuana. The sticking point remains the federal government, who are the only authority with the power to legalize pot, and who remain fervently pro-prohibition.
Ambrose released a statement shortly after the Vancouver vote, restating the governments position.
Storefronts selling marijuana are illegal, and under this Conservative Government will remain illegal, the statement said.
As Canada gears up for the October federal election, she also took time to take a political pot shot at Trudeau.
These stores have absolutely no regard for the rule of law and have been caught selling marijuana to kids  they represent Justin Trudeaus vision for Canadian neighbourhoods from coast to coast to coast, Ambrose wrote.
Former British Columbia attorney-general Geoff Plant QC expressed support for regulation: The federal government is increasingly out of touch. They are stuck in a reefer madness, non-evidence-based position.
The government of Canada has  with its failure to grasp the reality of marijuana and grapple with it  actually made things worse, he argues. They have allowed a black market to flourish, and now a white market has taken hold, and the longer it goes on, the harder it is to bring it back to a clean slate and introduce proper policy.
In an attempt to sidestep a potential legal challenge from Ottawa, Vancouver has been careful to say they are simply regulating the businesses involved, not the products they are selling.
Under the new rules, dispensaries will be banned from operating within 300 metres of a school, community centre, or rival pot shop. They will also be obliged to pay a business license fee of $30,000, compared to a regular business license of just $250.
Over the period of public consultation, more than 200 people put their views forward in person or by email to council. City manager Penny Ballem said that the most striking submissions came from people working so-called compassion clubs, where medical marijuana is provided for sufferers of cancer and other illnesses.
Following those presentations, the proposed business license fee for that model was dropped to $1000.
It was very compelling to hear how they provide access at an affordable rate to the most severely disabled and in need, Ballem, a physician by training, notes.
They are a different category to those simply retailing marijuana.
Ballem said she believes interest in the marijuana market has boomed as a reaction to the legalization of pot in nearby Washington and Oregon states.
They see a change in Canada as imminent, and they want to get in on it and get ahead of the game.

        <MainBody>An Irish woman on holiday with her two sons in the resort, described how she grabbed her children and ran for their lives when they heard gunfire erupting from one of the hotels.
Elizabeth OBrien, from Dublin, told RTE raido:
We were on the beach, my sons were in the sea and I just got out of the sea. It was about 12 oclock and I just looked up about 500 metres from me and I saw a (hot air) balloon collapse down, then rapid firing, then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me - because I thought it was fireworks,.
So, I thought oh my God, it sounds like gunfire, so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started saying run, run run! and we just ran to our room, which is like a little bungalow. So we are actually trapped in our room.
OBrien said the Irish consul in Madrid, Spain, called her to say it was a terrorist attack in the hotel next door and told her to stay where she was. She said:
My travel agent told me to go to the reception to speak to the rep, but Im afraid. Im stuck in the room with my two sons, not knowing whats going on.

France launches terror inquiry after factory attack
One attacker killed by firefighter and another arrested after police find severed head and flag with Islamist inscriptions at site of explosion

France has launched a terrorism investigation after police found a decapitated body and a flag with Islamist inscriptions following an attack on a factory belonging to a US gas company in the south-east of the country.
It is a terror attack. There is no doubt about it, the countrys president, Franois Hollande, told reporters in Brussels before leaving a European council summit to return to Paris.
A decapitated body found at the scene had a message written on it, Hollande said, without elaborating. Reports suggested the person, who has not yet been identified, might have been beheaded before the attack.

As well as the body, one suspected attacker was killed at the scene by a firefighter, according to Frances interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve. Two people were also injured in the attack.
Another suspected attacker was arrested, Cazeneuve said. His identity had yet to be confirmed, but he was thought to be Yessim Salim. The minister added: This person was under investigation for radicalisation but this investigation was not renewed in 2008. He had no police record.
According to local newspaper Dauphin Libr, another suspect has been arrested at his home in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier. He is believed to be a man seen driving around near the factory in a Ford car before the attack in a suspected reconnaissance attempt, the paper said.
Details of the attack remained unclear hours after police were first called at about 10am (0800 GMT).
According to a source linked to the investigation and quoted by Agence France-Presse, the incident began when one or several individuals drove a vehicle into a factory belonging to the US multinational Air Products in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon. There followed an explosion, which some reports said was apparently caused by gas canisters.
Speaking in Brussels, Hollande outlined what was known: This attack was in a vehicle driven by one person, perhaps accompanied by another, which rammed its way at high speed into this establishment which contained bottles of gas. The intent was without doubt to cause an explosion. It was a terrorist attack.
Another security source told the Associated Press a severed head was found on top of the gate at the entrance to the factory. The official said the body was found near the site of the explosion, and it seemed the blast was not the cause of the decapitation.
Two flags, one white and one black, both with Arabic inscriptions, were found at the scene, the same source told AP.
Map of the attack
Air Products confirmed there had been an incident at its factory and said all staff had been evacuated.
We can confirm that an incident occurred at our facility in LIsle-dAbeau, France this morning, a statement said. Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for. Emergency services are on site and have contained the situation. The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities.
Hollande, who said he would return immediately to the lyse palace, said the vehicle was crashed into the building with clearly an intention to cause damage. Police and troops had been deployed and all measures are being taken to prevent any other tragedies, he added.
France has been on alert for possible Islamist-related attacks since gunmen killed 17 people in January in assaults on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly and a Jewish food store.
Hollande said the response to such attacks should be measured. He said: We all remember what has happened in our country, and in other countries. There is a lot of emotion, but emotion is not the only answer. We need action, deterrence, and we need to spread out values and to never give in to fear.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, spoke to Hollande on Friday, Reuters cited an unnamed official as saying. The prime minister has just spoken to President Hollande to express his sympathies for what looks like an appalling incident there, they said. It clearly looks an extremely concerning situation and our thoughts are with all those affected by it.
Air Products, based in Pennsylvania, US, supplies gases, chemicals and associated equipment. It has 20,000 employees and outlets in 50 countries.

'The Marikana massacre is a tale of utter shame for South Africa'
Injustice and suffering have prevailed after report fails to hold a single person accountable for the deaths of 34 striking miners, writes Ranjeni Munusamy

Ramaphosa, a board member of Lonmin platinum mine where thousands were protesting in August 2012  made phone calls that allegedly escalated the confrontation; sent emails reportedly calling for action to be taken against these criminals, whose crime was to seek a wage increase; and held secret meetings to get the government and police to act in a more pointed way to quell the unrest.
Thirty-four miners were killed during the strikes  the bloodiest massacre by South African security forces since the end of racial apartheid.
But for Judge Ian Farlam leading the investigation, to tie the massacre to the person holding the second highest post in government, Ramaphosa would have had to be standing behind the police line with a loudspeaker instructing the police to shoot at the striking Lonmin workers himself.
Farlam said in his 646-page report that the commission could not find even on a prima facie basis that Mr Ramaphosa is guilty of the crimes he is alleged to have committed despite hearing from lawyers, witnesses and observers how Ramaphosas interventions were infested with a litany of conflicts of interest.
The commission is of the view that it cannot be said that Mr Ramaphosa was the cause of the massacre, the report states.
For the injured and families of those who died, and those who continue to live in poverty and indignity at Marikana, there was always going to disappointment with the outcome of the commission, because they were looking for accountability at the highest level.
That was never going to happen.
What happened was the opposite. Over a thousand days since the deaths of 34 people not a single person is being held accountable. There is no justice or closure for a single life lost or family destroyed.
The wound stays open. The suffering continues.

They were killed by a state meant to protect them
President Jacob Zuma had the Marikana report in his possession for 86 days before it was fully released. On Thursday night, he announced its key findings , without any specific actions on his part  apart from asking the relevant ministers to study the report and advise him on the implementation of the recommendations.
The commission overall found that a multiple failure from all involved resulted in the violence at Marikana, but in language that is extremely cautious. It found that Lonmin did not use its best endeavours to resolve the labour dispute, and did not respond appropriately to the threat and outbreak of violence. But the company that profits from the sweat of poorly paid workers got off fairly lightly.
The commission found that the companys failure to provide proper housing created an environment conducive to the creation of tension, labour unrest, disunity among its employees or other harmful conduct.
In almost three years since the massacre, the workers live and work in the same conditions that contributed to the violent protest in 2012. Lonmin has not acted to correct the situation, and a slap on the wrist from the commission is hardly stimulus to do so now.
Those who went on strike were people who tried to upset that balance so that their lives might be better
Judge Farlam said he did not agree that there was a toxic collusion between the police and the Lonmin mine, a finding that runs contrary to the narrative of the workers and the victims families. The commission did not recommend any form of compensation for those injured or dependents of the deceased, saying the terms of reference were not wide enough to cover this issue.
The commission also found that the two unions involved, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) did not do enough to prevent the violence. The report said Amcu members sang provocative songs and made inflammatory remarks, which tended to aggravate an already volatile situation. The NUM, it said, wrongly advised rock drill operators that no negotiations with Lonmin were possible until the end of the two-year wage agreement, and also did not take the initiative to persuade and enable Lonmin to speak to the workers.
After waiting 34 months to hear why their loved ones and colleagues were killed, the people of Marikana have to contend with the fact that there is as yet no justice or accountability for the extreme violence visited on them, and no compensation owed to them.
They live in indignity and die in indignity. Their blood and tears mean nothing to the rich and powerful who benefitted from their toil.

Day after day, they pass the killing fields of Marikana and go deep into its bowels so that the balance between the poor and the rich, the prosperous and the damned is maintained. Those who went on strike were people who tried to upset that balance so that their lives might be better. For that they were shot and killed by a state that is meant to protect them.
Marikana is and always will be a tale of utter shame.

Deadly attack on Tunisia tourist hotel in resort of Sousse
At least 27 people, including one gunman, killed in attack on the Imperial Marhaba hotel, according to Tunisian interior ministry
British tourists in Sousse say people began running and screaming when the shooting started

At least 27 people have been killed in an attack on a hotel in the Tunisian beach resort of Sousse, according to an interior ministry official quoted by Reuters.
The attack was on the Imperial Marhaba hotel, a source and local radio said.
A security source at the scene said the body of one gunman armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle lay where police had shot him dead. It was unclear whether there were other assailants.
Elizabeth OBrien, an Irish woman on holiday with her two sons in the resort, described how she grabbed her children and ran for their lives when they heard gunfire erupting from one of the hotels.
We were on the beach, my sons were in the sea and I just got out of the sea. It was about 12 oclock and I just looked up about 500 metres from me and I saw a [hot air] balloon collapse down, then rapid firing, then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me, she told RTE Radio.
Gary Pine, a British tourist close to the scene of the attack, told Sky News he was on the beach and heard what we thought was firecrackers going off 100 yards away, followed by an explosion from the next hotel complex along.
There was a mass exodus off the beach, Pine said, adding that his son told him that he had seen someone get shot on the beach. Pine said guests at his hotel were first told to lock themselves in their rooms, and later to gather in the lobby.
The British foreign office said it was urgently investigating the situation
Sousse, 150kms (93 miles) from Tunis, is one of Tunisias most popular beach resorts, drawing visitors from Europe and neighbouring north African countries. There have been no details on the nationalities of those killed but during the holy month of Ramadan, those on the beach tend to be tourists.
Tunisia has been on high alert since March when Islamist militant gunmen attacked the Bardo museum in Tunis, killing a group of foreign tourists in one of the worst attacks in a decade in the north African country.

How Britain's khat ban devastated an entire Kenyan town
Mild stimulant used to be Mauas most valuable export, bringing prosperity to all involved. A year since it was outlawed, the local economy has been devastated

Share on WhatsApp
In a quiet and unassuming town tucked away in a hilly part of eastern Kenya , the British home secretary Theresa Mays name is spoken with barely concealed anger. Since her role in the ban of the towns most valuable export, shes become a universally vilified figure.
For more than two decades, Maua enjoyed booming business propelled by the growth and sale of khat, known locally as miraa, a popular herb whose leaves and stems are chewed for the mild high they offer.
But last year the UK, home to one of khats biggest markets, declared the stimulant a class C drug and banned all imports , prompting Mauas rapid descent into economic purgatory.
Since the early 1990s, Britain has imported between 2,500 to 2,800 tonnes a year, according to the Home Affairs committee. Although in its initial findings the committee could not find a compelling health or social reason to ban khat, Mays argument  that continuing to allow trade in the UK would spawn off an illegal export corridor to other European countries where it is banned  won out in what became a controversial cultural debate .
Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food
Miriti Ngozi
Now, a year after the legislation was signed, residents in Maua have been hit hard by a shrinking local economy that has left many facing poverty.
Losses
Edward Muruu is one of the earliest pioneers of the khat export trade. A retired headmaster at a local primary school, he says he has experienced unprecedented losses since the ban came into effect.
I used to ferry miraa (khat) from Maua to Nairobi four times a week using 27 Toyota Hilux trucks, where it was repackaged for export. I used to make around 2,100 a month. Now I am lucky if I bring in 250 per month, he says.
With the European market gone, the only place left for Muruu to sell his stimulant is Somalia , where consumers now dictate how much they pay  and its not much.
The other issue with the Somali market is that the only people who can transport miraa to Mogadishu are Kenyan Somalis, meaning that the rest of us drivers have been put out of work, says a former worker of Muruus, who only identified himself as Kanda.
According to Kanda, if non-Somali drivers attempt the trip they are attacked along the journey. For a town of its size and location, Maua has a disproportionately large number of residents of Somali heritage, most of whom are involved in the khat trade as middlemen. They are also big consumers themselves.

Miraa was the heartbeat of this town
The effects of the London ban have reached everybody in the khat micro-economy, from the big name traders like Muraa to the small fish who depend on the trade for their survival.
Although Muraa has made investments that have cushioned him against the blows of a deeply depleted income, those at the lower end of the food chain have not been so lucky.
Miriti Ngozi, chairman of the Miraa Traders Association, says that many farmers and traders are no longer able to pay school fees or even buy enough food for their families.
The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else
Lawrence Kobia
You have to understand that in this region, subsistence farming has long been overshadowed by the more prestigious miraa farming. Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food and many families are sleeping hungry, he says.
Yet many remain reluctant to uproot their khat crops and plant maize instead, holding on to the hope that their fortunes might one day return.
Pius Mbiti, a trader in his early 30s, is a qualified vet but says that he makes most of his income from picking and selling the stimulant.
On a good day I used to make up to 12 which, when supplemented with earnings from my vet practice, was enough to take care of my family. But since the ban I am lucky if I make even 2 pounds, he says.
He cannot rely on animal medicine any more either because farmers no longer have the money to pay for his services.
This narrative is familiar across the town, with the common refrain being that shutting down miraa imports to London is killing businesses indirectly linked to the herb.
The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else. With revenue from miraa so drastically low, people no longer have the money to buy things, says Lawrence Kobia, who owns a bookshop. He says that his sales have plummeted by more than 40% since last year.
Seizures
In its submissions to parliament, the Home Office committee warned that banning khat would result in the formation of a black market  as seen in the United States and other European countries including Norway and Holland.

Although initially khat sold for between 3 and 4 a kilogram in Britain, the committee reported that if it was banned the price could increase to 318, similar to its price in the US.
Their predictions turned out to be true: there has been a proliferation of the stimulant in London since the ban. While the border police have no statistics on seizures, the London Metropolitan police says it has handled a number of khat-related offences.
A spokesperson said that in the first six months after the ban came into effect, a total of 68 warnings and 14 penalty notices were issued. In addition, 36 people were arrested for possession of the herb, four of whom were later charged.
In the meantime, the Kenyan government is trying hard to get the ban lifted, with president Uhuru Kenyatta even promising the farmers in Maua as recently as February that he will petition to have the market reopened for them.
The farmers, however, see this as a cheap political move to whip up support, complaining that no tangible rewards have come from promises made by politicians regarding the matter in the past.
But the squabbling over high-level politics in Kenya and the workings of the parliament in Britain are meaningless to the miraa farmer in Maua, whose only worry is where the next meal will come from.

The touring exhibition teaching Russians about Russia itself

From photographs to video, every-day items to modern artefacts, an exhibition touring Russia is blurring the lines between art, science and ethnography to educate the population about the cultural and geographical diversity of their own country.
Our peoples idea of geography is an absolute mess. When the countrys main TV channel speaks of Altai being in the far north when it is one of Siberias southern-most republics, it is very hard to accept, says Sofia Gavrilova , one of the exhibitions curators.
Initiated by an organisation called Russia Research, the first project was an installation in the central Russian Udmurt Republic, followed by a focus on the village of Kalevala in Karelia, along the border with Finland, and another on Moscows satellite towns.

I love conducting an experiment among my students, says Gavrilova. I ask them: What makes New York different from Florida? And how is Birobidzhan different from Vladivostok?
Everyone is stuck. No one has a real image in their head, she says. They cant go to these places themselves. Whats left is the mass media, the news, and the image of these regions that the Russian Geographic Society promotes.
Russia Research is made up of a team of well-known photographers, including Ikuru Kuwajima, Maxim Sher, Ivan Mikhailov and Sergey Novikov.
The group is described as Russias first inter-disciplinary project bringing together artists, photographers, geographers, anthropologists, architects and urbanists with the aim to study modern anthropological and geographical processes taking place in Russia today, through the medium of art.

Often, their photographs from Russias diverse regions are accompanied by written commentaries from psychologists, economists, anthropologists, urbanists and sociologists. But none of the commentators are told where the photographs were taken, or what the story behind them is. Instead, theyre forced to speculate. The curators say this allows them to escape from presenting the photographers visions and the commentaries as the truth, but as art.
For example, one caption exhibited at the groups recent show at Moscows Triumph Gallery reads: The women are going to the centre of town, or to the city; theyre waiting for a bus that only goes two or three times a day. The women look solemn, important. Its obvious that they are travelling for the same reason. They are old, but still healthy, still work  maybe at the local dairy plant.

Dmitry Khankin, a partner at Triumph Gallery, says that by allowing artists to approach the subject of social customs and folklore, the nuances that might otherwise be overlooked by anthropologists or other professionals can come to the fore: As strange as it sounds, artists with a strong social conscience are able to measure processes that scientists sometimes arent able to see.
The Ministry of Culture in Moscow has so far supported two exhibitions, but hasnt given a grant for the whole projects. Yet to be convinced of the value of Russia Researchs work,
for the moment, everything is happening gradually, one exhibition at a time.
But as Russia becomes increasingly isolated  and its position in the world increasingly tense  supporters of the organisations work say it offers a unique way for citizens to gain an understanding of their own country at a critical time in the countrys political climate.

The document, drafted by the EUs diplomatic corps, also calls for efforts to persuade people in countries such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova of the benefits of European-style reforms.
The plan was prepared ahead of the EU summit in Brussels and offers a strategy to provide alternatives sources of information to outlets such as Russias state-funded RT television, amid an increasingly polarised media environment sparked by the war in Ukraine .
A communications unit called the East StratCom Team, launched in April, will support EU delegations in the six eastern neighbourhood countries, Armenia, Azerbaijan , Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine  as well as in Russia itself.
The main objectives include communicating and promoting EU policies and values, supporting independent media and increasing awareness of disinformation activities by external actors.
The document states that communication towards the east should first and foremost focus on the development of positive and effective messages regarding EU policies towards the region.
Brussels needs to spread the message that reforms promoted by the European Union can, over time, have a positive impact on their daily lives, the action plan says. It stresses that the strategy should highlight the benefits, not the bureaucracy, focusing on clearly explaining the positive effects of EU programmes and policies rather than going into details about the policies.
Tensions between Europe and Russia have exacerbated since Ukraines former president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following months of protests sparked by his decision to scrap plans to move closer to the EU and improve trade ties with Moscow instead. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 and has backed separatists fighting with government forces in the east.
The action plan also calls for the 28-nation EU to more actively to promote freedom of the media in the eastern neighbourhood region, mainly in concert with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe . Proposals include targeted training and capacity building for journalists and media outlets in the region. Brussels will also consider how best it can support training for journalists experiencing conflict situations, to better enable them to report on issues of relevance to local populations.
Several potential responses to Russian propaganda have been discussed among EU member states, including an initiative led by countries such as Denmark and Latvia to create a Russian-language TV channel.
The action plan does not mention the creation of new media outlets in Russian, but it notes that a number of Member States are already increasing their support for broadcasting in the Russian language to cater to national minorities. In the meantime the EU will continue its support at local level for independent media, including Russian language media, to ensure that citizens have access to alternative sources of information in their local language.
It also states that the EU will ensure that communication materials and products are available in local languages, notably in Russian.

'Armenia is not a new Maidan. Please don't make it one'
Protests against electricity price hikes in Yerevan have little in common with Ukraines uprising  but Russian geopolitical rhetoric has a habit of making self-fulfilling prophecies, says Paul Goble

Many Russian analysts are hurrying to suggest that this weeks protests in Yerevan and their suppression by the Armenian government are the opening round of a new Maidan  an anti-Moscow action promoted and exploited by the west as part of a broader geopolitical struggle.
But such an interpretation of events, if it comes to guide policy, could prove to be the worst form of a self-fulfilling prophecy, transforming what are protests by Armenians about domestic conditions into something more. Should Moscow choose to defend the existing authorities in Yerevan no matter what, it would alienate the country against Russia .
That is the conclusion Sergey Markedonov of the Russian State Humanities University offers in his latest commentary , one that constitutes a clear warning to the Kremlin, as well as analysts inside Russia and abroad, about misreading the situation on the ground by trying to make everything fit a pre-existing framework.
Those who read every case of popular discontent in the post-Soviet space as a Maidan or proto-Maidan are falling victim to a kind of geopolitical determinism, as Markedonov puts it, according to which practically any [protest movement] is only an expression of a proxy war between the United States and Russia.
Such people are taking the lazy way out, and forgetting that a political crisis is not a virus which spreads from one place to another, but rather reflects specific problems, however much some of those who are participating in it  both the regimes andthose who oppose them  draw on past cases in their vocabulary.
What is happening in Armenia is decidedly not like what happened in Ukraine . For one thing, Russia considers Armenia its strategic partner. For another, the government and the people are not divided in their attitude toward Moscow. Some in the government question Yerevans ties with Russia; and many in the streets would like to see those ties deeper.
In short, the Moscow analyst says, the issue of Russia is not the defining element in their struggle and it is critically important that in Moscow people do not fall victim to emotions and look for signs of a Maidan where they are hard to find. Rather, Russia must recognise that the protesters are not unhappy with the Kremlin but with Yerevans own power structure.

Capturing the world of Russian amateur football, one game at a time
A long way from the glitz and gore of the Fifa scandal, photographer Sergey Novikov is travelling to the furthest reaches of the country to capture local teams at play. The Moscow Times reports

Beating on drums and chanting loudly, two dozen supporters of FC Semyonov football club march across their local teams pitch and take their places in the stands.
Down on the grass, photographer Sergey Novikov is instructing the 11 local players how to stand as he takes a pre-match photo, before the game against FC Spartak Tumbotino begins.
The shots Novikov takes are part of his ongoing project, Grassroots , which has seen the 35-year-old spend the past three years travelling around central and western Russia to photograph amateur football teams and their stadiums.
Focusing as much on what lies beyond the pitch as who is playing on it, Grassroots is more than just a collection of sports photography. From the sparse pitches in the far north of the country to fields in central Russia surrounded by churches, Novikovs project also offers a glimpse into everyday life in the furthest of Russias regions.
For me it is always interesting to look at what surrounds the stadium: how does it fit into the urban landscape? Novikov says. The stadiums in the Tver region are often surrounded by concrete blocks. In the village of Pryazha in the Karelia region, they built a wooden fence around the pitch as if it was an ancient fortress.

Sport, or alcohol
Novikov works in Moscow as a photo editor for culture news site Colta.ru. He devotes much of his spare time to Grassroots, funding the project out of his own pocket. The problem is when  you have to travel really far for one photo, its very expensive, he says. In order to make the trips worthwhile, he tries to attend two or three games in the same area over a weekend.
Given the amateur status of the teams that he photographs, Novikovs plans are prone to disruption. He recalls travelling to the northern town of Kirovsk in the Murmansk region only to find out the match had been cancelled. It turned out that a day of mourning had been declared after more than a dozen local officials were killed in a helicopter crash.

Plans to watch another team in the Nizhny Novgorod region also fell through after the club  FC Ruslan, named after a character in Alexander Pushkins poem Ruslan and Lyudmila  withdrew from the game citing financial reasons. Novikov says problems with money are the main reason for cancellations.
When asked why Russian supporters should shun professional clubs in order to watch amateur teams, Novikov notes that grassroots matches say a lot about real life.
Stadiums are especially important in provincial towns because they are often the only place that members of the local population can let off some steam. When everything is going badly at work, when you face chaos and corruption in your town, when your wife leaves you for another man then you have two options: sport, or alcohol.

To find clubs to take part in his project, Novikov scrolls through fixtures on the websites of regional championship federations and then contacts them via Russias VKontakte social media site. Two towns in particular took weeks of planning to photograph  Snezhnogorsk and Polyarny in Murmansk. These , like other so-called closed cities, are successors of Soviet towns which house military or nuclear facilities, locked-off to non-residents. For Novikovs visit official minders accompanied him to and from the games.
Grassroots is still a work in progress, and Novikov says he wants to extend his project eastward beyond the Ural Mountains and into Siberia. His aim is to complete the project by 2018, when Russia will host the Fifa football World Cup .

Grassroots is not Novikovs first football-inspired project. A previous series titled FC Volga United saw him photograph amateur and professional clubs dotted along the banks of the Volga River. It was during this time that Novikov realised: how diverse the footballing landscape of the country was and decided to do Grassroots to document the more unique and interesting pitches across Russia.
The stadium in Semyonov comprises one stand overlooking a synthetic pitch that is dotted with sand-filled holes. Behind the stand lies a copse of birch trees, where several cows are grazing. A herd of cows once almost wandered onto the pitch at another match, Novikov says.
He says he always shoots the team before the game because after the match the weather  or the players moods  might change.
Teams usually respond well to having their photo taken, but Novikov notes the players often act very seriously. Sometimes when I do a group photo, I feel like adding a bit of irony  so if someone not connected to the team comes into the frame, Im for this.
No sooner has the days game kicked off than the group of raucous FC Semyonov fans let off a flare, prompting five or so policemen to march over.
That will be a 3,000 rouble [35] fine, says a middle-aged man dressed in a suit and with glasses perched on the end of his nose, marking the violation down on his clipboard. Hes a match inspector from the regional football federation,and spends the rest of the game lurking around for possible infractions.

At least one police car and a medical officer are obliged to attend every football match organised through football federations, says Novikov, pointing to the designated doctor for todays game  a middle-aged woman wearing three-inch heels and a nurses apron underneath her coat.
In the 70th minute, one of the home players punches an opponent in the face and is sent off. Later, the same sides goalkeeper is ordered off after he flattens an attacking player just outside the penalty box.
FC Semyonov did eventually pull a goal back, but a 45-yard lob sealed the win for Spartak Tumbotino, who won the match 3-1. The two dozen hardcore Semyonov fans left about five minutes before the end of the match, releasing several flares outside the stadium gates as they went.

        <title>What do Iranians really think of a nuclear deal beyond the polls and Twittersphere?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/25/iranians-speak-out-landmark-nuclear-deal</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Related: Offices in houses and the best tea breaks  welcome to working life in Tehran
When I first started at the company, my new co-workers warned me about delving too heavily into politics with others. Most were afraid there might be an informant lurking in the office. Careful  dont say that in front of just anyone, theyd say. Living in Tehran, Im no stranger to talk of bugged rooms, keywords that alert spooky software to tap your phone, and government agents disguised as hipsters.
Ive decided, however, that much of this is the same exaggerated nonsense that must have hovered over the Shah s secret police in the 1970s.
So I unabashedly spark conversations on the nuclear negotiations in the office.
But when I extract myself from the Twittersphere and ignore my politically savvy journalist friends, I notice few at my workplace are engaging with the nuclear negotiations as passionately as Im being told they are. Or as passionately as I am.
Because when Irans nuclear negotiators struck a framework agreement in early April (the Joint Plan of Action  JPOA), I was ecstatic. Our office? Not so much.
Hamed says Im nave if I think anythings going to change.
Gita tries for small talk with a you think so? and then delivers her finishing blow with a lukewarm I sure hope so. Mohsen just lays it on: the mood hasnt changed.
In the office where I spend most of my days, the nuke talks dont always arouse heated discussion. I cant blame my co-workers for not being fired up. Irans reformers have been shot down so frequently over the past few decades that JPOAs, comprehensive JPOAs and framework accords seem like noise set against a backdrop of immense un- and underemployment, inflation that outpaces pay raises, and social restrictions that have no place in 2015 ( lets avoid the hijab for a second: physically playing musical instruments on state TV is still against the rules). That mood will remain unchanged, Mohsen says, until Iranians see the proof in the proverbial pudding.
Related: Iranians optimistic about end to isolation, says new poll
People dont believe its going to happen  its like theyre waiting for the talks to end in disaster, says Hesam, whose smartphone is clearly more grabbing than the prospect of having sanctions lifted. I probe him for more: what about the street celebrations on Vali Asr street after the framework deal  the pictures, the tweets? He looks up as if to swat a fly. People were happier on the first day after the agreement. But over time, they started to doubt it again.
And its not just at the office: were less than a week away from what could be a historic agreement, but it sure doesnt feel like it in my slice of Tehran. That doesnt mean people dont support the deal. Everyone I know would like nothing more than to see the sanctions removed. They just arent excited - or optimistic - about it.
Sometimes, I fantasise about the nuke deal. I see Iran on the cusp of what could be a transformation  an end to nearly four decades of exasperating sanctions that have prevented its full and unhindered reintegration into the international community. Its big. It could bring massive foreign investment , job creation, and cleaner air. It could pry the economy from entrenched establishment types that have abused the countrys relative isolation for their own gain. It could mean McDonalds, Starbucks and maybe somewhere down the line, Shakira and Radiohead.
Then reality smacks me square in the face and Im back at the office. I remember dropping by my co-workers room a while back to follow up with a project we were both assigned to. I noticed he was gone, so I checked a few other rooms to find still more unattended desks. When this happens, I usually head to the cafeteria, which contains one of two televisions hooked up to state TV. Sure enough, the second-floor staff had huddled around the lunch table, gripped by the last few minutes of a soccer match on Channel 3.

Theres nothing unnatural about this. It was just a bizarre contrast to the complete lack of interest in the run up to the JPOA last November, when Iran and the United States  sworn enemies for 36 years  took the first concrete step toward dtente. No one rushed to the cafeteria to see if the negotiations had succeeded, even though IRINN was on, broadcasting live updates. At the time, in fact, most were busy furiously debating an upcoming faceoff between Esteghlal and Persepolis . If there has ever been passion in our office, it was then.
Related: Did the Supreme Leader just torpedo the nuclear talks?
(Admittedly, Ali, who used to sit across from me, would occasionally ask for the latest on the nuke deal, setting off a conversation between me, him, and the guy who sat in the corner. Once he stopped me in the stairwell, saying he was worried about the supreme leader lambasting the US at a critical juncture in the talks. I responded by asking him to picture the utter regime meltdown that would ensue if the supreme leader had instead extended an olive branch to America. Our conversation thus ended).
Determined to find someone beaming with as much enthusiasm as I am in the aftermath of the framework accord, I head upstairs to the third floor. Here I find Asghar, who isnt beaming but is content with the faint scent of hope that has wafted through Iran. Just the fact that theres hope  like when [President Hassan] Rouhani was elected  is enough. Iran has to change gradually, he says, because sudden changes  like a revolution  could end up in a full-blown civil war between the not-so-religious and the religious.
Across the table, Elnaz takes the counterpoint: the agreement only prolongs a status quo she utterly despises. This just means that these people are only going to stay around longer - for another ten to 20 years now, she says of her countrys political leaders.
The lack of excitement still confounds me. Maybe Im cuing into the wrong signs? You would assume an agreement that could fundamentally remake Irans relationship with the world would be glamorous enough to trigger something beyond prosaic elevator chitchat.
Then I think back to what the always-smiley Morteza had to say. Instead of looking at the formidable challenges ahead, he marvelled at the distance we had already travelled.
Related: Iran's state TV tries 'soft power' to win hearts and minds
I mean just the fact that our two presidents have spoken to each other is big, he says of President Rouhanis historic phone call with President Barack Obama in September 2013. Could you imagine that just a short while ago they tried to avoid each other? Like, if one of them learned the other was walking somewhere, he would try to distance himself so they didnt cross paths? Morteza is telling the story of the Islamic republics first reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, and the rumoured lengths to which he went to avoid a run-in with Bill Clinton in the UN bathroom in 1997 (lest he inflame Iranian hardliners).
Maybe I should be paying attention to the little things, like Morteza. Maybe I need to temper my daydreams with a heavy dose of the little changes weve already lived through. Maybe  just maybe  my co-workers are more willing to acknowledge that the nuke deal wont be the be-all end-all panacea than I am. Even for Mohsen, its the gradual changes that might make the wait worthwhile.
Look, all Im saying is that even if we regain our stature and honour in the international community - if the Iranian passport is a valid document again - that alone will make more of a difference to me than any improvement in our livelihoods, he says. So the next time somebody says Iran, people dont just turn around and look the other way.
I dont think it will have much of an impact on our lives, says Mahnaz of a potential nuke deal a day after I interviewed Mohsen in front of her. I think most of the benefit will accrue to the higher echelons of society: I mean, thats the way its always been. I dont know how this is going to be any different.
She continues: Just like [Mohsen] said the other day - if our countrys reputation improves in the eyes of the international community, that alone would be wonderful.
Names have been changed.

Thousands of Armenians have taken to the streets to protest against electricity rate hikes, marching on the presidential palace and staging all-night sit-ins around the main square of the capital, leading to fears in Moscow of a Ukraine-style popular uprising.
The protests in Yerevan, which began on Friday, escalated significantly after police fired water cannons to disperse seated demonstrators on Tuesday morning. By Wednesday evening thousands of people had gathered on Marshal Baghramyan Avenue near the presidential palace, chanting slogans and blocking traffic.
In the early hours of Wednesday, ruling party politicians and others formed a human shield between police and protesters, although negotiations over a potential meeting with the president, Serzh Sargsyan, fell through for the second night.
Smaller-scale protests spread to the cities of Gyumri, Vanadzor and Charentsavan, Armenia Today reported .
A lot more people came on [Tuesday] because they understood that you cant just drive people out like that, Nikolai Torosyan, a journalist at the site PanArmenian.net, who has been attending the demonstrations. They came to protest not just against the electricity price hike but also against the rough way protesters were dispersed.
The sit-ins began on Friday near Yerevans opera house. On Monday night demonstrators marched toward the presidential residence, where they remained through the night. On Tuesday morning riot police sprayed seated protesters with water cannons , then marched forward to force them out. In video of the events, several bulky men in civilian clothes can be seen grabbing protesters and dragging them behind the police line.
According to police, 237 people were detained and seven demonstrators and 11 policemen were injured. They were later all released.
Torosyan told the Guardian that although he was wearing a press badge, police knocked him down and kicked him as they confronted protesters on Tuesday. Other journalists reported having their cameras broken or confiscated by police.
The protests flared up in response to a decision on 17 June by the state utilities commission to raise electricity prices by 17 to 22%, at the request of Electric Networks of Armenia , which has a monopoly on distribution. The utility company is fully owned by the Russian company Inter RAO, which is headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of president Vladimir Putin.

The price hike, which will come into effect on 1 August, is the third in the past two years and provoked anger in the poor landlocked country of three million, where unemployment was reportedly 17% in 2014 and has been rising.
Armenias growing economic woes are closely tied with those in Russia. The rouble lost half of its value in 2014 amid falling oil prices and western sanctions over Moscows role in the Ukraine crisis. As a result, remittances sent home from by Armenians working in Russia have reportedly fallen by as much as half in dollar terms.

The state utilities commission remained unwilling to back down on Wednesday, with spokeswoman Mariam Stepanyan saying it had not made decisions that need to be corrected.
Although its daughter company was behind the price hikes that drew people to the streets, Inter RAO claimed that it had no role to play.
Inter RAO believes that the events in Armenia have become political, and were engaged in business in Armenia, not politics, and we dont plan to participate in these events, spokesman Nikolai Gorelov said on Tuesday, the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reported.
Amid the standoff between Moscow and the west over the Ukraine crisis, Russian politicians have suggested the Yerevan protests could be the start of a US-orchestrated colour revolution to topple the Armenian government.
Igor Morozov, a member of the foreign affairs committee in Russias upper house of parliament, said the unrest in Armenia was exactly the same as the beginning of the Maidan protests in favour of European integration that ousted Ukraines president Viktor Yanukovych last year.

The American embassy in Armenia is also actively participating in the current events in Yerevan, Morozov told state news agency RIA Novosti.
Liberal commentators have in turn blamed the Kremlin. Opposition activist Vsevolod Chernozub tweeted a photograph of Sechin, who heads state oil champion Rosneft as well as Inter RAO, with the caption, The State Department puppet whose company suggested raising electricity prices in Armenia by 40%.

Speakers at the rally in Yerevan have reportedly denounced the idea that they were being influenced by foreign organisations or governments, and protesters have tweeted that they were simply opposing the price hike and that the demonstrations should not be compared to the Euromaidan protests in Kiev.
Although some protestors had waved European Union flags, Torosyan said they included people from all political backgrounds. This weeks events are the first major protests since demonstrations over the presidential election in 2008, he added.
Its new people who are taking part, people themselves who use these services, they are coming out on street, Torosyan said. There are not just poor people, there are middle class, nationalists, liberals. Its a very wide swath of society, and there are no political overtones.
Torosyan said he planned to join protestors again as they assembled on Wednesday evening.
Alexei Malashenko, a Caucasus and Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Centre in Moscow, called the Yerevan demonstrations ordinary economic protests, but said Armenias economic situation would likely remain bad.
Sargsyan only just signed documents with Putin that Russia will sell Armenia cheap gas, and everyone was happy, Malashenko said, referring to a 2014 deal for customs-free sale of oil products that the federation council on Wednesday extended until the end of 2015. Then they raise electricity prices, no one likes this, and they hold up EU flags... Will there be a Maidan in Armenia? I doubt it, but the fact they harshly dispersed protestors has grown the demonstrations.

Rwandan spy chief's arrest exposes the intricacies of international justice
Emmanuel Karenzi Karakes Heathrow airport detention may be justified but will be used to confirm claims that African leaders are unfairly targeted, says Simon Allison

In the last week, the international community has seen three high-profile arrests, and three explosive debates about jurisdiction. First came the arrival of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir on South African soil , and the countrys failure to arrest him for alleged crimes of genocide in Darfur  defying both the international criminal court and domestic law.
Then followed the arrest of Al-Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour , detained at an airport in Berlin at the request of the Egyptian government  who had convicted the reporter in absentia for allegedly torturing a lawyer during the Tahrir Square protests in 2011.
And finally, news broke on Tuesday that Rwandan spy chief Lieutenant-General Emmanuel Karenzi Karake, head of the countrys notorious National Intelligence and Security Services, had been arrested while trying to depart from Londons Heathrow airport.
So what do these three cases tell us about international justice?
Where Bashirs is an example of the top-down approach  where an international body investigates and prosecutes crimes anywhere in the world  Mansours shows national agreements and organisations such as Interpol helping countries enforce their national laws in other jurisdictions.
The arrest of Karake  one of 40 Rwandans indicted by a Spanish judge in 2008 for allegedly ordering revenge massacres in the wake of the Rwandan genocide in 1994  is a good example of universal jurisdiction in action.
The term refers to the idea that a national court may prosecute individuals for any serious crime against international law  such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and torture  based on the principle that such crimes harm the international community or international order itself, explains the International Justice Resource Centre.
The majority of states  163 of the 193 UNs member , according to Amnesty International (pdf)  provide for some kind of universal jurisdiction, but few exercise it.
Spain is a notable exception: it has actively prosecuted international crimes committed in faraway places including Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala  and now Rwanda.
Karakes arrest is a major test of universal jurisdiction in action

Karakes arrest is a major test of universal jurisdiction in action. In addition to accusations relating to the post-Rwandan genocide massacres, Karake is implicated in the killing of hundreds of civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo during fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan forces in 2000, according to Human Rights Watch.
In 2009 a Finnish court tried Francois Bazaramba, a former Rwandan preacher, with genocide and 15 counts of murder for his role in the 1994 atrocity , exercising its law which allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.
Selective justice?
But although the legal case for Britain to extradite Karake to Spain is strong, there are political considerations that will impact on the process.
Britain and the Rwandan government have a close relationship: the east African country is a major destination for British aid, and president Paul Kagame has a  close working relationship  with former British prime minister Tony Blair.
Already, Rwanda is putting on heavy diplomatic pressure to secure Karakes release, with its ambassador to the UK describing the arrest as an insult.
Williams Nkurunziza, the Rwandan high commissioner to the UK, told the BBC World Service: We take strong exception to the suggestion that hes being arrested on war crimes. Any suggestion that any of our 40 leaders are guilty of crimes against humanity is an insult to our collective conscience.
But the British government wont be able to ignore its courts  like South Africa did over Bashir.
Which begs the question: why was Karake detained in the first place? According to media reports, Karake has made several trips to Britain since 2008 but has been permitted to leave each time. This implies either that something has changed  perhaps the furore around Bashirs non-arrest forced Britains hand  or that some border official was a little over-zealous in the execution of his duties.

Another factor that politicians will be considering is the ramifications that extraditing Karake will have on the already strained relations between the African continent and organs of international justice.
Karakes arrest is a public relations coup for African leaders looking for further justification that they are being unfairly targeted by the western justice.
In December Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, said the international criminal court is a tool to target Africa, while Rwandas own president Paul Kagame accused the court of selective justice . This is in some sense true: since its establishment in 2002, the ICC has heard 22 cases and indicted 32 individuals . All of them are African.
While there are sound reasons for the German court to have released Mansour  and for Britain to extradite Karake  these decisions could easily be portrayed by disgruntled African states as western judiciaries unfairly choosing to enforce only western arrest warrants (in the case of Spain and Karake) while neglecting African cases (in the case of Egypt and Mansour).
Britain is now in a delicate position. If it does go ahead with extradition proceedings it risks angering an important ally on the African continent and alienating their supporters  while giving self-interested leaders more fuel for their claims of western bias in international justice.
If it doesnt uphold the case, it will have to defy its own rule of law, potentially dealing a crippling blow to the concept of universal jurisdiction in the process. Its a legal and political minefield.

Unsolved murders of indigenous women reflect Canada's history of silence
As spotlight returns to decades-long violence against native women and girls, calls for national inquiry have been rebuffed but groups refuse to give up

Hanging on the walls of Kattie Lee Fontaines living room are two striking portraits of her cousin Tina, who was just 15 when she disappeared from the streets of Winnipeg, Manitoba, in August 2014.
Tina and her four cousins, Kattie Lee, Rose, Jolene and Angel grew up together on the Sagkeeng First Nation, an indigenous reserve east of Lake Winnipeg with a population of 3,000  and six unsolved cases of missing or murdered First Nations women.
In June 2014, Tina travelled to Winnipeg to rekindle her relationship with her estranged biological mother. Her family reported her missing, and five weeks later, on 8 August, Fontaine was picked up by police in a vehicle that had been pulled over for drunk driving.
Despite the missing persons report, the officers let Tina go, and later the same day she was found passed out in a downtown alleyway. Paramedics took her to hospital, where she was handed over to a social worker to be taken into foster care, but she ran away.
Nine days later, Tinas body, wrapped in a plastic bag, was dragged from the Red river. We couldnt even open the casket because of what her murderers did to her, said her great aunt, Thelma Favel. Nearly a year after her death, Tinas family are beginning to lose hope that her killers will ever be caught.
Meanwhile her cousins fear that they could suffer the same fate as Tina: the four girls live in the North End, an area of Winnipeg rife with violence and sexual harassment. We feel even less safe since her death. We miss her so much, says Kattie Lee.
Tina is just one victim in an decades-long epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women. Ever since the 1970s  when aboriginals were encouraged to migrate to the cities  women of all ages have been shipped back to their families in coffins, said Derek Nepinak, the Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC). I lost an aunt in Winnipeg in 1978, he said. This is not a new phenomenon by any means.
But Canadians are finally starting to pay attention.
In its first attempt to gauge the scale of the problem, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) last year retrieved data from 300 police authorities across the country. The study concluded between 1980 and 2012, at least 1,017 First Nations women were murdered, while a further 108 went missing in suspicious circumstances.
Last week, the RCMP released an updated report , which concluded First Nations women are four times more likely to go missing or be murdered than other Canadian women. While aboriginal women represent just 4.3% of Canadas female population, they represent 16% of female murder victims and 11% of missing persons cases involving women, the report said.
The update also said in the 12 months since the first report, 11 more indigenous women had gone missing.
It isnt really high on our radar
When the findings were first published, thousands gathered for candlelight vigils in cities across Canada , and chiefs and activists renewed their calls for a national inquiry into the countrys indigenous femicide.
But those calls have repeatedly been rebuffed by the Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, who has argued the problem is mainly one of domestic violence and criminality on indigenous reserves.
Asked about the possibility of a national inquiry by the CBC state television in December, Harper replied:  It isnt really high on our radar, to be honest. 
First Nations leaders acknowledge that violence is a problem on the reserves  which are beset with poverty, drug abuse and unemployment. But only 40% of the countrys indigenous people actually live on reserves, and activists and analysts say the abuse and murder visited on Canadas indigenous women reflects a broader history of marginalization and abuse.
That view is shared by the United Nations, which has repeatedly called for a national inquiry into violence against First Nations women, similar to the investigation launched into the murder of hundreds of women in Ciudad Jurez in Mexico .
The victimisation of native women is partly the legacy of colonial heritage
Authors Niklas Bruun and Barbara Bailey
The UNs Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (Cedaw) concluded last year that the Harper governments refusal to investigate the violence was a grave violation of indigenous womens rights.
The victimisation of native women is partly the legacy of colonial heritage where gender-based violence is linked to the lack of realization of their economic, social, political and cultural rights, said the authors of the report, Niklas Bruun and Barbara Bailey in an email.
Nahanni Fontaine, a special adviser to the Manitoban government on aboriginal womens issues, argues that the violence is a form of collateral damage wrought by centuries of prejudice. From the first moments of contact with European explorers, indigenous women were scorned and stereotyped as promiscuous because they owned their sexuality and were treated as equals by their male counterparts, she said.
Related: Canada confronts its dark history of abuse in residential schools
Such contempt for indigenous women was reinforced by brutal attempts to force First Nations to assimilate into mainstream Canadian society. Earlier this month the countrys Truth and Reconciliation Commission described such policies as a form of  cultural genocide  in a report on the state-sponsored, church-run Indian Residential School system.
Between 1876 and 1996, 150,000 aboriginal children were taken from their families and interned in boarding schools specially designed in the words of the systems founder Sir John A MacDonald, to take the Indian out of the child.
One of those children was Sue Caribou, who in 1972 was separated from her family at the age of seven, and taken to a Catholic school where for the next five years she was physically and sexually abused by missionaries who forbade her from speaking Cree, her native language.
The violence has never stopped: by the time Caribou left the school in 1979, both her parents had been murdered. Now aged 50 years old, Caribou has lost three female relatives to murder. The last was her beloved niece Tanya Nepinak, who disappeared in 2011 on her way to get pizza in Winnipeg. She was 31 years old.
When is this going to end? Its getting worse, Caribou said.
Tanyas body was never found, but police believe she was killed by a man called Shawn Lamb, who in 2012 admitted murdering two other indigenous women, Carolyn Sinclair, 25, and Lorna Blacksmith, 18.

Indigenous groups argue that institutional racism contributes to a culture of impunity for perpetrators of crimes against aboriginal women.
Justice for the missing or murdered
Canadas worst serial killer also targeted First Nations women: pig farmer Robert Pickton tortured and killed at least 33 aboriginals before he was arrested in British Columbia in 2002.
Soon after his arrest, Amnesty International concluded that perpetrators of violent crimes tend to target them because the police in Canada have often failed to provide Indigenous women with an adequate standard of protection.
Polices failings proved fatal for Jennifer McPherson, 41, an Ojibway woman who went missing in British Columbia in May 2013. Her remains were found one week later scattered around the island where she was an off-season caretaker of a fishing resort. McPhersons husband Traigo Andretti, later admitted to choking the 41-year-old and burning her body.
Andretti confessed to murder, but investigators soon discovered evidence linking him to the disappearance of another indigenous woman seven years earlier.
Myrna Letandre had been dating Andretti when she went missing from her home in Winnipeg in October 2006. Her sister, Lorna Letandre, begged Winnipeg detectives to search Andrettis house, but he was released after being interrogated just once and was never charged. He married McPherson a couple of months later. Last year, Letandres remains were found buried in the house  seven years after her sister first raised the alarm.
If the Winnipeg police had properly investigated Myrna Letandres case, my sister would still be alive today, said Kim McPherson, Jennifers sister, her voice still cracking with grief.
Last year, Winnipeg police announced that it was making investigations of missing and murdered aboriginal women a strategic priority; it has also established a special task force of 18 officers to solve 28 outstanding cases of murdered or missing women in the province. The force has also worked on improving relations with the community in the citys poorest neighbourhoods  all of which are predominantly indigenous.
But better policing alone is not the answer, warned Winnipegs police chief, Devon Clunis. The Jamaica-born commissioner said that Canada still needed to embark on a difficult national conversation on discrimination against First Nations.
Its not just simply a police issue. Its not an indigenous community issue. It is an issue for every single person who calls himself a Winnipegger, a Manitoban, a Canadian, he said.
Such a reckoning seems all the more urgent in Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, which was named as  Canadas most racist city  by the national news magazine MacLeans.
The city is home to the countrys largest urban indigenous population, but that population is relegated to relatively impoverished neighbourhoods, which are plagued by underemployment, drug abuse, substandard housing and violent crime.
A dysfunctional foster care system
Activists say that the citys social services  which should be protecting vulnerable indigenous children  are instead exposing them to further risk by plunging them into a dysfunctional foster care system.
Indigenous children make up 87% of the children in foster care in Manitoba, even though they only account for 34% of the provinces population under 18. This means that at any given time, nearly 10,000 native children are under the care of the provincial Child and Family Services department (CFS).
We see a direct correlation between girls who are taken into foster care at a young age and women who go missing, says Grand Chief Nepinak of the AMC. We have to stop traumatising our children.
Carolyn Sinclair was separated from their alcoholic mother when she was only two. She and her sister Amanda were placed in a foster home where Carolyn was sexually abused, and by the time they were teenagers, both girls were using hard drugs.
Amanda, now 35, managed to turn her life around and now has a steady job as a construction worker. Carolyn Sinclair never found a way out of her chaotic lifestyle: she was murdered and dumped near a garbage bin in Winnipeg at the age of 25.
In turn, Carolyns two small children have now been taken into foster care, and Amanda has been refused rights to see them. We dont even know if they are still alive, she said.
For more than a decade, a chronic shortage of foster placements meant that children taken into care were often simply left in hotels in downtown Winnipeg. Tina Fontaine disappeared after running away from a Best Western hotel where she had been given a temporary placement.
In April, a 15-year-old girl in emergency care was violently assaulted and left for dead in the same hotel. Four weeks later, the minister responsible for the CFS, Kerri Irvin-Ross, was promoted to become deputy prime minister of Manitoba.
Indigenous activists such as Sue Caribou see a grim parallel between the casual neglect of the current foster care and the systematic abuse of the residential schools.
Kids are shuffled around in abusive homes. Its starting all over again, she said.
Tina Fontaines great aunt Thelma Favel said she hoped that coverage of her nieces murder would help focus attention on the violence  and perhaps even save a few lives.
Speaking through her tears, she said: My priest has told me that like Jesus died for our sins, Tina died so that other girls could be saved.

Scottish ferry strike shuts down two-thirds of routes

The Scottish ferry operator CalMac has been forced to cancel two-thirds of its routes as a strike by RMT union workers caused more disruption than expected.
CalMac said the 24-hour strike, prompted by a dispute over a potential privatisation , meant only nine of its 27 routes were running.
The publicly owned ferry company, which is facing fierce competition from the private operator Serco for a new contract, said all its larger vessels sailing to the Outer Hebrides  Coll, Tiree, Colonsay, Islay and Arran  remained at the quayside.
Gordon Martin, the RMTs regional organiser for Scotland , said up to 700 crew were taking part in the strike and that picket lines at Gourock  CalMacs headquarters  Ardrossan, Stornoway on Lewis, Oban and Lochranza were very well attended. The vessels are tied up and are going nowhere, he said.
Fridays strike follows two days of work-to-rule by the RMT in a dispute over the preservation of jobs and terms of employment under the next eight-year contract, which starts in 2016.
Talks with the RMT will resume next week but the dispute could escalate further after a second CalMac staff trade union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), which represents 100 ticket office staff and managers, ballots its members on industrial action next week.
Serco, which has already taken over CalMacs contract to serve Orkney and Shetland, is thought to be the favoured bidder for the far larger and more lucrative contract for 27 routes on the Firth of Clyde, inner and outer Hebrides.
Scottish government ministers insist they are required by EU law to put the contract out to open tender, and deny opposition and union charges that awarding the tender to Serco woud amount to privatisation.
The government would still own all the ferries and infrastructure and would set the timetables, routes and fares. Serco would be running a public service contract and would not own the service, the government argues.
CalMacs managing director, Martin Dorchester, said he was disappointed that the strike had gone ahead and said extra sailings overnight and on Saturday would help some travellers reach their destinations.
Those included runners heading for the Barrathon race on Barra and guests travelling to seven weddings in the Western Isles. Putting weddings at risk is just one of the very human consequences this strike is having, Dorchester said. Im grateful for the efforts of staff to salvage peoples big day, but this cannot go on, it is damaging the social and economic fabric of our communities.
He said the RMT should have accepted CalMacs offer to include a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies in its bid, in a last0minute deal to avert the strike.
Martin said that was very welcome but it did not bind Serco or the Scottish government. If CalMac doesnt win the contract it means nothing. As well as being in their bid, we want it written into our collective bargaining agreements and contracts of employment, he said.

Mood shifts in Athens: labour minister says creditors asking for 'suicide of an entire people'
Over in Athens this morning the mood appears to have shifted yet again, reports our correspondent Helena Smith.
Last night, it was optimism that ultimately reigned with senior officials in Greeces governing Syriza party expressing the hope that a cash-for-reform deal was ultimately in sight.
The radical left partys prominent MEP, Dimitris Stratoulis, told the Guardian from Brussels.
There is a detectable shift in stance. Under pressure lenders have retreated on several issues.
This morning, grave doubts were being expressed as to whether a deal was possible at all.
Panos Skourletis, the labour minister who is in close contact with prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels, told Mega TV:
On the basis of what things look like today the possibilities of an agreement are slim. Every time a solution is almost found and there is convergence, they come and say bring us a few more pensioners to execute. What they are asking right now is tantamount to the suicide of an entire people.
The politician, reflecting what is clearly the latest thinking in Syriza, did not rule out fresh elections, or a referendum, if the impasse could not be broken.
If dilemmas occur that are outside the democratic mandate that we have been given, we will once again resort to the people, he said, adding he did not rule out some king of extension being given and negotiations restarting later in the year. I dont exclude that either, he added.

President Obama travels to Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday to deliver the eulogy for Reverend Clementa Pinckney , the pastor of Emanuel AME church who was gunned down last week along with eight others , amid intense speculation over whether he will use such a sensitive moment further to articulate his views on race.
The president will make his funeral oration at TD arena at the College of Charleston, in front of more than 5,000 people including relatives and friends of the victims as well as African American, church and local political leaders. He will be joined by the first lady, Michelle Obama, and Vice-President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill.
It will be one of the most closely scrutinized engagements of Obamas six years in office. With the aftershocks of the gun rampage by an avowed white supremacist still thundering across the deep south, the presidents main focus will be to celebrate the life of a much-loved pastor whom Obama himself knew well.
But he also faces the much more delicate task of offering the nation some kind of moral way forward as it continues to struggle to understand more than a week after the event an act of undiluted racial hatred. State capitals across the south  not just Columbia, South Carolina , where the Confederate flag still flies high  have been racked with soul-searching since the shooting spree on 17 June, much of it directed towards enduring public symbols of the regions slave-owning secessionist past.

In his remarks so far on the Charleston massacre, Obama has tended to emphasize his frustration with Americas lax gun laws which, as he put it the day after the shootings, has forced him to make statements like this too many times. He also made reference in that speech to the Emanuel AME church, the scene of the carnage, as a place of worship founded by African Americans seeking an end to slavery.
But his remarks in public over the past nine days have been restrained, muted almost, in regard to the overt racial nature of the attack. The past nine days have been in keeping with the cautious stance that Americas first black president has consistently adopted when talking directly about the countrys legacy of racial strife.
Whatever the extent of his comments on race on Friday, it is certain that his eulogy will address the many achievements of its subject. The president will have rich material to work with  the aftermath of last weeks massacre has been marked by an outpouring of affection and praise for the 41-year-old Pinckney in both his public roles, as pastor and as state senator.
On Wednesday several thousand mourners filed past Pinckneys open coffin at the South Carolina state house to pay their respects to a man equally at ease in a place of worship as on the floor of the legislature. On Thursday night a wake was held at his church, a place of worship that was so integral to Charlestons African American community over so many years that it became known as Mother Emanuel.
Obama forged his friendship with Pinckney during his first presidential run in 2008, in which South Carolina played a key role as a turning point in the fierce battle for the Democratic nomination between the then US senator for Illinois and Hillary Clinton. Even then, the contest was notable for its racial undertones .
How much further the president chooses to go in the course of his eulogy into the snake pit of modern American race relations remains to be seen. There are signs that as he approaches the end of his term in the White House he is feeling liberated enough to speak more openly  just this week he used the N-word in a podcast, stating that the nation has yet to be cured of racism.
He has also indicated that his post-presidency plan is to try to help young black American men cope with the many hurdles that stand in their way. In the wake of the spate of recent unrest over police behavior towards black citizens in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, the subject of race is clearly at the front of Obamas mind, though only rarely does he give the nation a glimpse of his thinking.

'Offensively tasteless' Mother Canada statue plan sparks outrage against PM
Media and local residents lambaste Stephen Harper for offering financial support to erect a 10-storey statue overlooking the shore of a national park

A plan to erect a 10-storey statue in a national park on one of Canadas most scenic shorelines has prompted outrage and sparked a growing political row as the country heads towards a general election this fall.
The statue of Mother Canada  a cloaked female figure with her arms outstretched towards the Atlantic Ocean  is intended to honour the countrys soldiers who died overseas.
But growing anger over the plan has made it a new focus of opposition to the increasingly unpopular government of Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper .
The proposed monument is an awkwardly remodelled, vastly upscaled version of an earlier statue, known as Canada Bereft , which adorns the memorial to the countrys first world war dead near Vimy, France.
The design has been widely lambasted both for its design and its proposed location in Cape Breton Highlands national park. In an editorial this week, the Globe and Mail newspaper described it as  offensively tasteless  and a hubristically arrogant act of arrogant unoriginality.
The bigger-is-better approach to art is best left to Stalinist tyrants, theme park entrepreneurs and insecure municipalities hoping to waylay bored drive-by tourists, the paper wrote.
The project is the brainchild of Toronto businessman Tony Trigiani, who was inspired after a chance visit to a Canadian war cemetery in Italy and set up the Never Forgotten National Memorial Foundation to realise the plan.
The initiative gained early and enthusiastic support from the Harper government, which has donated the necessary public land and $100,000 from its parks budget to help erect the colossus on a rocky spit along the Cabot Trail, eastern Canadas most popular scenic drive. The foundation hopes to raise $25m to complete the project, in part by selling corporate sponsorships that will be prominently acknowledged on the site.
Growing criticism in the nations media has helped swing opinion against the grandiose scheme, but opponents fear the fate of rocky, windswept Green Cove is already sealed.

Were pleased with the momentum, said Sean Howard, spokesman for Friends of Green Cove. What we dont know is how much time we have. Our worst fear is that theyre going to send the bulldozers in before the federal election this fall.
But until Green Cove becomes concrete cove, Howard added, were going to keep fighting.
Trigianis Never Forgotten National Memorial Foundation and the government hope to have the colossus up by 2017, the sesquicentennial of Canadian Confederation and also the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge.
In addition to the statue, the monument will include such amenities as the Commemorative Ring of True Patriot Love, the True North Commemorative Square and the With Glowing Hearts National Sanctuary  all named after the English lyrics of O Canada, the national anthem.
Howard accuses the monument of a kitsch glorification of war, but local opponents are also angered by the speed with which the project is to be executed.
You have to have a very strange process to get through such a strange product, Howard said. Its hair-raising how fast they want to do it.
A significant majority of those who are engaged with the issue believe that the statue either shouldnt be built anywhere or for sure shouldnt be plopped down in a beautiful national park, Howard said.
A spokesman for Parks Canada declined to answer questions about the monument, describing it as privately funded and referring inquiries to the Never Forgotten Foundation. Trigiani, president of the foundation, declined a request to be interviewed.
With criticism of the monument going national, the most articulate opponent remains Cape Breton resident Valerie Bird, 93, who served as an auxilliary with the royal air force in the Middle East during the second world war. It is vulgar and ostentatious, she said. It certainly doesnt belong in a national park, and I dont think its going to do a darn thing for veterans.
I think the idea of this horrible thing offends veterans, she added. I find it difficult to find words. This is a monstrosity.

After 35 years in development, the worlds first commercially available jetpack will be available next year for $150,000.
The Martin Jetpack is made from carbon fibre and aluminium. It eschews the traditional rockets of science-fiction jetpacks, which are powerful but difficult to control, and instead uses fans.
A two-litre petrol engine drives two fans either side of the pilot to lift the jet pack and up to 120kgs of human into the air, along with a low-altitude parachute for use should things go wrong.
After initial test flights in 2011, an updated version was shown off recently at the Paris airshow. It could fly for up to 30 minutes at speeds as fast as 74 kilometres per hour. Pilots will be able to reach altitudes of 1,000m taking off and landing vertically, meaning rooftops, gardens and parking lots are all viable launchpads.
In fact, Martin believes that the jetpacks ability to land in confined spaces will be its selling point, not aimed at millionaires as an expensive toy, but the emergency services.
I think the first responders will see that as a massive improvement to their capability, Peter Coker, chief executive of Martin told Reuters. Naturally for the ambulance service getting to a point of importance of rescuing people in the shortest possible time [is crucial].

The jetpack will ship for emergency services in the second-half of 2016, with a personal version scheduled to be released the following year.
New Zealand-based Martin Aircraft recently floated on the Australian stock exchange , seeing a $50m investment from Chinese aerospace company Kuang-Chi Science, valuing Martin at $100m. It began taking orders earlier this year, and has been showing off a simulator of the jetpack at airshows including Paris.

A young man has appeared in court charged with starting a bushfire that spread to a coalmine and sent toxic smoke over eastern Victoria in 2014.
The 20-year-old, who cannot be named, has been charged with arson and recklessly causing a bushfire over a blaze in the Latrobe Valley that spread to the Hazelwood open cut mine at Morwell.
The man was arrested on Friday and faced the Latrobe Magistrates Court over the fire, which is alleged to have been started on February 7 in the Hernes Oak area.
It spread to the open cut coal mine two days later, where it burned for several weeks.
Morwell was blanketed in toxic smoke and ash for 45 days, prompting many of the towns 12,000 people to flee their homes.
The man was released on bail and will return to court in September.

The factory targeted in a suspected Islamist attack in south-east France is owned by Air Products , a US company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
The company supplies gases, chemicals and equipment for products ranging from TVs and mobile phones to sports cars and running shoes.
It was unclear on Friday whether the company was targeted because it was American.
In a statement, it said: Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for.
Emergency services are on site and have contained the situation. The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities.
Air Products was founded in 1940 and is now the 276th largest company in the US with $10.4bn of global sales last year. It employs more than 20,000 people in 50 countries.
Its French subsidiary, created in 1990, employs 400 people across a number of sites. It is the third largest producer of atmospheric gases in France , with more than 15% of the market.
The companys chair and chief executive is Seifi Ghasemi, an Iranian who emigrated to the US in the 1960s and holds a masters degree from Stanford University.

Northern Ireland gay marriage ban faces judicial review
First couples in UK to enter civil partnerships delighted with result of legal battle, saying religious views should not affect public policy

The first two couples to become civil partners in the UK have won the right to have the same-sex marriage ban in Northern Ireland subjected to judicial review.
A Belfast high court judge ruled on Friday that Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles, and Charles and Henry Flanagan-Kane, should be granted the review, which is set for the autumn.
Both couples civil partnership ceremonies were held at Belfast city hall, just a short distance from the high court, 10 years ago.
The review is likely to be held in November, alongside several other legal challenges taken by gay couples in the region, and who are backed by the Rainbow Project, an LGBT rights organisation.
Neither couple was in court for Fridays ruling but their barrister and senior counsel representing the Northern Ireland regional government were present to hear Mr Justice Treacy say that he had read the case papers and had already satisfied himself that the matter should proceed to judicial review. The applicant has an arguable case, he said.
Members of the Rainbow Project and Amnesty International were also in court. Others supporting the legal challenge included the former CEO of the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast Dawn Purvis and the actor Nuala McKeever.
Outside court, solicitor Mark OConnor issued a statement on behalf of both couples: We are delighted that we have been able to get over the first hurdle in relation to the judicial process and that the judge today has granted leave for us to bring this judicial review.
We are thankful that the judge has made that decision today. We believe that religious policy and religious views shouldnt be affecting public policy. Thankfully today the judge appears to have accepted that there is an arguable case to answer  and hopefully we will have success in the future in relation to this matter.
Prior to the hearing Grainne Close had said: This is not a religious issue, it is a human rights issue. That is why we are going to court.
Close said she and her US partner had been inspired by Irelands overwhelming vote in favour of gay marriage last month and the joyous scenes that greeted the result of the referendum at Dublin castle.
The Rainbow Projects director, John ODoherty, welcomed Treacys ruling. We are pleased that this case is progressing and that it will likely be heard alongside our clients case challenging the failure of the Northern Ireland government to recognise their lawful marriage.
The current illogical patchwork of marriage laws created by the Westminster government is placing LGBT people in Northern Ireland at an inexcusable disadvantage and we hope that the courts will agree and find that there must be a harmonisation of marriage laws across the UK.
A Sinn Fin motion on marriage equality was defeated in April, with 47 Northern Ireland assembly members voting in support, but 49 unionists against. Even if there had been a small majority in favour, the Democratic Unionist party would have exercised a special veto drawn up under devolution.
The petition of concern rule allows any party to veto legislation if it can argue the law would not have sufficient cross-community or Protestant/Catholic support.
Earlier this month, 20,000 trade unionists staged a rally in Belfast city centre to support gay marriage in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK where LGBT couples cannot be married.
Amnesty International said the ban has turned Northern Ireland into a discriminatory backwater for the gay and lesbian community.

A second police force has joined the search for an aggressive 6ft ostrich-like bird that escaped from a farm in Nottinghamshire. Officers have warned that the rhea bird, which has been missing for four days, poses a very real threat to the public.
The male bird escaped from a farm in the village of Carlton-in-Lindrick between Monday evening and midday on Tuesday through an open gate. South Yorkshire police joined the search on Friday after the on-the-run rhea was spotted in Rotherham.
A South Yorkshire police spokesman said: Police in Rotherham are currently searching in the Rother Valley area and surrounding land, following reports of a sighting of the aggressive rhea from Nottinghamshire.
The bird has also been sighted in the Dinnington area. Officers are there to ensure that there is no risk to members of the public and the bird is located and captured as soon as possible.
Dinnington is about five miles north of the birds home village. The rhea, a flightless bird native to South America, can run at speeds of about 30mph.
Inspector Paul Peatfield from Nottinghamshire police has said the bird poses a very real threat to the public due to its size, aggressive nature and the unfamiliar surroundings it could find itself in.

I hope they catch this escaped killer bird, it's like Mad Max times in my village! #rhea #rheagate
Owner Alex MacDonald, 24, told Sky News that the bird had been spotted at a college in Dinnington . They have a smallholding at the college where they keep two female rhea themselves, said MacDonald
The thinking behind it is that he could be responding to hearing their call as it is mating season. He has expressed fears that the bird may have been stolen and said the family are going through CCTV from the farm where they also keep alpacas and goats.
He said the birds female partner has been pacing the field they share looking for her mate.
Shes alright. She doesnt really want to attack you when you come in but the male was aggressive, very protective because he was sat on the eggs, he said.
 Its the male that does the sitting on the eggs with these... My dads just put them in a bucket at the top of the garden hoping that hell come back and will know to come to its eggs.
MacDonald said it often needed four men to wrestle the male bird to the ground if they need to move it.

Migrant reportedly dies trying to board Channel tunnel freight train
Amid worsening migrant plight in Calais, Le Parisien reports that an Eritrean man has died after attempting to get on a moving train at Coquelles

An Eritrean man is understood to have died on the French side of the Channel tunnel as he tried to board a moving freight train bound for the UK.
The unnamed man was found at about 5am near the terminal in Calais, a spokesman for Euro Tunnel said.
Aid workers say the situation in the French port has deteriorated in the past few months as more people arrive in the camps, and migrants  many of them unaccompanied children and teenagers  take ever greater risks to get to the UK.
This week, a strike by French workers at the port caused huge tailbacks on motorways leading to both the ferry port andChannel tunnel. Hundreds of migrants  mainly from east Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan  attempted to take advantage of queuing traffic by breaking into lorries bound for the UK.

On Wednesday, Riswan, a 19-year-old from Pakistan, who had been in the camp, known as the new jungle, for a month, told the Guardian the situation was very dangerous.
He said many migrants had been hurt the night before as hundreds of people took ever greater risks to get on to lorries and trains bound for the UK. One boy was badly injured in his chest when a wheel went over him, he said. There was lots of blood.
Other migrants told how they had tried to cling to the bottom of lorries and trains but had either fallen or been dragged off by police. Many people have been hurt but what else to do?, said an Afghan man. We have to keep trying because this is no place to stay.
Last year, a Guardian investigation revealed that at least 15 people living in the makeshift camps in Calais had died trying to get to the UK in just 12 months. Aid workers say the situation has got even worse in the past six months.
Related: Calais migrants: 'we have to keep trying because this is no place to stay'
Martine Devries, from Mdicins du Monde, a medical charity that works with the migrants, said people in the camp were hungry and living in appalling conditions. It is much worse than it was before. There are more people and they are becoming more desperate and are taking more risks.
Last year, people would only make attempts to get on to lorries at night. Now there are so many and they are so desperate people are trying in broad daylight.
French police do not keep a record of how many migrants die trying to get to the UK from Calais.
On Friday, a spokesman for the Euro Tunnel said: I understand that the person was pronounced deceased but we havent had any official confirmation of that. We dont know what the circumstances are just yet, but obviously this is a very regrettable incident.

Kobani-based Kurdish activist Mustafa Bali said small groups of jihadis were still in the town and had taken civilians hostage.
He added that Kurdish fighters were besieging three areas where Isis fighters took up positions.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday that the attack on Kobani and its suburbs left 120 civilians dead.
Bali said more than 100 civilians were killed in Kobani as well as 40 Isis fighters, whose bodies were still lying in the streets.
Kobani, on Syrias border with Turkey, had become a symbol of Kurdish resistance against Isis extremists.

If you think you understand Lebanon, you havent been properly briefed. Thus went the advice dispensed by the spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force in the wild south of the country in the mid-1980s. The same worldly-wise adage applies these days to the entire Arab region, wracked by collapsing states, terrorism, sectarianism, proxy wars and alliances of the strangest bedfellows.
It takes patience, clarity and perspective to explain the whole grim picture and the links between its constituent parts. These qualities are on impressive display in an important new book by the French scholar Jean-Pierre Filiu. His particular skill is to describe the development, survival and resurgence of the Arab deep state, the security agencies that have kept it going and the monster they helped create - in its most extreme form the jihadis of the Islamic state (Isis).
Filiu traces how autocrats in Syria, Egypt and Yemen used their experience of managing internal dissent to unleash their own thugs - different names in different countries, same vicious methods - to enforce their will when the call went up to reform or change their regimes. Anyone who experienced the heady events of 2011 will recognise the bitter truth in his admission that the excitement of the Arab spring obscured the prospects of successful counter-revolution.
I thought I had seen it all from the Arab despots. Their perversity, their brutality, their voracity. But I was still underestimating their ferocity and their readiness to literally burn down their country in order to cling to absolute power.
Following the departure of Hosni Mubarak, counter-revolution triumphed in Egypt with the repression of the Muslim Brotherhood. The overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, compared with the success of Rachid Ghannouchi in Tunisia, provided an instructive lesson, Filiu argues: Islamists who succeed at the ballot box, in complex and volatile circumstances, must not take their electoral victories as a blank cheque. To ignore that is to invite the backlash that brought Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi to power and forged a reality even worse than under Mubarak.
The guardians of the status quo were ready and waiting across the region. Fighting domestic enemies - Kurds in Turkey, armed Islamists in Algeria, Libya and Egypt, separatists in Yemen - had helped keep the operators of the mukhabarat state on their toes throughout the 1990s. Opaque, oil-fuelled budgets helped line the pockets of their masters and their crony capitalist friends.
The 9/11 attacks, in Filius compelling analysis, were a bonanza for the Arab dictators and their security mafias, who cooperated willingly with George Bushs global war on terror. Rendition and torture were the backdrop to Tony Blairs grubby flirtation with Muammar Gaddafi. In Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh tightened his grip on an ever-expanding security apparatus in the battle against al-Qaida while secretly colluding with the terrorists to keep their menace usefully alive. Egypt proved its enduring worth to the US as the guardian of the peace treaty with Israel.
The master, though was Bashar al-Assad. After the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, he backed the Sunni insurgency next door and used the post-Saddam chaos to justify repression at home. Ali Mamluk, one of his top security chiefs, famously met US officials and boasted of Syrias ability in penetrating terrorist groups. In 2011 Assad first denied the existence of popular and mostly peaceful protests and then blamed them on captured terrorists who confessed to their crimes on camera. He carried out what Filiu calls a highly selective amnesty - releasing Islamists from prison: one went to Iraq to join al-Qaida and later founded Jabhat al-Nusra, its Syrian affiliate. Assads self-fulfilling prophecy became true.
Iraqs Nouri al-Maliki, like Assad a close ally of Iran, helped fuel a vicious Sunni insurgency by his unbridled Shia sectarianism. The outcome, promoted by the mayhem in Syria, is a transnational jihadi movement that morphed into Isis, captured Mosul and declared its caliphate a year ago.
It is unclear how it could have turned out differently given that Arab leaders were determined to hold on to power at any price. Support for their moderate opponents - in the west at least - was limited and halting. Saudi and Gulf backing recklessly promoted extremists - but so did the impunity for Assads chemical weapons attacks in 2013. Deep-seated suspicion of Islamists played a role too, especially in Egypt. Spring was followed by winter. Yet the answer, Filiu concludes bravely, has to be more democracy, not less, not a fatalistic acceptance that change can never come to the Middle East. The Arab people are not doomed to remain pawns, the perpetual victims of a deadly game between their dictators and the jihadis.

Investigators who discovered two bodies in an Irish bog believed to be the site where the IRA secretly buried some of its victims in the 1970s are continuing to search for a possible third set of remains.
Specialist search teams charged with finding the remains of the IRA victims who became known as the disappeared were initially looking only for the body of Joe Lynskey, a former Catholic monk-turned IRA man, who the Republican group murdered in the early 1970s.
Related: Disappeared but not forgotten: the grim secrets the IRA could not bury
But on Friday, the senior investigator Jon Hill, from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR), said there could be more remains at the site in County Meath.
We were searching for the remains of Joe Lynskey, only expecting to find the remains of one person, he told BBC Radio Ulsters Good Morning Ulster programme. As the archaeologists were uncovering the remains they had found, it became clear that there was more than one where we were searching.
Hill said he thought the two bodies were probably buried together.

Apart from Lynskey, the other bodies suspected of being buried there are those of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee, both IRA members who were abducted, murdered and buried secretly by the organisation in 1972. They were accused of being recruited as British agents by an army undercover unit carrying out covert attacks in west Belfast at the start of the Troubles.
Hill stressed that it would be some weeks before DNA could give more clarity on the identity of the bodies.

Maria Lynskey, Joe Lynskeys niece, who has been to the site at the Coghalstown bog, said on Thursday that she thought the whole day that it was her uncle who had been found, but had come to terms with indications that now may not be the case.
The three men were part of a group of 17 people bar one that the IRA accused of being informers during the Troubles. They were abducted, killed and buried in secret locations across Ireland . The IRA only admitted to their murders decades after they had been disappeared.

The most notorious case was that of Jean McConville, a widow and mother of 10 who was kidnapped, taken in a car from west Belfast across the border to the Irish Republic, shot dead and buried at a beach in County Louth.
It was also the most controversial case because the IRA commander and hunger striker Brendan Hughes claimed Gerry Adams, now the Sinn Fin president, had given the order for the woman to be killed and buried in secret to avoid political embarrassment for the republican movement. Adams has always denied any connection to the McConville murder or even being in the IRA.
This year was the first dig for Lynskeys remains. The list of 17 disappeared includes Gareth OConnor who was murdered in 2003 and had his body recovered in June 2005 at Victoria Quay, Newry Canal, County Louth.
The ICLVR has investigated 16 of the abductions and murders. The most recent confirmed discovery was that of Brendan Megraw, whose remains were found in Oristown bog, also in County Meath, in October.

Thailands military government has forced a human rights group to cancel the launch of its report on the Vietnamese governments persecution of an ethnic minority, saying it could affect national security and bilateral relations.
The 33-page report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch describes persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnams central highlands , whose religious practices have been described by the government as evil.
Thai police said in a statement on Friday the scheduled event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand (FCCT) could have an impact on the countrys security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam.
It is the third event in a month that has been cancelled at the venue, including seminars about the human rights situation in Thailand and the countrys harsh lese-majesty law protecting its monarchy.
More than a dozen plainclothes and uniformed police officers were waiting outside the club, along with a police truck parked nearby. The FCCT said it received a written order from the police, issued on behalf of the ruling junta, to cancel the press conference by Human Rights Watch at which the report was to be launched.
The FCCT complied with the written request, which was also sent to HRW, the club said in a statement. However, the report was available on the groups website. An electronic version was also sent to journalists by email.
The FCCT lets out its premises for public events as a service for the media, diplomatic community and students.
Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watchs senior researcher in Asia, said the forced cancellation of the event was very disappointing and another affirmation that human rights organisations can no longer report, not only about the situation in Thailand, but situations in neighbouring countries in south-east Asia.
Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in (south-east Asia), which added more damage to Thailands already tarnished international reputation under the military rule, he added.
Thai authorities have cracked down on critics and dissent since the military seized power from a civilian government in last Mays coup and briefly blocked the Thailand section on Human Rights Watchs web page.
In its report, Human Rights Watch called for the Vietnamese government to end abusive policies and practices that have forced hundreds of Montagnards to flee the country.
It said the Montagnards beliefs and faith practices, such as De Ga Protestantism and Ha Mon Catholicism, were suppressed by the government on the grounds that they are not religions at all. It said the Montagnards have been subjected to intimidation, arbitrary arrests and mistreatment in custody.
There was no immediate response from the Vietnamese government on the report.

China issues report attacking US human rights record
In its annual rebuttal to accusations of Chinese human rights violations, Beijing accuses the US of being haunted by spreading guns and racial discrimination

China accused the United States on Friday of being haunted by spreading guns and racial discrimination, in its annual tit-for-tat rebuttal to US criticism of Chinas human rights record.
In a lengthy report carried by the official Xinhua news agency, Chinas State Council Information Office said the United States violated human rights in other countries in a more brazen manner, and was given more red cards in the international human rights field.
The US was haunted by spreading guns and frequent occurrence of violent crimes, which threatened citizens civil rights, the report said.
The China section of the annual US State Department report on human rights conditions globally, released on Thursday, said that repression and coercion were routine against activists, ethnic minorities and law firms that took on sensitive cases.
Human rights have long been a source of tension between the worlds two largest economies, especially since 1989, when the US imposed sanctions on China after a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijings Tiananmen Square.
While senior leaders periodically promise Chinas citizens democracy and human rights, the last two years under President Xi Jinpings administration have been marked by a sweeping crackdown on dissidents and activists.
China has long rejected criticism of its rights record, saying providing food, clothing, housing and economic growth are far more relevant for developing countries, pointing to its success at lifting millions out of poverty.
The State Department report came in the same week that the United States and China held three days of high-level talks in Washington DC.
The Chinese report, which was mostly compiled from US media articles, said racial discrimination has been a chronic problem in the US human rights record, adding that the United States suppressed the voting rights of minorities.
It cited a USA Today report that said preliminary exit polls showed that voters of African origins accounted for 12% in the 2014 midterm election, down from 13% in the 2012 presidential election.
In 2014, multiple cases of arbitrary police killing of African Americans have sparked huge waves of protests, casting doubts on the racial equality in the US and giving rise to racial hatred factors, the report said.
The report also criticised the US for conducting surveillance on world leaders and civilians and for allowing a few interest groups to influence the governments decision-making.

An excursion plane carrying sightseers from a Holland America Line cruise ship has crashed in south-east Alaska , with all nine on board killed including the pilot.
Reports said wreckage was located on a rocky cliff face about 800ft (240 metres) above a lake after the plane was reported missing on Thursday afternoon. Search and rescue crews were sent.
The crash occurred near Ella Lake, about 20 miles (30 km) north-east of the town of Ketchikan, the Seattle-based cruise company said in a statement.
We have nine fatalities, said Clint Johnson, head of the National Transportation Safety Boards Alaska office.
Rain and wind forced an end to recovery efforts on Thursday night in the rugged terrain about 20 miles north-east of Ketchikan, south-east Alaska. Officials would mount a recovery attempt again on Friday, he said.
The eight passengers were guests from the Westerdam, a ship on a seven-day cruise that departed Seattle on Saturday. Promech Air, an airline based in Ketchikan, operated the air excursion sold through Holland America Line, the cruise ship company said in a statement. The pilot was among the dead.
There was no immediate indication of why the DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter turboprop crashed. It was found on Thursday against the granite rock face of a cliff, 800ft (240 metres) above Ella Lake.
Johnson said it was too soon to know circumstances of the crash, including whether the plane flew into the cliff.
The NTSB was assembling a high-level team to investigate the crash, including three members from Alaska and at least two people from Washington DC.
The initial rescue crew that went in had a very tough time because of the terrain, Johnson said. Its a very steep, mountainous area and weather conditions caused them to stand down.
Coast Guard Petty Officer Lauren Steenson said the agency received a report around 2.15pm that the plane was overdue. Troopers said an emergency locator transmitter activated in the Misty Fjords National Monument area and a helicopter pilot spotted the downed aircraft above the lake, which is about 800 miles (1,300km) south-east of Anchorage.
Holland America Line said in a statement: We are incredibly distressed by this situation and our thoughts and prayers are with those onboard the plane and their families. Holland America Line is extending its full support to travelling companions of the guests involved.
Promech said that the crash happened about 11.20am and the plane was one of five Otter aircraft in its fleet.
The Ketchikan Daily News reported the Westerdam had been scheduled to leave the city at 1pm but remained in port on Thursday evening.
The airlines website advertises tours of the Misty Fjord National Monument in its float planes. Towering granite cliffs, 1,000-foot waterfalls, lush and remote valleys and serene crystalline lakes make up this incredible landscape, it says.

First, I was delighted at the letter from my old friend Marian telling me she is coming this summer to Maine. Of course she must weekend with me and of course Id go to visit her at her interesting summer job with Indians near the Canadian border.
Then the doubts came hurtling in: visions of snubs, incidents, demonstrations, police dogs, hoses, tear-gas. For my friend Marian is a Negress, and I know I am not cut out to be a heroine in an integration crisis this summer of the Civil Rights Bill.
What would my landlady say about a Negro woman coming to stay in one of her all-white apartments, built into the wing of the landladys own beautiful home? What would my friends say? I would have to invite some of them to a party for Marian, morning coffee at least. I would have to take her out to one of the famous New England meals such as a shore dinner with lobster and clams. I know from my New Orleans days that there is something specially provocative about inter-racial eating. When I taught there even religious groups gathered at meetings could not take even light refreshments together. But I owed Marian all kinds of hospitality. She had often fed me and put me up for the night when I went as art teacher to the Pennsylvania Adult Centre, where she acted as dietician.
At this centre Marian had occupied far better accommodation that I, for a dietician is more valuable than an art and English teacher. Because of my English background, she had shown me the manuscript of her novel about her familys ancestry, going back to her White ancestress who had been an English governess in love with the mulatto son of the plantation owner who employed her. Marian had never been to me in the category of the Southern cooks and cleaning women who with melodious names like Samantha and Sophronia had added charm to my fifteen years of life in New Orleans. She is a University woman with dignity and beauty.
She would be horrified if she got into a Civil Rights Bill racial incident by being my guest in Maine. I didnt want to create an incident. I am not even a Maine native but a naturalised American, glad to live in a peaceful New England small town similar to the Lancashire town where I spent my childhood. Perhaps for both Marians and my own sake, it would be safer not to invite her here.
Doubtfully I called my most liberal friend, a social worker, and put the question directly. Shall I have difficulties? Just what is the situation in Maine?
Facebook Twitter Pinterest
April 1968: The race riots that followed Martin Luther Kings assassination, Washington, DC.
Rose gave the matter serious thought. Of course Ill want to meet her, she proffered, but I dont know what youll get yourself into. We tried to give a farewell party at the Country Club for that pretty girl who was here for a while as social worker, and they wouldnt let her into the club. What did you do? I gasped. Well, I was just threatening to leave with the whole party when one guest phoned a board member she knows, and he gave permission so long as wed use a private dining-room. Dont worry too much, though, she finished. I dont believe shed have any trouble on buses or at hotels. Im not sure really. But well arrange for you and Marian to come over here to something. I brightened, thinking of Roses useful car. There would be no taxi problem then.
I made myself phone Marian that night on the rate of three minutes for a dollar. When her warm voice responded from Philadelphia, I came forth with my congratulations on her summer job and my delight that we might meet in Maine. But I couldnt bring out the fateful words, You must visit me one weekend.
During the next few days as I combed the local newspapers for indications of how the racial question goes in Maine, my research only got me a headache. Front page headlines shrieked out: Rocks and bottles thrown at Negro boys at Maine schoolchildren visiting Washington. Outbreaks of violence seemed to be everywhere, but I found a small announcement of a symposium on the race question to be held at a Roman Catholic college a hundred miles away. Martin Luther King and half a dozen other experts on Civil Rights issues would speak, and there would be panel discussions.
My enthusiasm for meetings runs lukewarm, but my regard for Marian got me into the necessary buses, and I arrived at the college gymnasium where a crowd of nearly a thousand Maine people rose and clapped as the speakers came in - protected by local police, State police, and even sheriffs with wide hats and guns dramatic enough for a Hollywood set.
During the speeches, my barometer registered only what the speakers comments meant in terms of Marians possible visit to me. When a speaker warned that violence might increase if the Civil Rights Bill didnt pass without being watered down to useless form, I could see Marian caught up in the backwash by troublemakers in Maine, where a National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People has only been formed this month. When veteran civil disobedience demonstrators quipped about how cosy a prison cell could seem when one reached it in the midnight hours, I could see myself and Marian jostled in a police car because we had picknicked together.
On the bus next morning returning home, I was hypersensitive when I saw ahead of us a Negro girl waiting by the roadside. Would the bus driver stop for her? I prayed that she was a regular like the other girls we picked up along the forested road and deposited at various restaurants and beauty shops and nursing homes for their daily work. The bus driver stopped. The Negro girl got on, smiled at us all in general, and took one of the front seats. The bus stopped again, this time for a young white girl outside a lonely farmhouse. My barometer swung with joy as the white girl took a seat by the Negro girl. Soon they were chatting busily, two regulars on their way to work at the usual time.
All at once my mental map shook into proportion. Police dogs and demonstrations faded. When I dropped the fateful letter of invitation into our corner mailbox that afternoon my knees had stopped quaking. Whats your fuss? I asked myself. Youve simply invited an old friend to come and visit.

Australia's population increase from migration continues to slow

Australias population increase from migration continues to slow, the latest data from the Bureau of Statistics show, while people are increasingly moving to Victoria from other states and territories.
Last year, the net overseas migration figure was 184,100 people, a fall of 15% from the previous year. Migration to Australia added 473,500 people to the population, 5.3% fewer than the previous year.
Victoria recorded its highest interstate migration in more than 40 years, with most of the new arrivals  2,700  coming from New South Wales. This was followed by 2,100 from South Australia and 1,400 from Western Australia.
In Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, more people left the state in 2014 than arrived, but all jurisdictions increased their overall population thanks to the number of births exceeding the number of deaths.
The bureaus director of demography, Denise Carlton, said overseas migration had peaked in 2008, and that many push and pull factors influenced the rate of this movement.
Carolyn Whitzman, a professor of urban planning at the University of Melbourne, said the data highlighted the need for capital cities to develop better plans for growth.
Australias population increased by 330,200 to reach 23.6m by the end of last year, representing a growth rate of 1.4%.
I dont think population growth is the problem per se, because cities like Melbourne have seen growth at a higher rate over much of its history, Whitzman said.
The problem is, we arent planning for the future. The bottom line is, whether Melbourne, Sydney and Perth grow at all, there is a need for better kinds of housing, transport and social infrastructure, like schools and healthcare.
She suspected growth in jobs in the healthcare and education sectors had contributed to the movement to Victoria.
But it was important that the infrastructure built to support those industries, such as hospitals, schools and public transport, were spread equitably, she said.
Unfortunately, major cities see rapid urban sprawl, coupled with infrastructure not catching up, Whitzman said.
This story was amended on 26 June to correct the interpretation of the ABS figures. The overseas migration figure refers to the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants, not the absolute number of emigrants.

        <title>Gambia: presidential candidates face US$25,000 electoral registration fee</title>

Pro-democracy activists have accused Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh of trying to price potential opponents out of the market through astronomical rises in registration fees for presidential elections.
The government has announced plans to charge candidates one million dalasi (US$25,000) to run in any future campaigns  10,000 times the current cost.
The sum would differ from a conventional election deposit in that it would be non-refundable, even upon victory, under a bill being put before parliament.
The government is proposing the same charge for political parties, as well as smaller, but still significant, increases for candidates for parliamentary and mayoral elections.
The proposed amendments are retrogressive and are designed to scuttle the growth of multiparty democracy in the Gambia, said Ousainou Darboe, secretary general of the main opposition United Democratic Party.
About two-thirds of the population of the west African nation live on less than US$1.25 a day and would have to spend nothing for more than half a century to be able to afford to run for president.
The Gambia , mainland Africas smallest country with a population of about 1.7 million, has been ruled with an iron fist by Jammeh since he came to power in a bloodless coup in 1994.
One of the poorest countries in the world, it survives mostly on agriculture and tourism, luring sun-worshipping Europeans to its sweeping, palm-fringed coastline.
Jammeh has woven an aura of mysticism around himself, dressing in billowing white robes, never letting go of his Quran and brooking no dissent.
The former wrestler, who claims he can cure AIDS, is often pilloried for rights abuses and the muzzling of journalists. He has threatened to cut off the heads of homosexuals and heaps derision on any criticism from the west.
He won a landslide re-election to serve a fourth term in 2011 presidential polls slammed by the opposition as bogus and fraudulent. The next vote is expected in 2016.
Due to high levels of illiteracy, voting is through a unique system using glass marbles instead of ballot papers.
The marbles are dropped into drums, which are coloured to represent each candidate. As the marbles fall they hit a bell that sounds loudly, preventing multiple voting.

The president of Nauru has attacked foreign media organisations as he confirmed three MPs faced criminal charges after a protest outside the island nations parliament.
The government has accused members of the opposition of an orchestrated campaign to disrupt parliament and the passage of the budget.
On Friday president Baron Waqa condemned their shameful actions and said they were guilty of a campaign of lies backed by foreign media outlets in a statement issued on Friday.
He named Guardian Australia, the ABC and Radio New Zealand has having an agenda to attack the Nauru government, Radio NZ reported .
Waqa said information from police suggested the former president Sprent Dabwido and fellow MPs Mathew Batsuia and Squire Jeremiah were the ringleaders of a protest held almost a fortnight ago and they would face criminal charges.
The hundreds-strong rally reportedly called on the government to resign over corruption allegations aired on the ABC, new laws cracking down on free speech and the indefinite suspension of the MPs.
The government has characterised the protest as a riot.
Members of the opposition have been speaking loudly and freely against the reform measures of our government for some time, Waqa said.
The government of Nauru will not be dictated to by a handful of power-hungry people focused on causing fear and panic.
Waqa accused the organisers of the demonstration of using children as part of their protest and plying them with alcohol. He blamed the organisers for not warning public servants they might lose their jobs if they took part.

The remains of two bodies have been found on reclaimed bogland in the Irish Republic where three of the people believed to have been disappeared by the IRA are thought to have been secretly buried.
As part of a search for the remains of the former monk Joe Lynskey, a dig on farmland in Coghalstown, County Meath, unearthed one body on Thursday morning, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) said.
A second body was discovered as further examinations took place at the site and preparations were made to take the first body out the ground.
IRA victims Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee are believed to have been buried in the same area as Lynskey, the ICLVR said.
We have always said that we think three bodies are in that area and until there is further identification we just dont know, a spokesman said.
It is understood the second set of human remains was unearthed as specialists cleared ground around the first body to prepare it for removal.

Lynskeys family had been notified of the initial discovery and were said to be shocked but relieved.
The former Cistercian monk from Belfast was abducted and murdered by the IRA in August 1972. The group only admitted his disappearance in 2010.
Wright, an asphalt layer also from Belfast, had been in the IRA and was murdered by his former colleagues, who accused him of being a British army agent and a member of its military reaction force  an undercover unit.
Wright was 25 and married when he went missing in October 1972.
McKee, again from Belfast and in the IRA, was murdered in the same year because of the same suspicions the IRA had of Wright. McKee was interrogated and murdered by the terrorist group.
Lynskeys niece, Maria, who expected to visit the site, said her thoughts were with other families awaiting news.
We would like to thank the [ICLVR] and those who have engaged with the commission in the search for Joe, she said. Our thoughts are with the other families whose loved ones remain disappeared.
Extensive searches have been carried out at the site for both Wright and McKee, but this year was the first dig for Lynskeys remains.

Its instructive that someone of Simon Jenkinss elite western background perceives current patterns of migration so narrowly ( The human tide the west doesnt want , 19 June). For him its primarily an immigration issue, a threat to his nation. National identity is fixed in history and geography, he says. But geography is transforming rapidly as a consequence of the wests increasingly desperate efforts to maintain a fatally flawed ideology and way of life. After centuries of nation-building, expansion, colonialism, militarism, capitalism, exploitation, expropriation and extermination, the European international project of the last 500 years is collapsing. The writing on the wall couldnt be bolder  climate change, destruction of habitats, the global economic crash, frenzied migration  but the elite continue to promulgate the old narratives and pretend to carry on as normal even as they bail out to become part of a global superclass. They exist in a new four-dimensional world created by the technology and transport necessary for the progressive shrinking of time and space required to maintain capitalist growth. The notion and importance of the European concept of nation have been transformed by them. They are operating in a world without borders.
Without conscious irony, Jenkins supports his case with references to Australia and America seeking to deter and repatriate migrants with imprisonment and transhipment. More accurately, he should have referred to this as the actions of the European diaspora. I suspect the descendants of the survivors of European invasions will have a clearer understanding of the current migration situation than Jenkins. Viewpoint is also influenced by history and geography.

 The governments plan to expel non-EU migrants whose earnings after six years fail to exceed 35,000 ( Report , 22 June) could be the first step towards eliminating poverty in the UK. It only needs an extension of that rule to force anyone whose income is below that level to live elsewhere. It would get rid of a lot of troublesome pensioners before the infirmities of old age make them costly for the NHS. It could be a little problematic if it also meant that we lost most of our social workers, a lot of teachers, and many other leeches on the public purse. But it would boost the nations apparent wealth. I look forward to another of the prime ministers Alice in Wonderland speeches.

        <title>Dirty boulevard: why Paris's ring road is a major block on the city's grand plans</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/26/ring-road-paris-peripherique-suburbs-banlieue</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
With 1.1m cars a day, the 35 kilometres of the Boulevard Priphrique are the busiest in Europe . Pariss inner ring road runs around the French capital, following the citys administrative boundaries almost perfectly and connecting the city proper and its banlieues, or suburbs.
Since its inauguration in 1973, the priphrique  measuring 40 to 60 metres wide and composed of up to six lanes  has been a concrete belt around Paris, making all too real what should have remained an invisible administrative boundary. This has reinforced the insurmountable contrast between Paris and the citys adjacent municipalities, adding a physical dimension to political borders and separating the Parisiens from the rest of France .
Architect Richard Rogers , who designed a strategic plan for the city , said: I dont know of any other city where the heart is as detached from its limbs. A number of studies published this year by Atelier Parisien dUrbanisme , the public agency in charge of urban studies, qualify almost the whole priphrique as a challenge for urban integration.
As a result, on the first day of 2016, the Mtropole du Grand Paris will come to life. The MGP aims to deliver a more integrated development to Paris and its suburbs, by creating a new metropolitan governance.
Pariss boundaries are defined by its fortifications  displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning
The City of Paris and its 2.3 million inhabitants will be merged with its petite couronne (small crown, or inner suburbs), adding about 4.6 million residents and an extra 128 local authorities to form a new metropolitan institution: the Grand Paris.
Where New York, Berlin and London have successfully created metropolitan governments, can Paris overcome its inner boundary, and convince inhabitants of Paris proper and the suburbs that they are all Parisiens? And to achieve this, should it sacrifice the priphrique, the citys most prominent physical and symbolic boundary?
The roots of the division between Paris and its suburbs run much deeper than the building of the road in the 1970s. To understand the significance, we need to go back to the fall of Napoleon. In March 1814, the Battle of Paris saw the defeat of the Napoleonic troops and Prussian forces storming the capital city.
Consequently, King Louis-Philippe and French prime minister Adolphe Thiers decided to transform Paris into a fortress and protect the city from any further intrusion, ordering construction of city fortifications in the 1840s. Completed in 1844, the message was clear: Pariss boundaries were to be defined by its fortifications  displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning.

Consisting of a thick wall, 10 metres high and protected by a wide ditch, the ramparts were also granted a 250-metre wide non-building zone. Yet, as the fortifications lost military relevance and became obsolete only decades after their completion, informal settlements mushroomed within the Zone, housing the Parisian proletariat.
The destruction of the fortifications was in the pipeline as early as 1882, but only started in 1919 and was completed in 1929. To put this into perspective, Berlin destroyed its last fortifications in 1740; London in 1760.
In Paris, the defunct fortifications were replaced at the beginning of the 1930s by a grand scheme of social housing. Yet the Zone remained untouched, full of zonards (still a deprecating term for someone from a deprived area who loiters suspiciously) and their insalubrious housing.
While the idea of an orbital road around Paris emerged in the 1920s, it was only in 1956 that the construction of the priphrique started. It addressed the increase in inner-city car use, and similar schemes were designed in cities around the world . The zone was cleared, its inhabitants evicted and the priphrique was inaugurated in 1973 , after 17 years of building work.
Cutting across the city, the priphriques viaduct structure is omnipresent in the working-class neighbourhoods of north-east Paris, but in well-off areas  such as Vincennes in the east, and Boulogne in the west  it discreetly passes underground as a tunnel. In the main, though, a formidable ring of concrete now stands where fortifications once did. London has its green belt, Paris its concrete one.

To explore the physical boundary created by the road, we must meet the people who have a direct relationship with it. All along the priphrique, the entrances to Paris are still named portes, as they are located where the fortifications gates used to stand. Walking from Porte Dore to Porte de la Chapelle, I encounter various types of transition between Paris and its banlieues. In some places, the transition is smooth and painless: the tunnel of the priphrique allows Parisians to easily access the Bois de Vincennes  one of Pariss green lungs, which sits outside the boundary but is under Pariss jurisdiction. Where Paris connects with the well-off cities of Saint-Mand and Vincennes, several effortless transitions are in place, allowing residents to move easily from one area to another, as resident Dorothe confirms.
In 1932, Dorothes in-laws moved into a housing block built in the place of the fortifications; she moved into the flat herself in 1969, as the priphrique was being completed. Living on the edge of the 12th arrondissement, she is within walking distance of Saint-Mand and Vincennes. In other spots, such as Porte de Montreuil, its really different  there is a real break between Paris and [those suburbs]. But here, we are well connected. Theres a real continuity.

The compact and humble houses evoke rural France
The Porte de Montreuil, a few kilometres up the priphrique, offers a starker contrast between Paris and the adjacent environs of Montreuil and Bagnolet. The roundabout, which connects the area with the priphrique by means of four access roads, is empty of almost any pedestrian or bicycle  and, although the Rue dAvron on the Paris side and the Rue de Paris on Montreuils side are very busy thoroughfares, they do not connect.
Bndicte, a Montreuil resident, describes the priphrique as a ditch between Montreuil and Paris. While the priphrique running below the roundabout leaves a wide void between the two areas, how it is built  its height, architectural style and condition  on each side of the road reveals another level of divide.
In Montreuil and Bagnolet, alongside glossy new office buildings sits the traditional suburban housing stock: 19th-century houses that are one or two storeys high. With its compact and humble houses, sometimes left in ruins, the streetscape evokes rural France, not the core of the wealthiest region in Europe. An unlikely vision when you consider that Paris is among the biggest property markets in the world.
Here you might be only 60 metres away from the capital, but you are not in Paris any more. Cross the priphrique and the value of properties drops by half , from 6,300 per sq metre in the 20th arrondissement to 3,800 per sq metre in Bagnolet. Yet it has good transport connections, with line 3 of the Mtro stopping here, plenty of buses to Paris, and docking stations for both Autolib and Vlib: the self-service car- and bicycle-sharing systems launched by the City of Paris.
As I continue my orbital journey along the priphrique, the divide between Paris and its banlieues changes many times. A few hundred metres further, I have to face the Bagnolet Interchange  Pariss very own spaghetti junction. A few kilometres later sits the Porte des Lilas: here the road has recently been covered, creating a whole new district and a new way to move between Paris and the adjacent town. A couple of kilometres later, arriving at Porte de la Chapelle, the contrast is even more pronounced.

But there is not only negative feeling for the priphrique. Carla, a resident of the 19th arrondissement of Paris who works in the nearby town of Colombes, and her colleague Aude, who lives in Saint-Ouen right outside the priphrique, explain that not all the points of passage on the priphrique are the same. For instance, at the Porte Montmartre there are always people, even in the middle of the night. It is always full.
I am very aware of the Paris-banlieue divide, probably because I grew up here: thats a very Parisian attitude
While some parts of the priphrique remain a hostile environment for pedestrians, it seems the residents close to the road have found ways to cope with the concrete beast. Sophie, who lives on the edge of Pariss 18th arrondissement, says the break between Paris and the banlieue is visible. Its physical. For instance, the cycle path between Paris and Saint-Ouen stops at the Porte Montmatre, where the priphrique starts. Yet, Anis, from the 17th arrondissement, says: The priphrique, its like a rampart, like a wall  but more or less invisible. Bndicte from Montreuil adds: The priphrique is both a connector and the separation between Paris and its suburbs.
Talking with the residents, I realise there is much more to this than just an urban design issue. While the road and its 1.1m daily cars does not help, the reconnection between the citys heart and its limbs might require more subtle intervention. Perhaps the last wall that will bring down the invisible rampart is in fact a psychological one.
Marko, from Clichy, and Bndicte believe the banlieue is a myth. Bndicte, who moved to Montreuil in the 1990s after a lifetime in central Paris, adds that Montreuil was a compromise: My husband [who did not grow up in Paris] had no prejudice about the suburbs. Meanwhile, I am very aware of the Paris/banlieue divide, probably because I grew up here: thats a very Parisian attitude.
Marko and Anis were interviewed in 2013 by citizen collective and NGO Mtropop for its project titled My Neighbourhood, My Heritage. Antoine Le Pessec, its president, tells me Mtropops objective is to question representations of the banlieues, to work on social prejudice, and to accompany Parisians and suburbanites towards founding a genuine Grand Paris. Beyond redesigning political institutions or the priphrique, the real challenge is in peoples heads.

From 1 January 2016, Bagnolet, Montreuil, Vincennes, Saint-Ouen, Colombes, Paris and more than 100 other municipalities will form the Mtropole du Grand Paris. For the first time since 1860, we will witness an institutional attempt to move Paris beyond its own boundaries, beyond the priphrique. Yet, in six months time, the road will still be standing, untouched and unchallenged.
Projects  of uneven quality and relevance  to get rid of the priphrique have regularly appeared in the media since the 1990s. Some parts have been covered, making the transition between Paris and the adjacent municipalities smoother. Yet a total coverage of the priphrique has never been seriously contemplated  it would be immensely costly  and nor has its destruction, as the city struggles with managing its car traffic.
Related: America wakes up to walking: 'Think of it as a patriotic duty'
Yet plans announced in May by Mayor Hidalgo to pedestrianise inner-city urban motorways along the Seine were, until recently, seen as ludicrous and unrealistic. They follow up on a similar successful scheme implemented by former Mayor Bertrand Delano in 2013, which was met at the time with fierce opposition from pro-car lobbies. Why cant the challenges of the priphrique be met with similar panache?
This iconic road remains an eyesore, as well as a major health hazard for the hundreds of thousands who live close to it. And, surely, dedicating hundreds of hectares in a central location to a single road is a lost opportunity in a city where land is scarce.
The main divide between Parisiens and banlieusards, however, remains a psychological one. While redesigning and reinventing the priphrique is certainly part of the solution, it is Parisians perceptions that must change if the ghosts of Pariss historic fortifications are to be eradicated for good.

'My children are suffering but what can I do?' Delhi's polluted air, by the people who live there
A family living in the middle of an eight-lane motorway, an autorickshaw driver struggling to breathe, a young woman who cant wait to leave ... the foul air of Indias capital affects all sections of society

For three years Mohammad Yunus, his wife Babli, five children and a handful of relatives have made their home on a patch of concrete in the middle of an eight-lane motorway, near a stretch of road named after Mahatma Gandhi. As lorries, buses and motorcycles roar past on either side of the familys cramped bit of south Delhi pavement, and a modern, concrete flyover carries several more lanes of traffic overhead, their evening routine unfolds.
A young woman in a pink dress squats to kindle a fire from wooden sticks and plastic bottles, then breaks a lump of dough into pieces to bake into chapatti bread. A three-month-old baby and a toddler sleep on a dirty mat just a few feet from the curb. The incessant blaring of horns makes conversation difficult, but does not rouse the children.
Delhis horrendous air pollution  the worst in the world, according to the World Health Organisation  is far from the only worry facing the Yunus family. But the poisonous fumes are doing them serious harm, and the children are particularly vulnerable to its health-wrecking effects .

Babli Yunus has a thick, phlegmy, hacking cough that she says never goes away. Her son Toufiq, who looks about nine (no one at this encampment knows their precise ages), has had a fever for several days. I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do? Babli asks as one daughter, aged about three, leans back in her lap, playing with a dirty yellow comb. This child has a cough and cold. So does this one.
Babli doesnt know whether the familys latest round of illnesses was caused by the diesel and petrol exhaust that gives the air an acrid smell and a heavy feel, or by a soaking rain that left their clothes and blankets wet. It all goes into our systems, she says. We end up eating a lot of dust.
Dust, dirt, everything, her husband echoes. This is a main road. It never closes.
It is hard to imagine an existence more wretched than that of the Yunus family, huddled together on this dirty rectangle of concrete about 10 x 4 metres, surrounded by traffic on three sides and pressed on the fourth against a tall metal fence. Mohammad brings home what money he can, working on construction sites and selling vegetables in the market. His children, who do not attend school, earn a few coins collecting discarded plastic bottles from around a nearby bus stop.
Mohammad says a total of 1820 people live in the space. Their belongings hang from the fences spikes: a plastic bucket, bundles wrapped in patterned cloth, a few blankets, a shirt. Pedestrians stream past just inches away, dodging traffic and carrying goods on their heads or under their arms. A few months ago, a girl of around eight living on the same stretch of road was struck by a car and killed, nearby families say.
Delhis foul air impacts all sections of its society. A 2010 study of more than 11,000 schoolchildren found 43% had poorly developing lungs, compared with 25% of a rural control group. The Delhi pupils were three times more likely to have severe impairment, and such deficits are believed to last for life.
I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do?
Babli Yunus
But the citys destitute  poorly nourished, often suffering from chronic illnesses, and unable to afford medical care  are the most severely affected. These people dont get any respite from the pollution, even at night, so yes I think it does [cause more death and illness among the poor], says Dr Neeraj Jain, a respiratory consultant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Its just their economic status that makes them more vulnerable.
A growing body of research also shows that those living within a few hundred metres of major thoroughfares suffer greater health problems. Everywhere in Delhi, the air is thick with toxins, and levels of the tiniest pollution particles  linked to ailments from heart attacks and stroke to cancer , respiratory infections and even dementia  reach 17 times the recommended limits in some parts of the city. Even in the springtime, when the air is far better than in the filthy, choking winters , the haze is visible night and day, shimmering in the headlights of cars and blurring buildings and bridges behind a gauzy grey curtain.
Mohammad and his relatives came to Delhi from their village near Lucknow because the high cost of land made it impossible for them to earn a living by farming. The family originally camped a few kilometres away but police forced them out so they settled beneath the flyover, unable to find anywhere better to live.
It was Gods will that we came here, says Yunus, a slim man in a worn grey shirt and trousers, his face freshly shaven but for a neat moustache. Where should we go? You tell us.

The autorickshaw driver
In Delhi, millions live much of their lives on the street. It is not just the homeless: vendors of everything from car parts and furniture to drinks and snacks spend their workdays beside busy roads. Rickshaw drivers wait at busy corners for fares, then pedal through heavy traffic, inhaling pollution deeply.
Sitting for hours in New Delhis gridlocked traffic, perched behind the handlebars of his open-air autorickshaw, Nand Lal Kumar coughs and coughs, struggling for air. His head pounds, my chest gets heavy, stomach gets tight and I feel suffocated, anxious.
I have difficulty breathing at the end of the day, my face is black with soot, says Kumar, waiting for his next fare on a noisy corner in south Delhi, beside a road jammed with honking cars, trucks and buses. But theres absolutely no other alternative. There are no other jobs.
Kumar, 38, left his village more than 20 years ago to seek opportunity in the capital, but he still struggles to scratch out a living. After fuel, maintenance and loan payments, he nets 300 or 400 rupees, about three or four pounds, each day.
I cant even pay my rent on time. I havent been able to pay my childrens school fees for a year or two. I pay half the fee, they go for a while, then they have to stop, he says. Nobody thinks about autorickshaw drivers in this country. Passengers are only concerned that we might overcharge them. Nobody cares about us or our families.
The doorless, green-and-yellow three-wheelers that clog Delhis streets were converted to compressed natural gas years ago, so they create little pollution. Their drivers, though, inhale the health-wrecking air on the roads all day. Scientists who measured levels of tiny, dangerous airborne particles in autorickshaws backseats said they were the among the worst ever found in a regular form of transport, up to eight times higher than Delhis already disastrous baseline pollution. Kumar, in battered sandals and a worn, blue-grey uniform, knows he suffers the effects.
He sees a respiratory expert every few months, to little avail. Take medicines and youll be fine, thats what the doctor says. It gets OK and then it gets bad again, he says. My cough doesnt stop for a month at a time.
I do worry about my future health, but theres nothing I can do, he says sadly. My job is a hazard for me.
The young family
As well as the 7.5 million vehicles on Delhis roads (with nearly 1,400 more added every day), smouldering garbage fires are everywhere in the city, and poor families burn wood and dung to cook and stay warm. Just beyond the city limits, thousands of primitive brick-making factories send plumes of black smoke into the air, while coal-burning power plants lack even the most basic filtration systems.
Dirty diesel generators power mobile-phone towers and provide back-up electricity for malls, hospitals and apartment blocks. Smoke from the fires that farmers in neighbouring states set to get rid of crop stubble after harvest settles over the city. Construction projects such as the expansion of the Delhi Metro  a long-term hope for reducing pollution  only add to the clouds of dust.
After Manjali Khosla and her family moved to Delhi from Dubai three years ago, she spent the first six months fighting pneumonia. She tried every brand of face mask she could find, to filter out the pollution she blames for her illness and keep others from catching it.
Born in India and raised in Hong Kong and North America, Manjali wanted her children to experience life in their parents home country and spend time with extended family. She and her husband did not understand until they arrived just how big a role Delhis filthy air would play in their lives.
You feel like theres like an ulcer inside you, somethings burning, and it takes a week for the feeling to go away

The children, a 10-year-old and twins aged eight, sometimes wear masks at school . Someone in the family is always coughing and Manjalis father-in-law suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a severe lung problem. She has a PhD in chemistry so she understands the science. Air pollution is Indias fifth-biggest killer, causing 620,000 premature deaths a year, and it terrifies her.
Manjali has bought filters for the familys house and plants that are said to purify the air. She finds indoor activities to discourage the kids from playing outside on the foulest days, and plans holidays abroad as often as possible  but still frets about what their years in Delhi may do to her childrens health. Ive even dreamed polyps coming out of their lungs, something very drastic, she says.
Returning to Delhi after trips away, the kids come off the plane holding their noses. Symptoms are always bad during the first days back: You feel like theres like an ulcer or something inside you, somethings burning, and it takes about a week for the feeling to go away, she says. The sinuses hurt, your head hurts, your eyes water.
But while many of the foreign families Manjali knows are contemplating leaving, she is determined to stay in Delhi for a few more years yet.
My kids say, Why are we here, why dont we just leave? But I say, If we leave, it doesnt solve the problem  your grandparents are still here, your cousins are still here. Lets stay and try to fix it. And in the meantime, wear masks.
The paediatrician
Dr Sanjeev Bagai has one word to describe what it feels like to see the wheezing children who stream through his surgery door every day: Helpless.
He can treat them with steroids and inhalers, and antibiotics for those with bronchitis  but he cannot clean the air that makes them sick.
In his practice, asthma cases are up by 40-45% in the last five years, poor lung function is common, and lowered oxygen levels caused by breathing difficulties can lead to long-term problems with vision, growth and brain development, says the paediatrician.
This morning, Ive seen five patients; three had wheezing. All of them were under six. Bagai, a burly man with cufflinks and a carefully waxed handlebar moustache, explains that asthma, once seen only in children over three or four, is now common in babies and toddlers. He once diagnosed it in a newborn, less than three weeks old. Rapid breathing, breathlessness, spasmodic cough, he says.  It can be life-threatening.
According to Bagai, asthma carries a stigma in India , and young patients often become depressed and withdrawn. They feel scared to play, they miss a lot of school days, he says. Very often kids say, Im taking all the medicine, but why am I getting this again and again? Why me?
The lorry driver

In the hottest part of a baking day, eight truckers are stretched out on a concrete platform in their companys bare, windowless office, waiting for 10pm, the earliest they are allowed to drive their hulking diesel vehicles through Delhi.
A dozen lorries are parked outside, their cabs decorated with scraps of sparkly tinsel. Its a tough life, but this is what I do, says Surinder Singh, sitting on a blue wooden table, a Hindi newspaper in one hand. If I had some other job, I could spend time with my children, relax, go to the market.
It is mid-afternoon and Singh, with a round face and boyish sweetness in his eyes, has not been home since last night; grey stubble covers his cheeks and chin. He plans to stop there for a nap, dinner and a bath before heading out with a load of iron pipes. There is no rest in this job.
An estimated 80,000 trucks crowd Delhis roads every night, spewing a toxic stew of pollutants . So Singh and other drivers have become a focus of the citys growing pollution concerns.
Now, their livelihoods are in jeopardy. In April, judges barred all diesel vehicles more than 10 years old from entering the capital. Truck drivers threatened to strike and the court postponed its order , but the threat remains.
My truck will be as good as scrap [under the rule], Singh says. He estimates the decision slashed two-thirds off the value of the lorry that became his in 2013, after nine years of repayments. How will I feed my children? How will I educate them if I lose my business, my job?
He feels the effects of dirty air himself  shortness of breath, itchy eyes, a cough. But he doesnt think truckers deserve all the blame. Look at the garbage fire right here, he adds, pointing toward a thick cloud of acrid smoke across the street. And what about the 20 and 25-year-old cars that drive on the roads of Delhi?
The wantaway Delhiite
Pavika Bakshi has swallowed live fish and drunk the waters of a healing stream in search of something to stop her wheezing. Aside from medication, the only thing that helps, she says, is yoga.
It wont be enough to keep her in New Delhi, though. Bakshis parents are searching for a husband for her, and she has told them to look beyond the city.
It could be outside India, it could be in India around the coastline, she says, perched on a chair in a quiet room at the yoga school where she practices. Anywhere I feel better.
Its not a happy situation to be in, because this is my city and I absolutely love it  but I wish it was minus this huge baggage. I keep asking my mother all the time, Why are we a part of this place? Why are we here? Can we not leave?
Bakshi, 32, says she feels well whenever she goes abroad, so is certain it is Delhis air that makes her chest grow tight and her breathing raspy. You come back glowing, because you are healthier, she says. But soon after returning, there is no energy and you are lifeless and you are dull.
Her friends talk all the time about leaving, says Bakshi, who has long, dark hair and a sparkling stud in her nose. Weve all been in good jobs, we are making good money here, but what am I supposed to do with that money? she says. It cant buy me clean air.

Dirty air, and the death and illness it causes, have become front-page news in India. Government ministers and the courts are taking heed, announcing a bevy of measures  from fines for burning garbage to coal-fired power plant upgrades. But many doubt the rules will be enforced.
At one level, Im confident that something will happen now, because the public outrage over this rising pollution is at such a pitch that a government cannot ignore it altogether, says Arindam Sen Gupta , executive editor of the Times of India. But how effective this plan will be is a matter of speculation.
I dont think theres a cohesive vision  we work in fits and starts. When the problem becomes acute, we wake up to it and then emergency measures are taken. Its usually pressure from below which works in India, from the people.

        <title>Chennai unchained: can India's first cycle cafe make bikes cool again?</title>

Before the sun rises over the East Coast Road south of Chennai each day, a lone rider speeds down the tarmac. Dressed in a fluorescent jersey and cycling shoes with a srichurnam  a red line of lime and turmeric paste  on his forehead, Ramanujar Moulana has followed exactly the same route every day for the past four decades  until now. For the past few weeks theres been a new stop on his agenda: Indias first cycle cafe.
Nestled in Kotturpuram, a plush neighbourhood in the south of Tamil Nadus state capital, is the Ciclo Cafe . It boasts a cycle spa, where riders can watch their bike get washed while they drink their coffee, a reading area stocked with books on cycling, and decor fashioned from bike parts  cycle-chain chandeliers and table legs made from front forks. A retail zone showcases high-end brands like Bianchi, Cannondale, Mongoose and Schwinn.
There is more to Chennai than ancient temples, Carnatic music and filter coffee, says Nidhi Kapoor Thadani, the co-founder of the cafe, who was partly inspired after a visit to Look Mum No Hands! in Shoreditch, east London. Thanks to the many recreational cycling clubs in Chennai the city has a strong cycling culture.
I gave up cycling in the late 80s. As the city grew, so did pollution, and cycling was pass
Mithra Massillamoney
Bikes ands taxis outside Chennai central station. Cycling has been a part of the city since the colonial period
Cycling has been a part of Chennai since the colonial period, when many British officers used bikes as their main mode of city transport. Nowadays, at least 37% of Chennai households own a bike, according to the Energy and Resources Institute; yet there is little in the way of local provision for cyclists and the city remains without a single urban bike lane.
Ciclo Cafe customer and longtime Chennai resident Mithra Massillamoney remembers that 1970s Madras, as the city was known until 1996, was friendlier to cyclists. I used to ride a cycle to work every day in the mid 70s. Madras wasnt so crowded back then. But I gave up cycling in the late 80s  as the city grew, so did pollution, and cycle was pass  motorbikes and cars were in.
Mithra wasnt alone. Cycling dropped significantly through the 1980s and 90s, as the city became known as the  Detroit of India  for its burgeoning motor industry  international companies including Hyundai, Renault, Bosch, Ford and BMW have factories in the area.
Since 1949, Chennai has also been home to manufacturing by TI Cycles  one of Indias big four bike-makers alongside Hero, Atlas and Avon, who together account for 90% of the 16m bicycles sold in the country every year. Yet, while India ranks among the worlds top bicycle manufactures, bikes lack the status of cars or motorcycles.
While Chennai doesnt have any cycle infrastructure, cities such as Delhi have built some bike paths. I definitely dont think Indian cities provide facilities for cyclists, says prominent environmentalist Sunita Narain, who suffered multiple fractures when she was hit by a reversing car in Delhi two years ago.

The Cycling Yogis on a ride. Its 2,000 members take part in organised rides to heritage sites in the city
In fact, we are going in the opposite direction. We dont see cyclists on the road. Urban planners consider them invisible people. The entire planning objective of the government is to widen the road to accommodate cars and even when cycling tracks are constructed in places like Delhi, they are not continuous and only cover a very small part of the city.
Data shows that the most vulnerable road users are cyclists and pedestrians. Our cities need cycle tracks and we need to increase penalties for those responsible for road accidents, and increase camera surveillance to investigate when somebody is hit. This is why the upcoming Road Transport and Safety Bill must look at the safety of cyclists.
The urban decay started in the late 1970s and continues today, adds Jasbir Singh, co-founder of Pedal Yatri, a recreational cycle group based in Gurgaon near Delhi. In the 1960s and 70s, every Biswajeet or Rajesh Khanna movie seemed to have at least one musical number featuring a group of happy girls cycling blissfully along, but in the name of urbanisation many switched to 100cc motorbikes and the bicycle was left to the economically needy, he explains. Given a choice, even the poorest people will not ride a bike because of safety concerns, and because they want to grow up in life.
Jasbir does believe that is changing, though, thanks to a handful of lifestyle and health conscious individuals.
Related: 'Nobody cycles across Mumbai.' But why?
In Chennai, a growing number of recreational cycling groups  the Tamilnadu Cycling Club, Madras Randonneurs and Chain Reaxion among them  are building on that heritage. At the forefront are the Cycling Yogis, founded by Ramanujar Moulana, whose 2,000 members take part in organised rides to heritage sites in the city.
He hopes Ciclo Cafe can help raise awareness about cycling as a viable mode of transport by, for example, profiling residents who bike-commute in the pages of the menu and organising rides for customers. If the cafe can stir the interest of non-cyclists about cycling, he says, it is definitely a good addition to the city.

One recent Friday night just outside Cape Town , I sat on the side of the N1 highway and counted dead bodies. Kombi vans pulling coffins on trailers were converging at a tunnel that cuts through the mountains. Some call this the border between the city and the Other Side: the Eastern Cape, the rural heartland of the Xhosa people where hills are dotted with colourfully painted mud huts and pastures are grazed by sheep, goats and cattle.
Many Xhosas leave the family homestead to work in Cape Town. They make up the vast majority of this South African citys black population and spend most, if not all, of their lives there. But few want to spend their afterlives there too. So, every weekend, the reverse migration of the dead begins. Over the span of four hours, I counted 196 coffins.
The UNs Population Division estimates that, by 2050, nearly 80% of South Africas population will live in cities . But, among the Xhosa, this rapid increase in urbanisation is happening at the same time as a fierce reclamation of their connection to the old soil. They cinch that commitment with their bones. And its not just the newly dead who are being brought home. Those who have been buried in Cape Town for decades are finding their way back to the Eastern Cape, too.
Bukelwa Fortuin, 26, works just outside the city for First National Bank and lives in Site B of Khayelitsha, Cape Towns largest township. A few months ago, she started dreaming of her dead mother, who had been buried in Cape Town nearly 20 years earlier. Fortuin dreamed the same dream six times, and couldnt get her mother out of her head.
These drives can be perilous and they are expensive, too: the transport alone can cost upwards of $1,000

Every time she passed the cemetery where her mother was buried, she would cry. She would cry at other times out of the blue, and had a few strange experiences  such as the time she beat up a guy who was being disrespectful to an old lady at a taxi rank. When Fortuin eventually sought the guidance of a sangoma healer, she was told that her mother was trying to show she didnt want to be buried in Cape Town. She wanted to go home.
Fortuin talked to some Xhosa elders. They suggested she go to the grave to speak to her mothers spirit and try to bring it back to the Eastern Cape. No, she told them, I think she wants to be exhumed.
Fortuin talked to her father, Griffith, about the possibility of digging up her mothers bones and bringing them home. He explained that he hadnt originally wanted to bury her in Cape Town but wasnt working at the time, so had had no other choice. The regret he felt for burying his wife in the city meant he welcomed the idea of bringing her bones back to the Eastern Cape.
They hired an undertaker, found the death certificate, identified the grave, and planned a second funeral in their village in the Eastern Cape. Funeral policies do not cover exhumations, so the hefty price of the endeavour  around 15,000 rand ($1,300)  came out of their own pockets.
A date was settled on, so that a Cape Town health inspector could be present to prevent any active spores from diseases such as tuberculosis from infecting those unburying the bones. When the day came, Fortuin, her father, the undertaker, the health inspector and a few hired hands went to the graveyard in Maitland . Fortuin watched men with rubber boots, overalls, masks and gloves dig into the dirt.
When the men neared the spot where her mothers bones lay, Bukelwa stepped forward without saying a word. She clambered into the grave, plucked each bone out of the soil with her bare hands, and placed them in a pile on the ground. When she climbed out of the grave, she put the bones inside a new coffin. She didnt want one piece of her mother left in Cape Town.

In the latter half of the 19th century, once diamonds and then gold had been discovered in South Africa, men from all over the region began leaving their rural homelands in search of employment. Between 1871 and 1875, as many as 80,000 Africans worked in the diamond fields each year. Plenty of challenges came with being uprooted: the dangers of working the mines, the horrors of the living conditions, the distance from home. But nothing was as horrible as the idea of being buried in foreign soil.
Miners did all they could to avoid dying far away from home. The academic Tshidiso Maloka describes how, at one diamond mine in the Orange Free State , each Mosotho migrant contributed three pence a month to create a fund that would help the sick return home . These mutual aid funds became common among African miners, and are the basis for the burial societies still common in South Africa today.
These days, of course, its not just miners who live far from home. Families are spread out across the country, but amid this spatial dispersion, the fear of dying far from their point of origin has remained . It is now the reason for a growing industry that transports the dead across South Africa  an industry I came across while living on the Other Side in the small city of King Williams Town, whose streets seemed to boast more funeral parlours than convenience stores. You could buy funeral insurance there in drugstores, at the bank, or even via SMS.
Every Saturday, huge tents housing suit-clad men and dressed-up women would spring up throughout the surrounding countryside; the demand for burials in that much-loved soil came from both near and far. Many of the funeral ceremonies were for people who hadnt lived in the region in years  or, in the case of a growing generation of young Capetonians, who had never lived there at all.
A few months later, I began hanging out in the townships of Cape Town, where most of the citys Xhosa population now resides. I wandered from shack to shack, asking the people I met, Where do you want to be buried?
For bodies to make the journey to the Eastern Cape they have to be embalmed, which happens at the mortuary

People often chuckled at my forwardness and desire to talk about death so soon after meeting them  but almost everyone answered without hesitation: the Eastern Cape. People knew where they lived (the city), they knew why (to work), and they knew where their true home remained (the Other Side).
In one shack on a sandy road in Khayelitsha, a group of young people answered in unison that they all wanted to be buried in the Eastern Cape. Our great grandparents come from there, said Lwazi Lwasi, a young man in a striped collared shirt. Why would we be buried in the sand when theres proper soil back home?
If youre buried here, its as if they threw you away, said Vikela Qinga, a young woman with a floral T-shirt and grey leggings.
Siyabulela Duna, a tall man standing in the open doorway, shook his head at the idea of being buried in Cape Town. Not here, not here, he said. I dont belong here. I am a visitor here. Duna, like most of the young people present that day, was born and raised in Cape Town.
I turned to the others in the room, and asked if they felt like visitors here, too. All of them nodded. Im only here for a job, Mzyanda Mseleni said. I dont belong here. I belong in the Eastern Cape.

Mourners sing at a Khayelitsha funeral
Cape Towns funeral industry has responded to this hankering for home by modernising, and commercialising, the movement of dead bodies across what the academic Rebekah Lee calls the  rural-urban nexus . After someone in Cape Town dies, their family hires an undertaker. The undertaker takes care of the logistics: getting the body to a mortuary, organising the death certificate, helping the family pick out a coffin.
For years most undertakers were white, but once black entrepreneurs took over in the scene in the townships, they became cultural mediators and technological innovators. Unlike white undertakers, who may not have understood the desire to exhume bones or transport a body to a different location, Xhosa undertakers knew precisely why families wanted these things, and could advise customers accordingly.
For bodies to make the journey to the Eastern Cape they have to be embalmed, which happens at the mortuary. Embalming involves injecting a body with a carcinogen so that it doesnt rot, a practice that took hold in the United States during the Civil War, when northern families had their dead loved ones brought home from the south.
Most funerals happen on a Saturday so, come Friday night, there is one last service in the city. The undertaker takes the body from the morgue, puts it in a coffin, loads the coffin into the back of his car  most use old station wagons  and then drives it over to the familys house for the service.
After the service is over, usually around 7pm, the coffin is packed into a trailer and surrounded by clothes so it doesnt budge or shake on the 12-hour drive back to the Eastern Cape. Before family and friends crowd into the kombi pulling the trailer, one family member speaks to the body, telling the deceased that they are going home, and asking them for a safe journey on the way there.
These drives can be perilous  accidents en route to funerals have been dubbed  twice deaths   and they are expensive: transport alone can cost 10,000 rand (upwards of $1,000). But many Xhosa believe that, if you dont pay for a body to leave Cape Town immediately after death, youll only pay more later by organising an exhumation, as Fortuin and her father did.

According to the official census, 391,749 people lived in the Khayelitsha township in 2011, although many estimate that the population is larger. The township is a recent development; while Cape Towns growth accelerated with the boom of gold and diamonds at the turn of the 20th century, pass laws were put in place to keep the city segregated  including the Natives (Urban Areas) act of 1923 , which made all cities in South Africa white, and forced all black African men in cities to carry around passes. Those found without this permit would be arrested and sent back to a rural area.
When the National Party was elected in 1948, this geography of exclusion turned rigid with the implementation of apartheid. Within the city, the Group Areas act began to be enforced, which meant separating races into their own areas in what had been, for some 300 years, a mixed city. In neighbourhoods such as District Six, which was deemed a white area in 1966, many people were forced to leave their homes.
During this time, measures were also taken for influx control to keep Africans out of the cities and in their Bantu homelands  rural areas designated to different ethnic groups, some of which were separate nations until the end of apartheid.
Yet, despite all of these efforts at containment, by 1980 Greater Cape Towns population was nearly 1.9 million people. Pass laws were repealed six years later, and the city, especially the townships, experienced a whole new influx, which brought what is now Khayelitsha into being.

Noluthando Kapa (second left) and friends in Khayelitsha reminisce about home
The South African author Rian Malan described it thus:  It was as if a distant dam had broken , allowing a mass of desperate and hopeful humanity to come flooding over the mountains and spread out across the Cape Flats. They came at the rate of 80, 90 families a day, and built homes with their bare hands, using wooden poles, tin sheeting, bits and pieces of trash rescued from landfills and plastic garbage bags to keep out the rain. Within two years, the sand dunes had vanished under an enormous sea of shacks and shanties, as densely packed as a medieval city.
More than 20 years after democracy, the spatial separation and the sea of shacks and shanties remain: 99% of Khayelitsha residents are black Africans. Life in the township has its perks  cheap transportation, the possibility of work, young people to pass the time with. But, over and over, when I mentioned the idea of being buried in town, people here shuddered.
The watery ground of Cape Town is one of the most common reasons people say they dont want to be buried in the city. Most dwellings in Khayelitsha lie within the floodplain of the Kuils River, where the sand doesnt drain well. When the winter rains come, Khayelitsha floods. One study found that more than 81% of households in one section of the township always flood, and 11% of households sometimes flood. Another found that, during three winters in the late 2000s, between 32,000 and 34,400 people were displaced from informal settlements in Cape Town each year as a result of flooding.
This water is troubling in life  wiping out houses, spreading disease, forcing people to move  and in death, too. When Khayelitsha floods, so do its graves. As Lee notes in her article Death on the Move , a 2003 metropolitan cemetery study in Cape Town identified a looming cemetery crisis, with 16 of the 31 municipal cemeteries  subject to high water table conditions for up to six months of the year.
One afternoon, I talked with a group of women in a shack in Khayelitsha. One of them was an older woman named Noluthando Kapa. She moved to Cape Town more than 20 years ago, but laughed when I asked where her home was, and scoffed at the idea of being buried anywhere but the Eastern Cape.
How can we be buried in town? Be buried here and swim in the water? Water comes up to here, she said, pointing to her neck. When we die ,we need to sleep peacefully and rest, not drown. How can we die so many times?
When we die, we need to sleep peacefully and rest, not drown. How can we die so many times?

At 11pm on a recent Friday night, having counted 196 coffin-toting kombis, I stopped keeping tally and returned to Cape Town. On the ride back, I kept seeing the kombi vans zooming past on the other side of the highway: an ongoing procession of the homeward bound. People say the same thing happens during the holidays, only with more intensity: kombis full of Xhosa people bottleneck at the tunnel of the N1 highway, lining up to pay the tolls, lining up to go home.
In Marilynne Robinsons novel Gilead , a dying father writes a letter to his son. They live in a small town in Iowa that everyone, it seems, wants to leave in favour of the big city. The father writes, This whole town does look like whatever hope becomes after it begins to weary a little, then weary a little more. But hope deferred is still hope. I love this town. I think sometimes of going into the ground here as a last wild gesture of love  I, too, will smoulder away the time until the great and general incandescence.
For now, the midnight march of vans on Friday nights, from the big city back to the Eastern Cape, is a last wild gesture of love; an enduring gift for an unforgotten home.

Sound of the city
Trams have been crisscrossing Sofia since 1901. By the look of them, you might think theyre the same ones (they are mostly old, yellow and clanking). Recently some tram lines have completely closed because of our two expanding metro lines, but downtown and in neighbourhoods such as Krasno Selo, the rumble of the old trams remains a steady part of the citys soundtrack. Its not exactly romantic, but there is a certain old-world charm to it.
Best current venue

Anything outdoors; Swimming Pool was an instant hit. Sofias latest space for contemporary art is located in a charming pre-war rooftop apartment with a mind-blowing 360-degree view of the city, and a real  albeit non-functioning  swimming pool.
The latter serves as a blue cube to host artistic projects and performances twice a year. The first exhibition, Balconia, was curated by Swimming Pool founder Viktoria Draganova.
Whos top of the playlist?
A true poet and master of social satire, Itzo Hazarta is not a new kid on the block. The founder and frontman of Bulgarias all-time favourite hip-hop group, Upsurt, has been around for more than 15 years now. Singing strictly in Sofia dialect, Upsurt achieved cult status thanks to their razor-sharp, hysterical and completely untranslatable lyrics referencing Bulgarian culture, current affairs and daily life. These days Itzo Hazarta continues in the same vein, but solo.
Best local artist
With a physics degree, a job in IT and school friends who were imprisoned or shot, Svetozar Georgiev  AKA ghostdog  is not your average poet. His poems are a unique blend of rhythm and slang, self-deprecation, humour and sensitivity. His plays, on the other hand, ponder existential matters such as the phases of post-breakup recovery, what office culture might be like in purgatory and the inner life of a Russian cosmonauts wife, with the characters ranging from Homer to Tupac Shakur, Darth Vader to Alan Turing.
The look on the street
Hippy to hipster ... Sofia street style. Photograph: Mihail Ruev for U-lica.com (left and right) and Lora Slavova for Sofia Street Style
Sofia is not fashion-forward and you will rarely see avant garde or eccentric characters, but looks vary greatly, from chalga (a popular music genre based on Balkan rhythms, associated with simple lyrics and provocative clothes) to sporty and from hippy to hipster. Many women will only step out in full make-up and high heels. On the other hand, the cultural and creative communities take it easy in that understated, dressed-down Berlin way (a city some people say Sofia reminds them of). Western brands such as H&amp;M and Zara prevail, mixed and matched with secondhand finds. Lately a number of original Bulgarian designer brands have cropped up  Shevitza for scarves, Serendipity for jewels, Bogdanin Brothers for leather bags, 45 Street for hats, and Garderob , Sassa Bjorg and Knapp for clothes.
Comedy gold
The latest comedy hit is actually a staged multimedia sequel of a cult TV show. Aired between 1992 and 2004, the much-loved political cabaret Ulitsata (The Street) was based on brilliant improvisations and sketches about the life of small people after the fall of communism. A whole generation grew up with it, memorising lines from the show. Twenty years later, director Tedi Moskovs swan song did not disappoint loyal fans.
The best cultural Instagram
Boyscout is an online magazine, created originally as a guide for young men with good manners, but it has found a wider audience hungry for cultural media in a market where the only magazines are the Cosmos and the Playboys. Boyscouts weekly selection of popular culture is solid, stylish and diverse, covering music, fashion, design, events and arts both from the local scene and internationally.
Whats the big talking point?

Monuments are always controversial in Bulgaria (we are still processing parts of our past), but three weeks ago the newly erected Bulgarian Tsar Samuils monument in central Sofia prompted a fierce war of words . Academics and intellectuals criticised the tacky glow-in-the-dark eyes, setting off a number of internet memes on the monuments relation to Darth Vader. The pro camp said the critics were being unpatriotic and pretentious. The state failed to act and now the monument is there  not to honour Tsar Samuil, but as symbol of our societys deficiencies.
Moment in history?
While in 2012 the joke went that Greek protesters carried banners reading, Keep quiet, dont wake up the Bulgarians, in 2013 our civil society finally did wake up, and went out on the street to protest the governments nepotism and corruption. The protests were accompanied by artistic performances and a spirit of hope that something was happening. The legacy is still debated (the government did change, but not as a direct result), but one thing the protests are credited for is shaking civil society out of its coma.
Best street art?

An artistic take on the cyrillic alphabet, 30bukvi (30 Letters) is a project by Bulgarian graphic designer Georgi Georgiev. He printed his visual interpretation of the cyrillic on ceramic tiles and then secretly plastered them on to the streets of Sofia the night before 24 May last year (Bulgarian Education and Culture, and Slavonic Literature Day). The project was a bid to celebrate the alphabet as a part of the nations identity.

Will Google's $5m plan make cycling in the rest of Silicon Valley easier?
Cycling is safe and easy inside the search giants Mountain View HQ, but getting to the site from elsewhere in Silicon Valley means crossing fast-moving expressways and busy train tracks. Is Googles new bike plan the answer?

Inside the Googleplex  the tech giants headquarters in Mountain View, California  hundreds of multi-coloured bikes are scattered around. With bright yellow frames and big blue and green rubber tires, theyre seemingly everywhere  clustered at the edges of parking lots, lined near building entrances, or clumsily toppled over into the office park landscaping. The bikes make it easy for Googles employees to move between its many office buildings, spread over roughly two miles of land at the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay in a neighbourhood known as North Bayshore. Inside the Googleplex, biking is safe and easy.
Outside the Googleplex, not so much.
Getting to and from North Bayshore is not exactly pleasant, says Shiloh Ballard, executive director of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition. The neighbourhood is on the other side of a highway from most of the rest of Silicon Valley, and a bike ride to the Googleplex would typically involve crossing busy train tracks, navigating arterial roads with high speed limits and braving the valleys expressway system that has essentially turned many surface streets into mini freeways.
Ballards group is one of many that have become concerned about how people can bike from the residential areas of Silicon Valley to North Bayshore, where Google , Microsoft, LinkedIn and dozens of other companies are located. And, since the city of Mountain View recently made available more than 2.2 million square feet of commercial construction rights in North Bayshore, even more people will be heading to the area in the near future.

In an effort to improve the bicycle commute to North Bayshore, Google set out to rethink the areas bicycle infrastructure network. Working with the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition, the company commissioned an urban planning consultancy, Alta Planning + Design, to look not only at the area immediately surrounding the Googleplex, but at each of the cities in the general vicinity. The goal was to envision a bike network that would help people get from their homes to the tech offices in North Bayshore, but also for the entire community to have better bike access. The result is the recently released Bike Vision Plan for North Santa Clara County . The plan outlines a potential future for the area that moves away from its suburban office park present towards a Copenhagen-like future of bikeable streets and interconnected neighbourhoods.
The plan moves away from the suburban office park present towards a Copenhagen-like future
Such a transition may be more vision than plan, but Google has already engendered a vibrant bicycling ethos in the valley, at least among its own employees. Roughly 9% of Google employees living in the cities immediately surrounding its headquarters commute by bike. Within a 9-mile radius of the office, 21% are bike commuters.
To bump that number even higher, and to grow overall bicycle commuting in the valley, Googles vision focuses on expanding the existing bicycle infrastructure in the area and targeting what it calls high-stress streets  streets where speed limits are 35 miles per hour or more. By adding strategic infrastructure like protected cycle tracks, multi-use paths and buffered bike lanes, the plan envisions a low-stress bike system that covers 277 miles of roadway in the area, up from 87 miles today. The plan proposes $5m in matching grants that Google will award to cities or other groups in the region who come up with the best ways to start building this system.

But some worry that Googles bicycle vision and a broad swath of other proposed community benefits linked to the companys development plans may be in limbo. In May, the Mountain View city council dashed Googles proposed plans for a 2.5 million square foot project in North Bayshore, approving just 515,000 square feet of the project. The city instead awarded 1.45 million square feet of developable land to LinkedIn. The public benefits package tied to Googles development plan  including affordable housing, infrastructure repairs, new bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and upgrades to two existing multi-use trails  would have been worth upwards of $200m.
The likelihood of the entire plan going forward, thats contingent upon a 2.5 million square foot expansion, says Ballard. We already know they didnt get that, so now its a matter of looking at these different pieces of it and asking whats going to move forward.
Mountain View City Council member Lenny Siegel says the bike vision plan will likely stay on the table. Google seems willing to invest in those benefits even if its not linked to a particular approval, Siegel says.
Google officials were not available to comment.

Siegel says Google can be an important partner for municipalities like Mountain View to kickstart projects like the bike vision plan. But he also notes that the company should take responsibility for some of its impacts on the community.
The rapid growth of Google and LinkedIn and the other companies has created transportation needs, and we have to figure out a way to use the wealth thats been accumulated by those companies to pay to address those needs, Siegel says. And right now, Google is the company thats most willing to do that.
Ballard is hopeful that the bike plan will help Silicon Valley to begin building out a more complete bike infrastructure network, whether to Copenhagen levels or not. And with Googles $5m pledge, she says the plan has a good chance of getting the cities in the area to take action  and to compete with each other to get the matching funds.
The idea here is, look, weve got a pot of money, whos going to do the best job drawing down this money and doing some great bike projects? she says. We can absolutely use peer pressure to get the cities to be doing innovative things.
Though Ballard concedes that $5m is only a small investment in a huge problem, its at least a starting place for cities in Silicon Valley to help spread bikeability beyond the Googleplex.

Charles Correa wanted to design a better Mumbai but the city let him down

He was a prophet without imprimatur in his own city. Charles Correa , who passed away late on the night of 16 June, was among the great architects of our times. His institutional buildings across the world are all iconic. Yet, Mumbai, his lifelong home, boasts just one residential tower designed by him  an irony as much as a travesty. Though the cubist Kanchanjunga is eye-catching, its still high-rise: a genre caustically savaged by this patron saint of low-slung architecture.
It gets worse. Correas real passion was the designing of cities that are easy to live, work, play  and commute  in. But his karma was Mumbai, which can check none of these boxes with a straight face. The man who described cities as places of hope was fated to live in a city of disappointments . Its not just because its skyline resembles an alarming ECG. More specifically, Mumbai mindlessly sabotaged two of his masterful plans, each of which would have helped it regain its post-independence swagger as Indias showpiece.
One was his design for New Bombay across the harbour in 1964; the other his masterplan in 1996 for the textile mill-lands in the heart of what had by then been rechristened Mumbai. Ironically, he had been appointed for these visionary tasks by the very politicians who would later subvert them; one with myopic indifference, the other with unmitigated greed.

In a leap of imagination from prevailing wisdom, Correa envisaged a large, independent New Bombay, not a satellite town. He knew that nothing less would do to save a metropolis that was growing at a lethal pace. From 1951 to 61, the citys population had doubled; it would increase by 80.8% in the next decade. The City &amp; Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) was set up to give form to this wowing blueprint drawn up by him, Shirish Patel and Pravin Mehta. New Bombay could accommodate 2.1 million people, happily.
Instead, largely because the state government did not move its offices there as planned, it remained a dormitory town, and not a conducive one because the suburban railway lines were not extended. Correa was wryly vindicated some 40 years later when Mumbai finally burst at the seams, spilling over into Navi Mumbai  where real-estate prices on swanky Palm Beach Avenue now almost rival those on Mumbais art-deco Marine Drive.
The mill-lands, meanwhile, have turned into a nightmarish Gotham in a much, much shorter time. Before our eyes, chimneys give way to giant cranes: midwives delivering massive housing and residential complexes, whose hyperventilating billboards blithely ignore the antiquated civic utilities underneath.
By the time he died at 84, Correa had long been a disillusioned man
Correa may or may not have got smug satisfaction from this urban morass. His commissioned plan was a living, breathing document, developed along transit lines and integrating commerce, culture and ease of living. His canvas had been the open land which had fallen into decay after the fatal textile strike of 1982 , and which, after protracted legal wrangling over workers dues, was then opened up for development.
But with a rapacious sleight-of-hand, the relevant rule was reworded overnight: open land was redefined, and the promised 166 acres for public use shrivelled to a scandalous 32. Mill-owners and builders made a killing on the rest; the same can be said for much of Mumbai.

Correas sheer genius excused his arrogance. He worked with a manic stillness, and was caustically impatient with journalists unable to convey his nuanced urban vision  this writer included. I also still blush over a 2013 incident, when I invited him to launch my book on Mumbai at the Times Litfest . He adamantly refused at first, dredging up some long-ago lapse, then relented  only to lambast me from the stage for a bigger crime. I was the festival director, and our 11th-hour sponsor was exactly the kind of developer he routinely slammed for the citys destruction.
By the time he died at 84, Correa had long been a disillusioned man , compensating for the rampaging skyline at home with the accolades and commissions abroad he continued to execute. Ahmedabad-based Balkrishna Doshi, a believer in the same principles of architecture and planning for 60 years  and best man at Correas wedding  said he was overwhelmed by the new project plans his friend showed him on a recent visit. These included an extension for his awesome Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown : a research and treatment facility for neurosciences and cancer built on almost the same spot on Lisbons river Tigus from which Vasco da Gama sailed out on another voyage of discovery, five centuries ago. (Doshi also recalled how Correa would play Those were the days, my friend every time he visited him.)

Correas wife Monika is an accomplished art-weaver; his son-in-law, Rahul Mehrotra , also a globally acclaimed architect and planner. Monika and Charles were a striking couple for almost half a century on the citys cultural landscape  and the familiar faces of the cognoscenti that still holds on to the idea of Bombay were all there at the funeral mass this morning.
But there was much of Mumbai too  both students and unknown admirers. They gathered, undeterred by the unrelenting monsoon squall, in Salvacao Church : Correas expansive creation in congested Dadar, with its distinctive roof and circular, stained-glass window. From his signature mastery of light and space, Charles Correa departed from the city he tried to save  and which is paying the price of its greedy disobedience.

When Anthony Trzaska hears the words Slavic Village in news reports, he knows what is coming next. Its almost like when the media reports anything on Slavic Village, its followed with: Comma, where the foreclosure crisis in America started, says the 31-year-old resident. Its not like the foreclosure mess didnt happen. But it didnt just happen here.
Clevelands Slavic Village is widely perceived as the epicentre of the Great Recession . In 2007, when the media finally realised that the housing bubble was bursting wide open (about two years after 48 states had sued subprime lender Ameriquest for fraudulent loan practices), a few journalists decided to run some zip codes to see where the most foreclosures were happening.
The zip code 44105 popped up at the top of the list . And with that, the great international financial crisis of the 21st century was centred in an old neighbourhood in Cleveland, Ohio  one that had been declining since the 1970s. At the time, few reported that foreclosures were also hitting cities like Miami, Las Vegas, Detroit and Phoenix far worse than Cleveland. Instead, some claimed that what was happening on Fleet Avenue, home to Polish sausage makers, was influencing the International Monetary Fund s economic policy.

But what happened in Slavic Village  about five miles south of downtown Cleveland, on the eastern edge of the industrial valley  was symptomatic of greater issues across the cities of the American rust belt. For decades, old neighbourhoods had lost their economic reason for being; their factories were closing, their populations rapidly declining. They had too much housing in very poor condition, high poverty, high crime and little outside investment. When the housing crisis hit, many of the houses were abandoned, boarded up and left to rot.
After 50 years of decline, however, Slavic Village  named after the Polish and Czech immigrants who once settled there, with a current population of 22,000 that is now about half black and half white  is trying to crawl out of the wreckage. Never hip or trendy, it was, nevertheless, once the biggest retail district in Cleveland outside of downtown.

Trzaska is working to bring that back. The property developer is a native: his family still operates a funeral home in Slavic Village. Now he is buying up property to market to small businesses. The focus is on Fleet Avenue, which is currently being torn up as part of a $9m renovation project to be completed this year. His firm, Sonny Day Development , is hoping to encourage small businesses to take root in the old neighbourhood, with retail on street level and housing above  an old model that has fallen out of favour.
Slavic Village is playing the cards it has been dealt, Trzaska says. But I can see millennials approaching [local life] more in the way our grandparents did. Its not just that they want things close together  their work and social life, and stores they support  but they want to be a part of a neighbourhood. They didnt have that growing up in the suburbs.
The neighbourhood has a lot of natural advantages: it is 10 minutes from downtown, with solid housing stock. And part of the reason for Slavic Villages success in the fight against blight is the Slavic Village Recovery project . The private, for-profit entity has succeeded in fixing up decent, affordable housing for sale on the market  and has found that bypassing government subsidies to do so can actually make the houses cheaper.
The company is run by Robert Klein, CEO of Safeguard Properties, which manages foreclosed properties for banks. Klein, 62, knew from experience that banks just want to get rid of abandoned properties. But government regulations for non-profits trying to fix up foreclosed homes made the process too expensive  in short, taking public money meant you had to fix up homes too nicely.
We find we can do the basic refurbishments for about $40,000 to $50,000 and then sell a three-bedroom, 1,200 sq ft home for about $65,000, he says. We can make a small profit of about $7,000 on the house, and then put that money into doing more houses. We dont take a cent in public money.

Taking public money can make properties difficult to finance through bank lending. For example, to be eligible for tax breaks and other funding grants in Cleveland, a property must meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards: green regulations that exceed what is required by the Cleveland city building code. Meeting LEED can often require tearing all walls down to the studs  an expensive prospect. Third-party contractors must also supervise and certify parts of the refurbishment, which can further drive up costs. The difference can be big: about $100,000 total cost for a home certified under LEED guidelines versus about $60,000 for one that meets city building codes. Banks are less willing to lend $100,000 for a house with LEED certification in a neighbourhood where comparable homes are selling for $40,000, but will be more willing to loan up to $65,000 for a renovated home in that same neighbourhood that meets city building codes.
Because Slavic Village Recovery does not meet the full government green standards, its houses are not eligible for the citys 10-year tax abatement for refurbished houses. But, even without the tax break, the average monthly mortgage payment for a $65,000 refurb in Slavic Village comes in at about $450  whereas for a $100,000 home it would be $625, even after the $100 tax break.
It is pretty simple, Klein says. We can get people into a three-bedroom house in a neighbourhood that is coming back for less than most rentals in the area. And the buyers are not getting tax breaks, so the city isnt getting shorted, either. We found the government programmes were very slow, and didnt really help the neighbourhood much because it was one property here and another there. We work with the community development corporation to pick out houses we want to do, and try to concentrate on one neighbourhood first before we move on to other streets.
The community development corporation performs a sort of triage on the neighbourhood: those houses that dont make the grade are slated for demolition. About 150 homes  two-thirds of the ones theyve assessed so far  have been demolished in the past two years. These are usually houses with structural issues, especially ones that have been gutted by thieves stealing plumbing pipes and kitchen and bathroom fixtures.

This month, after two years of operation, the Slavic Village Recovery project will celebrate its 25th homebuyer. Another eight are under contract, with 30 houses total in the inventory and about 10 in the process of refurbishment. Klein says he has heard from other communities  in Columbus, Chicago and Atlanta  who want to do what Slavic Village is doing. Getting rid of blight isnt as complicated as it is made out to be, Klein says.
Eight years since it was written off, the housing market in Slavic Village seems to be on the up. Owning a three-bedroom home, 10 minutes from downtown, has practical market value. And retail follows rooftops that have people underneath them  shops and housing are each one half of an equation, both dependent on the other. Im pretty optimistic the worst is over for Slavic Village,says Trzaska. This neighbourhood has value, and thats what it was based on historically. Im seeing people realise that part of it once again.

        <title>Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/26/albania-battle-against-corruption-organised-crime</Link>
        <Description/>

In Albania , corruption has long been part of everyday life. People talk of taking a loved one to hospital and having to pay the doctor to get the best treatment, or of going to a property registration office and being asked to pay an extra fee to speed things up.
This culture of bribery has not only kept societys most vulnerable from accessing vital services but has also damaged Albanias international image. In a 2011 study , the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said Albanian citizens ranked corruption as the second most important problem after unemployment.
Since emerging from the decades-long dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, who turned Albania into one of the worlds most isolated states, the Balkan country of 2.8 million people has struggled to deal with corruption and organised crime.
When he took office in 2013, Prime Minister Edi Rama, the one-time flamboyant mayor who oversaw the repainting of Tiranas communist-era grey buildings, made it a priority to tackle corruption and improve Albanias international standing.
The centre-left coalition governments reforms have focused on improving administrative systems, enforcing the rule of law, and making it easier for people to report corruption.
Last February, the government launched an online anti-corruption portal to allow citizens to anonymously record instances of unscrupulous practices. The website covers 12 key areas, including police, health and customs.
Since then, 6,840 reports have been logged . Many of these involve complaints about poor service, but 777 cases directly relate to accusations of corruption, with 35 reports referred to prosecutors.
Rama insists Albanias poor international reputation is based on exaggerated stereotypes rather than reality, but admits that combating corruption is key to changing perceptions. To improve the image of a country, first you have to change the country itself, he said. I believe corruption becomes the alternative when a government is not able to serve its citizens in a transparent and efficient way. So we have to modernise, and modernisation is about reforms.
Another anti-corruption programme involves text messages being sent to citizens to ask whether they had to pay a bribe when receiving treatment at state-run hospitals.
The scheme, run by the ministry of state for local issues and anti-corruption, and supported by the World Bank , was launched in March and has reached more than 33,000 people, about 20% of whom have provided feedback.
The doctors are always late and the corruption continues as always. Without giving away money, no one takes care of you, said one person. Another person, who had gone to a hospital in the city of Durres, was more positive: I have been in hospital before, but this time you could feel the change. No one asked for a bribe.
The World Bank has previously supported a similar programme in Pakistan.
Low trust in government leads not only to informal means of obtaining services and less willingness to pay taxes, it also leads to lower resources for the government to provide public services, thus completing a vicious cycle of mistrust and corruption, Jana Kunicova and Zubair Bhatti, public sector experts at the World Bank, wrote in a blog . By proactively collecting citizen feedback and using it for management actions, this vicious cycle can be broken.
In its 2011 survey , the UNODC said on average 28.3% of Albanians aged between 18 and 64 had been exposed, either directly or indirectly, to a bribery experience with a public official in the previous year. But it noted that about 30% of bribes paid were actually offered by citizens themselves.
Albania, which ranks 110th out of 175 countries in Transparency Internationals 2014 corruption perceptions index, joins a list of other countries using the internet to crack down on corruption , either through naming and shaming or by bringing bribery and other corrupt practices into the open.
The UN Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting Albanias anti-corruption drive. The country, which was given a ninth millennium development goal on good governance, is now piloting the governance indicator of the new sustainable development goals , which will frame development priorities until 2030.

Between June and December 2014, the project focused on identifying indicators relevant to Albania. The second phase, which ends in September, will implement systems to measure the indicators.
The UNDP says Albania recognises that reforms in good governance are essential if the country wants to achieve European Union membership. Many Albanians are optimistic that acceptance last year as an official membership candidate signals a new start for the former communist country.
The governance indicators are very important for Albanias EU integration and for strengthening the rule of law, said the UNs resident coordinator, Zineb Touimi-Benjelloun. Controlling corruption and improving good governance remain a challenge here, but being a pilot country has proved to serve as a catalyst for the government to set up appropriate systems and improve service delivery.
After the first phase of the pilot, about 20 indicators were proposed and grouped into three target areas: improvement in governance to meet EU standards by 2030; better service delivery, with a focus on water, electricity and land; and improved economic performance, using foreign direct investment as a measure.
Rama believes his government is moving in the right direction. Albania suffered for many years from lack of reforms and badly made policies, he said. We have shown we can make positive changes but, of course, we have not solved all the countrys problems yet. Every month, we have something important scheduled to happen and, less than two years in, we are definitely where I hoped we would be.

Sustainable development must live up to its promise to leave no one behind
With the endgame nearing for the sustainable development agenda, leaders must commit to helping those worst affected by poverty and discrimination

When heads of state sign an international agreement on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in September, the document is likely to include a promise to leave no one behind.
The principle will be one of the most important in the entire agreement. Implemented properly, it will take the world beyond business as usual, marking an important difference between the existing millennium development goals and the new SDGs.

But if countries make impressive overall progress towards the goals while people suffering the worst poverty and discrimination see little or no change, then the whole project will arguably have failed.
So as negotiators resume talks on the SDGs in New York this week, they should push for an agreement that enshrines the principle of leaving no one behind in the outcome document. The concept has obvious appeal. Not only is it a prerequisite for ending extreme poverty by 2030, it can also be applied in every country, rich and poor alike.
Nonetheless, some are sceptical about the idea. It does not address the pressing issues of global wealth concentration and international inequality. Moreover, making it a reality will involve hard work. Addressing entrenched poverty and discrimination will require finance, including international funding , and the political will to make difficult decisions.
Governments around the world will have to integrate the idea into their own policy and planning and may have to contemplate economic, structural and fiscal reforms.
All countries will need to buy into the idea, but if it is to succeed there must be a focus on particular countries, such as least-developed countries, that need additional support.
Once agreement is reached, the hard work will begin. Every country should be required to develop national SDG implementation plans, identifying those people and communities at risk of being forgotten.
These groups may match up with some already listed in the existing post-2015 draft: women and girls, migrant workers and people with disabilities. But there may be other social groups that should be highlighted in national plans  minority groups, indigenous people and those affected by caste-based discrimination, for example.
Country plans should also include interim or mid-term targets. A 15-year timeframe is important for achieving long-term change, but stepping stones are also needed to ensure that the hardest tasks are not deferred.
Christian Aids new briefing on leaving no one behind tries to bring the principle to life, illustrating its global importance and suggesting how governments might start to implement the idea.
The briefing includes some shocking examples of the millions of people left far behind, from a wide range of countries across the world. Ghana, for instance, reduced its income-poverty level from 52% in 1992 to 28.5% in 2006. Yet, while the reduction in the south of the country was 58.66%, in the north it was just 8.87%. Maternal mortality rates are similarly uneven.
Every country should be required to those people and communities at risk of being forgotten
Brazil, meanwhile, despite laudable progress towards reducing income inequality, still has one of the worlds most unequal patterns of land ownership, with 3% of the population owning two-thirds of all arable land. Quilombola people , who are descended from slaves, are at the other end of the spectrum from the big landowners. Only 8% of their 3,000-plus communities in Brazil own the land on which they live, leaving them vulnerable to harm from private interests, such as mining companies, as well as government authorities.
In south Asia, the briefing notes: Poverty is overwhelmingly concentrated among those groups who face discrimination because of who they are and the work they do. Discrimination based on work and descent, associated with the practice of caste, is a root cause of inequality and persistently high levels of poverty  worldwide, it is estimated that 260 million people are affected.
Dalit women are particularly vulnerable, the briefing notes.
The SDGs have the potential to focus policymakers attention on the people who are left behind in their societies. With so many women, men and children so profoundly affected  and with less than 100 days until heads of state meet to finalise the new goals  the challenge of embedding the idea of leaving no one behind in the new development agenda could not be more important or urgent.

        <title>Foreign Office under fire over aid spent on game show and Facebook workshop</title>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has launched a review of its use of aid money following reports it has spent nearly 300,000 on projects including a TV game show in Ethiopia , a Shakespeare workshop in Ecuador and efforts to find mates for fish off Madagascar .
While the overwhelming majority of the UKs 12bn aid budget is administered and spent by the Department for International Development (DfID) , the Foreign Office was allocated 343m of aid money last year.
On Thursday, the Sun newspaper published a list of projects apparently funded by FCO aid money, ranging from a 7,000 anti-littering campaign in Jordan to a 970 programme designed to promote the safe and responsible use of Facebook in Laos .
According to the Sun, the FCO spent nearly 14,000 on the Ethiopian quiz show as part of its drive to connect with a younger generation of Ethiopians  [and] engage them on UK values of human rights and good governance. A further 5,000 went on Hamlet education workshops in Quito to mark a visit by the Globe theatre in London, claimed the newspaper.
Related: UK passes bill to honour pledge of 0.7% foreign aid target
In a box headlined Fish Called Squander, the Sun reported that the department also spent 3,400 trying to help find mates for two endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in London Zoo.
Although the FCO pointed out that the projects in question had cost a total of 278,000  0.08% of its total aid allocation last year  it said the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, had asked for the spending to be investigated.
The foreign secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCOs aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money, said a spokeswoman.
Building closer relationships with growing economies is important. The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show tax-payers cash is being spent wisely.
Some Tory backbenchers attempted to derail the legislative process, with one dismissing it as sop to Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, lentil-eating do-gooders with a misguided guilt complex .
On Sunday, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, suggested that more of Britains aid budget should be spent to discourage mass migration from Africa so that the UK does not have to fish refugees out of the Mediterranean.

International donors led by India and China have pledged approximately $3bn (1.91bn) to rebuild Nepal in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes that hit the country.
Sushil Koirala, the countrys prime minister, vowed zero tolerance of corruption and said all aid money would go to those affected by the disasters.
Nepal says it needs about $6.7bn (4.3bn) to recover from the quakes that occurred in April and May , which killed more than 8,800 people, destroyed nearly half a million houses and left thousands in need of food, clean water and shelter.

At a meeting of foreign donors on Thursday, Indias foreign minister Sushma Swaraj pledged $1bn to finance reconstruction, while China promised 3bn yuan ($483m) in grant assistance.
Nepals two giant neighbours have historically vied for influence in the Himalayan nation, and both were heavily involved in post-quake rescue and relief efforts.
Additional pledges of $600m from the Asian Development Bank , $260m from Japan, $130m from the US, $100m from the EU as well as an earlier announcement of up to $500m from the World Bank means the total assistance pledged now stands at roughly $3bn.
The Nepalese government wants all aid to be channelled through a new state body, raising concerns among some international donors that bureaucracy and poor planning will hamper reconstruction.
Koirala, however, urged delegates to work with us, the government of Nepal and vowed zero tolerance toward corruption.
I assure you that we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the support reaches the intended beneficiaries, he said as he opened the one-day meeting in Kathmandu.
Nepal  one of the worlds poorest countries even before the disaster  desperately needs assistance to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals destroyed or damaged by the earthquakes. .
One in 10 people are homeless and the Himalayan nations already weak economy has been hit hard, with annual growth forecast to fall to just 3%, the lowest in eight years.
But critics say Kathmandu is struggling to lay out a roadmap to recovery.
What is lacking right now is a clear strategy  the government needs to come up with a credible plan to implement reconstruction projects within a stipulated time, Chandan Sapkota, an economist at the Asian Development Banks Nepal office, said ahead of the meeting.
As pledges rolled in, participants said it was crucial to ensure the money was spent well.
Money will be important for building back a more resilient Nepal  but its not just about money, the World Bank president Jim Yong Kim told delegates in a video message. Just as important is how these funds are spent.
The international community pledged several billion dollars in aid to Haiti after a catastrophic earthquake struck the Caribbean nation in January 2010 .
But the pledges yielded little tangible progress as donors delayed implementing projects due to concerns over corruption and political instability, leaving thousands living in temporary shelters five years on.
Follow-up is extremely important  when pledges are made, the government formulates its plans accordingly and if the money doesnt come, it throws everything out of gear, said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the World Health Organisation s regional director for south-east Asia.
We have seen that happen in previous cases with devastating results, so I think we will lose our credibility as members of the donor community if we dont act on our promises, Singh said on the sidelines of the conference.
Dev Ratna Dhakhwa, secretary general of the Nepal Red Cross Society , said earlier he feared Kathmandus one-window policy for reconstruction would obstruct relief efforts, with political parties already trying to manipulate the system to siphon off funds.
People are using political influence to pressure officials and access funds meant for quake victims, by getting their names added to government-managed records, Dhakhwa said.

In a basement under the UN headquarters in New York, the worlds governments are negotiating an agreement that could strengthen the future course of global tax systems. A deal on this could also dramatically contribute to financing poverty eradication and environmental protection, securing development priorities for the next 15 years .
The talks  meant to lead to agreement on how to fund the sustainable development goals  will culminate in a global summit on financing for development in Ethiopia next month.
A core issue in this heated discussion is whether developing countries have a right to sit at the table when global tax standards are decided.
Aware that they lose more money to international tax dodging than they receive in aid , developing countries have demanded fundamental changes to the way global standards for cross-border taxation and financial transparency are decided.
They want a global body on tax cooperation under the auspices of the UN. Today, global tax standards are decided behind closed doors at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD )  also known as the rich countries club.
The result is a set of standards that disadvantage developing countries financially, and a broken global tax system, riddled with loopholes for tax dodgers.
This system also creates a race to the bottom whereby governments clash in tax wars  fighting to get multinational corporations to pay taxes in their own country, while at the same time providing loopholes for multinationals to dodge taxes in other countries.
The victims include national companies unable to compete with multinational corporations, and citizens, who face higher prices and poorer public services.
Developing countries want a new tax body to foster global cooperation based on the simple principle that countries should not destroy the tax systems of other countries. This would strengthen the ability of countries to set their own tax rates and decide their own national systems.
European states have different positions, but  in particular because of the UK and France  the EU is rejecting the proposal for a global tax body.

Here are 10 reasons why the EU should change its stance:
A key step towards a coherent global system. The international tax system consists of a complicated web of legally binding bilateral tax treaties, and parallel international systems to regulate cross-border taxation. A global system offers the only way to remove this complexity.
Stronger cooperation between tax administrations. A coherent global system will improve working conditions for tax administrations, enabling more efficient cooperation to ensure multinational corporations pay their taxes.
Less unilateral action. Individual governments have resorted to blacklisting and aggressive national laws to protect their tax base. Under the status quo, we are likely to see more self-protective measures, which complicate the lives of ordinary people and those companies not evading taxes.
An end to the race to the bottom. The fear of losing investments is driving governments to introduce tax incentives, loopholes and harmful tax practices.
A better business environment. Diverse, inconsistent national tax systems create heavy administrative burdens, legal uncertainty and high risks for international business.
A level playing field. Governments fear that being a first mover on tax transparency will push businesses to register in other jurisdictions. Through truly global negotiations, governments can agree coordinated action and ensure a level playing field.

Stronger implementation. No government feels obliged to implement tax standards that were adopted, without consent, behind closed doors. The UN is the only global institution where all governments participate as equals.
Less double taxation and double-non-taxation. Mismatches between national tax systems explain why some get taxed twice on the same income while others dont get taxed at all. Only truly global cooperation can end these problems.
More financing for development in the poorest countries. The exclusion of the worlds poorest countries from decisions on global tax standards means that international systems often dont consider their interests. This means lower tax income and scarcer financing for development.
Fair and consistent global action against tax havens. Many governments try to protect their tax base through national blacklists based on criteria that are often unclear and inconsistently applied. The EUs controversial new  tax haven blacklist  omits countries like Switzerland and Luxembourg but includes, for example, Liberia  one of the worlds poorest countries and not a major player in the offshore world. Action against tax havens must be fair, consistent and globally coordinated to be effective.
There is also one last bonus reason. Right now, disagreements about the tax body are preventing governments from reaching an agreement on a wider financing for development accord.
This deal, meant to be finalised in Addis Ababa, would be the first step towards the adoption of the sustainable development goals in September and the drafting of a climate treaty in December . Unblocking the stalemate over a global tax body could pave the way for more multilateral breakthroughs.
Its time for EU countries to call their negotiators in New York and tell them to shift position.

        <title>Development finance's $83bn question: who will pay for gender equality? | Chiara Capraro and Kasia Staszewska</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/financing-for-development-gender-equality-83bn-question-addis-ababa-sdgs</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>While a significant number of governments have championed an ambitious standalone goal on gender equality and womens empowerment in the negotiations on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), discussions on financing have struggled to reach agreement on issues that are fundamental to women.
Last week, governments met in New York to draft the outcome document for the third international conference on financing for development (FFD) , which will take place in Addis Ababa in mid-July. Negotiations are continuing as governments struggle to agree on key issues such as tax, a critical source of financing for development commitments, human rights and gender equality.
The Addis Ababa conference is of crucial importance to women. Decisions made in the Ethiopian capital will determine how the SDGs will be financed.
Although no specific costing for achieving gender equality and womens rights within the context of the SDGs has yet been calculated, in the case of the millennium development goals (MDGs), which expire this year, the gender equality financing gap in low income countries was projected at $83bn (53bn) in 2015 .
Because the new development agenda is universal  and far more ambitious than the MDGs  the costs are likely to be even greater.
Yet it is not only the quantity of funds that matters but how funds are raised and who receives them. As women and men occupy different roles in society, different sources of money affect them differently.
According to research, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off
Across the world, women carry out at least twice as much unpaid care work as men , and this contribution is often invisible and unrecognised. At work, women are worse off too. According to recent research by ActionAid, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off . Governments need to value women and their unpaid work when thinking about economic policy.
The FFD process can and should address major structural issues such as tax dodging, which deprives developing countries of far more than they receive in aid . Lack of revenue forces governments to spend less on essential public services. This can have a disproportionate effect on women in poverty if, for example, you consider childcare or support for survivors of gender-based violence  both services that are used mainly by women. Governments should take the opportunity offered by the Addis meeting to accelerate progress on global tax reform that works for developing countries.
Aid will continue to be a critical source of finance for the SDGs, especially for the least developed countries, but the share of aid supporting womens needs is still too low. According to OECD GenderNet , in 2012-13 only 5% of aid had gender equality as a principal objective .
Governments must recommit to meet the long-standing target of devoting 0.7% of GDP to aid, and increase the share of aid dedicated to gender equality, while investing more in supporting the crucial work done by womens rights organisations on the ground .
To date, huge emphasis has been placed on the role of the private sector in financing development, especially multinational companies. While the private sector has a role to play in creating decent jobs and ensuring equal pay for women, the footprint of many companies has been harmful to womens rights at work .
Related: Less pay, more work, no pension: the 21st-century woman's lot laid bare
We need to move away from voluntary corporate social responsibility commitments towards a legally binding regulation to make sure companies are accountable. If businesses did this, and paid their taxes in full, it would send a strong signal that the private sector is serious about supporting sustainable development, gender equality and womens rights.
The current draft of the Addis Ababa Accord starts well by stating a commitment towards gender equality and womens rights, but falls short on staying true to this vision throughout. Lack of recognition of the structural causes of gender inequality, such as the disproportionate responsibility of unpaid care borne by women and girls, means it risks focusing only on what women can do for the economy rather than on how the economy must work in a way that supports rights for all.
As governments continue their discussions, they must reach a consensus on financing methods that can really make a difference for gender equality and womens rights for years to come. The vision for change is clear  now the money must follow.

The article warzone rape seen as costly failure , published on the Global development site earlier this month, raises, perhaps unintentionally, some of the crucial issues that need to be discussed as part of a strategy to combat gender-based and sexual violence in armed conflict.
What needs to be prioritised? How do we determine budget allocation? What are the appropriate responses and how should we measure results? These are big questions. The overriding issue, though, is why does sexual violence happen and what can be done to address it?
The Prevention of Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) set some very clear objectives, with ending the impunity of perpetrators the foremost. This, however, was merely a starting point.
Related: Revealed: how the world turned its back on rape victims of Congo
The reality is that if men think of women as property  if violence at home, or committed by family members, is considered a private matter; if society continues to judge the conduct and dress of women in sexual violence cases; if the state fails to insist upon political, social, economic and cultural equality for women in all fields, and fails to engage with men in resolving the issue  then sexual violence will continue.
The former British foreign secretary William Hague publicly asserts that the leading issue of these times is the empowerment of women. He speaks of the need to address the root causes of sexual violence and see sexual violence in conflict as a matter of international peace and security. And he is right. Rape destroys communities and the consequences are international, as peace remains unobtainable. PSVI is a component of a global agenda on women, peace and security that recognises the critical importance of womens and girls empowerment and gender equality.

It is wrong to look at short-term indicators. Results will take many, many years. Rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will not end before the conflict does, and even then it will continue unless attitudes towards women also change.
Legal frameworks have to be reformed and applied, mindsets transformed, social and economic systems put in place. These things can only be achieved by national governments. Hence the need to bring them on board and keep them committed.
Budget is also important. Funding has been provided, and must be spent wisely. Though 5m was spent on the summit hosted by Hague and Angelina Jolie, the investment  tiny in relative terms  got more than 100 states on board. This should be compared with the more than 250m pumped into the Nato conference in Wales in the autumn of 2014 to discuss military deployments.
Stopping sexual violence is an obligation under international law, but still it happens. Governments have made commitments by ratifying human rights treaties and the statute of the international criminal court but, as we know only too well, they commit only to walk away, with South Africas decision to let the Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir leave the most recent, shameful example . It does not mean that we should stop bringing them together to remind them of what they have to do. It gives civil society more advocacy possibilities and with the protocol, launched at the summit, a practical tool to work with .
There was a lesson from the summit for the present UK government too. There can be no serious engagement on sexual violence without respect for, and delivery of, human rights, including economic and social rights and equality. State legal systems must incorporate these fundamental obligations and they must be complied with.
PSVI has the potential to make a serious difference; it has started to do so and now needs to be strengthened. The UK must be robust in demanding accountability for sexual violence by peacekeepers and insist on the participation of women in all peace processes. Britain must also ratify the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women , to which it committed three years ago.
The principles Hague enunciated are above politics and are not negotiable. There is a manifesto commitment to continue with the work he started. Those of us who work in civil society want this initiative to succeed and will give it the support it merits. We also understand that there is no quick fix and that we all need to be in this for the long haul.

Sierra Leone poised to lift bar on pregnant girls being educated
UN and donors optimistic that talks with Sierra Leonean government over ban introduced in 2010 are about to yield major breakthrough

The decision to continue the school ban on pregnant girls in Sierra Leone could soon be reversed as the government inches towards an agreement with international agencies.
It had been expected that the government would lift the ban, imposed in 2010, when schools reopened following the end of the Ebola crisis but the education minister, Minkailu Bah, reaffirmed it .
Now, after weeks of talks with the government, senior UN officials and UK and Irish aid representatives say they are on the verge of a significant breakthrough.
It is estimated that a third of children in Sierra Leone are born to school-age children and there is anecdotal evidence that the incidence of teenage pregnancy rose sharply during the Ebola outbreak.
In a survey of 1,100 girls and boys between the ages of seven and 18, 10% reported that girls, especially those who had lost relatives to Ebola, were having to engage in transactional sex to cover their basic needs.
There were also reports of children being assaulted in quarantined areas.
This report confirms that Ebola has put an incredible strain on childrens lives and it will take time for them to recover. The impact on them has been huge, said Casely Coleman, country director of Plan International in Sierra Leone.
Aid agencies including the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Irish Aid and the Department for International Development are working with the Sierra Leonean government to find a temporary solution that would involve girls being educated outside the classroom.
They are insisting the girls should continue to receive formal education and not be downgraded to vocational studies.
Government and development partners want a way for these girls to stay in the formal education system and we are hopeful that we can find a solution. There is a flexibility and openness to find a solution, said Sinead Walsh, the Irish ambassador to Sierra Leone.
Walsh, who is responsible for discharging Irish Aid, which had a strong presence in the country before Ebola hit,
continued: This not a new problem for Sierra Leone and we have been working to find a solution before Ebola. Weve looked at a lot of African countries where teenage pregnancy rates are high and there isnt really a magic solution.
So this could be an opportunity for Sierra Leone to play a leadership role in the region and find something that works.
Aid agencies say off-site education is not a sustainable solution in concept, but would be a watershed for a country where the incidence of teenage pregnancy is so high.
A senior UN official in New York described the bar on pregnant girls going to school  a policy in many African countries  as irrational and a breach of human rights.
Kate Gilmore, deputy executive director of the UNFPA, said the ban would perpetuate the cycle of poverty and hold the country back economically.
Ebola may be going, but its presence and consequences for the country are enduring. This is a sign of how much the situation has deteriorated, she said.
Gilmore said the government should be concentrating on educating pregnant girls and ensuring they delivered healthy babies rather than stigmatising them.
We have a fantastic relationship with Sierra Leone over many many years before Ebola. Sierra Leone was doing an extraordinary amount to achieve a turnaround in sexual reproductive health and reduce infant mortality, particularly as a post-conflict country, so the tragedy of Ebola is intense on so many fronts, with the reversal of such hard-won gains alongside the loss of life, she said.
Sierra Leone is already one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth, with maternal mortality and child mortality rates among the highest in the world.
These are the most vulnerable, they are at risk of child marriage and maternal mortality, said one aid worker, who asked not to be named because of local sensitivity on the subject.
Gilmore said she can understand that antipathy towards teenage pregnancy in many countries, but said traditional belief systems were not a reason to hold on to a toxic norm.
She said it was possible to change social conventions: We have done it with smoking, seat belts, FGM, there is no reason why we cant do it with teenage pregnancy, Gilmore said.
You can understand that irrationality might dominate in the early phase but pregnancy is a health issue, not a bar to education. This is eroding their capacity, as future parents, to be literate, to be numerate, to be part of economic society, she said.
This is about the demographic dividend. There is an economic boom to be reaped here  that is there for the taking for Sierra Leone.

        <title>Uganda: NGO bill aims to muzzle civil society, say activists</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/24/uganda-ngo-bill-aims-muzzle-civil-society-say-activists</Link>

Ugandan civil society groups are warning that a bill to regulate non-governmental organisations is a blow to basic freedoms and threatens to curtail the activities of some groups, reducing essential services to some of the countrys poorest people.
The NGO bill , which was published in the east African countrys official gazette in April, must be debated in parliament before it can be passed into law. That debate is expected to take place in the coming months, but NGOs are urging MPs not to send the bill to President Yoweri Museveni to be signed.
Nicholas Opio, a human rights lawyer and the executive director of Chapter Four Uganda , said the legislation would extinguish the very character of non-governmental organisations and make them puppets of the state. It unjustifiably restricts the space for civic engagement, civic association [and] civic participation in governance and in service delivery.
The new law will replace previous legislation  described by rights groups as stringent. According to its preamble, the aim is to provide a conducive and enabling environment for civil society organisations.
The internal affairs minister, Aronda Nyakairima, wrote in an introduction to the bill that while NGOs provide key services such as health, education and water, the rapid growth of non-governmental organisations has led to subversive methods of work and activities, which in turn undermine accountability and transparency in the sector.
Opio estimates there are around 11,000 registered NGOs in Uganda  there are no comprehensive official figures  and activists admit there is some lack of clarity about what they do and who runs them. But they say this opacity is due to the dysfunctional nature of the official NGO board, which is meant to regulate the sector. The board will be given new powers under the proposed law.
Opio said Ugandas efforts to tighten state control over NGOs mirrored similar actions by other governments across the region, citing notably a 2009 law on charity funding in Ethiopia, which included a provision stating that any organisation receiving more than 10% of its funding from abroad was a foreign NGO, and thus banned from any activities concerning democratic and human rights, conflict resolution or criminal justice.
It began in Ethiopia in 2009 with an extremely repressive NGO law and it appears many of the countries in the east and Horn of Africa are learning from Ethiopia, Opio said.

Last year, Kenya shut down around 500 NGOs for non-compliance with the law, accusing some of using their charitable status as a front for raising cash for terrorism. In May, South Sudans parliament passed a law that would force aid agencies to ensure that no more than a fifth of their staff are foreigners. The bill is still awaiting the presidents signature.
Under Ugandas proposed legislation, the NGO board will register NGOs or community-based organisations and issue permits. NGOs will have to declare their sources of income and obtain permits from local authorities to operate. Groups that seek to operate without a permit could face fines, prosecution and criminal penalties of between four and eight years in prison for directors.
The NGO Board will be able to revoke permits if NGOs contravene their constitutions or the bill, or if in the opinion of the board it is in the public interest to do so. The NGOs must also not engage in any act which is prejudicial to the security and laws of Uganda.
The vague nature of these latter articles, in particular, have raised concerns. Livingstone Sewanyana, director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative Uganda , said the bill aims to create fear among activists. The fight against corruption, human rights abuses and maladministration will be seriously jeopardised, he says. It seeks to disable citizens who would have a say in how they are governed  and the outcome is dictatorship.
As well as providing basic services to many communities, NGOs have worked to preserve the land rights of Ugandans living near oil finds and spoken out against government excesses and rampant corruption.
Related: Ugandan farmers take on palm oil giants over land grab claims
Maria Burnett, a senior researcher in the Africa division for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says government control over civil society risks negating the very essence of freedom of association. We have documented threats to the operating space for civil society over many years in Uganda, [especially] groups working on oil transparency, human rights, land, governance, corruption and other sensitive issues, particularly when they publicly advocate for change, Burnett says.
Oil has been discovered around Ugandas Lake Albert but production is not expected to start before 2018.
Lawyer Isaac Semakadde, who works in a legal aid centre, says the bill, if it comes into law, will drive NGOs away. It will make it impossible to establish and operate an NGO; as a result, practitioners will be selectively allowed to stay [in the sector], and those organisations that advocate against the government side will certainly be told to give way, he said.
Under the bill, NGOs are also banned from fundraising or campaigning for any political party or candidate. Ugandans will vote for a new president next year, and Museveni, who has held the job for nearly three decades, is widely expected to run again for his National Resistance Movement party.
The 70-year-old leader has been criticized by some donors for hanging on to power, but there are no term limits in Uganda.
Cissy Kagaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition of Uganda , said NGOs would start to self-censor to avoid losing their permits. The bill wouldnt be bad if it intended to kick out quack [NGOs], but when you target whoever opposes the official position, then that does not work, she said.
Ofwono Opondo, a government spokesman, argued that the NGO bill was necessary to force the sector to be transparent and accountable. There is even duplication of activities; NGOs claim they are providing water and when you go there you dont find anything. We want them to specify their area of jurisdiction and what they want to do exactly, he said.
He linked opposition to the bill to anti-gay activists in a country with a growing anti-liberal movement, tough laws against homosexuals and a rise in religious conservatism.
Opio said the NGO sector was not against regulation, per se. What we are rejecting is control because we are non-governmental, he said.

Governments are failing to meet their international obligations to protect women from violence by starving womens groups of funding and closing the space in which they can operate, according to a report by ActionAid.
Laws and national action plans introduced to end violence against women and girls are routinely ignored, while efforts by local civil society groups to push for change are being thwarted by threats and intimidation, the NGO said on Tuesday.
A survey of 47 womens rights activists from more than 20 countries, conducted by ActionAid and Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition , found that more than 60% of women said they felt less safe in their work than they did two years ago. Of this group, 19% said they felt significantly less safe. Activists working on abortion, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights reported feeling particularly under threat.
Armed militias, governments, the police and religious groups were identified as the main instigators of threatening behaviour, which includes verbal abuse, sexual remarks, sexual harassment and assault.
ActionAid said rather than protecting womens rights, and meeting the UN resolution adopted in 2013 to protect activists , many governments are directly perpetrating violence against women, while failing to address cultures of impunity. And rather than supporting women in their struggle, many states are closing down the civil society space which all civil society, including womens organisations, need in order to be effective.

More and more women are facing the fear of violence and its consequences for them and their families, said Lucia Fry, head of policy at ActionAid. The work of fearless women standing up against violence is being eroded by increasing intolerance of dissent and the rising influence of fundamentalist agendas that are anti-womens rights.
As our survey shows, women activists from countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and the US have all seen threats of violence increase, making them insecure and hampering their efforts to improve womens lives and end violence in society.
The survey marked the launch of ActionAids Fearless campaign , which is calling on the UK to take a lead in working with the international community to fulfil its obligations to end violence against women and girls with practical action and adequate funding. Rights activists are hoping this year will be a catalyst for long-term change for women with the adoption in September of the sustainable development goals. A target to eliminate all forms of violence is expected to be included in the goals, which come into force for all countries next year.
Speaking at the Fearless launch, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the proposed SDGs were immensely powerful and had the substance on achieving gender equality that was lacking in the millennium development goals. She added that the issues raised in the campaign were so important.
This is a battle that if were not winning it, were losing it. There are many people in many parts of the world who think women have too many rights, that its gone too far and should go back to where it used to be, she said. I have a voice and have a responsibility to use it to speak for those who dont to make sure we are winning that battle.
Figures published by the World Health Organisation in 2013 estimated that almost 30% of women experience physical or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner, despite more countries passing anti-violence laws. According to the World Bank, 76 out of 100 countries surveyed have laws to tackle domestic violence, compared with 13 in 1995.

An ActionAid report published with the survey outlined numerous cases of women being attacked in the course of their activism. These include Atena Farghadani, 28, an artist who was placed in solitary confinement in Iran for posting a cartoon on Facebook criticising a government bill to limit family planning services, and Gladys Lanza , who was convicted of defamation in Honduras when she spoke in defence of a woman who had accused a government official of sexual harassment.
Samira Hamidi , former director of the Afghan Womens Network, said she had been repeatedly threatened by opposition groups in the course of her work. There are no prevention and protection mechanisms by my government where any women  but particularly women human rights defenders  can be supported.
ActionAid is calling on governments to adequately fund local womens rights groups, which it said are critical to ending gender-based violence.
A survey conducted in 70 countries over four decades found that the mobilisation of womens rights organisations was the most important factor in turning commitments to end violence into meaningful action  having more impact than the number of women in parliament, or the wealth of a country.
But, between 2012 and 2013, of the $28bn earmarked for gender equality globally, the overall funding for womens organisations was less than $400m, said ActionAid.
A global survey of 740 womens organisations conducted by the Association for Womens Rights in Development (Awid) in 2010 found the average annual income of these groups was just $20,000 (12,000). Organisations in sub-Saharan Africa often receive just $12,000 a year.

Doris Owusu Prempeh, a member of a community-based anti-violence team (Combat) in southern Ghana supported by ActionAid, said she had seen a reduction in gender-based violence locally in the five years since her team had been working.
The team, comprised of three women and four men, educate people about what constitutes domestic violence and why its wrong, and support those who have been attacked, with counselling and reporting the crime to the police. When we started, we had so many cases [of violence] but now it has reduced to one a month. When we started, we got more than six or seven a month because there was no education about domestic violence, she said.
But there is only so much the group is able to do. Police are sometimes reluctant to pursue an arrest unless they are paid by the victim or the family. We dont have money and our work is voluntary so that makes it very difficult for us to report cases, she said.

Economic inequality will make it harder for countries to weather crises such as natural disasters and social unrest in the future, a study has shown.
The 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) measured the ability of governments, businesses and civil societies in 127 countries to handle economic change and take advantage of investment opportunities.
It evaluated each countrys quality of governance by looking at macroeconomic frameworks, business environments and the rule of law. Researchers also considered the freedom and influence of civil society groups.
Economic inequality was seen as the greatest threat for many nations, leaving them vulnerable to financial shocks, according to the CRI, which was released on Tuesday by KPMG and Oxford Economics thinktank.
A recent study by Oxfam on extreme wealth inequality said 85 of the worlds richest people had the same wealth as half of the worlds population.
Worsening inequality can lead to or exacerbate conflicts and reduce social cohesion
Change Readiness Index
Uneven economic growth does not reduce poverty as quickly as growth that is spread across societies, the CRI said. It also warned that worsening inequality can lead to or exacerbate conflicts and reduce social cohesion.
The 2015 index said Namibia, Haiti and Guatemala had the least inclusive economic growth.
Some low-income countries ranked higher than expected in the CRI. Trevor Davies, executive director of KPMGs International Development Assistance Services (Idas), said this was because of economic diversification, a strong rule of law, and educational opportunities.
Weve found that the countries that do well are the ones that actually focus not just on the economic side, but also on bringing about good governance and improving the lot of their people  so making sure that the economic benefit flows through inclusively to their population, said Davies.
Mozambique, which came 80th in the index, performed better than any other low-income country, based on projections of gross national income. Uganda, Cambodia and Tanzania also ranked high in the index.
Timothy Stiles, chairman of Idas, said: Many countries compensate for lesser wealth with robust governance, a strong social foundation, and a positive business environment.
Algeria registered the biggest gain in this years rankings, because of impressive improvements in its enterprise and government capability, the report said.
The Philippines strong political institutions demonstrated the importance of good governance in recovering from natural disasters, according to Davies. Much of the country was devastated by typhoon Haiyan in 2013, but the Philippines effective policies and institutions have enabled it to persevere, and it is projected to be one of the worlds fastest growing economies in 2015.
The index showed that the volume of national income is the most significant factor in determining change readiness, with the top 22 spots in the index going to high-income countries. Small countries with high gross national income are the best positioned to handle economic shocks and take advantage of investment, the report said.
Singapore came top, followed by Switzerland, Hong Kong, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Qatar, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
The report combined data from 22 primary survey questions that were gathered from 1,270 country experts around the world. Data sources included the World Economic Forum, World Bank, Legatum Institute, International Monetary Fund and United Nations.

Kenyan president's call to arms on self-sufficiency carries health risks

During the 25th African Union summit from 7-15 June, Kenyas president Uhuru Kenyatta took to Twitter to urge his fellow leaders to move away from reliance on development aid from donor countries.
In his tweet at the conference in South Africa , Kenyatta said that sometimes aid only appears to be charitable and so often carries terms and conditions that preclude progress.
Kenyatta has been a vocal opponent of perceived Western influence and power in Africa  notably since he was charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . The charges, which related to post-election violence in 2007-2008 and were denied by Kenyatta, were dropped in December 2014 after key witnesses withdrew.
But despite Kenyattas bold call for increased African self-sufficiency, could Kenya do without aid in the near future?
Advocacy group Results has researched health financing in Kenya with the Kenya Aids NGO Consortium (Kanco). The study, Who Pays for Progress?, looks at the balance between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Domestic Resource Mobilisation (DRM) such as tax, and will be launched in July. The data so far suggests it would be a major challenge to move away from aid in the health sector, and also difficult in other areas, such as education.

Of the overall health budget, 45% is currently provided by donors and 55% by the Kenyan state. In some programmes, the dependency on ODA is even greater. In a series of interviews in March 2015, we learned that the HIV and Aids programmes are funded 70% by donors, and work on nutrition is around 80% funded from ODA.
Even these figures do not tell the whole story  for tuberculosis programmes, 23% of funding comes from domestic sources, and 17% from ODA, but 60% of the need is completely unfunded. At present the country needs to increase funding for healthcare if it is to fulfil the ambition stated in the 2010 constitution to achieve universal health coverage.
In the long run, all Kenyans would be happy to see a time when the country does not need aid, said Allan Ragi, director of Kanco. But at present, if ODA falls then we will be unable to deliver essential healthcare to the most needy.
In the medium term, there is more cause for optimism. Economists in Kenya see ample scope to increase domestic resources, for example by improving the efficiency of the tax system.
The Kenya Revenue Authority has identified a significant number of high-net-worth individuals who could increase their tax payments, and the same is true of some multinational companies. Kenya had around 8,700 dollar millionaires in 2014 and in Nairobi alone, there are at least 65 high-net-worth individuals with wealth exceeding $30m.
As well as improving tax revenue, the country could reduce illicit financial flows out of Kenya. According to authoritative research Kenya lost $4.9bn in capital flight in 2010 alone: this is approximately $120 per person. This ties in with global analysis that shows that while high-income countries collect an average of 34% of their GDP in taxes, low-income countries in Africa only collect 17%, or even less.
Related: Without leadership over development finance, talks in July cannot succeed
The government of Kenya has identified ways to close some tax loopholes and thus make more funds available for health and other development programmes. Capital gains tax of 5% was reintroduced on 1 January this year after an absence of 30 years. The National Aids Control Council has said it can increase the domestic funding of the HIV programme from 30% to 85%, but not until 2024.
If Kenya can raise more domestic finance through taxation, and devote a greater share of the national budget to health, then the current funding gap for essential health programmes can be filled. Chatham House health economists estimate that around $86 per person per year is needed to deliver adequate health coverage in developing countries.
President Kenyattas call to arms to fellow African presidents came just a month before the Financing for Development conference in Ethiopia on 13-16 July, where the world community will debate how to pay for development priorities over the next 15 years.
Kenyattas call for self-sufficiency will surely find a great deal of support in Addis Ababa, but health economists will be urging caution, and will want assurances that domestic finance for health is in place before ODA dries up.

        <title>68 million children likely to die by 2030 from preventable causes, report says</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/unicef-68-million-children-under-five-die-2030-preventable-causes-report</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
Almost 70 million children under five will die by 2030 from mainly preventable causes unless the world is bolder and more strategic about helping the poorest and most vulnerable young people on the planet, Unicef has warned in a blunt final report on the millennium development goals (MDGs) .
The UN childrens agency says that while the MDGs have yielded significant achievements in reducing child and maternal mortality and improving access to drinking water, they have failed millions of disadvantaged children and even increased levels of inequality within some countries.
Unicef attributes the failures to a lack of ambition and planning, but also points to the way in which data was collected and used  and the fact that the MDGs inadvertently encouraged countries to measure their progress through national averages.
In the rush to make that progress, many focused on the easiest-to-reach children and communities, not those in greatest need, says the report, Progress for Children: Beyond Averages .
Related: If we want to end poverty, we need to be able to measure it properly
In doing so, national progress may actually have been slowed. This is because we were not strategic enough. Though it was once assumed that reaching the hardest-to-reach was unrealistic, we now know that investing in the most disadvantaged children can actually be more cost-effective.
The agency says that the sustainable development goals  which will replace the MDGs later this year and set the development agenda until 2030  must take into account lessons learned from their predecessors if lives are to be saved and futures altered.
Without concerted action to reach the most vulnerable children, Unicef estimates that by 2030, 68 million more children under five will die from mainly preventable causes; 119 million children will still be chronically malnourished, and half a billion people will still be defecating in the open .
In sub-Saharan Africa , the risk of a child dying before her or his fifth birthday in the region is almost 15 times higher than the risk facing a child born in a high-income country, while Unicef estimates that, at the current rate, it will take 96 years for all girls from the regions poorest families to complete their lower secondary education.

The report also notes that neonatal deaths currently represent a larger share of the total under-five deaths than they did in 1990: by the end of 2015, about 1 million children  16% of all under-five deaths  will die on the same day they were born. Eleven children are predicted to die every minute in 2015.
The differences within countries are equally stark: children from the poorest households are twice as likely to die before turning five  and far less likely to achieve minimum reading standards  as children from the richest households.
Although Unicefs executive director, Anthony Lake, insisted the MDGs as a whole had absolutely not failed the worlds children, he said the report had to serve as a wake-up call.
If the global community allows the current trends to continue, we will fail millions of children, he said.
This shows the huge stakes in achieving the goals of the SDGs and we believe that to achieve the most results, most efficiently, we have to focus ever more on the most disadvantaged children.
Lake said targeting the poorest children was the best way to reduce cycles of intergenerational poverty and improve the lives of families, communities and societies.
They are where the needs are greatest and our modelling over the years has shown that its the most cost-effective way to achieve results, because the results you achieve in the most disadvantaged areas almost always outweigh the additional costs of reaching those areas, he said.
Despite its bleak assessment of some MDG progress, the report highlighted a series of successes in the fight against poverty, disease and mortality levels since 1990.
It pointed out that under-five mortality dropped by 53%; that chronic malnutrition among children under five decreased by 41%; that maternal mortality decreased by 45%, and that 2.6 billion people gained access to improved drinking water sources .

Hugh Muir presents this edition of the Global development podcast, ahead of the UN's third international conference on Financing for Development. Having set in motion a bold agenda for a better world with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will drive development priorities over the next 15 years, member states now have to work out how to finance them.
The talks will cover everything from aid and taxes to the role of the private sector and trade  and success is crucial if the SDGs are to be achieved by 2030.
Clr N Chonghaile went along to a panel discussion, Financing the Future, at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), and asked participants what they hoped the Addis meeting would deliver. Research officers at the ODI Gideon Rabinowitz and Andrew Rogerson emphasise the importance of developed countries delivering on the 0.7% target of national income as ODA. We also hear from Rupert Simons, chief executive of Publish What You Fund, on his hopes for the Addis talks.
Joining Hugh to discuss the development financing agenda are Tim Jones, policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, and Paddy Carter, one of the lead authors of the ODI's report on how international public finance should fund a global social compact to eradicate poverty. We also hear from Jean Letitia Saldanha, senior policy advisor from CIDSE, the International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity.
Plus, Kary Stewart takes a tour of London's tax-dodging hotspots to find out just where the country's top corporate tax avoiders call home.

Corruption stymies Niger's attempts to stem flow of migrants to Europe
Despite a government crackdown on people-smuggling, police corruption means the migrant convoys continue on the perilous journey across the Sahara

In the desert town of Agadez in central Niger , almost anyone can point out the smugglers compounds where African migrants lie low before heading for Europe. Almost anyone, except the police.
At a checkpoint on the outskirts of town, police officers turn a blind eye as dozens of smugglers trucks packed with migrants drive past at nightfall. This happens every Monday as convoys start the three-day trek across the desert to Libya.
We cannot stop the migrant trucks. They do not pass by here, says one of the policemen, gesturing vaguely into the blackness. They go around us, far off in the desert.
After two migrant trucks pass, a turbaned fixer hired by a smuggler to pay off the police gets back on his scooter and drives away, his work done.
A confidential government report into illegal migration in Agadez concluded that corruption was so entrenched here that to tackle migrant smuggling would require replacing almost all military and police officials.

A record 100,000 migrants are expected to cross Niger this year into Libya, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), taking advantage of the chaos that has given smugglers an open door to Europe.
The EU believes just over half the migrants arriving in Italy travel first through Niger. More than 1,800 migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean this year alone and Europe is looking to Niger for action.
Last month, President Mahamadou Issoufous government passed a tough anti-migrant smuggling law that establishes prison terms of up to 30 years for smugglers. It said this was to protect vulnerable young Africans.
Not only are many migrants exploited by smugglers, falling victim to forced labour or prostitution, but others die in the desert when they are abandoned there, or when vehicles break down.
Officials in Niger, ranked as the worlds poorest country by the UN, know that implementing the new law means cracking down on endemic graft in a country where a young policeman earns less than $190 a month.
For a truck of illegal migrants to cross Niger and reach Libya, many officials must turn a blind eye, said Goge Maimouna Gazibo, head of Nigers National Agency for the Fight Against People Smuggling (ANLTP).
From now on, any official who allows a bus to cross a border will be considered guilty of smuggling and corruption, Gazibo added.
Niger has tried before to curb migration. After 92 migrants were found dead in the desert in 2013, the government launched raids on several smugglers compounds, known as ghettos, and replaced a handful of police officers.
Migrants and smugglers say they are obliged to bribe police, in a racket worth millions of dollars a year
Two years on, little has changed. Flows from countries like Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria, Mali and Ghana are higher than ever. Migrants and smugglers say they are obliged to bribe police, in a racket worth millions of dollars a year.
On the road north from Nigers capital Niamey, police systematically took migrants aside at checkpoints to demand payment. Although citizens of west African countries have the right to travel in Niger, many migrants say they prefer not to show their identity papers for fear they will be confiscated by corrupt police.
If they stop you, you have to pay, said Lamine Bandaogo, a lean 17-year-old fleeing Burkina Faso, as he stood in a bus depot on the route to Agadez. Bribes range between $2 and $20. If you have nothing, you must beg forgiveness.
Since winning power in 2011, Issoufou has made some progress in the fight against corruption. Niger has risen to 103rd in Transparency Internationals 2014 survey of graft perceptions , from 134th (of 175) the year he took office.

Yet some people question whether security forces are ready to forego lucrative revenues from migration. A confidential 2013 national police report concluded that Agadez, which acts as a gateway to the north, was an El Dorado for security forces. It found there were more than 70 smugglers ghettos active in the town, each one protected by a paid police agent.
A separate report by the Halcia anti-corruption agency said that payments to security forces and local authorities totalled $450 per vehicle and $30 per foreign migrant on the route between Agadez and the Libyan border.
The Halcia mission also found that bribes paid by migrants were essential to keep the security forces functioning as money earmarked in the military budget to buy diesel for vehicles, spare parts and food simply disappeared in Niamey.
The security forces recognise that they take money but they have no choice. That is money they use to do their jobs, said Ousmane Baydo, deputy head of Halcia.
In an effort to bypass corrupt security forces, the new law places the legal responsibility on transport companies to ensure travellers have valid documents.
Any transport company that doesnt check documents, well prosecute them for complicity, Gazibo said, adding this should help to reduce migrant numbers by next year.

Once we have confiscated two or three buses, the transport companies will start to cooperate, he said.
The justice minister, Amadou Marou, said Niger cannot tackle the problem alone and has appealed to neighbouring countries to adopt similar laws punishing those who profit from illegal migration and to agree terms for the repatriation of migrants.
Niger officials are concerned that any unilateral expulsion of west African citizens could sour relations with neighbours.
Niger plans to create welcome centres in Agadez to try to prevent migrants from falling into the hands of smugglers, to inform them of the risks of the perilous journey, and to return those wanting to go back to their own countries.
This is not a law to protect Europe, Marou said. We have done this to save lives because African governments also have a responsibility.
But with some west African states reliant on remittances from migrants, questions remain over how determined they are to combat illegal migration.
Marou said Europe needed to make legal immigration easier. If it is possible for European citizens to come to Africa , it should be just as easy for Africans to go to there.

Niger is the largest per capita recipient of European aid , with some 600m ($680m) earmarked between now and 2020. EU ambassador Raul Mateus Paula said that would be boosted by at least 30m this year.
An EU police training mission will open an office in Agadez and focus its activities on migrant smuggling. The EU will also contribute to the centres to inform and repatriate migrants.
Yet Niger and its European partners recognise that, if they are to stem the flows, migrants and smugglers alike need economic alternatives.
The 2013 national police report warned that Agadez lived off smuggling and any attempts to end it could lead to riots. With tourism devastated by Islamic militancy in the Sahara, many in the town say they have no other source of income.
A smuggler can make 3m CFA francs ($5,212) with just one 4x4 packed with 30 migrants  a fortune in a country where most people live on less than $2 a day. Dozens of ghettos lie behind red mud walls on Agadezs dirty backstreets, with metal gates offering glimpses of groups of young men inside.

They cannot stop migration completely. If there was no immigration, Agadez would grind to a halt, said Bashir, who owns a migrant ghetto. He says he is getting out of the business because of the new law and wants himself to emigrate.
If Europe would give us money, then we would stay here, he said.
Giuseppe Loprete, local head of the IOM, said migrants who have sold everything to pay for their trip are ready to die rather than return empty-handed to even worse poverty. Would-be migrants should be told more about the risks so they do not leave in the first place, he said.
The IOM is training members of western African communities in Niamey to explain the dangers. Djibril Sow  a Senegalese expatriate who has lived in Niamey for years  says he will seek out his fellow citizens in bus stations.
Loprete said: If they know that there is a 90% chance of dying, or getting held up, or coming back with nothing, then I think people will change their minds.

In three months, the UN looks set to adopt 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) that will guide the international communitys efforts to tackle global poverty, inequality and climate change over the next 15 years.
After years of negotiations among policymakers, NGOs and academics , a zero draft of the SDGs is now under discussion. But how will we know if we advance towards achieving these targets? What should be the indicators of progress?
The draft goals call for an end to poverty in all its forms everywhere and set the target of reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. But how do countries measure the multidimensional nature of poverty and track progress towards reducing it?
Multidimensional poverty measurement has been rapidly evolving over the past five years, both at the national and international level. Since 2010, the UN Development Programme s human development report office has published a Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), developed with and calculated by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford .
Related: Number of people in extreme poverty could be greatly underestimated, report says
The index complements traditional measures of monetary poverty and captures the multiple, overlapping disadvantages poor people can face  such as poor sanitation, malnutrition, poor quality of housing and lack of education.
According to the latest updates of the Global MPI , released by OPHI on 22 June and covering 101 developing countries, 1.6 billion people are living in multidimensional poverty around the world.
Of this number, most MPI poor people  69.6%  live in middle-income countries. In addition, looking at the 67 countries for which there is comparable data on both MPI and monetary poverty, 29% or 1.4 billion people are MPI poor, while 1.07 billion or 22% live on less than $1.25 a day.
In certain countries, including Mexico, Pakistan and Egypt, the number of those living in multidimensional poverty is twice the number who are living on less than $1.25 a day, and is more than 1 million people. This emphasises how the MPI complements monetary poverty measures, as both together better capture the true reality of poverty.
This month more than 100 policymakers and senior officials came together in Cartagena, Colombia, for the third annual meeting of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), a group of more than 40 governments and institutions that promotes the use of national multidimensional poverty measures.
In a communique released after the meeting, which was hosted by President Juan Manuel Santos and the government of Colombia, theparticipants called for an improved Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI 2015+) to be included in the SDGs.
Related: First draft of sustainable development goals exposes gaps, warn NGOs
This index would reflect progress towards tackling different dimensions of poverty, and could also be broken down to show exactly what poverty is like in different areas of a country, or among different groups of the population. Such information would help ensure that no one is left behind by the post-2015 development agenda.
The network supports governments designing national MPIs using indicators of poverty that are relevant to their specific country contexts. The governments of Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Bhutan, as well as the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, have already adopted official multidimensional poverty measures. And a rapidly increasing number of countries, including Pakistan, Philippines, Malaysia, Tunisia and Vietnam, are developing their own MPIs.
What is electric is how these measures galvanise action. By pinpointing exactly how and where people are poor, national MPIs enable governments to better target their resources and combat poverty more effectively through integrated and well-coordinated policy interventions.
The MPPN hopes that the global and national MPIs will receive support at the UNs conference on financing for development in Addis Ababa next month. It also hopes the MPIs will be recommended as indicators by the expert group that recently concluded its first meeting on the indicator framework in New York.
How we understand poverty is changing  its multidimensional nature is now widely acknowledged. But recognising this fact in the SDGs is, in itself, not enough. We must commit to measuring multidimensional poverty to ensure that the many overlapping disadvantages faced by the poor can be energetically and successfully tackled.

In the mountains above the Peruvian capital Lima, the worlds second largest desert city, scientists are working with farmers to restore ancient canals, believed to predate the Inca empire, in an effort to tackle the citys increasing water shortage.
The system  known locally as mamanteo, a term derived from the Spanish word for suckling, or amunas  could help the city of nearly 10 million inhabitants to ride the seasonal extremes of floods and droughts.
It works by funnelling water from highland streams into the mountain itself, where it percolates through cracks and natural aquifers over months to emerge in springs and natural reservoirs.
Its all about building in delays in the hydrological runoff of these catchments because if the water continues through this stream it will reach the village downstream in a question of hours. Letting it seep through the mountain, we expect to build in delays of weeks and hopefully months, says Bert De Bivre, an expert on Andean water basins working with the Consortium for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Ecorregion , an NGO.
The delay means that the abundant wet-season moisture in these highlands at more than 3,500 metres above sea level can be gradually distributed during the dry season, which can last more than half the year.
Floods and landslides killed nine people, left thousands homeless and caused major infrastructure damage on the outskirts of Lima in March. Meanwhile, unusually warm autumn temperatures brought drought in other parts of the city, where at least 700,000 live without running, potable water, according to Sedapal , the citys water board.
A third of Peruvians live in Lima and up to 150,000 migrants continue to swell its infrastructure-starved peripheries every year. Authorities are struggling to supply the growing population, dependent on three rivers that flow from the Andes: the Rmac, Chilln and Lurn.
Regrouting and maintaining the pre-Inca drainage canals provides a cheap alternative to building modern hydric infrastructure, according to De Bivre. Experts believe they may have been built by the Wari culture as long ago as 700AD, yet De Bivre says it is clear they were developed over centuries by different cultures  and we are just one more of them.
State funding for the project began in March. Perus national water regulator Sunass multiplied the proposed budget, diverting 1% of consumer tariffs from Sedapal over the next five years  more than 70m Peruvian soles, or about $22m (14m)  to green infrastructure. This will include restoring amunas and recuperating highland wetlands. A further 3.8% of tariffs, approximately $89m, will be used for climate change adaptation and disaster risk mitigation.
The investment in green infrastructure would mean an increase in Limas water volume by at least one cubic metre a second, which makes it very affordable in contrast to building a canal, said Fernando Momiy, the president of Sunass.
Lima is a desert city which keeps growing and in five years there will be another 700,000 inhabitants who will need water. Thats why we need to look at combining grey infrastructure with green infrastructure, said Momiy.
Its the first time that a regulatory body has promoted this kind of infrastructure in Lima. We see that theres a lot of focus on grey infrastructure when we should be looking at green infrastructure, so as not to have to invest so much in expensive grey infrastructure.
Pointing to water crises in California, the UK and Sao Paulo in Brazil, Momiy said: Theres no reason to think that couldnt happen to us.
With a commanding view of the distant smog above Lima, the small district of Huamantanga feels far removed from the city that houses a third of Peruvians.
Here we count on the expertise of the local people who know all the water sources and springs, says De Bivre.

With nearly four million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, a heavy toll has been placed on local populations. Basic infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water supplies, has been placed under enormous strain.
But despite the pressures, many local communities have stepped in to help new arrivals. Refugees have also banded together to support each other. To mark World Refugee Day, the European commissions humanitarian aid and civil protection department (Echo) has partnered with the Danish Refugee Council to pay tribute to the everyday heroes supporting Syrian refugees.
There is a lot of media coverage highlighting the negative impact of the crisis on the refugee-hosting countries, but there are also many positive stories that never get reported, says David Verboom, Echos regional head of office in Amman, Jordan. This is an attempt to redress the balance a little, to shine some light on the generosity and friendship shown towards the refugees, and vice versa, that often goes unnoticed.
Syrian refugee Ahmad Khalif supports other refugees who arrive at Darashakran refugee camp, Iraq

Khalif fled Syria in August 2013 with his wife and six children, taking nothing but the clothes they were wearing. The quietly spoken 42-year-old now lives in Darashakran refugee camp, where he has become a father figure, helping more than 300 families access clothes, food and medicine.
They come here with nothing. [Just] the clothes on their back. Many have not eaten for days and they are scared. The children cry a lot, Khalif says. You become aware of those that are really struggling, so I make calls and talk to people and we share what we have. We dont make a fuss. We leave the clothing, food or blankets at night so it can be found in the morning.
We may not have much, but what we do have we share. Are we not called humans, after all?

It is not good enough to give a tent and leave them. We must ensure we offer dignity too, says Fathullu, one of the few female mayors in Iraq. She aims to offer a personal welcome to each refugee who arrives in the district, and has overseen the construction of Darashakran camp, home to 11,000 Syrian refugees.
She says the camp has reliable electricity, water and sanitation facilities, as well as green areas for children to play and families to meet. Our door here is always open because we, like our brothers and sisters in Syria, are humanitarian people who look after one another. From one human to the next, I offer my support. I want them to feel secure.

Dirani is the director of one of the few womens resource centres for Syrian refugees in Lebanons Bekaa Valley.
The stories I have heard from women I work with are often unbelievably heartbreaking. But at the same time, day by day, I see their strength grow, their heads rise and strength building as they learn new skills that help empower them, Dirani says.
More than half of the 400,000 refugees from Syria living in the Bekaa Valley are women and children.
Most days women just sit in their homes, cook, clean and worry about how they will be able to provide a good future for their children. Some women have been abandoned by husbands who take on younger, second wives. They struggle and even push their daughters into early marriage or pull their children out of school so they can work and earn money, Dirani says.

Mawa Terro, 29, Foodblessed co-founder and director, Beirut, Lebanon
With food donated by local restaurants and food manufacturing companies, Terro runs a street feeding programme for refugees in Beirut. In the three years since the project began, Foodblessed has provided more than 190,000 meals to Syrian families.
Terro leads a growing team of more than 400 volunteers who make and distribute meals from food that would have otherwise ended up as waste. I used to think that people didnt care, but Ive found out that people just didnt know how, she says.
Journalist Ahmad Abu Hamad knows first-hand what it is like arriving in a new country as a refugee
Ahmad Abu Hamad, 24, Radio Al Balad journalist, Amman, Jordan
Journalist Ahmad Abu Hamad is a Palestinian refugee who grew up in Jordans Madaba refugee camp. Having experienced life as a new arrival, he says his aim is to bring humanity into the conversation on refugees.
There is a misconception that people believe a refugee has no responsibilities. But to become a refugee, that person has had only three options to choose from  to be killed, to be imprisoned or to become a refugee. It is that simple.
Last week I interviewed a 20-year-old refugee girl. When we spoke I looked at her and thought, What has she done? No home, alone. A refugee because of what?

Many things have changed for 13-year-old Salam Al Jundi in the past 15 months, among them being able to smile and walk.
In March 2014 the young Syrian was walking with her young brother and cousin to a shop near her home to buy sweets when a bomb struck their path. Her cousin died, her brother was injured and Salam lost her leg.
With no treatment available near their home, her parents took the chance and sent Salam and her eight-year-old brother to Souriyat Across Borders , a medical centre in Jordan offering free treatment to Syrian refugees.
These kids do not only need treatment but also love and encouragement. Their disability is a mark in their mind and a lot of them lose faith in a brighter future, says Yaseen, a volunteer physiotherapist. I always ask them, Do you need your legs or head to think and attend school? That way I encourage them to believe that they can study and achieve their dreams.

More than half of the Syrian refugee population are children, and agencies are working to provide psychosocial support for children, both in refugee camps and host communities. One form of support is art therapy, which aims to help children express themselves and share stories with others who have had similar experiences.
Artist Hala Abu Said, a Syrian refugee herself, says she hopes she can make a small difference in the lives of the children she works with. This is the best gift I can give the kids as an artist. Every person has something to help Syrians, regardless of their nationality.

Many years ago, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, printed a poster of Albert Einstein with the caption Einstein was a refugee  a reminder of the enormous contribution that refugees have made to the world. But this World Refugee Day , instead of celebrating their contribution, we will unfortunately have to focus on finding solutions for an unprecedented global crisis.
Antnio Guterres, the head of the UNHCR, has spoken of a world facing an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement, as well as the response required, is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before.
There are now nearly 60 million forcibly displaced people in the world: thats almost the same as the combined populations of Canada and Australia. Half of these displaced people are children, and the overall numbers are increasing rapidly.
Related: Pakistan: 'Son, you brought electricity to the village and added 15 years to my life'
Addressing this problem demands coherent migration and refugee policies. Reversing the trend will require effective conflict resolution and prevention. These all remain a long way off. In the meantime, we must find practical, humane and cost-effective ways to respond to the needs of displaced persons.
Like everyone else, displaced people need access to safe, reliable and clean energy, whether for lighting, heating, cooking, sanitation, earning a living or communicating. They rarely get this. Every situation is different, but millions of people in camps depend on rudimentary or primitive energy solutions, such as three-stone fires and candles.
This has profound human, environmental and economic consequences. Accidents with naked flames can cause injuries and death, such as this months tragic example in a Syrian refugee camp in Lebanons Bekaa Valley, where at least four people were killed when dozens of tents caught fire.
Indoor cooking with open fires contributes to serious respiratory illness, chiefly among women and children who tend to be most exposed to the fumes. The same women may also spend hours each day gathering firewood, increasing the risk of gender-based violence, especially as areas around camps become deforested and the women are forced further and further afield in search of firewood.
Humanitarian agencies try to provide what energy they can but their efforts can often be inefficient and costly.
The potential benefits of doing things differently are obvious. They include reduced deforestation, carbon emissions and pollution; improved health and reduced levels of violence; and lower costs. Better energy access can also create livelihood opportunities and could improve relations between displaced people and local populations by supporting enterprise or generating benefits for both communities.
The celebrated UNHCR poster featuring Albert Einstein.
So why is access to sustainable energy not front and centre in responses that seek to address the needs of displaced people?
The problem is not technological. A breathtaking range of innovative products and services exists to meet needs for everything from lighting and cellphone charging to cooking and heating, water pumping and cooling. Some technologies, such as solar PV or panels and mini-grids, are highly advanced. Others, such as fuel-efficient stoves, are basic. All offer cleaner, safer and more reliable energy at an affordable price, and represent a significant improvement on the current situation.
However, a host of obstacles  political, financial and institutional  constrain humanitarian agencies in their efforts to meet the energy needs of displaced populations.
Governments and local authorities in host countries may be reluctant to facilitate energy access for refugees, particularly if local populations have unmet needs, or if they fear increased energy provision may prolong the existence of a camp.
Although most solutions offer very attractive payback times, agencies may struggle to find predictable, long-term funding to procure them. Within the humanitarian system, energy often falls through the cracks. Dedicated agencies, organisational arrangements and funding lines exist for basic needs such as food, water, shelter and health. But not for energy. This means that in the rush to save lives and respond to crises, energy provision is often an afterthought  uncoordinated and short-term.
The scale of these challenges cannot be understated. Success will require rewiring the humanitarian system, developing new funding models, building capacities and expertise where none currently exist, and persuading governments with responsibilities for refugee influxes to try new approaches.
Crucially, it will also require the involvement of the private sector, which is often where the deepest expertise and capacity for innovation lies.
The Moving Energy Initiative , a partnership between the UNHCR, GVEP International, Chatham House , Practical Action Consulting , the Norwegian Refugee Council and the UKs Department for International Development has been formed to address these challenges.
Working in different countries and with other collaborators, the project is designing and piloting new approaches and models for energy provision among displaced populations, building the case for reform and developing recommendations for systemic change.
This year the international community will agree a new set of sustainable development goals . As currently proposed, the seventh goal is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. If all is to mean everyone, the humanitarian system has to start changing now.

Majority of illegal migrants enter UK via Heathrow on a visa, not on a lorry
If Theresa May wants to tackle illegal immigration, better to target overstayers and focus on root cause of Mediterranean migrant crisis
Asylum seekers try to jump on to a moving lorry at Calais on Tuesday

The shocking television footage of desperate asylum seekers and others trying to jump on the slow-moving, queueing lorries on the approach roads at Calais were a sharp reminder of the scenes 15 years ago when the tabloids, daily in the grip of invasion panic, complained of illegals flooding Calais in their efforts to come to soft-touch Britain.
In fact, the migrants are just one element in the chaos created by striking French port workers that will fade once Calais gets back to normal. The home secretary reassured MPs that contingency plans had kicked in to ensure that there had been no mass break-in to Britain.
The numbers of those trying to cross the Channel from Calais fluctuate according to the international situation, and with the largest refugee crisis since the second world war currently playing itself out across the Mediterranean, in north Africa and in the Middle East, it is not surprising that more than a few thousand have gathered in the port.
Millions have already been spent on building bigger fences at Calais to ensure that the port does not become a back door, or indeed a front door, for illegal entrants into Britain.
But the truth is that the vast majority of illegal migrants in Britain are not smuggled across the Channel in the back of a lorry, but enter Britain perfectly legally through the front door on a plane through Heathrow on a visa. If you want to tackle the problem of illegal immigration, then better to tackle those overstayers than the few thousand who might make it across the Channel each year.

Calais migrants: Get to England or die trying - a Guardian investigation
Anyway many of those in Calais are asylum seekers who have fled from countries such as Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan. Some will have come direct from Italy or Greece having made it across the Mediterranean.
Theresa May is right that the root cause lies in the Mediterranean migrant crisis. This weeks EU summit will see the European Union agreeing a programme to share responsibility for just 60,000 migrants and refugees over the next two years. There are already more than 1.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey alone. The United Nations has said in the face of this crisis, the European Union could easily take one million refugees.
All 28 EU countries will agree to take some refugees under this scheme, but the numbers fall far short of the numbers in need of international protection. Britain last Friday dropped its reluctance to take any at all and said it would resettle a few hundred more Syrians.
The replacement of the former flagship, HMS Bulwark, by the small survey ship, HMS Enterprise, this week means that Britain has also scaled back to almost next to nothing its contribution to the EU humanitarian effort to save the lives of those trying to cross the Mediterranean.
The home secretary says she wants to break the linkbetween getting into the boats and reaching Europe. HMS Enterprise is to take part in an eight-strong EU naval fleet to target the smugglers boats. This will be backed by a new taskforce of intelligence, policing and asylum experts to smash the people smuggling networks.
The EU summit this week will agree a timetable for the new force to seize their boats with a possible military operation to destroy them in time if the Libyans consent is ever obtained. Events are moving rapidly in the face of this refugee crisis, and the British and European response is equally rapidly moving from humanitarian solutions, based on international protection, to declaring a war on traffickers based on military solutions.

US ransom policy shift undermines UK's hardline stance

Barack Obamas decision to relax Washingtons blanket ban on paying ransoms to free hostages will be seen as belated American acceptance of an unpleasant but unavoidable necessity by west European countries criticised in the past for buying off terrorist kidnappers with cash.
But if David Cohen, deputy director of the CIA , and other counter-terrorism experts are to be believed, Wednesdays announcement may increase the risk of American citizens being taken hostage abroad, because the payment of large amounts of money for their release now appears more likely.
Obamas policy shift does not in any way overcome the basic ransoms-for-hostages dilemma, which is the fear that handing over money is, in effect, giving in to the bad guys and will encourage and finance more terrorism. Linked to this is the belief, common among American and British politicians, that European governments that pay ransoms (while officially denying it)  notably France, Germany, Spain, Austria, Switzerland and Italy  are letting the side down.
This view contains an element of self-righteous moralising that, whether justified or not, is of scant comfort to the grieving relatives of executed American and British hostage victims. Acutely aware of this cruel human toll and of a string of failed or thwarted armed rescue operations, particularly in Syria, Obama ordered the policy review in an attempt to ensure US policy was consistent and that hostages relatives were treated fairly and kept informed and involved.
Families complained that they had been threatened with prosecution for trying to arrange ransoms, while different government branches were giving them contradictory advice. Obama will allow officials to communicate and negotiate with kidnappers, but has made clear he remains opposed to making concessions to terrorists.
Related: British government faces dilemma by refusing to pay hostage ransoms to Isis
David Cameron is outspoken on the ransom issue. He cajoled the G8 countries into issuing a joint declaration in 2013 pledging that they would not meet ransom demands. This vow has since been ignored by key signatories. In September last year, Cameron told parliament he had no doubt that the many tens of millions raised by Islamic State extremists through hostage-taking in Syria and Iraq was being used to promote terrorism. Thus Britain would not change its stance. Britain continues with this policy, America continues with this policy, but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure that other countries are good to their word, he said .
Obamas shift  giving American hostages families or their representatives the right to pay ransoms without fear of legal repercussions, and authorising US government officials to communicate and negotiate with captors in arranging such deals  cuts the ground from under Camerons feet. Although it has occasionally broken its own rule, Britain now stands alone among the big western powers in adhering to the principle of no hostage ransoms, with the possible exception of Shinzo Abes Japan (which lost two hostages this year after rejecting Isis demands). Camerons stance may prove increasingly hard to maintain as public pressure grows to rescue British citizens in trouble abroad in the same way that other countries do.
The US move has several other ramifications. It potentially raises the profile of the hostage-taking business, giving the terrorists what Margaret Thatcher called the oxygen of publicity. Critics will say it encourages copycat scams by criminal gangs. The change may also fuel hostage price inflation. According to figures researched by the New York Times , al-Qaida took in $125m (80m) in revenue from kidnappings between 2008 and 2014, with more than half  $66m  extorted in 2013. In total, ransoms paid amounted to $165m in the same period. In 2003 the average hostage head-price was $200,000. Now $10m is not unusual.
France, for example, is said to have paid about $40m in 2013 to free four citizens held in Mali. (It denied having done so.) In total, France has reportedly paid out $58m since 2008. In January this year, two Italian aid volunteers held in Syria were freed after $14m was reportedly handed over to their captors, the Nusra Front. Italy and Spain previously paid about $8.9m for the release of three tourists abducted in southern Algeria. Similarly, Germany paid out untold millions last year for two hostages held by Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines .
When Isis paraded the US hostage James Foley before video cameras and threatened to behead him, the asking price for his release was an extraordinary $132m. This figure reflected Foleys political and propaganda value to Isis, rather than any realistic hope of obtaining so large a sum. Foleys subsequent murder was a cruel reminder that in the world of Isiss new caliphate, no amount of money may suffice to save a life if fanatical extremists decree otherwise.
Some evidence suggests Americans will become more attractive to kidnappers due to Obamas move, because al-Qaida and other terror groups target individuals according to their governments willingness to pay. Of 53 hostages taken by al-Qaida from 2009-14, a third were French and a disproportionately high number were Spanish, Austrian or Swiss. Its obvious al-Qaida is targeting them by nationality, Jean-Paul Rouiller, a Swiss counter-terrorism expert, told the New York Times .
David Cohen, deputy CIA director and formerly the top US Treasury official responsible for terrorism and financial intelligence, made a similar point in a trenchant speech in London in 2012 . Unless he has radically changed his opinion since then, Cohens view is sharply at odds with the new White House approach.
Cohen said: We know that hostage-takers looking for ransoms distinguish between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not, and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that do not pay. Recent kidnapping trends appear to indicate that hostage-takers prefer not to take US or UK hostages because they understand they will not receive ransoms.
He said paying ransoms, by whatever means, was a bad idea. Ransom payments lead to future kidnappings, and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments. And it all builds the capacity of terrorist organisations to conduct attacks.

Among the measures Alexis Tsiprass government has used to swell the package it tabled in Brussels on Monday is a 200m (142m) cut in next years defence budget. Estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) for 2014 suggest that would equate to a reduction of around 5% in Greeces military spending . The proposal raises an intriguing question: why did Tsiprass Syriza party not offer more swingeing cuts in defence spending at an earlier stage in its tortuous negotiations with Greeces creditors?
It would seem the obvious course of action for a leftwing  arguably far left  movement. It might also have obviated the need to inflict yet more pain on Greeces long-suffering consumers and workers in the form of the higher VAT and increased social security contributions that also form part of the package. Until now, however, the Tsipras governments only move in the direction of more modest defence spending has been to put the brakes on a 500m programme for the modernisation of naval support jets .
The case for deeper cuts in the defence budget would seem to be all the more persuasive given that Greeces military expenditure is high. Ironically, the EUs most leftwing government spends proportionately more on defence than any other. Greeces military spending amounted to 2.2% of GDP last year, according to Sipri. Among Nato countries, only the US spent more in proportion to the size of its economy.
Thanos Dokos, a defence analyst and director general of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, noted that the latest figures nevertheless reflected a sharp drop since the start of the Greek crisis. The defence budget has come down by around 40% in the last four years, he said.
If it is still high, that is because of a consensus in the country that there is a threat from Turkey and that we need to be able to defend ourselves against it. This is not Belgium or Portugal, Dokos said.
Deeper cuts than those outlined in the Tsipras plan might also be difficult to implement for both political and practical reasons. Tsiprass government is a left-right coalition. Its parliamentary majority depends on support from the rightwing ANEL nationalist party whose leader, Panos Kammenos, holds the defence portfolio.
With no new procurement initiative on the horizon, future defence budgets will consist largely of the cost of earlier arms purchases, military pay and pensions and the armed forces operating expenses. Only the last can be reduced. Which is where a rich irony enters the picture, because Greeces biggest European arms supplier over the years has been Germany . According to Sipri, more than a quarter of Greeces weapons imports between 2000 and 2011 were from the country that has become its main creditor.
There is also strong evidence to indicate that some of the contracts under which the arms were supplied were obtained by bribery, a practice for which Greece has been widely criticised in creditor nations .
The Tsipras government may not have been in a hurry to put military spending cuts onto the table in its talks with its creditors, but then nor has the other side. Greeces plentiful defence budget has proved a nice little earner for its eurozone partners over the years.
No one put a gun to our head and made us buy those weapons, said Dokos. But, although I cannot prove it, I dont think [other European countries] were too keen to make it an issue. I dont think they were too displeased with Greece buying their weapons.

        <title>Creditors' economic plan for Greece is illiterate and doomed to fail</title>

The troika plan for the Greek economy has already failed twice, and it will fail for a third time if the economically illiterate plan being foisted on Athens is adopted. Greece requires growth and debt relief, but the proposals currently being discussed provide neither.
As usual, the International Monetary Fund, the European commission and the European Central Bank will come up with forecasts showing that the latest set of austerity measures will boost confidence, promote investment, stimulate growth and lead to lower unemployment. As usual, they will be wrong. The recession will deepen and the crisis will return.
Back in 2010 when it first got involved , the IMF assumed that the Greek economy would have a painful but relatively short recession. There would be a 6% peak to trough contraction in the economy, which would bottom out in 2011.

Things did not go according to plan. By the time the fund announced its second programme for Greece in March 2012, the economy was in freefall. The IMF assumed the decline would end that year, with a period of flatlining followed by the resumption of growth.
In the end, the Greek economy shrank by 25%, a slump equivalent in its severity to that suffered by the US between 1929 and 1932. Recovery coincided with the arrival of Franklin Roosevelt in the White House.
One of the insights gleaned during the Great Depression was that it does not make a lot of sense for governments to try to balance budgets during a severe downturn, because tax increases and spending cuts reduce demand. That deepens the slump, leaving an even bigger hole in the public finances.
In Greece , though, it as if the clock has been turned back to the pre-FDR days when Herbert Hoover was US president. Weak growth means that Athens continues to miss the deficit targets the troika sets for it. The troika responds by insisting on additional savings to put the budget back on track.
Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning US economist, posted a chart last week based on IMF data that illustrates what happened to the underlying public finances of the eurozone members in 2014.
This measure of budgetary discipline looks at the primary budget surplus - the gap between revenues and spending excluding debt interest payments - adjusted for the state of the economic cycle. Measured in this way, Greece ran a surplus of more than 5% of GDP last year, comfortably higher than any other eurozone country.

It is, however, not enough for the troika. In order to avoid a debt default and a run on its banks that would threaten its continued membership of the single currency, Greece has now had to table proposals that will suck an additional 8bn out of the economy in the next 18 months. Consumer spending will be hit by an increase in VAT and higher pension contributions, while investment will be dampened by a one-off levy and an increase in corporation tax.
Greece has a number of severe economic problems. It suffers from a lack of demand, and a five-year slump has pushed it into deflation. Falling prices have added to the real, inflation-adjusted burden of the governments debt, which currently stands at 175% of GDP. A fresh dose of austerity will make all these problems worse.
One way for Greece to get out of its mess would be for it to leave the euro, devalue its currency and renege on all or part of its debt. That is not an option if it stays in the single currency, which the public wants.
Another way out would be for the creditors to cut Greece some slack. That would involve immediate debt relief and more realistic targets.
The troika, though, will continue with policies that have failed before in the hope that they will succeed this time. Einstein had a definition for this - insanity.

Queen's choice of Germany for state visit seen as diplomatic coup
German observers view monarchs trip, which includes a meeting with Angela Merkel, as a way of showing how poor Europe would be without Britain

For several days, Germans have been fed a daily stream of instructions on what to do should they happen to meet the Queen. In the first instance, she is to be addressed as Your Majesty, wrote the liberal daily the Sddeutsche Zeitung, and thereafter with Maam, to rhyme with gram. And um Gottes willen, keine Selfies! [for Gods sake, no selfies].
If such newspaper guides are anything to go by, Germany is taking Queen Elizabeths seventh official visit to Germany , which begins on Tuesday, extremely seriously. Lilac is a safe colour to wear if you meet her, was another more specific crumb of advice in the tabloid Bild, which pointed out that it is also, appropriately, the tone that results from mixing together the colours of the union jack.
Angela Merkel welcomed news of Her Majestys visit. Queen Elizabeth is witness to the development of the relationship between Germany and Britain which is very friendly today, the German chancellor said this week. And when she visits, its always a big event. But as this is expected to be one of the 89-year-old monarchs last state visits, the interest is more heightened than usual. That their country should be the choice of her final foreign port of call is seen as immensely flattering to the majority of Germans.

There has been much speculation in Germany as to the reasons, including her husband the Duke of Edinburghs German roots  he was born into the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glcksburg and went to school in southern Germany  and not least, her own strong German ancestry. Only during the first world war was the family name changed by her grandfather, George V, from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor.

But as the German socialite and most prominent royal watcher, Alexander, Count of Schnburg-Glauchau, pointed out to readers of Bild in a five-part series, Die Queen und die Deutschen: It is not the Queen who decides when and where she travels, but the British government  and Downing Street has very concrete reasons why it should want to send the Queen  the secret weapon of British diplomacy  to Germany.
Historians have been wheeled out in their droves to explain how her first, 11-day, 18-city visit in 1965 was seen as a major contribution to healing the wounds caused by the second world war. In Britain some critical voices called it an insult to Britains war dead. It was highly symbolic  a sign that Germany was once again being viewed as a normal country, said historian Simone Derix, who has researched the topic in depth. At the same time there were fears among officials that some Germans in their enthusiasm to see her would let slip a heil, she said. In the end, they shouted: E-li-sa-beth!
In the following years, the cold war made her visits just as necessary, not least after prime minister Margaret Thatcher was quoted in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, as saying: I love Germany so much, that Im glad there are two of them. Those wars may be over, and Germany long since reunited, but nowadays, said Schnburg, the anxieties are quite similar, namely Londons fear of  an EU which fuses into a super-state, in which the individual states lose their independence.

David Camerons decision to piggy-back on the visit, when he attends a state banquet with the Queen and the German president, Joachim Gauck, on Wednesday evening, has certainly raised eyebrows. Downing Street insists his trip follows an invitation from the German government. But observers in London and Berlin view it as a deliberate exercise to reinforce the countries commonalities ahead of crucial EU talks Cameron is due to hold with Merkel over Britains future relationship with Brussels, before an in/out referendum on the UKs membership in the EU.
Related: Brexit  what would happen if Britain left the EU?
Certainly, when the Queen is greeted by Merkel on the steps of her cuboid chancellery on Wednesday morning, the pictures will, hope diplomats on both sides, speak volumes about the British-German relationship. Merkel has said she will do all she can to try to keep Britain in the EU. Schnburg said: The Queen, simply through her very presence, is supposed to remind us Germans just how poor Europe would be without Britain.
One commentator from the leftwing paper Taz suggested that another effect of the encounter might be to finally put Merkel, often referred to as the Queen of Europe, in her place, because after all, when Elizabeth became Queen, Merkel was not even born yet.
The packed schedule of the three-day visit will on Wednesday see the Queen and Prince Philip greeted with military honours by Gauck at his residence, Schloss Bellevue, before they take a boat up the river Spree to the chancellery, where the Queen will hold talks with Merkel, before laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
At the Technical University she will listen to the annual Queens lecture, this year delivered by the outgoing director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor  one of the most popular Britons in Germany since his curation last year of an exhibition on 600 years of German history, and the recent announcement that he will take over as a chief adviser on the contents of the new cultural palace in Berlin, the Humboldt Forum.

On Thursday, she will travel to Frankfurt, the countrys financial centre, where the underlying message will be the strong business ties between Britain and Germany, which many say would be threatened by a Brexit. But the most poignant item on the Queens schedule will undoubtedly be her first ever visit to a former concentration camp when she goes to Bergen-Belsen on Friday. The camp was liberated by British troops in April 1945.

The visit  taking place at the Queens request, according to the British embassy  will see her meet survivors and liberators of the camp. It is being kept deliberately low-key but again will usefully serve to reinforce the bond. Details of everything  from what she and Philip will eat (guinea fowl and venison), where shell sleep (the fact that his room is reportedly at the other end of the corridor from hers in Hotel Adlon), to the colour of her Bentley, which was transported to Berlin at the weekend  are being pored over.
One celebrity magazine claims to have seen the protocol note that says the Queen did not respond to the German query as to whether she preferred to take the lift rather than using the stairs. And her personal cook in the Adlon said, on being asked if there was any food she wished to avoid: I was told anything goes, which I think is quite charming.
Everyone, from porcelain manufacturers to toy makers, is exploiting the event for all its worth. The Berlin branch of Lego has even produced a limited edition Queen figure. The fascination is easily explained, say German royal watchers, by the fact that the country does not have its own royal family to admire. From the butler who will serve her tea on her arrival at the Adlon, where the royal entourage will move into 70 rooms on two floors, to the organ grinders outside on Pariser Platz, everyone has their own memories of her last visit in 2004. And few have forgotten how she briefly fell asleep during a lecture on medicine and magnets in Dsseldorf, an incident which did nothing to lessen the love.

Is the Confederate flag a racist symbol? After Charleston, the debate rages on
For most Americans, the answer is simple: yes. But the flag has its defenders who insist it expresses a rich southern heritage, not hatred associated with slavery

The killing of nine African Americans inside a Charleston, South Carolina, church last week by a suspect who appears to have decorated online declarations of his white supremacist views with the Confederate battle flag has returned debate over the flag to the national stage.
Related: South Carolina governor calls for removal of Confederate flag from statehouse
Is the flag a quintessentially racist symbol? Recent polling suggests that for about half of Americans, the answer may be as brief as the question is basic: yes.
The flag was first sewn for an army that fought to preserve in the United States the legally sanctioned slavery of African Americans. Racist hate groups continue to love the flag for something more than its aesthetic appeal. For most African Americans, especially, the meaning of the flag is clear.
Certainly symbolically, we cannot have the Confederate flag waving in the state capitol, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) president, Cornell William Brooks, said in Charleston last week, referring to a banner that flies at a memorial to Confederate soldiers on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse. Hundreds of protesters, black and white, marched on the statehouse at the weekend to demand the flags removal.
Yet the flag has its defenders who insist that it does not express hatred. Many of those voices have become scarce in the days since the Charleston shooting . Elected officials and public figures who have vocally defended the Confederate flag in the past and who ignored repeated requests for comment or declined to answer questions for this story include the president of the College of Charleston, the president pro tempore of the South Carolina state senate and a former speaker of the state house of representatives.
Those who were willing to talk about their devotion to the Confederate flag said, among other things, that it honors soldiers killed in the American civil war who were fighting out of a sense of duty to God and family  not hatred.
Ben Jones is the chief of heritage operations for the Sons of Confederate Veterans and traces multiple lines of ancestry, he said, to soldiers who died fighting for the Confederacy. But he is better known as the actor who played the mechanic Cooter in the 1980s hit television show The Dukes of Hazzard . The heroes in the show drive a car named the General Lee  for the Confederate leader Robert E Lee  which has a Confederate battle flag painted on its roof.
Symbols mean different things to different people in different contexts, said Jones, who is also a former Democratic US congressman from the state of Georgia. When you ask me what it symbolizes, it symbolizes, in a personal way, the courage and the valor of my ancestors, who in their time did what they believed was the right thing to do.
Jones, 73, who runs a chain of Cooters Place outlets in the south that sell Dukes memorabilia including Confederate flag license plates , said the flag had a place in southern culture that had become detached from its history as a battle flag  and from the question of race and racism.
Its been used to sell soap, and its been used to sell rice, and its been used to sell grits, and apples, and travel brochures and beauty pageants, and at race tracks, and its been the name of sports teams, and that flag is flown throughout the southern culture in a hundred different ways to mean the spirit of the south  the independent, the rebelliousness of the south, Jones said.
The argument that the flag is a harmless cultural symbol, however, has withered before. The rapper LL Cool J and country musician Brad Paisley were charged with trivializing slavery for a 2013 collaboration called Accidental Racist . In the song, Paisley says the flag only means that he likes the southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd . LL offers: If you dont judge my do-rag, I wont judge your red flag.
The song isnt perfect, LL Cool J later told talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres, but what we were talking about is love and not judging people on symbols.
South Carolina senator Kevin L Bryant, a Republican, said he thought the Confederate flag outside the statehouse eventually will come down, and that he would support, with ambivalence, legislation to take it down.
Im torn on the issue, Bryant said. Theres three groups of people. Theres some that find it offensive. And then theres a small amount of people who use it as a symbol of hate. And then theres a large group of folks who have had relatives that fought and died in the war between the states  a title used by some in the south for the American civil war  who see it as their heritage.
Ive talked to lots of constituents and theres strong feelings on all sides. Its just unfortunate that some people, like this murderer in Charleston, use it as a symbol of hate. I dont think the flag on the statehouse grounds had anything to do with this murderer.
Jones forcefully disclaimed any link between the flag and the suspect in the Charleston killings, Dylann Roof, whom Jones called a demented white supremacist, a reactionary little drug addict and a nowhere man who tried to make a name for himself.
These were wonderful people who were murdered by an idiot, Jones said. That does not stand for anything. That is a hateful individual.
What else did he have, a black Hyundai? Is that a symbol of racism?
South Carolina congressman Doug Brannon, a Republican, has written legislation to remove the flag from the capitol grounds. He described how southerners who seek to honor the memory of their ancestors could still ask for the flag to be removed from the statehouse, where it was first flown in 1962 in order to signal resistance to the forced desegregation of southern schools and public places.
Theres a number of people in South Carolina that will tell you that flag represents their heritage, Brannon said. But the truth of the matter is, those people dont understand the history of the flag, and the state capitol. That flag may in fact be your heritage. But the flag of your heritage is the flag that was carried by battalions or divisions in a war 150 years ago.
The flag that Im talking about is the one that was put on the state capitol dome in 1962 in response to desegregation. So  its two separate issues.
The flag of their heritage is fine for them. And their flag of heritage needs to be in a museum. The flag that Im talking about was put up by a bunch of white guys in 1962 in response to desegregation. And thats not heritage. Thats hate.
State senator John Matthews was one of the African American leaders of the legislature who led the fight to take the flag off the capitol dome, where it was raised until 2000, and plant it in front of the Confederate memorial.
To African Americans, we saw it as suppression, Matthews told the Guardian in an interview last week. We at the state are evolving from where we were, to where we need to be. A lot of people in this state are good people moving on and moving up. But some of the old south is still lingering.
The Confederate memorial to which the flag attracting the current controversy is attached is one vestige of the old south. It was dedicated in 1879, just 14 years after the civil war ended and four years after the statehouse itself was finished.
Heres how the monument explains itself :
This monument perpetuates the memory, of those who true to the instincts of their birth, faithful to the teachings of their fathers, constant in their love for the state, died in the performance of their duty: who have glorified a fallen cause by the simple manhood of their lives, the patient endurance of suffering, and the heroism of death, and who, in the dark hours of imprisonment, in the hopelessness of the hospital, in the short sharp agony of the field, found support and consolation in the belief that at home they would not be forgotten.
But Gwendolyn Neal, a black woman who was born and raised in South Carolina and was interviewed by the Guardian at the capitol over the weekend , said the flag was offensive, full stop: Its always going to be a slap in the face, as long as its up there.
This article was amended on Monday, 22 June, to more accurately represent polling numbers on American views of the Confederate battle flag.
