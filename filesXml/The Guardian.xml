Eurozone calls on Athens to get serious over Greece debt crisis
Appeal made as Greek banks stay shut and 19 leaders convene in Brussels for what many see as last chance to avoid leaving eurozone

The Greek government has been told by its eurozone partners not to expect debt relief any time soon, amid fading hopes of decisive action to stop the country tumbling out of the currency union.
Eurozone finance ministers arriving for emergency talks in Brussels made it clear they were waiting on Athens to sign up to further reforms and were in no hurry to discuss debt relief.
Finance ministers are preparing the way for a summit of eurozone leaders that gets underway on Tuesday evening. The summit, called after Greeks rejected the eurozone-drafted bailout plan in a referemdum on Sunday, is seen as one of the last real chances to secure a deal to stop Greece crashing out of the euro.
Greek banks are on the brink of running out of cash, but senior European figures are already dampening hopes of any breakthrough. What we are going to do today is to talk to each other and restore order, said the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, adding that there would be no overnight solution.
In a coordinated press statement, the leaders of France and Germany called on Greece to come up with serious and credible proposals at Tuesdays summit which are consistent with its wish to stay in the eurozone.
The demand was echoed by finance ministers, who stressed they wanted to see the Greek government sign up to reforms. Several made it clear they would not support any write-off of Greek debt.
We are not in the business of renegotiating debt, said Finlands finance minister, Alexander Stubb. That was already done in 2011 and 2012, referring to re-structuring of Greek debts that imposed heavy losses on private creditors.
Stubb said Finlands commitments to Greece had proved to be more than anyone ever expected, totalling 10% of the Finnish government budget.
The European commission, the guardian of EU law, was openly split. Valdis Dombrovskis, the Latvian commissioner in charge of the euro, said a Greek exit from the eurozone could not be excluded. Pierre Moscovici, the French commissioner in charge of the economic policy, struck a different note, saying that Grexit would be a terrible collective failure.
Juncker blamed the Greeks for walking out of talks and said it was up to Athens to come up with proposals that would allow Europe to get out of this situation.
The depths of mistrust were highlighted by Latvias finance minister, Jnis Reirs, who said his compatriots were surprised at the referendum result. Latvian people do not understand Greek people, he said.
As talks in Brussels grind on, Greek banks remain closed with it far from clear they will be able to reopen on Thursday, once the latest bank holiday comes to an end.
The European Central Bank raised the pressure on Greek banks on Monday night by tightening access to emergency credit. The Frankfurt-based institution has pumped 89bn (63bn) into the Greek financial system in recent months, but Greek banks can only tap this emergency aid by putting up collateral, such as Greek government bonds.
The bank said on Monday it was adjust[ing] the haircuts accepted on collateral, meaning that Greek assets are now deemed more risky, to secure smaller amounts of emergency funds.
The level of emergency funding remains unchanged at 89bn, despite a plea from the central bank in Athens for an extra 3bn. The request was first reported by Bloomberg.
The ECB said its governing council was closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area.
The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, pressed for capital controls to be lifted when he spoke to the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, on Monday. After a hectic day of meetings with Greek party leaders, Tsipras also spoke to Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. She told him the IMF was no longer able to provide money to Greece until it clears its arrears, following last weeks default on a 1.6bn loan repayment.
Tsipras is expected to table fresh proposals to the eurozone summit to secure desperately needed financial aid. These new proposals are likely to be based on a plan Tsipras submitted last week, when he called for a two-year loan of 29bn from the eurozones permanent bailout fund and promised to sign up to economic reforms, including further austerity.
Despite the departure of Greeces finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis , reaching a deal will not be easy. Germanys finance minister, Wolfgang Schuble, who clashed often with Varoufakis, indicated the path ahead would be no easier for his successor.
Euclid Tsakalotos, an Oxford-educated economics professor, was sworn in as Greek finance minister on Monday night, having already served as chief negotiator on the debt crisis for the Syriza-led government. He arrived at Tuesdays meeting without talking to reporters.

Bill Cosby admitted in 2005 that he got quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with, and that he gave another sedative to at least one woman and other people, according to documents obtained on Monday by the Associated Press.
That woman and a second woman testified in the same case that they knowingly took quaaludes from him, according to the unsealed documents.
The AP had gone to court to compel the release of the documents from the deposition in a sexual abuse lawsuit filed by former Temple University employee Andrea Constand  the first of a cascade of sexual abuse lawsuits against him. Cosbys lawyers had objected on the grounds that it would embarrass their client.

Cosby settled that lawsuit under confidential terms in 2006. His lawyers in the Philadelphia case did not immediately return phone calls on Monday. Constand consented to be identified but did not want to comment, her lawyer said on Monday.
Cosby, 77, has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct, including allegations by many that he drugged and raped them in incidents dating back more than four decades. Cosby has never been criminally charged, and most of the accusations are barred by statutes of limitations.

Cosby, giving sworn testimony in the lawsuit accusing him of sexual assaulting Constand at his home in Pennsylvania in 2005, said he got seven quaalude prescriptions in the 1970s. The lawyer for Constand asked if he had kept the sedatives through the 1990s  after they were banned  but was frustrated by objections from Cosbys lawyer.
When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with? lawyer Dolores M Troiani asked.
Yes, Cosby answered on 29 September 2005.
Did you ever give any of these young women the quaaludes without their knowledge? Troiani asked.
Cosbys lawyer again objected, leading Troiani to petition the federal judge to force Cosby to cooperate.
Cosby later said he gave Constand three half-pills of Benadryl, although Troiani in the documents voices doubt that was the drug involved. The two other women who testified on Constands behalf said they had knowingly been given quaaludes.
Three of the women accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting them have a defamation lawsuit pending against him in Massachusetts. They allege that he defamed them when his agents said their accusations were untrue. Cosby is trying to get their case thrown out before discovery.
Cosby had fought the APs efforts to unseal the testimony, with his lawyer arguing the deposition could reveal details of Cosbys marriage, sex life and prescription drug use.
It would be terribly embarrassing for this material to come out, lawyer George M Gowen III argued in June. He said the public should not have access to what Cosby was forced to say as he answered questions under oath from the accusers lawyer nearly a decade ago.
Frankly ... it would embarrass him, [and] it would also prejudice him in eyes of the jury pool in Massachusetts, Gowen said.
US district judge Eduardo Robreno asked last month why Cosby was fighting the release of his sworn testimony, given that the accusations in the Temple womans lawsuit were already in the public eye.
Why would he be embarrassed by his own version of the facts? Robreno said.
Cosby resigned in December from the board of trustees at Temple, where he was the popular face of the Philadelphia school in advertisements, fundraising campaigns and commencement speeches.

Campaign to cut supermarket food waste reaches European parliament

A French councillors campaign to stamp out food waste by forcing supermarkets to give unwanted items to charity will reach the European level on Wednesday.
Arash Derambarsh, who has already persuaded the French government to pass a law barring shops from destroying food as it approaches its sell-by date, hopes the European parliament will approve an amendment to a new circular economy law encouraging individual member states to follow suit.
Derambarsh, a municipal councillor in Courbevoie, north-west of Paris, said he was confident the amended law would be approved during Wednesdays proposed vote, describing it as historic.
Related: France to force big supermarkets to give unsold food to charities
This is such an important issue and we have to work fast before the food lobbies get together and start opposing us, he said.
I set a deadline of getting the law passed in France and Europe within a year, and were six months in, so were doing well. After that, its the world.
If Wednesdays law is approved, Derambarsh said it would go before the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who would decide if and when it should be applied.
Derambarsh said: I call on Mr Juncker to sign it immediately so it can be applied now. This is the most important legislation of the year and we cannot lose time.
The councillor started his campaign by collecting unsold food from his local supermarket. He and a team of helpers personally distributed it to the needy, many of them pensioners, families struggling in poverty and people living on the streets and in shelters.
A petition launched in seven European countries including Britain that calls for support for the law has more than 539,000 signatures.
Derambarsh has the backing of French MEPs Nicole Fontaine, a former European parliament president, and Anglique Delahaye, of the Rpublicains party, who introduced the amendment into the law.
The French law, passed in May, obliges large supermarkets and food stores to sign an agreement with a charitable organisation by next year.

During a recent visit to Italy, Derambarsh also enlisted the support of former UN goodwill ambassador and actor Gina Lollobrigida.
The amendment calls on the European commission to promote in member states the creation of conventions proposing that retail food sector distribute their unsold products to charity associations.
Derambarsh is planning to table the issue  via the campaign group ONE, founded by U2 singer Bono  in September when the United Nations discusses its millennium development goals to end poverty in September, as well as at the G20 economic summit in Turkey in November and the COP21 environment conference in Paris in December.
Derambarsh, a lawyer whose family moved to Paris to escape the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, is a member of Nicolas Sarkozys rightwing Rpublicains party. Critics have accused him of trying to further his own political career by creating a media storm over food waste.
The 35-year-old admits he is engaged in what he calls a press blitzkrieg, but only to raise awareness of the scandalous and utterly absurd situation where comestibles are thrown away or destroyed with bleach while people go hungry.
He cited his teams success working with their local Carrefour store since last October.
In Courbevoie we collect 40kg of unsold food worth around 500 (350) and we are able to help 100 people. Imagine what that translates to on a European level. With this law we can bring immediate relief to the poor and hungry, he said.
Derambarsh, who says he is also working with Action Contre La Faim and the French Red Cross, added: Its true that these kind of issues are normally associated with socialist politicians, but when it comes to thirst and hunger, there should be no political divide. These issues cut across national and political lines. Its something we can all agree on.
The job of any politician is to help people, my objective is to help people who are hungry.
An estimated 7.1m tonnes of food is binned in France each year  67% of it by consumers, 15% by restaurants and 11% by shops. The figure for food waste across the EU is 89m tonnes while an estimated 1.3bn tonnes are wasted worldwide.

        <title>Pamplona festival: two Americans and a Briton gored by bulls</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/bull-runners-gored-pamplona-festival-san-fermin-spain</Link>

Six half-ton fighting bulls were let loose in the narrow streets of the northern Spanish city for the festivals first run, which was described as quick and dangerous. Eleven people in total were injured in the two minutes and 23 seconds it took for the bulls to barrel down the 850-metre route from the holding pen to the city bullring.
A 38-year-old American was gored in the armpit, and a 30-year-old Brit was left slightly injured after being gored in the groin. A 27-year-old from California was treated for a superficial wound on his lower back after being grazed by a bulls horns. None of the injuries were considered to be life-threatening.
Eight other men, including three Americans, were treated for bruises and scrapes.
Tuesdays run included six animals from the Jandilla ranch in the rural western region of Extremadura, known for the ferocity of its bulls. The Spanish newspaper El Pas heralded a particularly feisty bull named Fastuoso, or Magnificent, who took an early lead in the run, knocking people aside as he charged down the tightly packed street. As he rounded a curve, Fastuoso hurled a runner against the wall, breaking a water pipe in the process.
The nine-day festival, which traces its roots back to the 13th century, was made famous by Ernest Hemingways 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. Each year thousands of tourists, mostly from the US, Australia and Britain, flock to the festival to tear through the streets dressed in red and white.

The festival is a target for animal rights activists, who point out that the bulls used in the eight days of runs are all killed in evening bullfights. On Saturday 100 or so protesters, many of them covered in fake blood, gathered outside Pamplonas bullring to protest at what they call a week of fear and death for bulls. Pamplonas streets are stained with bulls blood, read their signs.
Fifteen people have been killed in the festival since records began in the early 1900s. Dozens are injured each year, many of them during the panicked chaos of the bull runs.

        <title>China and Russia: the world's new superpower axis?</title>

Forget euro summits and G7 gatherings: for the countries that like to style themselves as the worlds rising powers, the real summitry takes place this week in central Russia, where Vladimir Putin will hold court.
Leaders of the Brics countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) will meet Putin in Ufa on Wednesday, then make way for the Asian powers grouped in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Russia and China are the common denominators, as in so much geopolitics these days. The UN security council, Apec, the G20 - Russia and China are the ever-presents, a powerful pairing whose interests coincide more often than not.
Moscow and Beijing have lots in common apart from a 2,500-mile border, economies dominated by state-run firms and oligarchies that can enrich themselves as long as they play by the prevailing political mood of the day.
organisation membership
Officially, Putin is dismissive about suggestions of a new eastern alliance. We are not creating a military alliance with China, he said last month. We are not creating a bloc-based approach, we are trying to create a global approach.
And yet both countries share a desire to limit American power; they enjoy a burgeoning trade relationship in which, in essence, hydrocarbons are swapped for cheap consumer goods; and they have a mutual interest in promoting an alternative model to western diplomacy.
Trade has increased sixfold over the past decade. Last year they trumpeted the biggest gas deal in history. The summer will be bookended by two striking events: Russian and Chinese warships puttering about together in the eastern Mediterranean in May, gaming war; and Russian and Chinese presidents standing shoulder to shoulder in Beijing for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in September.
So how robust is the Russia-China axis?
Geopolitics
For China, one of the main attractions of closer relations with Russia is the potential for challenging Washingtons still dominant global position.
In China, where until recently the official line was non-alignment, some prominent scholars have started to make unambiguous calls for a comprehensive strategic alliance with Russia, Alexander Korolev, at the National University of Singapores centre on Asia and globalisation, argued recently . [They are] arguing on the pages of the CCP [Communist party] central party schools internal publications that China-Russia strategic relations are the most substantive ones and elsewhere that China will be unable to shift the world from unipolarity to bipolarity unless it forms a formal alliance with Russia.
But often cooperation and tension are two sides of the same coin. Take Central Asia. Chinas president, Xi Jinping , has set his sights on a new silk road, using Chinas billions to help neighbours and regional allies to develop, indirectly supporting growth at home and the expansion of Chinese soft power.
However, this is also Russias traditional sphere of influence and any Chinese presence that goes beyond commercial dealings is likely to raise hackles in Moscow.
Its totally possible for China to develop its relations with central Asian countries without challenging Russia, said Liu Jun, a Russian studies expert at East China Normal University. Its true that Russia would be concerned if Chinas influence in Central Asia grew too much, but the concerns are not mainstream in the bilateral relations  there are more benefits in cooperation than otherwise.
Russia shares the strategic goal of challenging US hegemony in favour of a more multipolar world, and the two powers often find themselves on the same side in the UN security council, where they wield vetoes as permanent members.

No deal on regulating Irans nuclear programme can be made without Russia and China, which have staunchly backed its atomic expansion in the past, and the two countries support is largely the reason Bashar al-Assad has been able to hold on to power in Syria. Recently, Russia has been making political and economic overtures to North Korea, which relies on food, arms and energy from its key ally, China, to survive.
As they support the idea of a multipolar world against American dominance, Moscow and Beijing will also tacitly back each others attempts to defend their own spheres of influence, said Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. In the past two years, Russia has annexed Crimea and backed a separatist campaign to frustrate Ukraines turn to the west, and China has been disputing islands with western allies in the South China Sea.
China admits de facto that Russia has interests in eastern Europe , Russia admits that China has interests around the perimeter of its borders, and even though neither will actively help its partner in Ukraine or the South China Sea, both will observe an advantageous neutrality, Trenin said. There wont be criticism of each other in the areas of their core interests.
Leadership
Government enthusiasm for warmer ties with Russia is summed up by a recent video from the state-controlled Xinhua news agency entitled What Do Chinese People Think About Russia?
It features Chinese children describing Russia as even bigger than China, an old man praising Russias strength, demands for more investment, gas sales, a high-speed train, and plenty of airtime given to adulation of the Russian president.
Putin has long been popular in China, where he is seen as a strong leader who has bolstered national pride, and is not a little admired for his topless photo shoots. Putin youre a handsome man, says one middle-aged woman on being asked what message she would like to send to Moscow.
There is also an overt comparison to Xi, who has fostered a personality cult of bold leadership that has echoes of the Russian leaders (though with less bare flesh). Putin is the same as our Papa Xi, says one young man, using a government endorsed affectionate term for the president.
For their part, Russians are more ambivalent about Xi, who has a far lower profile in Russia than does his counterpart in China.
Trade
Chinas interest in Russian exports has until now been largely focused on natural resources and military hardware. Beyond that they do not make natural partners. Russia can offer little by way of famous brands or innovation in consumer technology to tempt ordinary Chinese customers.
Its a good thing that there is political will behind the business cooperation. Without it, a lot of things wont happen, Liu said. Most big projects are backed by the governments and the volume of trade along the border is quite small.
The imbalance of the relationship can be seen in the breakdown of their bilateral trade, worth around $100bn a year. China is Russias second largest trading partner after the EU, while Russia only just scraped into a list of Chinas top 10 trading partners, accounting for barely 3% of the countrys total trade volume.
Moscow is also hoping Beijing will help with finance for businesses, after western funds dried up last year. Some Chinese firms have seen the Russian economic wobble as an opportunity to make capital investments in the country.
Energy
China and Russia should make natural partners in energy deals, but in reality they have struggled to turn past agreements into real supply deals; pipelines announced last decade have still not been built because of disagreements over pricing and other conditions.
Earlier this year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil to China for the first time, with Russian exports to China more than doubling since 2010. But Beijing is accustomed to shopping around for energy and driving a very cheap bargain with its suppliers, while Russia is used to controlling prices for European customers with few other options.
The expansion of shale gas production may have weakened Russias hand by improving global supply, but China is also increasingly concerned about climate change and needs to wean itself off the dirty coal that still provides well over half its energy.
Since Russia has rarely agreed to sell stakes in strategic land-based deposits to western companies, Putins offer of a stake in state oil champion Rosnefts biggest production asset, the Vankor oilfields, to China in September underlined the new direction the countrys energy policy is taking.

The offer was made at a ceremony to start construction of Russias $55bn Power of Siberia pipeline, a breakthrough project that is planned to deliver an annual 38bn cubic metres of gas to eastern China over the next 30 years. In November, the two countries also signed a framework agreement for an Altai gas pipeline to potentially supply 30bn cubic metres of gas to western China each year for 30 years.
But neither pipeline deal appears to have been completely finalised, and economic sanctions and a weak rouble will probably make financing the huge projects difficult for Russias Gazprom.
It seems like at every meeting theres some sort of document signed and hailed as another big agreement  but Gazprom will need to develop large fields and construct the pipelines, said Grigory Birg, an analyst at Investcafe. I think in the current environment securing the finances is the major holdup, and we dont have any indication as to the economics of the project.
Although Birg estimated the rate of return on the Power of Siberia investment to be a modest 9% to 10% when the deal was signed, the profitability is likely to be even less if global oil prices remain weak. Beijing will, by all appearances, be able to drive an even harder bargain for the gas price under the proposed Altai pipeline to western China, a region that has less demand than the industrialised east of the country and already receives cheap gas from nearby Turkmenistan.
Nonetheless, analysts expect energy cooperation to continue to grow as Russia seeks alternatives to the politically thorny European market, and China addresses growing demand and problems with pollution and blackouts. Last year, China replaced Germany as Russias biggest buyer of crude oil. China is the major alternative market and is easily accessible for Russia given the [location of energy] reserves and the geopolitical partnership, so its an obvious fit, Birg said. But the timing at which it is happening is not in favour of Russia.
Pipeline to china
Currency
Both Russia and China have an interest in loosening the US dollars dominance in global trade as the worlds reserve currency. Russia now accepts yuan for oil payments (something that other oil exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, dont do).
Following the imposition of sanctions, Russian companies and banks  traditionally reliant on dollar-denominated syndicated loans  started to look to China for a financial escape route. The rouble-yuan currency pair reached records in trading volumes last summer.
Russian companies are not new to the renminbi market, nor to the issuing of dim sum bonds  bonds denominated in Chinese yuan and largely issued by entities based in China or Hong Kong. In the past these options represented a cheaper source of funding. Now theyre a necessity. However, yields on Russian corporate bonds denominated in yuan have increased as the list of sanctions started mounting up.
Military
Russian arms sales to China have been estimated at $1bn a year, the Russians were previously hesitant to give advanced weaponry to the Soviet Unions one-time military rival. But the recent announcement by Russias state arms exporter of a deal to supply China with its S-400 surface-to-air missile systems has taken their relationship to a new level at a time when Beijing is seeking new air and naval defence technologies.
The higher-level arms sales have been accompanied by greater military cooperation, which was on display in May with the war games in the Mediterranean Sea. Such exercises in what has traditionally been a Nato pond are designed to expand the Chinese navys reach while showing the United States that Russia is a potentially important military partner, according to Trenin.
Following the Ukraine crisis, which soured relations with the west, he said the main considerations behind Russias entente with China were political. Now Russia has an important stimulus to grow relations with China, because relations with the west are troubled, and China is the only large player in the world that can be considered as economic, political and to a certain extent military ally, Trenin said.
China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies
Both sides, meanwhile, are concerned that the unrest in Pakistan and Afghanistan could spill over into their territory, or serve as incubators for militants who may one day return home.
But none of that means that either side has forgotten past disputes or present differences. Russia is nervous about China sapping its revenue by reverse engineering the equipment it buys, and is also monitoring Beijing closely for any attempts to project military power into central Asia.
China and Russias strategic partnership is a result of the times, but it is totally different from a military alliance such as the one between the US and Japan, the Global Times, a Chinese nationalist tabloid, said in a recent editorial.
China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies. They do mean that. China also cares about relations with western countries. Russia does not want to see relations with the west become a deadlock.
UN vetoes
Cyber security
Both Russia and China share a concern over the US domination of the internet. In January, Russia, China and a number of central Asian dictatorships jointly submitted a new proposal for an international code of conduct on information security to the UN general assembly.
In a clause clearly aimed at the US, the document calls for countries not to use information and communications technologies and  networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other states or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability.
At a recent internet security forum in Moscow, officials from both countries called for a new approach to online security.
Its great they [the US] invented the iPhone but when you open your iPhone and see the camera you have to guess whether its photographing you at that moment or not, said Konstantin Malofeyev, a controversial businessman known for his backing for the Russian Orthodox church and the pro-Russian separatist movement in east Ukraine. Russia went into space first and Antarctic first but we dont control those things, they are controlled by international charters. Why should the US control the internet?

Chinese official Chen Xiaohua said: We should join hands to build cyberspace order. Various countries share a consistent vision of enhancing the governance of cyberspace  following the principles of mutual trust and mutual respect.
In the meantime, Beijing and Moscow signed a landmark cyber-security deal recently that could bolster defence against external attack as well as allowing them to share technology for domestic control.
The two countries have poured resources into managing the internet, aiming to curb its potential as a platform for dissent. Beijings great firewall is a powerful and sophisticated filter of the online world, but is still porous enough that most people inside China do not need to bother trying to evade it.
Both countries also field armies of both hackers and paid pro-government commenters, known in China as the 50 cent group, because of how much they are paid for each post. However, experts say their focus on internal controls may have come at the expense of security.
Prioritising political information control over technical cyber defence also damages Chinas own cybersecurity, Jon Lindsay of Harvard Universitys Belfer centre for science and international affairs said in a recent briefing . Lax law enforcement and poor cyber defences leave the country vulnerable to both cyber criminals and foreign spies.
Business mood
Among some business people, there is a fear that the enforced turn to the east will mean Russia selling out from a position of weakness.
The downturn in relations with the west is bad for Russia and bad for the west; the only beneficiary is China, one top Russian businessman said. The number of Chinese delegations coming to Russia has gone up tenfold, and the Chinese will only enter the market when they see the conditions are very beneficial to them.
Russian media have been told to play up links with China and other non-western countries, and companies have felt pressure from the government to look eastwards even if it makes little business sense. But what initially seemed pointless may be starting to bear some fruit.
It started as theatre, but now there are some companies out there really getting stuff done, said Tom Blackwell, CEO of EM, a consultancy firm that has worked with a number of major Russian companies on exploring the Chinese market. Chinese investment funds have very little experience or knowledge about Russia and its a hard sell. But the strategy seems to be to do the big state deals first and assume smaller ones will follow. Slowly, real things are happening.
Russias federal migration service is especially wary of an influx of Chinese migrants across the Russia-China border. It has stated that Chinese could become the largest ethnic group in Russias far east by the 2020s or 2030s; last summer a border official said that 1.5 million Chinese illegally entered the region from January 2013 to June 2014.

Australian swimming legend Dawn Fraser has apologised after she launched an extraordinary attack on tennis star Nick Kyrgios in the wake of his heated Wimbledon round-of-16 defeat to Richard Gasquet.
Fraser lambasted Kyrgios and compatriot Bernard Tomic on Tuesday morning on Australian television for their childish behaviour during this weeks Championships.
But the former Olympic gold medallist went a step further by suggesting both players should go back to where their parents came from if they were going to maintain such an attitude.

Fraser later said: I want to unreservedly apologise for any comments that I made this morning which may have caused offence to my fellow Australians, including Nick and his family. The live-to-air clip was part of a larger un-broadcasted interview however this does not condone what was said.
My intended message, which was not delivered as articulately as it could have been  was on a purely sporting level rather than meant as an attack on Nicks ethnicity. Nicks representing Australia and I want to see him representing Australian tennis in the best possible light.
Representing your country is the highest accolade for any athlete and being selected for Australia is both a privilege and an honour. Not only do you represent yourself, your team, your fans, your family, but you are representing the heritage of the competition and acting as a role model for young Australians.
Frasers comments emerged during an interview on Channel Nines Today program. Responding to a question from host Karl Stefanovic about Kyrgioss behaviour at Wimbledon and Tomics attack on Tennis Australia , which led to him being dumped from the Davis Cup team, Fraser said: They should be setting a better example for the younger generation of this country, a great country of ours.
If they dont like it, go back to where their fathers or their parents came from. We dont need them here in this country if they act like that.
Stefanovic glossed over the comments, but Kyrgios posted on his Facebook page after the interview in response to Fraser.
Throwing a racket, brat. Debating the rules, disrespectful. Frustrated when competing, spoilt. Showing emotion, arrogant. Blatant racist, Australian legend, he wrote.
His mother, Nill Kyrgios, said on Twitter that Frasers attack was out of line.
 nill kyrgios (@nillkyrgios) July 7, 2015
I have no comments on Dawn Frasers nasty racist attack...but she is out of line. #unaustralianbehaviour
Kyrgios was born in Canberra. His father Giorgios hails from Greece and Nill Kyrgios was born in Malaysia.
Tomic is German-born, with a Croatian father and Bosnian mother. The family migrated to the Gold Coast when Tomic was three.
Frasers comments were also criticised by Australias race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane. He told the National Press Club on Tuesday: Contrary to what the likes of Dawn Fraser might say, most Australians do not tell migrants and their children to go back to where they came from.

It is not the first time Fraser has made controversial remarks about race. In 1997 she said she was sympathetic to the cause of Pauline Hanson and considered standing for Hansons rightwing One Nation party in the 1998 election. At the time she said of refugees: Weve got a lot of problems in our own country and we should be looking at our own first, before looking overseas.
Kyrgios had earlier denied tanking against Gasquet and pushed back at questions over his on-court behaviour in his post-match press conference . Kyrgios faced a potential $US20,000 (A$27,000) fine under grand slam best effort rules, but fended off accusations that he had stopped trying.
Of course I tried, he said. There was a lot of ups and downs. It was a tough, tough time, especially when hes not missing any balls.
Im getting frustrated myself. I feel as if Im playing not how I should be playing. Im angry at myself.

Somalias al-Shabaab group has claimed responsibility for a gun and grenade attack that killed 14 sleeping quarry workers and wounded many others in northern Kenya. The attack was staged only weeks before a visit by President Barack Obama to the east African country.
Gunmen raided the remote village of Soko Mbuzi near the Somalia border at about 1am on Tuesday, smashing through a gate using a petrol bomb before hurling grenades at workers and spraying those who tried to flee with bullets.
Local police chiefs said the attack bore all the hallmarks of the al-Qaida affiliate, which has been blamed for a series of atrocities in east Africa .
All indications are that they were al-Shabaab militants. They destroyed metal grilled doors before they bombed the houses and opened fire on the innocent victims, the Mandera county commissioner, Alex Ole Nkoyo, told the Standard newspaper .
An al-Shabaab spokesman later claimed responsibility, telling Reuters the raid was part of its campaign against Kenya .
Several victims were rushed to hospital although the number of the injured was unclear.
The killings follow a pattern in which al-Shabaab militants have targeted non-locals working in the predominantly Muslim region near the Kenyan-Somalia border. Workers from areas outside the region tend to be Christian.
In December, 36 quarry workers were killed in similar circumstances in the same county.
Kenya has been on a heightened state of alert since it was announced in March that Obama will tour the country at the end of July to attend a global entrepreneurship summit.
Although the visit has generated considerable enthusiasm, in part due to the fact Obamas father was Kenyan, there are concerns militants could take advantage of the occasion to stage attacks.
Hundreds of security officers have been mobilised to bolster security and surveillance cameras have been installed in many streets in the capital, Nairobi. But al-Shabaab has shown itself capable of operating at will in the vast, historically marginalised region near the Somalia border where they are most active.
After a particularly shocking shooting rampage in a university in the northern town of Garissa left 148 students and security students dead in April, Obama called his Kenyan counterpart, Uhuru Kenyatta, to offer his support and said he would not change his plans to visit the country.
The Kenyatta government, which has come under intense public pressure to contain the al-Shabaab attacks, is expected to find itself under increasing scrutiny in the weeks leading up to Obamas visit.

Migrant dies on UK-bound freight train near Calais
Death is second in two weeks amid migrant crisis at French port, causing delayed passenger services and freight traffic

A migrant has died on a freight train while trying to reach Britain from the French side of the Channel, the second fatality in as many weeks.
The incident happened at about 6am (5am BST) on Tuesday near Calais. Freight traffic was disrupted but there were also delays to passenger services.
A Eurotunnel spokesman said: At 5.30am, the presence of migrants was reported on a freight shuttle just entering the tunnel.
Safety procedures apply automatically if there is any human presence in the tunnel, therefore the train was brought to a controlled stop and the overhead power was cut. The French police conducted a search, in the process of which they found a migrant who they declared deceased a short while later.
There are no details yet about the age, sex or nationality of the migrant.
An Eritrean man died while trying to get on a train at Coquelles last month. The latest death occurred as migrants tried to clamber on to a freight train. It was unclear how many were involved, but it was thought to be fewer than a dozen. Such incidents have become a regular occurrence as migrants resort to ever more desperate tactics to enter the UK.
Last year, a Guardian investigation revealed that at least 15 people living in the makeshift camps in Calais had died trying to reach the UK in just 12 months. Aid workers have said the situation has got worse in the past six months.
The travel disruption caused by the death of the migrant led Kent Police to implement Operation Stack on the M20 coastbound carriageway.
The force said: Due to this mornings disruption at the Channel Tunnel, all motorists are warned of significant disruption to their journeys.
Anyone intending to travel across the Channel is advised to check with the operator before starting their journey.
 Eurotunnel LeShuttle (@LeShuttle) July 7, 2015
Confirmation that due to migrants found on freight shuttle, we expect delays to Passenger service of 3hrs from UK &amp; 60mins from France . ^LE
Eurotunnel recommended that day trippers rearrange their travel for another date due to the length of delays.
Last week, about 150 migrants caused delays and cancellations when they tried to storm the Channel tunnel terminal in France amid calls for a resolution to the Calais migrant crisis.
About 3,000 people displaced from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan have set up camp near the port. French aid workers have described the situation at the camp, known as Jungle 2, as catastrophic.
Industrial action by ferry workers this summer has compounded the problems faced by truck drivers, with migrants trying to get on their UK-bound HGVs. Last week, more than 3,000 lorry drivers had to queue in high temperatures on the M20 during a wildcat strike by ferry workers in France.
Related: Migrant reportedly dies trying to board Channel tunnel freight train
French authorities have been criticised for not doing enough to safeguard lorry drivers from intimidation, violence and attempts by migrants to board their vehicles. Migrants have tried to board slow-moving or queuing UK-bound vehicles, forcing some drivers to take long detours to avoid Calais.
In a letter to the prime minister, David Cameron, the Freight Transport Association (FTA) said the death highlighted the need for urgent action.
David Wells, the FTA chief executive, said: It is a tragedy that the deplorable situation in Calais has resulted in a fatality, but it was clear that the issue at the port was spiralling out of control. We have been calling on the British and French governments to intervene for some time, and are now asking the prime minister to give the matter his urgent priority and implement plans to alleviate the crisis.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has called for the deployment of the French military to boost security in Calais. The Fresh Produce Consortium estimates that 10m-worth of fresh fruit and vegetables has been thrown away since the start of the year because of the problems in Calais.
Port of Dover officials said last weeks ferry strike cost the UK economy 1bn. They have joined calls for robust contingency plans to be introduced to ensure the port works smoothly.
Theresa May, the home secretary, and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, agreed last week to increase the joint intervention fund to improve security around the port and the Channel tunnel. They said they would rush through the improvement work, including measures to prevent access to the Channel tunnel.

        <title>Donald Trump: Mexican migrants bring 'tremendous infectious disease' to US</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/donald-trump-mexican-immigrants-tremendous-infectious-disease</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Related: Divided Mexico unites against Trump: 'He has no respect for human beings'
The would-be president and billionaire businessman, who has already branded Mexican immigrants to the US as criminals, drug dealers and rapists, accused the Mexican government of forcing their most unwanted people into the United States which has become a dumping ground for Mexico.
The worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government, Trump said in a statement he released on Monday, which criticised the media for deliberately distorting his earlier remarks .
The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The border patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.
Trump, who has lost several business deals as a result of his comments about Mexico , said his previous remarks  Theyre bringing drugs, theyre bringing crime, theyre rapists  could not have been simpler or more accurately stated.
The Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc, Trump said. This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a five time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didnt want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States. In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government.
Trump went on to accuse Mexico of wanting an open border with the US but only as long as its a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.
He attempted to temper his comments by saying that as well as the criminal immigrants, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it.
I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans  many of them are working for and with me ... and, just like our country, my organization is better for it, he said. I have great respect for Mexico and I love their people and their peoples great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours.
Trump said his message to citizens of the United States was that the Mexican government is not our friend.
Trumps statement is full of highly questionable assertions however, starting with the idea that immigrants are flowing unchecked over the Mexico border. Data from both the US and Mexican governments shows that net immigration has actually been steadily falling in recent years.
The idea that the Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States also seems to have little basis in reality: in the past year a crackdown by Mexican forces has dramatically reduced the flow of migrants into the US.
Meanwhile, migration experts often stress that the migrants prepared to take the considerable risks of heading north tend to be among the most determined, hard-working and ambitious family members.
Nor is there much evidence to back Trumps assertion that the Mexican government wants a one-way border into the United States. President Enrique Pea Nietos government is frequently criticized in Mexico for doing very little to push for a relaxation of the border or lobby for the rights of Mexican immigrants. The only major migration-related initiative attributed to the government in an effort to achieve such goals is the allegation that it is cracking down on Central American migrants in transit through Mexico in order to get privileges for Mexicans.
Trump said he lost a lot during the presidential run defending the people of the United States including deals with department store Macys, NBC, Univision and a host of other TV networks and sports organisations including Nascar. Macys, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country, he said.
This past weekend, the former Apprentice star said that while the outcry may have hurt him financially, his open criticism was helping his cause as voters agreed with him. I believe in punching back. You know I dont think theyve [the media] treated me fairly, he said on Fox News Sunday. A while ago they said hes never going to run, hes never going to run.
Then I ran. Then they said, Hes never going to file his papers. Then I filed my papers. Now they dont know what to say. Now, all of the sudden, I get these really big poll numbers. And, theyre really good. Although I think theyre going to go higher because I really think people agree with what I say about the border and just agree with me, period.
In several recent polls Trump was behind only Jeb Bush in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

Billions in gas projects stranded by climate change action, says thinktank
Carbon Tracker report reveals keeping to emissions targets would render obsolete more than $280bn worth of global liquefied natural gas projects

More than $280bn (180bn) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects being planned over the next decade risk becoming stranded if global action is taken to limit climate change to 2C, according to a report by the thinktank Carbon Tracker .
LNG projects allow gas to be compressed into tankers and sold around the world, making it key to hopes in the US, Canada and Australia of fully exploiting their gas reserves.
But the new analysis shows that if emissions are cut to keep global temperature rise below the internationally agreed target many LNG projects being considered will not be needed.
The report concludes that over the next 10 years $82bn of LNG plants in Canada would be surplus to requirements, $71bn in the US and $68bn in Australia, with the rest of the world, led by Russia and Indonesia, accounting for the remaining $59bn.
The analysis found Shells agreed takeover of BG makes it by far the biggest player in the market and $85bn of the combined companys potential LNG projects would not be needed.
Shell said it was only the biggest in LNG compared to oil majors, and no comparison had been with national oil companies.
The report is the latest to raise concerns that increasing action to cut carbon emissions, combined with falling renewable energy prices, will put some fossil fuel investments at risk. Carbon Tracker has pioneered this analysis, which has been backed by the Bank of England and the World Bank .
Investors should scrutinise the true potential for growth of LNG businesses over the next decade, said James Leaton, Carbon Trackers head of research. The current oversupply of LNG means there is already a pipeline of projects waiting to come on stream. It is not clear whether these will be needed and generate value for shareholders.
The Carbon Tracker report examined the LNG, North American and European gas markets in the light of scenarios produced by the International Energy Agency in which carbon emissions are cut to limit global warming. It ranked the future gas projects being considered by cost and found that those producing gas at over $10/mmBtu risked being stranded by an international crackdown on emissions.
Previous Carbon Tracker reports have shown that coal and oil use must decline in future decades to tackle climate change, potentially leaving $1tn of oil projects unable to make a return .
But gas, which produces fewer emissions when burned, could continue to grow to 2040, the new report finds. However, not all the planned projects could go ahead. The analysis finds that 16 of the worlds 20 biggest LNG companies are considering future major projects that are unlikely to be needed to meet gas demand to 2025 if climate change is tackled.
The golden age of gas once mooted by energy commentators has not arrived in most regions, the report states. With the costs of renewables falling, gas is already struggling to compete in some markets, or could be priced out soon in others. The shale gas revolution in the US has been the exception, but this has not been replicated in Europe where the swing has been from coal to renewables.
A spokeswoman for Shell said: At Shell, we believe that overall energy demand could double by 2050 driven by population growth and rising prosperity. The energy system is in long term transition as society looks to a lower carbon future, but peoples desire for a decent quality of life and less CO2 require both renewables and cleaner hydrocarbons such as natural gas and LNG to provide a full suite of energy products, from power to plastics.
Natural gas  methane  is a potent greenhouse gas and the fuel is only cleaner than coal if leaks of methane are kept low. Stopping these fugitive emissions should therefore be a priority for the industry, says the report. It adds: At the gas prices in our scenarios, capturing this lost product should more than pay for itself, so there is little excuse for not dealing with the problem.
The report does not expect fracking to be significant source of gas in the UK in the next decade. The economics shows UK unconventional supply will struggle to compete in the gas market over the next decade, and shale gas could only contribute a tiny volume if projects do go ahead, concluded Andrew Grant, lead analyst at Carbon Tracker.

Pope Francis has used his first mass in Ecuador to ask for support in his efforts to reach out to Catholics who feel shunned by the Church when the worlds bishops gather at the Vatican in October.
Speaking to 800,000 people on the first leg of his homecoming tour of South America, the 78-year-old pope weaved his homily around the theme of the family, which will be the subject of the monthlong synod at the Vatican .
The meeting is expected to discuss ways to reach out to Catholics who have divorced and remarried outside the Church. Under current rules, they are prohibited from receiving communion unless they abstain from sexual relations.

The gathering is also expected to discuss how the Church should reach out to homosexual Catholics.
The pope said the synod would consider concrete solutions to the many difficult and significant challenges facing families in our time.
He asked for prayers for the synod so that God can take even what might seem to us impure, scandalous or threatening and turn it ... into a miracle. The family today is in need of a miracle.
Conservative bishops oppose any changes regarding the divorced and remarried. At a preparatory meeting last year they botched conciliatory language on the pastoral care of gay couples.
Asked about the popes words on the synod, the Vatican spokesman said Francis was not referring to specific controversies but that he wanted the synod to find ways to help people move from a situation of sin to a situation of grace.
The Argentine-born pontiff delivered his remarks in Ecuadors second city Guayaquil, a steamy port sometimes referred to as the worlds banana capital.
In line with his simple style, Francis rode into the city in a small silver Fiat marked for the occasion with Vatican City number plates  SCV 1  standing for Stato della Citta del Vaticano or State of Vatican City.
Tens of thousands of people lined the route from the airport , at times rushing police to touch the car and throw flower petals before it.
His eyes often squinting in the sun, Francis switched to an open jeep when he reached the sprawling mass site and rode though the crowd, which authorities estimated at about 800,000.
Ive come to this spiritual encounter to ask the pope to heal me because I have cancer, said Franklin Borbor, 48, who despite his illness traveled more than five hours to find his place in the park.
Others came from as far away as Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico.
In his homily, the pope also called for a rekindling of family values and solidarity with the elderly, the abandoned and the unemployed.
How many of our adolescents and young people sense that (love and happiness) are no longer found in their homes? How many women, sad and lonely, wonder when love left, when it slipped away from their lives? How many elderly people feel left out of family celebrations, cast aside and longing each day for a little love? he said.
He said the family was the best social capital and could not be replaced by other institutions.
After the mass, Francis went to a Jesuit-run school to visit an old friend he has not seen in three decades, the cigar-smoking reverend Francisco Cortes.
When he was a seminary director in Argentina, Francis, then Father Jorge Bergoglio, would send seminarians to the school to study theology with Cortes, now a diminutive 91-year-old Spaniard affectionately known as Father Paquito.
The popes visit to Guayaquil took on extra significance for Ecuador , and its leftist President Rafael Correa, given it has been the epicenter of anti-government protests for weeks.
Francis was to hold talks with Correa later on Monday.
Thousands have been taking to the streets in Guayaquil and elsewhere to protest tax changes and what they see as state authoritarianism. Correa says the reforms will only affect the super-wealthy and accuses his foes of seeking a coup detat.
Protest leaders have called a truce during the papal visit.
The popes coming is putting a bit of peace in the hearts of we Ecuadoreans, said Jose Paldarreaga, 64, a participant at the mass in Guayaquil.
After Ecuador, the pope visits Bolivia and Paraguay on a tour encompassing three of the poorest and smallest countries in South America. The pope visited Brazil for a youth festival in 2013 but that was to substitute for predecessor Benedict after his sudden resignation.

This broader challenge of countering violent extremism is not simply a military effort, Obama said in remarks from the Pentagon on Monday. Ideologies are not defeated by guns. Theyre defeated with better ideas  a more attractive and more compelling vision.
This larger battle for hearts and minds is going to be a generational struggle, he added. Its ultimately not going to be won or lost by the United States alone. It will be decided by the countries and communities that terrorists like Isil [an alternative acronym for Islamic State/Isis] target.
Obamas remarks followed a rare visit by the commander-in-chief to the Pentagon, where he was briefed by top national security and military officials on the ongoing US campaign against the Islamic State. The meeting also came after the United States was placed on high alert over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, amid repeated warnings of Isis-inspired attacks that did not materialize.

Obama acknowledged the threat posed by lone wolf terrorists, citing an attack in May when two gunmen opened fire outside a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Texas. The incident, for which Isis claimed responsibility but to which it has not been directly linked, was evidence that militant groups have successfully convinced vulnerable people both in the US and around the world to join their fight, Obama said.
Numerous individuals have been arrested across the country for plotting attacks inspired by Isis or attempting to join the group in Syria or Iraq, he added, while still pointing out that improvements to homeland security have successfully prevented another large-scale 9/11-style event.
The threat of lone wolves or small cells of terrorists is complex, its harder to detect and harder to prevent, Obama said. That means that were going to have to pick up our game to prevent these attacks.
To meet that objective, the president said the US government will step up efforts to counter Isis propaganda online and partner with Muslim communities who must reject the groups warped interpretations of Islam and the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks.
Obama also criticized the Republican-led US Senate for failing to confirm Adam Szubin, the presidents nominee to serve as undersecretary at the Treasury Department. If confirmed, Szubin would play a leading role in cracking down on illicit funding to groups like Isis.
Earlier on Monday, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, lamented that Republicans had refused thus far to hold even a hearing, let alone a vote, on Szubins confirmation even though Obama nominated him in April.
Although he did not lay out a shift in his administrations strategy against Isis, Obama pledged to do more to train and equip moderate rebel forces in Syria. Responding to a question, the president also said there are no current plans to send additional US troops overseas but said he would do whatevers necessary to protect our homeland.

The possibility exists that Edward Snowden could make a deal with the US Justice Department and return to his home country, former US attorney general Eric Holder says.
Asked by Yahoo News in a Monday interview if the Justice Department might be open to a plea bargain that let the NSA whistleblower come back from Moscow, Holder said: I certainly think there could be a basis for a resolution that everybody could ultimately be satisfied with. I think the possibility exists.
The former attorney general, who left the Obama administration in April, also said that Snowdens revelations to the Guardian and the Washington Post of mass US and UK surveillance had spurred a necessary debate.
We are in a different place as a result of the Snowden disclosures, Holder said.
Holder, who has returned to Washington law firm Covington &amp; Burling, has previously said the US would be willing to engage in conversation with Snowden about returning to face charges, but the new comments appear to go slightly further.
But a spokeswoman for Loretta Lynch, Holders replacement, told Yahoo News the Obama administrations position had not changed. This is an ongoing case so I am not going to get into specific details but I can say our position regarding bringing Edward Snowden back to the United States to face charges has not changed, Melanie Newman said in an email.

Scott Walker's response on gay marriage may alienate donors and his own sons

None of the 16 declared or likely Republican presidential candidates came out in favour of the supreme courts ruling backing gay marriage last month, but one candidate stood out for the stridency of his opposition: Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin.
Calling the ruling a grave mistake, Walker issued a bristling statement that picked a fight not only with the decision but with the supreme court as an institution, dismissing the majority as five unelected judges with political agendas.
It is comments like these that have made Walker such an exciting potential candidate for conservative donors who have watched his struggle in Wisconsin against public-sector unions with admiration. Walker, who is expected to launch his presidential campaign next week, does not just use fighting words. He has shown that he means what he says  and is willing to draw blood.
As such Walker can be divisive, and on this issue he has proven himself so even among his own family.
Both of Walkers sons challenged their father after the supreme court ruling, according to Walkers wife, Tonette Walker, who spoke with the Washington Post in a revealing interview published at the weekend. She said she herself was torn over the issue.
That was a hard one, Tonette Walker said of the same-sex marriage ruling. Our sons were disappointed  I was torn. I have children who are very passionate, and Scott was on his side very passionate.
Its hard for me because I have a cousin who I love dearly  she is like a sister to me  who is married to a woman, her partner of 18 years.
The Republican party has a long history , from former vice-president Dick Cheney to senators Rob Portman and Jeff Flake to former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, of politicians kids leading their parents on marriage equality. The phenomenon reflects a generational gap on the issue.
For Walker the issue is especially loaded, however, because it represents more than a family conflict. It points to a key challenge as he seeks to expand his regional base in the northern midwest: will he prove versatile enough on the campaign trail to appeal to people who were not born agreeing with him?
The country has left Walker  and the rest of the Republican leadership  behind on marriage equality, with a record 60% of Americans now in favor, according to a Gallup survey from before the recent supreme court ruling.
The two Republican candidates who are demonstrating, at this very early stage, the broadest national appeal subtly bowed to those numbers in their responses last month to the Obergefell v Hodges ruling, going out of their way not to pick a fight.
Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and brother of former president George W Bush, said that we should love our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments.
Marco Rubio, the current Florida senator, included a line about how every American has the right to pursue happiness as they see fit.
Walker, by contrast, called for the extraordinary step of amending the US constitution  something that has happened only twice since the civil rights era of the mid-1960s  to block gay marriage, saying that an amendment was the only alternative left for the American people.
That intransigence could add up to difficulty with donors for Walker, too, according to reporting by Politico. The Wisconsin governor enjoys a regional base of support in the wealthy Koch and Ricketts families, big donors who share an enthusiasm for Walkers fiscal purity. But Walker has failed to gain comparable traction among influential Republican donors on Wall Street, who are skeptical about his moral purity.
There are signs that Walker may yet modulate his message. He told the Post that his familys input on marriage equality had encouraged him to find a different way of explaining it, so they can appreciate where I am coming from.
He added: It doesnt mean I change my position.

A girl aged about 13 was killed when explosives strapped to her body went off near a major mosque in northern Nigerias largest city Kano, police said, adding that no one else was caught up in the blast.
Kano police spokesman Musa Magaji Majia said on Monday that the explosion occurred at a roundabout, about 200 metres from the Umar bin Khattab mosque, where worshippers had gathered for prayers.
She blew up killing herself. Nobody else was hurt in the incident, he said of the blast, which happened at about 9:00 pm.
Police bomb squad officers were deployed to the scene to ensure there were no other explosives left nearby, he added.
A police source added: Its very likely the mosque was her target, but the explosives went off prematurely.
Boko Haram militants have increasingly used young girls and women as human bombs in their six-year insurgency to establish a hardline Islamic state in north-east Nigeria.
On Sunday night, rebel fighters fired shots and a rocket-propelled grenade at a mosque as part of a twin assault on the central city of Jos, which killed at least 44 people .
Earlier in the day, five people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a church in the north-eastern city of Potiskum.
Indiscriminate targeting of civilians, both Muslim and Christian alike, has been a feature of the rebellion, which has so far claimed at least 15,000 lives and left more than 1.5 million others homeless.

After receiving the report, the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said a further inquiry or investigation would be necessary to finally establish the facts surrounding the mysterious crash more than 50 years ago.
The panel found new information, which it assessed as having moderate probative value, sufficient to further pursue aerial attack or other interference as a hypothesis of the possible cause of the crash, said UN spokesman Farhan Haq.
The answers may lie in classified documents from the United States and Britain that the panel was unable to consult, despite requests for access.
Ban said he would follow up on the requests.
The UNs second secretary-general, Hammarskjld died when his plane crashed on 17 or 18 September 1961 near Ndola, in Northern Rhodesia, now known as Zambia.
The 56-year-old Swedish diplomat was on his way to negotiate a ceasefire for mining-rich Katanga province in what was then the Republic of the Congo, which had proclaimed independence from Belgium.
The three-person panel spoke to witnesses in Zambia who testified that there was more than one aircraft in the air when the plane made its approach to Ndola, or that the plane was on fire before it hit the ground.

These accounts seemed to corroborate information contained in a 2013 report by a separate commission that concluded that there was  convincing evidence  that the plane was shot down as it prepared to land.
A former US air force security officer, Paul Abram, told the panel that he heard transmissions about the shooting down of an aircraft near Congo while serving at a National Security Agency listening post in Greece.
The panel said it could not authenticate Abrams claims.
The US government wrote in a letter to the panel last month that a search had not revealed any documents on radio transmissions but added that other files classified as top secret from the National Security Agency would not be released.
Among the new information uncovered by the panel was a declassified report from a senior British diplomat to a secret service agent, Neil Ritchie, who details how he helped the Katanga leader Moise Tshombe travel to Ndola for his meeting with Hammarskjld.
The report did not mention the possible crash but its existence and content serves as new information about the presence of the British intelligence agency in the area, said the UN panel.
The British government responded last month in a letter to the panel that it would not be able to provide more information on the case due to security concerns.
The UN General Assembly in late December adopted a resolution, drafted by Sweden, that called for the new investigation to finally shed light on the top diplomats death.
Led by the Tanzanian prosecutor Mohamed Chande Othman, the panel also included Kerryn Macaulay of Australia and Henrik Larsen of Denmark.

South Carolina lawmakers take first step to remove Confederate flag

South Carolinas state senate has voted to take down the Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds in Columbia, the first of several steps needed for it to eventually be removed.
State senators voted 37-3 on Monday in favor of removing the flag from a memorial on the capitol grounds, but the bill must go for a third and final reading before it can go before the house, where it must pass by a two-thirds vote before heading to the governor.
The third reading is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, said lieutenant governor Henry McMaster.
The push to take down the flag became more urgent for activists after a 21-year-old man killed nine black people in a Charleston church. Days after the killing, images emerged of him posing next to a Confederate flag, a symbol of the part of the United States that seceded in response to the Unions decision to make slavery illegal.
One of the victims, Clementa Pinckney, worked inside the statehouse building as a senator.
State senator Vincent Sheheen, a Democrat and friend of Pinckneys, has wanted the flag to be taken down for several years and introduced the latest bill. On the senate floor on Monday, Sheheen said removing the flag is one small step that reduces the culture of division.
 Vincent Sheheen (@vincentsheheen) July 6, 2015
Thankful the SC Senate overwhelming voted to pass my bill to retire the #ConfederateFlag from SH grounds. I pray for unity in our state.
Senate Republican leader Harvey Peeler said that he would oppose the bill to remove the flag, saying that his ancestors owned slaves and that taking down the flag cannot change that history. With fellow Republicans Lee Bright and Danny Verdin, he was one of three senators to vote against the bill.
The reverend Jesse Jackson, who was born in the state, was in the senate chamber on Monday for the discussion. He pushed for protests against the flag in 2000, when it was flying atop South Carolinas statehouse. It was moved that year to its current position at a civil war memorial on the building grounds.
This move means that the flag can only be taken down with two-thirds support from the legislature. Governor Nikki Haley cannot force its removal unilaterally, though she has said she believes it should be taken down.
I dont think that this is going to be easy. I dont think that its going to be painless, Haley said on NBCs Today show. But I do think that it will be respectful, and that it will move swiftly.
Earlier in Mondays session, Republican state senator Lee Bright introduced an amendment that would allow voters to decide whether it should be displayed at the statehouse. His bill was tabled with a 36-3 vote, as was a bill to have it flown only on Confederate memorial day and to replace the flag with the first national flag of the Confederate States of America, which was the Confederacys official flag from 1861 to 1863 .
Bright said he opposes taking the flag down because it associates the souths history with the act of the killer.
I am more against taking it down in this environment than any other time, Bright said. Were placing blame on what one deranged lunatic did on people who hold their southern heritage high, and I dont think thats fair.

A Saudi air strike appears to have struck a livestock market in southern Yemen , killing more than 40 people  one of the deadliest bombings of a campaign that has now lasted three months.
The blast happened while civilians were trading in the market in the Fayyoush district of Lahj province. The Associated Press reported that the death toll was at least 45, with more than 50 wounded.
I came right after the explosion and saw dozens of dead strewn about and a sea of blood, while the wounded were being evacuated to nearby hospitals, resident Abu-Ali al-Azibi told the AP. [There was] blood from people mixed with that of the sheep and other livestock at the market.
A Saudi-led coalition launched an air offensive in March after Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran, took control of Yemens capital, Sanaa, and moved on the city of Aden to the south, forcing the Saudi-backed president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.
That month, more than two dozen people died in an attack on a refugee camp and 46 people were killed and hundreds wounded in a raid in April on the Faj Attan district in Sanaa.
More than 3,000 people have been killed and 14,300 wounded in Yemen since the war began.
The air campaign has had limited success and instead has plunged Yemen into a humanitarian crisis with food, fuel and medical shortages. Last week, the UN declared Yemen a level-three emergency, its most dire rating, placing it on par with Syria. It estimates that a million people been displaced since March.

Two leading human rights watchdogs said the Saudi-led coalition was failing to adhere to international law and was not taking the necessary precautions to prevent civilian casualties.
The cases we have analysed point to a pattern of attacks destroying civilian homes and resulting in scores of civilian deaths and injuries, said Donatella Rovera, a senior adviser at Amnesty International, in a statement last week following an investigation into eight attacks by the coalition.
There is no indication that the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition has done anything to prevent and redress such violations, she said.
Human Rights Watch said it had documented a series of apparently unlawful air strikes on the Houthis home province of Saada, including on residential houses, markets, a school and a petrol station.
The coalitions aerial bombing of Saada killed dozens of civilians, devastating entire families, said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and north Africa director at HRW, last week. These attacks appear to be serious laws-of-war violations that need to be properly investigated.

A convicted armed robber managed to escape from one of Iowas most highly secure prison cells by sneaking through the buildings piping on to the roof and guiding himself to the ground with a makeshift rope, authorities said on Monday.
Justin Kestner, 25, escaped early on Sunday from a cell in the A-Pod unit at the Iowa state penitentiary in Fort Madison, which houses some of the states most difficult prisoners.
This is an individual that I think was pretty ingenious in what he came up with, Governor Terry Branstad said.
Kestner was captured several hours later, about 100 miles away, near Geneseo, Illinois. He is suspected of stealing a car in Wever, Iowa, just miles from the prison, and abandoning it near Geneseo, prompting a resident to call authorities. An Illinois trooper found Kestner walking a mile from the vehicle on the side of Highway 82, near Interstate 80. Kestner fled into a cornfield but surrendered without incident after the trooper called for him.
The A-Pod is a unit where inmates are typically confined to locked cells 23 hours a day and are searched, handcuffed and escorted whenever they leave. The unit is for maximum-security inmates with housing restrictions such as Kestner, who had been sentenced by a prison judge last month to one year of detention for assaulting a correctional officer and other rules violations.
Kestner took advantage of the fact that cells in the unit have their own showers  a security feature designed to cut down on offenders interactions with guards and other inmates.
In his cell shower, Kestner removed the screws from an access cover that led to a pipe chase  an enclosed space that houses the prisons pipes, authorities said. Kestner managed to maneuver himself up the chase and through a vent to the roof  crawling through a very narrow area thats supposed to be too small for someone to crawl through, Branstad said.
The governor said Kestners makeshift rope was manufactured by tying together some 67 feet of bed sheets. He then guided himself down to an unfenced part of the prison grounds and fled.
Investigators do not think Kestner had any help from staff, a penitentiary spokeswoman, Rebecca Bowker, said.
Lawmakers said the escape raised security questions at the prison along the Mississippi river, which has a history dating back to 1839. Most of the prison is expected to close later this year as roughly 500 inmates get transferred a mile away to the new penitentiary  a huge undertaking that will involve local, state and federal officers.
This close to a transfer, we cannot be having escaped convicts. Thats just unacceptable, said state representative Bobby Kaufmann, a Wilton Republican who led an investigation into construction problems at the new $166m prison that was initially scheduled to open last year.
He worries that Kestners prison break  and last months escape of two killers from a New York prison  will potentially embolden other inmates to raise trouble when the time comes to move.
Kestner was serving a 20-year sentence he received in 2009 for robbing two gas stations in Sioux City, with a projected release date of 2019 before the escape. He was returned to the prison on Sunday evening and is expected to face escape-related charges.
On 25 June, a prison judge gave Kestner a term of disciplinary detention of one year and took away one year of earned time for assaulting the officer during a transport  the maximum penalty for serious or dangerous violence under prison policy.
Kestners cell was in a newer building at the prison complex, which was completed in 2001 and originally designed to house mentally ill offenders. Last year, the prison transferred most of those inmates elsewhere and converted part of the building to a minimum-security prison. But the building kept the highly secure A-Pod unit.
Im flabbergasted that anyone could have gotten out of there, said former building administrator Heather Brueck.

Chinas stock market collapse, which has knocked almost a third off share values since June, appeared to have been stemmed on Monday after Beijing authorities orchestrated a massive spending spree by Chinese financial institutions to bolster the market.
The Shanghai Composite Index initially bounced more than 10%, after more than 20 major stockbrokers and fund managers pledged to pump at least 120bn yuan (12.3bn) into the market and started hoovering up shares in some of the countrys largest businesses.
But hopes of a major turnaround in the fortunes of the Shanghai exchange were dashed after much of that initial rise was lost as small investors continued to panic over the safety of their investments. The final gain was 2.4%.
More than 2tn has been wiped off the value of Chinese-listed companies since 12 June, when concerns about a stock market bubble gripped investors and triggered a bout of panic selling.
Chinas stock markets had previously been among the top performing in the world, and had hit a seven-year peak in the middle of June. The Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months, but it has fallen 30% over the past three weeks  including a plunge of 12% last week.
There will be some fluctuation, but more money put into the market  I think it will be helpful to keep it steady
Shao Yu
State media reported over the weekend that the Chinese government, along with the securities regulator and financial institutions, had launched a joint effort to prevent more losses.
Most of the funds were pumped into banks and state companies, which saw their value soar. Shares in PetroChina, Asias biggest oil producer, rose by up to 10% following the move.
New share offerings were also suspended on orders of the state council. Twenty-eight Chinese companies with permission to float on the Shanghai exchange said that they would postpone further issues of shares.
Meanwhile, the Peoples Bank of China made a commitment to provide liquidity for China Securities Finance Corp, a state-owned company that provides insurance to cover stock market dealing.
China stock market value
Some analysts seemed confident the actions would have a positive impact on Chinas stock markets.
Shao Yu, chief economist with Orient Securities said the actions taken were clever. I think it will stabilise the market. Of course there will be some fluctuation, but more and more money put into the market  I think it will be helpful to keep the market steady, he said.
However, Shao added that he did not expect the market to reach the heights it had previously.
Previous efforts to keep share prices from falling, including interest rate cuts and plans to investigate short sellers, proved unsuccessful.
Oliver Barron, China policy research analyst at broker NSBO, said the selloff posed profound questions for the government. After the market continued to fall, despite myriad support measures, the government reached peak panic mode and must have worried that investors would not only lose confidence in the markets, but in the government itself, he said.
Chinas stock market is made up of mostly individual investors, rather than institutional investors. Almost 90 million people hold shares and up to 1.4 million new investors a week have been opening stock accounts. According to media estimates, the average loss of individual stock accounts has been about 420,000 yuan (43,000).
Meanwhile, a man has been detained by police in Beijing for allegedly spreading a rumour that someone had committed suicide due to the stock market slump.
The 29-year-old man, a project manager with a technology company, posted the information along with video clips and screenshots, according to the state news agency Xinhua. His post quickly spread and provoked a lot of online debate, particularly among those who had invested on the stock market.

        <title>Spain's politicians distance themselves from euro crisis: 'This isn't Greece'</title>

For the past year, they have positioned themselves as allied agents of a change sweeping across southern Europe .
On the face of it, Spains leftwing anti-austerity Podemos party should have been crowing at the landslide victory of the no vote in Sundays Greek referendum. But while Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias was quick to praise Syriza and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras , his overriding message was a simple one  Spain is not Greece.
With a general election due in Spain by the end of the year, Iglesias, whose party made substantial gains in local elections earlier this year, was careful to mark the differences between the two countries, worried, analysts said, that any worsening of the situation in Greece could drive crucial middle-class voters away from his party.

We have a great friendship with Syriza, but luckily, Spain is not Greece, Iglesias told radio Cadena Ser. Were an economy with much more weight in the eurozone, were a country with a stronger administration and with a better economic situation. The circumstance are different and I think it makes no sense to draw parallels.
Instead, Iglesias framed the referendum as a step forward for democracy in that the Greek people had finally been handed the power to decide on austerity measures. Its good news for Europeans and Greek citizens, said Iglesias. The people of Greece have said they want change, they support a government who says that things can be done in a different way.
The referendum was a clear success for Tsipras, said political scientist Fernando Vallespn from Madrids Autonomous University. The automatic assumption is that what is good for Tsipras is good for Podemos, he said, but he feels it is too early to say whether that is the case, pointing to the efforts made by Iglesias to distance Spain from Greece. I think Podemos is worried that the situation in Greece wont get better.
Reinforcing the differences between the countries dampens the idea of contagion, he said, and maintains the partys appeal to moderate voters. The latest polls show Podemos is in a virtual tie with the governing Peoples party and opposition Socialists.
Podemos must walk a fine line when it comes to Greece, said Jos Ignacio Torreblanca, the author of Asaltar Los Cielos, or Storm the Heavens, which explores the rise of Podemos. On one hand its good news for them, because the message of the people having voted against austerity strengthens their message. The frame for them is fantastic because its the people against the troika, David against Goliath and the weak against the powerful, he said.
The challenge, however, is then to distance themselves from any bad news emerging from Greece. This is where the space opens for the Peoples party and others to point to issues such as the queues for cash machine withdrawals. All of the parties have been trying to use Greece to their advantage.
On Monday, the governing Peoples party pointed to the referendum to justify their decision to impose austerity measures during the height of the economic crisis. Fortunately Spain has a prime minister who said no to the bailout and instead undertook reforms, PP vice-president Fernando Martnez-Maillo told broadcaster Radio Nacional de Espaa. The alternative, he said, would look like Greece does today. Thanks to those reforms  were in a situation of economic growth and job creation.
While Greece was forced to accept a series of bailouts amounting to 240bn, Spain drew on 41bn-worth of EU funds to rescue its banking sector and exited from the programme last year. The Spanish economy has seen seven quarters of economic growth, but inequality is rampant and the countrys unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, at 23.8%, the highest in the EU after Greece.
Spains finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said that although the no vote made the situation more complex, Spain was absolutely not contemplating a Greek exit from the euro.
Greeces creditors had not handled the crisis perfectly, he said, but the onus was now on Greece to enact reforms. I think there were mistakes on the part of the troika, but it is inevitable that Greece implements reforms because there have been nations that have done them and they are emerging from the crisis.
The Spanish government is open to negotiations for a third rescue package, he said. Given the circumstances, from the point of view of the markets, it is absolutely necessary.
His remarks were a backing down from the hardline position taken by Mariano Rajoy , Spains prime minister, who last week said that it would be good for Greece if Tsipras lost the referendum. If he wins the referendum, Greece has no other alternative other than to leave the euro, Rajoy told Cope radio station on Tuesday.
How the Greek situation will play out in Spain hinges on what happens in the coming days, said Torreblanca. If Tsipras manages to sit down with creditors and obtain an additional packages of concessions, then its great for Podemos, he said. Its a bit early to say because right now we dont know what the final act of all this will be  whether its a drama, tragedy or something else.

Post-sanctions Iran 'could be the best emerging market for years to come'
Iranian businesses eye the trade that ending sanctions would bring, but say: dont expect a Russia-style gold rush  we already have a free market

Hamid Mohammadi is excited at the prospect of international sanctions on Iran being lifted once a nuclear agreement has been signed. But hes not that excited. The CEO of the Islamic republics equivalent of Amazon is certainly looking forward to being re-connected to the outside world  vital for a fast-growing company at the cutting edge of digital innovation. Still, ending sanctions will not be a miracle cure for the countrys economic ills.
Digikala, launched with three employees in 2007, will have 1,500 by the years end as its slick Farsi-language online shopping service expands. It symbolises the energy of a young generation of wired and entrepreneurial Iranians who have built a domestic market from scratch and prospered despite international isolation. It guarantees deliveries within four hours in Tehran and its site boasts a whopping 750,000 unique visitors a day.
Culturally, the company is a world away from the dour image form which Iran suffers. Its recent iftar  the evening meal breaking the Ramadan fast  for staff and their families blended western corporate style with speeches, an MC and a live band; there was barely a beard and no turbans in sight. Headscarves were extremely loose, female fashion elegant.
Digikala is also an investors fantasy. Yes, we have problems related to sanctions, like the lack of foreign investment, Mohammadi explained at the companys warehouse near the capital. And Iranian banks and investors dont see e-commerce as having a good future. We need access to technology and to partners. The Koreans and Chinese ignore the sanctions, but when they are lifted we expect to see European and American brands.

Mohammadis view of the benefits to the most successful start-up in Iran is widely shared by fellow businessmen. After sanctions the governments behaviour will change, he predicts. There will be more discipline and more professional behaviour. There are many weird and useless rules here. If more foreign companies come then the general economic environment will be better.
Prospects for recovery occupy as much space in the Iranian media as the chances of reaching a deal in the P5 + 1 nuclear negotiations in Vienna , which are due to end by Tuesday. Things are already looking up. The economy rebounded out of recession and grew 2.8% in 2014, President Hassan Rouhanis first year in office. The IMF predicts growth of 0.6% and 1.3% in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Inflation is down from 45% under the reckless and profligate former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to 15% today.
Expectations are high in the energy sector  the source of 35% of government revenues. Oil exports have halved since 2012 though the deputy oil minister said on Sunday that they could almost double when sanctions are lifted. We are like a pilot on the runway ready to take off, a bullish Mansour Moazami told the Wall Street Journal . This is how the whole country is right now.
Oil matters. But Irans economy is far more diverse than that of Saudi Arabia, its great rival in the region. It is the worlds largest exporter of cement, as well as pistachios, saffron and caviar. Shipping is another big earner. State-owned Iran Shipping Lines has been badly hit by sanctions and stands to benefit significantly when they go, analysts say.
The single most urgent change business wants is the end to the ban on bank transfers under the international Swift system. That has been the biggest blow, said Rouzbeh Pirouz, chair of Turquoise Partners. But its not just that. Iranian companies have had difficulty trading and participating in global markets.
Yet interest from European countries has grown exponentially since the interim nuclear agreement was signed in Lausanne in April. Irans financial sector, food and beauty products are of special interest, he added. And French investors are looking closely at investment in hotels in the expectation of a leap forward in tourism.
Hardliners who fret about the implications of a nuclear deal involving the US, the old great Satan, take comfort from the fact that Irans biggest trading partner is now China (25%), followed by Iraq, the UAE, Korea, Turkey and India.
A lot of western media propagate the myth that our economy will collapse if there is no agreement in Vienna, argues Foad Ezzadi, an academic and principalist in the local political lexicon. But sanctions will collapse if there is no deal because a lot of companies are waiting to get into the Iranian market.

If there is an agreement, there will be plenty of business opportunities, but no bonanza for foreigners. We are ready to use the potential of foreign investment, said banker Majid Zamani. But this is not Russia in the 1990s. Some people make it sound like a gold rush. There wont be one because there is already a free market and free trade here. For people who want to add value Iran is the place to be. It could be the best emerging market for years to come.
What is true for a growing giant like Digikala is true for traders in Tehrans legendary and famously conservative bazaar. I am optimistic about the future, beamed Mostafa, surveying his little stationery shop in one of the labyrinth of alleys around the Masjid Shah (Shah mosque  still referred to thus despite having being renamed Masjid Khomeini long ago). If sanctions end people will be in a better mood and buy more. And if the dollar is reasonably stable, we can buy the paper we import from Indonesia at a decent price.
On all sides there is a recognition of the clear link between resolving the nuclear issue and economic prosperity. In business we talk about win-win, quipped Saeed Rahmani, founder of Sarava Pars venture capital and chairman of the Digikala board. Countries are no different.
Yet many fear that hopes of improvement are too high: There is probably an inflated view of the impact of a deal and of sanctions removal, said Pirouz. The buildup has been so long in coming and the anticipation so great that people have exaggerated expectations of what removal will achieve. The real question is whether this will be a Deng Xiaoping moment  whether the Iranian government will use this opportunity to really open up to the world and integrate into the global economy. If they are willing to take that leap it could potentially be a very exciting time.

President Robert Mugabe moved Zimbabwes information minister, who he branded a devil incarnate last year, to an education department role in his second cabinet reshuffle since December.
On Monday, the minister of information, Jonathan Moyo  whom Mugabe says appointed opposition sympathisers as editors of state-owned newspapers, was to be minister of higher and tertiary education  the secretary to the president and cabinet told reporters.
Misheck Sibanda did not give a reason for the changes, but said Mugabe had left the post of information minister vacant.
Mugabes seven cabinet changes included moving Kembo Mohadi, longtime minister in charge of homeland security, to the national state security ministry.
Ignatius Chombo, who ran the local government ministry for 15 years, takes over the homeland security ministry.
Savior Kasukuwere, one of the youngest ministers in Mugabes government at 44 years old, is the new minister of local government after serving at the ministry of water and environment since 2013.
Kasukuwere, nicknamed Tyson for his combative style, made his name as the enforcer of Mugabes black economic empowerment drive that is forcing foreign-owned companies to sell majority shares to black Zimbabweans.
In December, Mugabe fired his deputy of 10 years, Joice Mujuru, and several other ministers.

'We're a violent nation'  director tackles Spain's festival culture of animal cruelty
As tens of thousands flock to Pamplona for the annual running of the bulls, Miguel ngel Rolland explains why he made his documentary Santa Fiesta
Animal abuse film exposes dark side of Spanish festivals

It hurts me to say it but the Spanish are a savage, insensitive and ignorant people, says Miguel ngel Rolland. In his new documentary, the Spanish film-maker has chronicled some of the 16,000 religious festivals across Spain that he says involve the torture of animals.
Every year about 60,000 animals are killed during these festivals, often held in honour of a local saint or the Virgin Mary. Spanish identity is a local, rather than a national, affair and people are fiercely loyal to their town or village and the customs associated with it.
The best known festival is this weeks running of the bulls during the fiesta of San Fermn in Pamplona. Tens of thousands of people from all over the world flock to the small Navarra town each year for a week of partying that begins each day with six fighting bulls and six oxen being driven through the narrow streets to the bullring, where the bulls are killed in a series of bullfights.
The festival has attracted increasing criticism from animal rights groups  on Saturday activists from Peta staged a protest to draw attention to what they say is a week of fear and death for bulls.
The cruelties documented in Rollands film (warning: graphic scenes) include pulling the head off a goose and throwing a live turkey from a church tower, but the most abused animal by far is the bull.

He calculates that during the 1,868 festivals involving bulls last year, more than 11,000 were tortured and killed. Aside from bullfighting, which still attracts large numbers of spectators, there are village festivals such as the toro enmaromado (roped bull), held to celebrate Corpus Christi in Benavente, Zamora, central Spain. Here, a bull has a rope tied to its horns while dozens of men chase and drag it to the abattoir. It has been declared an event of regional tourist interest by the regional government of Castile and Len.Many other such fiestas enjoy legal protection.
In Dnia, Alicante, bulls are chased off a pier and then dragged out of the sea, and according to Rolland they often drown. In Villalpando, Zamora, a bull is pursued by cars. In Ohanes, Almera, the animal is tied up and forced to bow down eight times before the statue of a saint.
I never once saw anyone object. Everyone goes, they take their children. These cruel events have the churchs blessing
Miguel ngel Rolland
Three years ago, Catalonia banned bullfighting but the correbous, in which bulls are chased down the street, often with flaming brands fixed to their horns, remain popular and legal in the southern part of the region.
The really sad thing is I never once saw anyone object, says Rolland, who filmed his documentary, Santa Fiesta, almost entirely in secret and was occasionally run out of town when he was caught. Everyone goes, they take their children. These cruel events have the churchs blessing. In the Canaries at election time candidates will campaign by offering to supply more bulls for the fiesta.

The majority of these festivals are held in Andalusiaand Castile and Len, but there is no region in Spain where they dont exist.
We are a violent nation, he says, adding that my father is a big bullfight aficionado. He used to take us to the fiestas until I was old enough to say no.
The police often make themselves scarce during the festivals as some are now illegal. In 2002 the Andalusian government banned the fiesta in Cazalilla, in which a live turkey is thrown from the church tower. But the practice continues and each year the villagers club together to pay the 2,000 (1,450) fine. If they tried to stop the turkey throwing, people would riot, says Juan Balbn Garrido, the mayor.
Rolland reflects: In Spain about 200 animals are killed every day for entertainment. Thats eight terrible deaths every hour.

RSA to appeal against 1.25m employment tribunal payout
Sum awarded to former head of Irish subsidiary, who resigned following accounting discrepancies, creates dangerous precedent, says insurance group

Insurance company RSA has described the award of 1.25m (790,000) by an employment tribunal to the former head of its Irish business as astonishing as it launched an appeal against the potential payout.
Last month, an employment tribunal awarded the sum to Philip Smith, who resigned in November 2013 following accounting discrepancies that forced the insurance group to pump 200m into its Irish subsidiary .
RSA said it fundamentally disagreed with the judgment and was seeking redress through the courts. We are astonished by the amount of the award made by the tribunal, which RSA believes is utterly inconsistent with that crucial finding and creates a dangerous precedent, Derek Walsh, general counsel of RSA, said.
Smith had argued that he had not attempted to hide the way calculations were made about the possible claims the insurer could face and argued that the insurer had failed to listen to his side of the case. When he resigned, he had said he was the fall guy for the accounting problems that eventually led to the 200m shortfall.
Contrary to the impression given by the tribunal decision, no one at RSA group level had any prior knowledge of the inappropriate large loss reserving practices which emerged in RSA Ireland . RSA group would never have condoned such practices, said Walsh.
We continue to believe that Mr Smiths case is without merit and in the circumstances have no option but to appeal the judgment.

Police said on Monday there was no evidence of gunshots and no injuries reported after officers searched a 20-story tower at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington.
Montgomery County police said a 911 call reporting hearing a single shot inside Building 1, the original hospital on the campus in Bethesda, came from the tower on Monday morning.
Spokeswoman Natasha Plotnikov said police would now bring in dogs to search the building for explosives. She said people were still sheltering in place.
The navys website warned that the campus was on lockdown after a report of an active shooter.
Roads around the facility were closed for hours but later opened. Police and the navy tweeted that all patient care at the facility had been suspended for the day.
Local television coverage showed police cars parked by the building and people walking away from it. Helicopters were circling above.

Introduction: Leaders await new Greece proposals
Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the continuing eurozone crisis and the latest attempts to broker a deal between Greece and its creditors.
With time running out - to quote German Chancellor Angela Merkel - Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to present new proposals following his resounding victory in Sundays referendum.
Finance ministers will meet later to consider what Greece has put on the table, with European leaders discussing the situation in an emergency summit this evening. Heres Ian Traynors story looking at the prospects for a deal:
Germany and France scrambled to avoid a major split over Greece on Monday evening as the eurozone delivered a damning verdict on Alexis Tsiprass landslide referendum victory on Sunday and Angela Merkel demanded that the Greek prime minister put down new proposals to break the deadlock.
As concerns mount that Greek banks will run out of cash and about the damage being inflicted on the countrys economy, hopes for a breakthrough faded. EU leaders voiced despair and descended into recrimination over how to respond to Sundays overwhelming rejection of eurozone austerity terms as the price for keeping Greece in the currency.
Tsipras, meanwhile, moved to insure himself against purported eurozone plots to topple him and force regime change by engineering a national consensus of the countrys five mainstream parties behind his negotiating strategy, focused on securing debt relief.
Full story here:

One key participant will be new Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, appointed after the resignation of his colourful predecessor Yanis Varoufakis on Monday. Here is our profile of Tskalotos .
Meanwhile Greek banks will not reopen today after capital controls were extended until at least tomorrow. The European Central Bank put more pressure on the Greek system by tightening the rules for giving emergency funding. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:
[The ECB move} is likely to increase criticism that the central bank is getting involved in exerting political pressure and acting beyond its mandate of price stability, and as lender of last resort, which any credible central bank should do as a matter of course.
All the ECB has done is make it more likely that Greek banks will run out of money in a matter of days. Furthermore it remains highly unlikely that the Greek government will be able to make it to the next key payment deadline of 20th July when a 3.5bn bond to the ECB becomes repayable.
While the departure of the polarising Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is likely to mean that relations between the creditors and the Greek government are likely to improve, in reality the move changes nothing, particularly since attitudes in some parts of Europe appear to have hardened.
The players may have changed but the problems remain the same and while European finance ministers have agreed to meet today to consider some new Greek proposals, the likelihood is that they are unlikely to be any more acceptable now than they would have been last week, particularly given that debt relief is likely to be one of the key demands from the Greece side.
This would suggest that any new agreement remains unlikely which means that Greece may well be forced to issue its own currency in a matter of days.

        <title>Jerry Weintraub: indefatigable champion of old-school and retro film</title>

Jerry Weintraub never exactly became a household name, but he was a prominent enough Hollywood insider, finagler and mythmaker to earn his own HBO documentary profile, called His Way  along the lines of Robert Evans The Kid Stays in the Picture. His Way  named in honour of Weintraubs connection with Frank Sinatra  allowed Weintraub to ramble happily along about making deals with Elvis and setting up films, as well as accepting the plaudits of his high-profile Hollywood pals, George Clooney and Julia Roberts among them. If nothing else, it shows Weintraub as a Hollywood made man, a capo among capos.

For this seems to be the essence of Weintraub: a Sammy Glick style motormouth hustler in an age of a corporate, machine-oiled film-making. In fact, his whole career seems to have emerged through a haze of cigar smoke and cocktails: he tended to favour the nostalgic, the old-fashioned, the sort of thing you can imagine being discussed in studio back offices by an earlier generation. In the 70s, when Weintraub began to make his mark in the film business, Hollywood was a wild west: the old studio system had collapsed, the old certainties had disappeared, new and strange forms of cinema had appeared  from the counterculture, from the B-movie ecologies of sex and horror. Weintraub was a graduate of the mailroom at William Morris agency, the kind of place where ambitious wannabes steamed open their bosses letters, before talking himself into an junior agents job at the MCA talent agency. It was the classic favour-for-a-favour route, and Weintraub ended up promoting successful concert tours in the 70s with the likes of Presley, Sinatra, Bob Dylan and John Denver: unhip but remunerative acts that allowed Weintraub to cross over into TV and other media. In fact, it was via Denver that Weintraub really got into the moving-image business, via a string of TV specials, and it was his louche, music-industry background that no doubt eased the path to his joining forces with Robert Altman for Weintraubs first movie credit: legend has it they bonded over a joint, and Weintraub ended up getting the $2m backing for Altmans 1976 country-music epic Nashville.

In fact, Nashville, with its ironic tone and rambling structure, was not especially typical of the projects Weintraub sponsored. His next film was the John Denver vehicle, Oh God!, with crotchety Borscht belt comic George Burns. (Cruising, directed by William Friedkin , the notorious gay serial killer film was a mis-step; it was an unlikely brush with gruesome thrillerdom that Weintraub never repeated.) Diner, which he got greenlit by MGM, was much more like it, harking back to the kind of 50s Jewish life he knew well. The Karate Kid, a bona fide commercial blockbuster, took a tried-and-tested structure  one that had just won the best picture Oscar for Rocky  merged with a then-modish teen-movie template.

His luck ran out with My Stepmother Is an Alien  a comedy with Kim Basinger and Dan Aykroyd, directed by Richard Benjamin, another of the old-school stand-bys  and its catastrophic losses led swiftly to the bankruptcy of his production entity, the grandly named Weintraub Entertainment Group. Through all this Weintraub endlessly promoted his friendship with President George Bush (Weintraubs wife Jane Morgan had been a girlfriend of Bushs) and to some extent explains his survival as a Hollywood player during the bad times.
Amazingly, Weintraubs indefatigable attraction to backward-looking properties came up trumps with the Oceans Eleven series: a remake of the 60s heist film starring  yes  Frank Sinatra. By the early noughties, retro was in, and Weintraub could forget about another embarrassment: the feature film version of British TV spy show The Avengers, starring Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, which completely failed to catch fire. But, led by an effervescent George Clooney, and orchestrated by a resurgent Steven Soderbergh , Oceans Eleven worked brilliantly; pitched at just the right level between slick hi-tech film-making and pre-Mad-Men Rat Packism.

Behind the Candelabra - video review
Eleven, and its two sequels, Twelve and Thirteen  sequels were a very Weintraub preoccupation  were huge worldwide hits, and put him back in the game. He had one more fantastic retro hit in him, the Soderbergh-directed Behind the Candelabra , which distilled the Vegas era in all its camp glory. Notoriously, neither Weintraub nor Soderbergh could get studios to back the film, supposedly because of its gay subject-matter; shamefully for Hollywood, TV operation HBO had to step in, a decisive changing-of-the-guard moment in the struggle between the small and big screens. At the same time, Weintraubs franchising, money-chasing instincts led him to participate in the Karate Kid remake featuring Will Smiths son; it dumped karate in favour of kung fu, presumably to get Chinese producers onside, and Weintraub refused to change the title. It was a mess. And in between the two he got his pal George Bush his own HBO documentary, 41. What goes around, comes around, would seem to be Weintraubs motto.

Greeces no vote has left everyone wondering what it all means. While the topline summary is that no won with 61.3% of the vote , this is perhaps not the landslide victory it has been hailed to be.
For a start, there is confusion around what the referendum was actually about. Were Greek people voting to decide whether to stay in the Euro ? Was it about saying no to more austerity? Or defending national pride and southern European culture? Talking to Greeks yesterday, you might have thought there were several referendums happening simultaneously  a perfect illustration of just how muddy the waters of the debt crisis are.
For many following the crisis for the last five months, it has become clear that it is not just about Greek debt. Beneath the cultural tensions and ugly stereotypes, an ideological war is taking place. This battle is happening because the current economic system has only two answers to debt crises, recessions and slow economic growth: stimulus and austerity .
Related: Growth is not the answer to inequality
Stimulus is about the government pumping money into the economy to encourage consumer spending, which will theoretically lead to economic growth. In recent times, stimulus efforts have taken the form of the government spending money on infrastructure and other socially beneficial projects (think the New Deal ) and quantitative easing . Austerity is a set of measures that aim to cut government spending and shrink the public sector to make the economy less dependent on it, which in theory should make room for and encourage a burgeoning free market (ie neo-liberalism ).
The argument against government-led stimulus asks how the economy can grow if the government has to keep expanding its debt and/or money supply in order to start new projects and stimulate the economy. Surely the stimulation it provides will never compensate for growing levels of debt? Anti-austerity advocates, on the other hand, ask how the economy can grow if people make less money and taxes are higher  people will save, not spend, and economic growth is based on consumer spending.
The issue of austerity versus stimulus is often framed as the entire debate  if you dont support one, you must support the other, because there are no alternatives. This is the same binary debate that has been going on for more than 100 years between the state versus the market. Yet, these dichotomies distract people from thinking about whats really important  the goal of these policies, which is to grow the economy.
No analysis Ive read thus far has questioned the damaging role that the endless quest for economic growth plays. Neither austerity nor government stimulus will ever be able to address the debt crises and recessions of the twenty-first century because what were dealing with here is an inherent contradiction of capitalism.
Related: A wave of disruption is sweeping in to challenge neoliberalism
This contradiction comes from the surplus of the system (profit) being taken out of the real economy (the economy of physical goods and services) and put into the financial sector to generate more wealth for people who are already wealthy. This requires the economy to continually grow to compensate for the extraction of profit, which is essentially the extraction of the economys surplus.
However, this extraction of profit is the same mechanism at the root of soaring levels of inequality. A recent Oxfam report estimates that, by 2016, the richest 1% of the worlds population will own more than the other 99%. If the average person is making relatively less every year, or struggling just to maintain the same financial state, they cant afford to buy ever more products and services, so the economy cant grow as it did when we had more financial equality. Thus capitalism has always carried the seed of its own demise.
We are seeing this self-destruction in Greece. The current Syriza government wants to go back to the negotiating table and create a new bailout agreement that will cut the debt to a more manageable size and reform the public sector in ways that wont affect the most vulnerable. This would still be austerity, albeit a much milder version than that of the past five years. Yanis Varoufakis resigned from his post as Greek finance minister to allow for smoother negotiations between Greece and its European partners in the hope of reaching such an agreement.
If an agreement cant be reached, Greece might well go back to the drachma. However, the government has no clear plan for this and an unplanned exit from the euro would be painful, with the poorest hit the hardest.
In all of these scenarios, the governments goal would still be to re-start economic growth, even at the cost of creating more inequality. None of these options gets to the roots of capitalisms inherent contradiction. Theres no way to grow ourselves out of this crisis; not for Greece, not for the rest of the world. What we are witnessing is the beginning of the collapse of capitalism.
So what is a sustainable path forward for Greece? If the Greek government could see that it wont be able to re-start growth, and that GDP growth is a means to an end, not an end in itself, there are steps it could take to start paving a new path to prosperity for its people.
Related: Less material consumption is not the end for business
In addition to the basics  restructuring the Greek debt, deep reforms in the public sector to make it more transparent and accountable, and the strengthening of the solidarity economy  I suggest the following:
Greece should go back to a national currency to have more autonomous decision-making with regards to its own economy, which it needs if it wants to pave a more sustainable path. This is not a simple move, so the government will have to have a plan for such a transition, with safety netsto protect the most vulnerable.
The government should nationalise the banks and encourage people to start credit unions. This will re-align the banking sector with the needs of citizens and make the banks more resilient. Credit unions would empower people to take financial matters into their own hands.
Greece should keep for-profit interests from buying up its common wealth. This could be done via land trusts, not-for-profits and amending the constitution to make it unconstitutional for the government to sell off the commons.
The Greek government should start using a wellbeing or happiness index to measure success, as Bhutan does . In this age of inequality, working class people and the unemployed can easily slip through the cracks of GDP growth.
Businesses and the government should shorten the working week and encourage job-sharing , so more people can have part-time employment. This would counter the current problem of some having no work while others work 50 hours a week.
Finally, the government should create legislation and encourage not-for-profit enterprise in every sector to prevent the extraction of profits from the real economy and encourage social entrepreneurs and innovators to start up their own not-for-profits. These enterprises would help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Greece, create a more stable economy and keep the financial surplus in the real economy. By building an economy around social purpose, Greece could usher in the post-capitalist era, rather than fall victim to the unavoidable collapse of capitalism we are witnessing.

Iran nuclear talks continue as deadline looms

World powers are seeking to nail down a nuclear deal to end a 13-year standoff with Iran , hours before another deadline expires.
After talking deep into the night on Monday, foreign ministers from the P5+1 group leading the negotiations met briefly again on Tuesday without the Iranian delegation.
The group  Britain, China, France , Germany, Russia and the US  is seeking to hammer out a final accord to put an atomic bomb out of Irans reach.
But Tuesdays deadline for a deal  the fourth since an interim agreement was struck in November 2013  looks almost certain to be missed, as the ministers grapple with the toughest remaining issues.
Related: Iranian negotiator: deadline? What deadline?
In what has become a high-stakes game of diplomatic poker, the ministers met twice on Monday with the Iranian delegation led by the countrys foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, for a total of almost three hours.
Asked whether Tuesdays deadline might slip, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: I would say that its certainly possible.
State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Washington that Tuesday was not a deadline. It was an extension of basically seven days of the parameters of a 2 April framework accord struck in Lausanne.
But he refused to be drawn on what might happen on Tuesday, insisting: Everybody is still I think rowing on the oars here to try to get a deal done, but its got to be the right deal.
An Iranian official also made it clear on Monday that 7 July, 8 July, we do not consider these dates as those dates we have to finish our job.
Even if we pass 9 July, that will not be the end of the world, the Iranian said, asking not to be identified.

The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is under pressure to present a deal to Congress by Thursday, so American lawmakers have 30 days to debate it. If the accord comes later, then under a new law there will be a 60-day review period.
Despite progress on a series of complicated annexes, negotiations have become bogged down over how to ease sanctions against Iran and how to ensure Iran can continue to have a modest, peaceful nuclear programme.
Seeking to resolve lingering suspicions that Iran before 2003, or maybe after, had sought to develop nuclear arms, UN nuclear monitors were in Tehran on Monday.
The 24-hour visit by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) came after a similar trip last week by its director-general, Yukiya Amano.
Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, said Mondays talks were a major step towards resolving outstanding issues and were constructive and forward-looking.
The second IAEA visit shows the serious determination of both sides to enhance cooperation, he said, quoted by the official Irna news agency.
There was no immediate comment from the IAEA.
Related: Its not like Argo: the trials of a tour guide in Iran
But in what appeared to be a new spanner in the works, the Iranian official said his country also wanted to ensure there was no renewal of a UN arms embargo.
There is no evidence that the arms embargo has any relation with the nuclear issue, the official said. The arms embargo should not be part of the deal under negotiation, he said.
A factsheet put out by the State Department after the April accord said that once any deal is reached there would be a new UN security council resolution to extend important restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles.
Western officials are clearly balking at any notion of allowing Iran to buy conventional weapons at a time when it is accused of fomenting unrest in the Middle East.

The Singapore teenager Quah Zheng Wen has been cleared to compete at the world swimming championships and the 2016 Olympics after the ministry of defence approved a request to defer his mandatory national service.
The 18-year-old, who won 12 medals, including seven golds at last months South-east Asian Games, was in danger of missing both events because he was due to enlist for national service at the end of August.
However, the Armed Forces Council issued a statement on Tuesday saying his enlistment had been delayed for a year, allowing him to compete at next months world championships in Russia and the Olympics in Rio.
Mr Quah has satisfied the conditions for deferment of exceptional sportsmen who can win honour for Singapore, as his recent performances were better than the most recent Olympic Games qualifying times in the 200m butterfly, the statement said.
The AFC has therefore decided to grant deferment to Mr Quah from full-time NS [national service] till 31 August 2016, for him to train and participate in the 2016 Olympic Games.
In 2013, Quahs team-mate Joseph Schooling, who won nine gold medals at the SEA Games, was granted a deferment from national service until after the Rio Olympics. Singapore has never won an Olympic medal in swimming but Schooling and Quah are regarded as the countrys best prospects in years.
The AFC would like to reiterate that the criteria for deferment remain strict and limited to exceptional cases. The criteria for deferment have not changed and both Mr Schooling and Mr Quah met these criteria, the statement said.
Mr Quah will be enlisted for full-time NS when his deferment ends. We wish him success in the 2016 Olympic Games and hope that he will train hard to win a medal for Singapore.

'The west is too paranoid about Russia's information war'
Before stepping up the propaganda arms race America and Europe should realise how clumsy the Kremlins media campaign really is, argues Mark Galeotti

There is something of a panic in the west at the moment over fears that it is losing the information war with Russia .
On one level, this may be true. The Kremlin is undoubtedly engaged in a multi-front, multi-message, multimedia campaign to undermine America and Europe .
Everything from the pre-eminence given tin-hatted conspiracy theorists on the English-language state TV channel RT to the infamous troll houses and the efforts to demonise figures such as US State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki , testify to this.
Related: Inside the Kremlins hall of mirrors | Peter Pomerantsev
But before the west turns to info-warriors of its own, it ought to consider the weaknesses and consequences of the Russian campaign.
It is, primarily, a negative strategy. If anything, opinion polls show dwindling trust in and goodwill towards Russia around the world. Pew Research Center surveys found that between 2013 and 2014 negative views of Russia rose from 54 to 74% in Europe, with the countrys reputation failing to improve in any corner of the globe.
Russias aim, though, is not so much to accumulate its own soft power as to undermine the wests ability to act against it. At that, it has certainly had some success.
Many Nato members are becoming increasingly worried about the risk of being sucked into a wider conflict with the former superpower. At a time when their leaders are talking about the need for a tougher line against Russian expansionism , their electorates are uncomfortable. The sharpest indication of this split is in Germany, where many say they would not want to support a Nato partner facing Russian aggression.
The Russian information war has helped hide the ground truths of Ukraine within a cloud of rumour, innuendo, misinformation and spin. Whatever one may think about the Maidan protests that brought down the former government, the current government in Kiev was elected and is not a neo-fascist junta, as is often suggested
Whatever one may think about the Crimean vote to join Russia , the annexation was illegitimate under international law, and the fact that this continues to be debated attests to the successes of the Russian media campaign.
Related: EU to counter Russian propaganda by promoting 'European values'
But lets not assume that all of the innuendo and debate is a product of the Russian info-war, or that the Kremlin is a grandmaster of the memetic chessboard. These debates also reflect an underlying malaise of politics, leadership and legitimacy in the west.
We are willing to doubt the mainstream not because RT exhorts us to question more, as its slogan goes, but because we are already ready to believe that our leaders, our power structures and even our media lie to us.

We find ourselves exposed to conspiracy theories and sensationalist nonsense not because of the Russians so much as our own competitive media environments and the speed with which a funny, compelling or exciting lie or half-truth can be reposted, retweeted and re-reported around the world  outdistancing any fact-checking or sober analysis.
The most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth
Mark Galeotti
In this climate, the west is simply suffering from its own internal contradictions. The Russians have been able to exploit them but they have also often demonstrated themselves to be counter-productively clumsy.
Those troll farms whose sophistication is often vaunted by western alarmists have become a story in their own right  and anyone wanting to present the Russian perspective in an online forum now runs the risk of being taken for one.
While on the one hand attempts are made to woo German opinion, on the other Russian hackers break into Bundestag computers  probably gaining no more than trivial intelligence but undoing whatever work the media may have done.
In short, neither the Kremlin nor western governments should assume that the info-sphere is a simple battlefield on which disciplined forces wheel and charge. It is, at best, a cacophonous forum where umpteen rival voices struggle to be heard.
Russia may have a megaphone, but this just means that when its message is laughable or offensive it can alienate more people at once.

Now the European Union has launched an East StratCom Team to spread its values within the EU and the so-called eastern neighbourhood countries, including Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and Russia itself. But an organisation currently struggling to sell itself to sceptical audiences from England to Greece should be cautious about entering into full-blown information warfare.
As soon as such organs are created the temptation is to use them to spin and spread messages that edge closer and closer into outright propaganda. This mistake was made in the early years of the cold war, before the west realised that the most powerful counter to lies is not other lies, but the truth.
Yet the wests weaknesses are also its strengths: a plurality of opinions, an innately sceptical attitude, a willingness to revisit old assumptions. In the short term these may create vulnerability but in the long term they bring resilience.
The infamous declaration by Dmitry Kiselyov, the journalist who heads the state news agency Rossia Segodnya, that objectivity is a myth that is being imposed on us could stand as the motto of Russias information warfare campaign  or perhaps some day as its epitaph.

North Koreas state-run KCTV network has used the popular  birthday dog  meme that swept the internet in 2010 to criticise America and its extravagances.
As seen in a video released on YouTube , KCTVs talk show Todays World used the picture of Riley during a segment about poor conditions in the US.
KCTV commentator Lee Chung-song claimed in the clip that American billionaires are buying $15,000 dog collars for their pets, paying for dog hotels and spas or even hosting expensive birthday parties for their canines, such as the one enjoyed by Riley, while many homeless people are forced to live in boxes, he said.
None of this is untrue, strictly speaking, but it seems the TV channel may have taken the images a little too literally.
Kim Heung-kwang, director of NK Intellectuals Solidarity, said: I have heard of cases where DPRK media producers used the wrong pictures on a movie or newspaper, but this is the first time seeing it on the internet.
Riley went viral in 2010 after his owner posted the picture on her Facebook page. The picture received thousands of views when a family friend republished it Reddit. Riley became known for his smile, which users said looked like the canine was under the influence of marijuana.
The TV clip also shows images of dogs apparently at a tea party, and another surrounded by glasses of champagne, used by the programme as further evidence of Americas deep inequality.
The current affairs programme emphasises the gap between the rich and poor in America  criticising the country for exploiting the human rights agenda against North Korea while failing to shelter its own homeless population.
This incorrectly used image clearly shows the North Korean TV producers hardship in getting the right data file for their show, Kim said.
If the TV producers cant find the data they want to use, it will lead to miscommunication and mistakes, like using the wrong meme, Kim said.
KCTV also used a picture of Giant George , the worlds tallest dog, though his inclusion shows no clear relation to the shows theme on inequality.

How second-hand clothing donations are creating a dilemma for Kenya
Resale of charity shop rejects has destroyed local textile industry but a proposed ban on the importation of used garments risks putting thousands out of work

When a fire razed East Africas biggest second-hand clothes market in Nairobi last week , the deputy president, William Ruto, rushed to the scene to assure traders that the government would do everything to help them to rebuild their destroyed stalls.
But perhaps a more important question Ruto should have answered is whether Gikomba market will be in business a year from now if a proposed ban on the importation of second-hand clothes into east Africa is approved.
In January, east African head of states suggested that Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania should stop importing used clothes in an effort to revive the local textile industry.
Kenya alone imports around 100,000 tonnes of second-hand clothes, shoes and accessories a year  many of which were originally donated to charity shops in the west. According to Oxfam, more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa .
The items [charity] shops fail to sell or which they reject are considered for resale elsewhere, says Ian Falkingham, who manages an Oxfam-owned outlet in Senegal, Frip Ethique. Items which are in good condition and suitable for warmer climates are exported to Africa.
According to Oxfam , more than 70% of the clothes donated globally end up in Africa
This second-hand clothes chain sees, for example, a Forever 21 dress once worn by a young woman in London find its way into the wardrobe of a university student in Kenya. University of Oxford sweatshirts, I love London T-shirts, hoodies emblazoned with the star spangled banner or the Union Jack  and even the Confederate flag  are common wear for people who have never set foot in the UK or the United States.
But if the ban goes through, Kenyans will be compelled to buy locally produced clothes, giving textile manufacturers a chance to reclaim the market they lost to cheap imports from abroad.
Death of an industry
The decline of Kenyas textile industry dates back to the early 1980s, when market liberalisation policies spearheaded by the World Bank opened up the local economy to second-hand clothes. Previously, they had been distributed for free among the poor.
But the superior quality and originality of the clothes soon caught the eye of the young urban population, creating a demand that led to the collapse of many of Kenyas once robust textile companies, among them Rift Valley Textiles (Rivertex) and Kisumu Cotton Mills (Kicomi).
According to local media reports , 500,000 people were employed in the textile industry in the 1980s. Today, that number has fallen by more than 96% to around 20,000.
Banning the importation of used clothes is the governments latest effort to save an industry that is all but extinguished  and is intended to try to recover some of those lost jobs.
But, paradoxically, a ban could devastate another group of Kenyans who depend on the second-hand clothes trade to make a living.
William Ngonga, who sells used clothes at Gikomba, is aware of the possible ruling that could destroy the business his family has spent the past two decades building. I am in this business with my parents, I joined them 10 years ago just after finishing university. Its the only work I know, he says.
Ngonga says the business imports an average of two containers of clothes a month, for which they pay 16,700 in tax. The containers are offloaded from ships at the port town of Mombasa from where they are transported by road to Gikomba market.
A glorious, chaotic ecosystem

Gikomba is the ground zero of second-hand clothes in Kenya, and its from here that merchandise is redistributed to retailers all over the country.
Unapologetic for its mess of noise, dust and a confusing maze of timber, iron sheets and cardboard stalls, clothes hang from the stalls in a wild cacophony of colour and design.
If the clothes are not on hangers, they are bundled into giant heaps which the sellers invite buyers to burrow into to find what they are looking for. Often, the best dresses or blouses are buried at the bottom of the pile.
Buyers and sellers jostle for space in the cramped, often muddy, lanes, where the set price of goods is usually so low that it is ridiculous to bargain for anything cheaper. Even so, the more industrious sellers can be heard shouting themselves hoarse, advertising bargains designed to lure even the most reluctant of buyers.
Gikomba pulses with a spirit borne of genuine camaraderie: conversation and laughter punctuate the exchanges between the buyers and sellers.
It is a glorious, chaotic ecosystem that has survived catastrophe after catastrophe, including a terror attack in May last year that killed 12 people and more fires than the traders can count.
Ngonga says he directly employs 15 people, most of whom are casual labourers, and is afraid that they might all be left without a source of income if the East Africa Community goes ahead with the ban.
If these people are deprived of wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city
Charles Kuria
I have a degree in commerce which I have never used, but I might be forced to fall back on it if the ban goes through. I am not particularly excited to have to join the overcrowded job market and become a paper pusher because I really love this job, he says.
And paid employment of another kind is unlikely to match his current earnings: Ngonga reveals that each container imported at 38,574 brings in a profit of over 90%.
Charles Kurias store is one floor above Ngongas. It is bigger, and filled floor to ceiling with bales of clothes.
Kuria has had this store for almost two years, but he has been in the businessmuch longer, starting from the bottom as a hawker selling a few pieces on the streets to a big time wholesaler who now only sells in bales to retailers.
He imports his stock directly from the UK, the US, Canada and Belgium.
Although Kuria is reluctant to discuss his profit margins, he admits to living a comfortable life where money has ceased to be a worry. His is a business that has a sizeable staff, with four people employed permanently and up to 20 casuals each time new stock comes in.
He says the real casualties of a ban would be the casual workers who depend on odd jobs to earn a living.
If these people are deprived of an opportunity to make honest wages, they might turn to crime and contribute to making Nairobi an unsafe city, says Kuria.
Striking a balance
Former Kenya Association of Manufacturers boss Betty Maina is cognisant of the risk that comes with cutting off the second-hand clothes business without a fall back plan for the hundreds of thousands it employs.
In an article for a local media company , Maina says that it is possible to grow the local textile industry without taking jobs from the people who need them the most.
Granted, the mitumba sector is a source of employment and many people earn their livelihood from the business. Measures that would shut down the flourishing trade at a go would not be very welcome.
Related: Europe's secondhand clothes brings mixed blessings to Africa
But why not streamline activities in the sector in such a way that the local textile industry is able to reap the benefits of providing quality products at an affordable price and at the same time providing thousands of jobs directly and millions more in downstream activities? she asks.
The thousands involved in the second hand clothes trade will know their fate once the East Africa leaders meet for the November summit, during which the issue is expected to come up.
In the meantime, it remains to be seen how the government will walk the tightrope of reviving the local textile industry without annihilating Gikomba  and the people that thrive on it.

Nearly 1,400 North Koreans were publicly executed between 2000 and 2013, according to new research, which suggests that the number of these deaths peaked at 160 in 2009. Further increases after 2013 have also been reported.
The Korean Institute for National Unification, funded by the South Korean government, said in its annual white paper on human rights in North Korea that 1,382 executions took place in public in the 13-year period.
The figures, which cannot be independently verified, were said to be based on in-depth interviews with North Korean defectors and confirmed by witnesses in the country. The number of executions carried out away from the public eye is also impossible to ascertain.
North Korean media have reported only two executions in 2014 and none so far this year, according to Cornell Universitys Death Penalty Watch research group. During 2009, only one was officially reported.

But the South Korean newspaper Joongang Daily reported in late 2013 that thousands of North Koreans had been forced to attend executions by firing squad held in stadiums, the first known large-scale public executions under Kim Jong-uns leadership.
Public executions are considered to be a way to keep the population in line. According to witness testimonies from the DPRK, public executions for watching or distributing South Korean films and drug smuggling have increased in recent years, as well sentences for crimes against the regime. Many more are punished by being sent to work-camps, with Amnesty International estimating that 200,000 North Koreans are in prison .
North Korea does not allow access to human rights groups, but an Amnesty report confirms the 2013 spike in executions, claiming that at least 70 death sentences were carried out in the DPRK, from a total of 776 around the world.
Amnesty said the actual number was likely to be far higher, but even without taking this into account North Korea , a country with 0.3% of the worlds people, carries out nearly 10% of its confirmed executions.
This total is still less than Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which account for 80% of the worlds confirmed executions between them. The US executed 761 people between 2000 and 2013, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre , but many countries, most notably China, refuse to reveal the number of people sentenced to death by the state.
Since 1996, the South Korean unification institute has published annual statistics on executions. This years figures were based on testimonies of 221 North Korean defectors, selected based on demographics and background, of the total 1,396 escapees who came to South Korea last year.

Tehrans Valiasr Street is a long, winding road with sycamore trees and streams that were once fed all year round by the cool waters of the Alborz mountains  when there was enough snow, and when there was enough water. Known as the longest street in the Middle East, Valiasr spans the city from south to north, and reminds you that Tehran is almost surrounded by mountains, like a bird in cupped hands, as fragile and as transitory.
To walk up this street on any given day, from the deep south to the posh north, is to see history etched on walls and windows. Tehran is a city that has much to remember  when it is able.
Scattered along Valiasr, in random corners, one can find some of the citys most ignored treasures: 19th-century Qajar and 20th-century Pahlavi-era homes, with their distinctive architecture of colourful gardens and deep basements. But make sure to look in the most unlikely places.

In south Valiasr, north of Mowlavi Street, behind a large sign for the Sheep Butchers Union, is the house of Anis al-Doleh , favourite wife of the Qajar king, Nasser al-Din Shah. Her story is a real-life rags to riches tale: the orphaned daughter of shepherds, the shah met her on a hunting trip and brought her to Tehran. She gradually rose to become the most prominent wife and raees-e andarooni, executive chief of the harem.
While the house was registered as a national landmark in 2002, it still operates as the headquarters of the sheep butchers union, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. At least it has guaranteed the house a life.

The home is not large, but rosy and welcoming. A round blue pool dominates the garden, reflecting the trees and wall carvings  as well as the hideous three-storey building next door. The first floor is sealed off as storage space. The second (and main) floor houses the offices of the union and they kindly allow me inside. Delicate carvings of flowers and birds in pastel colours fill every room, all juxtaposed to the sound of sheep auction schedules and slaughterhouse prices that men are yelling over the phone.
A high aluminium pyramid roof indicates that once not long ago it snowed heavily in this area. These days one forgets the snow that covered the entire city throughout winter, even a decade ago.
Tehran is not associated with ancient history: popular opinion knows it as the city of the Qajars and Pahlavis. But as recent excavations suggest, Tehran was settled 7,000 years ago. Even so, the Qajar and early Pahlavi eras shaped modern Tehran in giving it a distinct architecture. Divergent art once defined Irans cities: from Qeshm, to Kashan, to Astara, each built according to its locality, climate and artisans. Today, Tehran, like those other cities and more, has been disfigured throughout.
In the Tehran of the most recent centuries, elaborate houses had intricate basements underground, and aab anbar  a deeper basement for water storage. No matter how lavish or simple the home, it almost always treasured a blue pool in the yard around which fruit trees were grown. Windows and doors were wooden, and intricate carvings filled the walls with patterns that became more complex the higher the financial standing of the owner.
Few of these homes remain today, unless renovated by a major organisation. The luckier ones were turned into museums and art houses. Few like the home of Anis al-Doleh were the odd in the bunch that were kept intact but overtaken by random associations.
As recently as the 1930s, Deh-e Vanak in northern Tehran was a farming quarter in the midst of the city. Today, nearby Vanak Square is one of citys most congested areas, but walk towards the village, and you will still find homes built in the 1920s, 1930s and even earlier. Why have they not been turned to apartment buildings in this frenzy? One wonders.
Ali Vanaki comes from a family that has lived in the village for hundreds of years. We were farming in this area for centuries, then Reza Shah came along and gave the entire village to his prime minister, Mirza Hassan Mowstofiyol Mamalek. We refused to leave, but many of these homes do not have proper documents, even to this day.
Despite this, they are still sold for up to 17m tomans (3,500) per square metre in the winding streets, and 30m tomans (6,000) for homes with bigger gardens.
Mowstofiyol Mamaleks grandchildren, in Vanak, remain some of the only old royalty that still live in their grandfathers orchards and Qajar-era home. The house is sealed off with high brick walls, but is available for wedding photographs at staggering sums. From the trees that peek out behind the walls, one can only marvel at the history of this place. Mowstofiyol Mamalek sold part of the village land to the industrialist millionaire Gashtasb Firouzgar, who in turn sold it to Tehran municipality.

Mowstofiyol Mamalek came from a long lineage of landlords and government treasurers, so they were awarded that title a century before his birth.
Today, this piece of land is called Baqh-e Irani (the Iranian garden) and is one of the countrys most exquisite open spaces, covering 3.4 hectares. It is a public park but, as its name suggests, with streams and old orchard trees. Tehran municipality spent a billion tomans on the tulips here alone, says Vanaki.
Much of Tehran was once khooneh baqhi (houses within fruit orchards), of which the remaining trees in Vanak village and Valiasr Street are but small reminders. Across north Tehran where the most luscious orchards once prospered, developers for decades now dry trees to turn their property into land for lucrative high-rises.
According to Tehran municipality law, an orchard cannot be built upon. So, they dry the trees and then request building permits. That is how the history of this city is wiped away: by burning the flesh of trees.
But in many street corners you will occasionally find an old home still in use. Usually, its an elderly couple with children abroad. Once the couple die, the house is sold by the heirs, and the tree drying ensues, followed by an apartment block.

A home in Pasdaran Street next to our high school was inhabited by an elderly couple with four children overseas. Once the couple passed away, it became a 15-storey apartment building. Each of the children made millions, a neighbour angrily remarks, dissatisfied with the heavy traffic the building has brought to the once idyllic corner.
In north Tehran, except for those few homes salvaged for museums, skyrocketing real-estate prices have left almost nothing intact. Adding to the confusion, are homes that were confiscated right after the revolution, taken over by various organisations, passed through the hands of one developer after the next, to the extent that past ownership is nearly untraceable. One might live in a high-rise that can cost as much as 70m tomans (14,000) per square metre, not knowing who used to sleep, sit or read on the very grounds upon which the tower was built.

One of north Tehrans most well-known homes, Baq-e Ferdows or the Mohammadieh palace, now serves as the citys cinema museum. The house was constructed in Shemiran, near Tajrish Square, in the mid-19th century, but underwent changes in ownership and architecture many times before the cultural ministry took the reins following the revolution.
Iranian scholar Mahmoud Afshar bought large areas of land around the orchard, and subsequently donated them for academic pursuits (like the Dehkohda language institute ) which stand to this day. Despite these random reminders, most of what stands of old Tehran must be sought after in downtown and southern areas of the city. The north has been mainly lost.
A rather well-maintained Qajar-era home in downtown Tehran is the house of Qavam ol-Saltaneh, prime minister under both the Qajar and Pahlavi monarchies. Qavams house is Abgineh, the glass and pottery museum, which stands on 7000 square metres of land. Wooden windows, long wooden stairways and delicate carvings adorn a building that served both as Qavams house and office. The museum space inside the house was designed by renowned Austrian architect Hans Hollein.
The care taken with Qavams house is in stark contrast to many other places, including another downtown Qajar-era home, Ettehadiyeh House . To the public, it is known as the home of Dayi-jan (dear uncle) in the popular television adaptation of Iraj Pezeshkzads novel My Uncle Napoleon . The historic house sits in ruins, decaying year after year, while Tehrans Beautification Organisation tries to battle developers who see it as prime real east for a mall. It is located in Lalehzar, in the heart of Tehrans financial district.

What can you expect of a city whose many custodians arent even from the city? said architect and urban planner Kamran Safamanesh in a ceremony to remember old Tehran. His remark hinted that many current-day functionaries rose to prominence with the revolution from villages across Iran , and have no understanding of cities, their histories and stories. A citys memories are a citys identity. Wipe them out and nothing remains, said Safamanesh.
Tehran is certainly not the first city to be overtaken by a development boom. In the last few years, gigantic shopping malls have only meant faster destruction: Palladium, the high-end mall recently opened in north Tehran, sits on grounds of an old orchard that was dried to make way for the mall, built with capital primarily invested by a kebab dynasty known as Raftari.
I remember the orchard, a resident says. Now our neighbourhood has become the parking lot of death. He is selling up and leaving, as the traffic has made it impossible for him to live here anymore, he said.
Although not as old as many others, one of Tehrans most disputed old homes is the house of Ostad (master) Behzad, the prominent 20th-century miniaturist. This is where some of the most well-known artists and intellectuals of the last century Tehran once gathered.

Behzads only son bequeathed the house to the Iranian Heritage Organisation in an agreement that would see the house become a museum. But once the papers were signed, the Heritage Organisation may have forgotten its end of the bargain. Today it serves as a library and storage space for the organisation  somewhere for sleepy, middle-aged ladies in office dress codes to sit around and drink tea with biscuits. The old tiles of the masters work have been removed, even the street upon which the house sits, once called Behzad, has for years now been changed to Nofallah.
The old homes of Tehran are not only reminders of this citys past art, but past co-existence. Haroon Yashayayi is a Jewish-Iranian writer who has spent the last few years writing on his beloved Oudlajan, the once predominantly Jewish neighbourhood near the bazaar.
Oudlajan, along with Sanglaj, Arg, Dowlat, Bazaar and Chaleh Meydan were the neighbourhoods that made Tehran-e Asr-e Nasseri, Tehran during the reign of Nasser al-Din Shah, as the dust was rising from a tired, sleepy city journeying to a new, unfamiliar world.
At the time, with nearly 3000 homes, Oudlajan was known as a prosperous place. Today, walking through the back alleyways you would not know this. The overhead domes have been refurbished but it remains deformed and alienated.
I remember when the street was thriving, when Molook Khanom, a local woman, would walk in the streets and wave hello to everybody, Yashayayi says, in a talk he gave on his upcoming book of stories of Oudlajan, to be published in Tehran. The neighbourhood is home to Tehrans oldest synagogues, sealed off to pedestrians, tourists and wanderers.
Home of prominent Zoroastrians also serve as reminders of the citys past: the house of Arbab Homroz, in east Tehran, was most recently launched as the Iranian National Museum of Graphic Arts. In central Tehrans Chahar Rah-e Valiasr (the intersection of Valiasr and Enqelab Street) a shining monument seems out of place: this is the Qajar-era home of Rostam Giv , the Zoroastrian parliament member and industrialist who also headed the Zoroastrian association until his death in 1980.
During the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, the house was bought by Jahad Daneshgahi, an educational organisation, and renovated by the Heritage Organisation. It is now a fully functional building that serves as classroom space.
Not all standing homes had the same fate. The home of Hassan Pirnia is one of the most significant architectural marvels of the Qajar era but sits in ruins , awaiting a shopping centre on some of its grounds. Some of the carvings at the home have been looted.
Pirnia was a lawmaker, historian and prime minister at the end of the Qajar era. This home is not simply a historic artefact . Within its walls, one of 20th century Irans most significant events took place: the writing of the constitution following the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.
These homes connect the memory of Tehran. Qavam did the writing, Pirnia provided the space. The constitution and the house both suffered the same fate: under rubble. A huge hole was dug for the mall - which has not been built - but permanently damaged the main building.
Emarat-e Masoodiyeh, Masoodiyeh palace, constructed on the orders of Zel-ol-Soltan, son of Nasser al-Din Shah, sits on five hectares of orchards. It has a remarkable facade with incredible carvings, disguising the fact it is crumbling from the inside.
Masoodiyeh palace in Tehran, Iran.
The house has garnered mainstream attention unlike any other in Tehran. In 2014, the Tehran autumn music festival was held there and most recently, the popular band Pallett held a ceremony to release their album on the palaces grounds with nearly 1,000 fans in attendance. They also have a song dedicated to Masoudiyeh in their new album: Tehran, Smile. None of this has quickened the pace of promised renovations inside the home, run jointly by Tehrans Beautification Organisation and the Heritage Organisation.
Tehrans Beautification Organisation, an agency that operates under the municipality, but with its own independent budget, walks on shaky ground. On paper, it is responsible for carrying out artistic projects around the city, and in conjunction with the Heritage Organisation, repairing and maintaining the citys monuments. While it employs sociologists, artists and architects who understand the worth of the citys old treasures, it is under the wings of a far larger body, the municipality, that is leading the charge for high-rises and shopping malls.
It often feels like we have to fight our own limbs, says an artist who works for the organisation. The municipality seems lost between the thirst for more and more real estate, which yields revenue, and the need to save what is left of the very things that give the city character. Some of Tehrans most notorious developers sit on the city council, only exacerbating this dilemma.
But so have we, the residents. Our very existence has mutated the shape and look of this city, from 15,000 residents in Qajar times to more than 8 million today. That the rats of Tehran are almost as big as cats not only speaks to the greed of developers, but how cities have come to be in the 21st century. Mass migration from villages and small towns to cities is the fuel driving ever more apartment buildings , more garbage , more waste, the very thirst for more.
A city without a memory may be a city lost. But what makes Tehrans story flit between the tragic and the uplifting is not just what has been lost but what has been salvaged, repaired, somehow maintained. Part of this citys story is this push and pull, this battle of opposing forces.
Tehran is a city with a past, and there are walls, homes and even people here to still remind you. If you look carefully, beyond the malls, and the butcher shops.

With the Womens World Cup final ahead, the soccer world must call for an end to the Islamic republics law against women going to stadiums, say prominent human rights activists

As the world watches Sundays Womens World Cup final, TV cameras will capture the joyful faces of spectators of all ages, races, and genders. Such joy, taken for granted by many people around the world, is unfortunately denied to women in Iran.
Since 1982, the Islamic republic has prohibited women from attending football and other sporting events. Though such discrimination is a blatant violation of the statutes and guiding principles of Fifa, it has counted the Islamic republic of Iran football federation as a member for over 30 years without the slightest reproach. The time has come for the world to call on Fifa, and for Fifa to call on Iran, to put an end to discrimination against women.
Barring women from entering football stadiums is a violation of article three of the Fifa statutes, its governing document, which states: Discrimination of any kind against any Country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.

Gender-based discrimination also violates Fifas objectives, which are set forth in Article 2 of the statutes, include [promoting the game of football] globally in light of its unifying, educational, cultural and humanitarian values, as well as [controlling] every type of Association Football by taking steps to prevent infringements of the Statutes, regulations or decisions of Fifa. Members of Fifa are required to comply fully with the statutes pursuant to article 13. Articles 14 and 15 provide for the suspension or expulsion of any member that seriously violates the Statutes, regulations or decisions of Fifa.
Iranian women  and men  have taken great risks to draw attention to gender apartheid at sporting events. Offside, a 2006 film by acclaimed director Jafar Panahi , chronicles the poignant struggle of several girls who attempt to sneak into a football match by dressing as men. In 2014, a group of women, including 25-year-old Ghoncheh Ghavami , were arrested for trying to attend a volleyball match in Tehran. Ghavami was sentenced to a year in jail, but released after several months due to an international uproar.
In recent months, the movement has taken on a global dimension. Thousands of Iranian men and women have taken to social media and sporting events around the world, including the 2015 Asian Cup matches in Australia in January, the Iran-Sweden football friendly in Stockholm in May, and the FIVB World League volleyball matches in Los Angeles and Tehran in June, to call for an end to the ban on Iranian women in Iranian stadiums. In February, prominent Iranian activists penned a letter to Fifa president Sepp Blatter. Though Blatter expressed public support for their cause, the situation in Iran remains unchanged.
In tackling gender discrimination, Fifa can take example from its strong position against racism. Fifa has promoted widely its Say No to Racism campaign, including at matches and across various media. Fifas Resolution on the Fight against Racism and Discrimination in its 63rd session of the Fifa congress, held in May 2013, established requirements for competition organizers to formulate concrete action plans to fight racism and deploy anti-discrimination officers in every match, and prescribed a stricter application of sanctions in response to violations.
Instead of expelling the Islamic republic of Iran football federation from Fifa - which would crush the spirit of tens of millions of Iranians - similar anti-gender discrimination rules, regulations, programs and publicity campaigns could provide Fifa and the global community of football fans with more effective tools to enforce and promote Fifa policies and bring an end to discrimination against women in the world of football.
Such strong actions are necessary if Fifa is to remain faithful to its statutes and guiding principles, including its commitment to promote football as a unifying force.

North Korea is the best place on the planet  or that is what Hyeonseo Lee believed when she was growing up. It was a rose-tinted vision that faded during the devastating famine that swept through the country in the 1990s.
Hyeonseo became one of thousands of defectors to try to escape across the border to China  a dangerous journey that risks being sent to one of North Koreas infamous prison camps or even death.
Speaking at a Ted talk in 2013, Hyeonseo said she couldnt remember many details of her crossing  apart from the dead bodies floating down the river.
Once she was safely across she went into hiding with her relatives in China before making her way to South Korea , where she now lives and divides her time between her studies and work as a human rights activist.

Eleven years after she left North Korea, Hyeonseo returned to China to help her mother and brother make their own perilous escape .
She wrote of being reunited with her mother in the memoir The Girl With Seven Names: My mind still held the image of her face the night Id last seen her. She was 42 then, and a woman of so much energy she could hardly sit still ... She was far thinner than I remembered, and her mouth was drawn and lined.
Hyeonseo will be talking about her dramatic life story at a Guardian Live event in London from 7-8.30pm (BST) tonight, joined by the Guardians Emma Graham-Harrison , SinoNK s Adam Cathcart and the BBCs John Sweeney .
Well be live tweeting the proceedings, which you can follow here or on Twitter @GuardianNK using #GuardianLive .

I have a question for each of the authors regarding their individual stories, if they wouldn't mind talking a little bit about them.
Segun Afolabi: What drew you to the topic of religious revivals and faith healers like Daddy Cool? Did you do any first-hand research on the subject?
Namwali Serpell: I'm so interested in the point-of-view shifts in "The Sack," and how you hold off on revealing the complicated relationship between J. and his bwana until the very end. Could you talk about how you arrived at this structure for the story?
FT Kola: You do such a great job of evoking the awkwardness the Colonel's wife feels at the party, trying to navigate both her husband's excessive pride and her discomfort with her surroundings. I'd love to hear about how you captured such a rich, complicated depiction of her social distress.
Elnathan John: I'm most interested in the resurrections in the story, both for Aunt Keturah in the end, and for Tachio as he considers what his old life must have been like to end up in the refuge home. Could you speak to the connections between Tachio's dream life and the revelations he make from reading the refuge home's records about the histories of the other children?
Masande Ntshanga: One of the things the story foregrounds is the adolescent sexuality of the boys -- developing just as they enter an era in which sex takes on new consequences. What drew you to focusing on young men of this age, and how do their relationships provide a focal point for the larger social changes that the grey man foreshadows?
Thank you all!

Thanks Mr Tibs - I was drawn to the issue of faith healing on several counts including the disappoint of people, post-revival, whose conditions havent improved, and also the tremendous amounts wealth amassed by the pastors who minister to these people - the dichotomy there and the possibility of deep disappointment (or being able to rationalise or even blame oneself because of a lack of faith). And yes, a significant amount of research (but I also go to church from time to time).

Hi Mr Tibs, thank you for taking the time to read our stories and to ask such thoughtful questions! I'm glad the awkwardness comes through in the story - part of my project was to evoke several types of social discomfort and awkwardness, and hopefully to make the reader feel them too.. One type is of course the awkwardness that the greater political situation (occurring in the background) brings about. These are people that are just not comfortable with one another, and they have to talk politely around Apartheid and what it means. But the other is just the very mundane awkwardness of going to a party where you don't know anyone. I wanted the Colonel's wife to be feeling both, and for the two to merge and mingle within her. So part of the writing process for her character was just thinking about all the times I've been to parties and felt awkward, and part of it was imagining the heightened anxiety that engagement between racial groups during Apartheid would cause. For that, I relied on stories from my parents and older relatives. It was then easy to draw the Colonel's wife's focus inwards, into her interior, but of course she simply finds more worries there.

MrTibs, I'm interested in what you think. Do you find that narrative delay and shifts in perspective are true to life, or distinctly fictional techniques? Do you think they produce a different experience than one would get from interacting with a group of new people? Does time work differently in life, fiction, and dream? Or are they all versions on a continuum?

I was drawn to the age because I wanted to evoke a visceral and physical memory of Bhisho, in which I'd spent some of my childhood years. In writing, I often associate childhood memory with the senses and adult memory with language. I wanted the story to be immersive--to feel more like an experience than a linear narrative.
Their relationships provide a focal point for the larger social changes that the grey man foreshadows insofar as both of them--the group of boys and the country--experience an opening into something unknown: the end of childhood on the one hand, and the end of apartheid--or the shifting of history--on the other.
The link in the narrator's personal discovery of sexuality and the country's re-discovery of the implications and consequences of sex was fortuitous.

We couldn't be more ready, says first African team to enter Tour de France
MTN-Qhubeka will make history tomorrow at start of the worlds biggest bike race. Theyre aggressive, cohesive and ready to compete, says Richard Poplak

Cycling is arguably the most brutal voluntary activity on earth, matching the demands of all other blood sports  war and politics included.
Douglas Ryder , the impresario behind Africas first cycling team MTN-Qhubeka , knows all this. Back in 2007, Ryder founded what had long been considered an impossibility: an African-owned, African-sponsored, African-managed professional cycling team designed to race the Grand Tours in general and the Tour de France in particular.

Dougie, as hes affectionately known in local circles, was smart enough to do away with the politics  Eritreans riding alongside Ethiopians; Rwandan Hutus riding alongside Tutsis; white South Africans riding alongside black South Africans. Ryder was happy to build a pedal-powered scale model of Thabo Mbekis African Renaissance.
And Ryder likes to win: the team he assembled, on the back of significant buy-in from the South African cellular megalith MTN , was more advanced than most of the big names in Europe.
He knew that in the post- Lance Armstrong era, cycling teams had to look and feel clean, and it helped to have a significant corporate social responsibility component.
He paired up with the charity Qhubeka , which provides locally assembled bikes to rural South African children. He hired top-notch scientists and nutritionists; and he placed on his roster hardened vets from Germany and Lithuania and Italy to turn his youngsters into pros.
Soon, his cyclists started to win.
Not just African races, but international events, catching everyones attention. The first big European result came during the 2013 Milan-San Remo spring classic . In weather so foul the race had to be curtailed, the German Gerald Ciolek won in a sprint finish, beating superstar sprinters Peter Sagan and Fabian Cancellara in the process.

The Tour
Suddenly MTN-Qhubeka was a big deal, impossible to write off as a corporate South African whim, and a wildcard berth in the Vuelta a Espaa followed.
Curiously, further 2014 wildcard entries for the Giro dItalia and the Tour de France  which along with the Vuelta constitute cyclings Grand Tours  were not forthcoming. People started to doubt whether MTN would get anywhere in the sport.
But this year, the team has won its entry to the greatest race on earth, as its known, La Grande Boucle  the 2015 Tour de France .
Nine men have been picked for the roster , five of them African, kitted out in Cervlo bicycles, Samsung electronics, and other high-end gadgets.
It was the Critrium du Dauphin , an eight-day stage race that is seen as preparation for the Tour, that tipped Ryders hand somewhat. His superb Eritrean climbing specialist Daniel Teklehaimanot won the polka dot jersey, the honour bestowed for claiming the most points on the hills. The Kenyan-born, South African-bred 2013 Tour de France winner Chris Froome took the general classification for the British team Sky.
There were other encouraging signs too. Louis Meintjes, the 23-year-old South African who is perhaps the best cyclist the country has ever produced, made a courageous bid for a mountain stage win. The team looked cohesive, aggressive, and mature. Nothing slapdash about them. They were world class.
We want African riders to be involved in all the teams in the future
Douglas Ryder
But everything up until the first pedal stroke of the Tour de France counts as nothing more than practice. With this in mind, I phoned Ryder to find out how he was managing expectations. His squad is a canny combination of raw talent and grizzled experience, and includes big names such as Norways Edvald Boasson Hagen and Americas Tyler Farrar, with newbies including Eritreas Merhawi Kudus , who is barely 21.
We couldnt be more ready if we tried, says Ryder.
Unsurprisingly, no one is more bullish on African cyclings future. Do I ever think this team will ever be 100% African? No. The international riders are fast tracking our African riders to success  having a rider like Edvald Boasson Hagen, who has been on two Tour de France winning teams with Froome and [Bradley] Wiggins  you cant buy that experience.
What I do see is that this international group will slowly become the support riders on this team. Also, we want people from all markets to build visibility for this team  our role is to spread the Qhubeka message.
As for this being the beginning of an African era, Ryder did not disagree. Do I think cycling will undergo the major change like marathon running did? Perhaps. But I definitely believe therell be a massive transformation happening in the next five to 10 years. MTN cant sustain all the talent in Africa , but we want African riders to be involved in all the teams in the future. Hopefully over time therell be more investment in African cycling, largely because of our pioneering potential. Its about the sustainability and the growth of it over the continent.

A year after the war, Gaza grieves for its child casualties
At a school where six boys were killed during last summers Israeli offensive, the loss is an open wound. For other young Palestinians, the scars are psychological

The walls of the office of Salim Abu Rous, headmaster of the Doha boys secondary school in Rafah, in the south of the Gaza Strip, are decorated with medals and trophies. He has photo albums of the boys in football teams and other clubs.
About 1,000 pupils attend his school, arriving in two shifts  so many that he struggles to remember the names of all the boys killed in last summers war.
I remember Haitham Abdul Wahab, he says finally, flicking through one of the picture albums to try to find him. He was a good boy. He was well loved in the school. He was killed at his uncles house with his brother and mother.
Six pupils from the Doha school were killed in the war, more than from any other school in Gaza. In total, more than 550 Palestinian children died during the conflict. Across Gaza, schools lost pupils and teachers, and thousands were injured.
Salim Abu Rouss difficulty in remembering all the dead boys is understandable given some had not long transferred into his large school.

But there is another, grimmer, reason. There were so many deaths in the last war, he says  so many it was hard to process them. The consequence is that, on an institutional level at least, it appears as though the boys have been almost erased from the schools memory.
But in their homes in neighbourhoods and villages across the Rafah area  which saw some of the heaviest attacks of the 50-day war  the anguish is still raw.
Anas Muamar was 16 when he was killed on 20 July last year.
It was two oclock in the morning. We werent sleeping here. It was too dangerous. So we were staying in another place we thought was safer, recalls his father, Mahmoud Hussein Mahmoud Muamar, a former employee of the religious affairs ministry.
There was a very loud explosion. Anas had been sleeping but woke up and went to the balcony to see what had happened. After a while they went back inside. Thats when the house was hit again. His two brothers were killed and Anas was injured.

Mahmouds face crumples into tears. We took him to the hospital  but he died. He was a good boy. He was a good student who liked football and followed Barcelona. He was religious, like his brothers. This year he was supposed to have been in the twelfth grade. I wanted him to go to university and become a teacher.
Gazas youngest residents still appear to be bearing the heaviest and most lasting consequences of last summers war. A report published on Monday by Save the Children, entitled A Living Nightmare: Gaza One Year On, says 551 children were killed and 3,436 were injured, of whom 10% suffered permanent disability. One Israeli child was killed during the war, and 270 injured.
Three-quarters of Gazas children experience unusual bedwetting regularly, the report says, while 89% of parents report that their children suffer constant feelings of fear, and more than 70% of children say they are worried about another war. Seven out of 10 children interviewed now suffer regular nightmares.
What is also clear is that the loss of older teenagers  such as the six Doha pupils on the brink of adulthood  has affected younger siblings and parents, compounding a deepening sense of fatalism and hopelessness in a Gaza where the promised reconstruction has barely happened and whose outlook, Palestinians say, seems bleaker than at any time in recent memory.
A green Hamas flag flies above the family compound where Muhammad Behabsa, 17, died, off a sandy lane in the Salaam district of Rafah. There seems little question that the house and five others beside it, occupied by relatives, were the intended Israeli target.
Like many living in areas heavily hit by military strikes during the war, the Behabsa family still live next to the ruins where their family members died. The main house was hit in an air strike that left a crater still visible in the dusty yard. A little later several smaller houses belonging to family members behind the compound were reduced to rubble in a second set of strikes, apparently by artillery fire.
It happened at three oclock in the morning on 2 August, recalls Muhammads father, Shiab Hussein Behabsa, 52. He was on his own, sleeping in the diwan of one of the houses behind this one. An F-16 hit this house with a bomb at first and then three artillery shells hit the five houses behind.
He was cut to pieces.. Five of his cousins were killed in the same incident.

Like Anas, he wanted to go to university, in his case to study law.
His headmaster and other teachers came to pay their condolences. His friends from school still come to visit. He was my second son but he was the dynamo of the family. He liked to joke but he would also help. If I needed anything it would be him who went to fetch it from outside.
Abdullah Qishta, 17, also from the Doha school, died on the same day while returning from a summer job he had found at a dairy farm.
When the war started, he continued working, his father, Naim, says. We moved to a house belonging to a relative of my wife when the ground invasion started. On 2 August the owner called and asked him if he would go and feed the animals. He said the situation near the farm was fine. But it wasnt. When he got there the Israelis were close so the owner said he should sleep there.
He wanted to come home and get some clothes and take a shower. He was calling every 10 minutes. Then the calls stopped. He had been walking back with another worker from the farm when he was hit by a drone missile near the house.
Back at the school, now closed for the summer holidays, Salim Abu Rous describes the aftermath of losing so many of his pupils. In the beginning the education ministry sent people to support the school. We had a mental health programme with plays and films and activities supported by Unicef.
We had a football team named after the boys. Some of their friends still talk about them.
The ministry never told us we had lost the most pupils of all the schools in Gaza. I have no explanation of why we suffered the worst. But the war took place during the school holidays. The boys were with the families. Perhaps that is why so many children died.
Hasan Zeyada, a community psychologist in Gaza, believes that children and young people have been the most affected group, both because of the last war and in the wider context of blockade and conflict that means children over the age of nine will have lived through three wars and continuous economic siege.

Children present problems you would expect. Hyper-vigilance, nightmares, cognitive problems. Teachers complain about falling performance in the classroom. In communication they become aggressive verbally and physically.
A yardstick is the feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness here in Gaza. It affects motivation and depresses the emotions.
Back in Rafah, Suleiman Loulahi, a Bedouin agricultural worker who lost his son Bilel, 17, a pupil at Doha, also on 2 August, reflects the new fatalism that has crept into Gaza.
He has named a new baby after the brother he never knew, killed by a missile while he was returning to his house from a relatives where they were feeding his pigeons.
Loulahi says: I look at my other children, and these days I wonder what the point is encouraging them to go to school, to better themselves and get on, when there will only be another war in a few years. When Ill risk losing them again.

Opening summary
Good morning and welcome to the Guardians live coverage of 7/7 memorial events in London and across the UK.
Its hard to believe a decade has now passed since the devastating attack that claimed the lives of 52 people and injured hundreds more on the capitals public transport network. For many, most clearly for those who survived the terrorist attack or lost loved ones, the coordinated suicide bombings remain as vivid now as if they happened yesterday.
London and the UK would never be quite the same again after the explosions that ripped through through three tube trains and a bus, bringing a cruel end to Londons celebratory mood - the previous day the nation was awarded the 2012 Olympics.
With a significant terrorist assault in London four years after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the US, Britain was embedded even deeper into the so-called war on terror. Community tensions ramped up, anti-terror laws became increasingly archaic, police and security services powers more sweeping.
Today, the country has been asked to observe a minutes silence at 11.30am in memory of the victims of the atrocity as a service at St Pauls Cathedral attended by David Cameron and the Duke of York takes place.
Across Londons public transport network, announcements will be halted and bus drivers asked to bring vehicles to a stop if they can do so safely. Tube services would run as normal but passengers would be asked to observe the silence and platform and other announcements would be paused.
Wreaths will be laid beforehand at the permanent Hyde Park memorial to the tragedy, where a second service, to be attended by the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, will take place later, featuring music, a series of readings and the laying of flowers.
As 7 July 2005 dawned, Prime minister Tony Blair and the Queen were among those leading celebrations after Londons Olympic bid emerged victorious.
But Mohammed Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Jermaine Lindsay, 19, had already set in motion devastating plans that bring the jubilant atmosphere to an end.
The four men met at Luton station that morning where they took a train to Kings Cross in London. They embraced and separated to carry out their deadly missions.
Within three minutes of 8.50am, Tanweer detonated his bomb at Aldgate, Khan set his device off at Edgware Road and Lindsay blew himself up between Kings Cross and Russell Square.
Hussain detonated his device on board the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square at 9.47am.
Twenty-six died in the bombing at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line, six in the bombing at Edgware Road on the Circle Line, seven in the bombing at Aldgate on the Circle Line and 13 in the bombing on the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square. Hundreds more were injured.

Google revs up carpooling with Waze app in Israel trial
RideWith uses technology developed by the Israeli start-up bought by Google to connect drivers with people travelling in same direction
Waze, whose app provides real-time traffic information, is testing a carpooling service in Israel.
Carpooling could be set for a new trip around the block following a decision by Google to test a new app in Israel .
RideWith uses technology developed by Waze , an Israeli start-up bought by Google in 2013 for about $1bn.
Its navigation system, which uses data from users smartphones to give live traffic information, learns the routes drivers most frequently take to work and matches them up with people wanting to travel in the same direction.
It is aimed at people who work for the same company and live reasonably close to each other.
Related: LAPD chief's claim that Waze 'helps criminals' leaves many in blank disbelief
An estimated 200,000 people participate in carpooling in Israel already.
Unlike ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, drivers using RideWith cannot profit from participating and thus the app relies to some degree on goodwill.
They can charge a modest fee that is based on the distance travelled and wear and tear, with a maximum price set. Waze will take a 15% cut.
Drivers will be limited to two journeys a day, with more passengers than drivers expected initially.
Waze said it was conducting a small, private beta test in the greater Tel Aviv area for a carpooling scheme, but had nothing further to announce.
The service is expected to be offered in other parts of Israel if the Tel Aviv trial is successful.
The Waze app is available on Android and iOS and allows users to see friends who are driving to the same destination if connected via Facebook.
The non-profit format of RideWith could improve its chances of being accepted more readily if Google decides to introduce the app in other countries.
Uber is battling opposition from taxi drivers and regulators in numerous markets.
Last week, it shut down the UberPop service , which allowed non-professional drivers to take passengers, in France following the arrest of two executives and protests from taxi drivers.
In May, a court in Milan ordered the company to stop offering the service in Italy .
Uber has not offered the Pop service in the UK, where it operates as a registered minicab company.

        <title>Beer and business: the unexpected benefits of water access in Cameroon</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/07/beer-and-business-the-unexpected-benefits-of-water-access-in-cameroon</Link>

When the government of Cameroon started a solar-powered water distribution system in the north of the country, the objective was to improve access to potable water and to ease irrigation for farmers in an area beset by drought, water-related illnesses and an influx of refugees fleeing Boko Haram attacks.
Related: Access to clean water and sanitation around the world  mapped
But the pioneering $1.3m project has had an unexpected effect: most of the recipients of the water in the local village of Mindif are using it to start small businesses, which they see as the best way of adapting to the increasingly tough climatic conditions and to overcome poverty.
Using the water source to invest in businesses shows how water resources can be used to build resilience among very poor communities, said Zachee Nzoh Ngandembou, the coordinator of the Center for Environment and Rural Transformation (Cerut), a Cameroonian NGO helping local communities, especially women, invest in income-generating activities to fight poverty.
Using the sun to combat the lack of water
In the parched six neighbouring villages - Mindif, Larie, Katchel, Dir Irlagare, Mayo Bahehel and Ouro Dole  many herders had lost nearly all their animals, their main sources of income, as a result of the regions erratic rainfall and drying groundwater supplies.
The new water supply system uses a 2,500 cubic metre water tower, built into the hills 15 km from Mindif. Using power from solar panels, the water is pumped up from an underground reservoir and distributed through a network of pipes to Mindif and the other villages.
Using the overabundance of sunshine, the system pumps more than 40,000 litres of potable water to the villages per day, providing families with water they desperately need, and rendering cases of water-related diseases a thing of the past, says water project engineer Jorel Kom. Experts involved the project are confident that the water will not run out.
Related: Decade of drought: a global tour of seven recent water crises
In the villages, more than 40 water storage containers collect the supplied water, which is delivered into household containers using a low-maintenance hand pump. Just one year after the project, clean drinking water is available to 80% of people in the villages.
Turning water into beer
With support from the government, Cerut gave out small grants of around 1,000 to more than 200 women to invest in businesses such as farming, soft drinks processing and cattle-rearing.
Ayisha Bouba, a farmer in Mindif, says that the new water supply project is a huge help to women who previously had to walk long distances to find water.
More than 60% of the women who benefited from the water supply and grants from Cerut are now involved in one business type or another, especially the brewing of Bil-Bil beer, a popular drink in the Sahel region. Farmers who grow millet used in the beer say better access to water has also improved their business prospects, both in production output and sales. Demand for the drink has become very high, especially in neighbouring northern Nigeria due to scarcity triggered by insecurity from Boko Haram attacks.
My business has since grown bigger, attracting more customers who no longer doubt the source of water used for production, said Bouba. She says that with constant water supply her millet farm has increased production from 20 tonnes to more than 80 tonnes in less than a year.
Government water experts say NGOs such as Plan Cameroon and Unicef spare no efforts to improve conditions around water supply in northern Cameroon communities, where there are recurrent cases of cholera.
The government and many development partners have provided more than 1,000 boreholes to date, says Parfait Ndeme from the Ministry of Mines, Water Resources and Energy . The cost of providing potable water in the Sahel region might be three times more costly than in the rest of Africa. Distance is one major factor that influences cost and the arid climate in the region makes it difficult to have underground water all year round.
Essimi Menye, Cameroons Minister of Agriculture, hopes more solar-powered water distribution projects will be constructed in neighbouring northern Nigeria, Niger and Chad to minimis e water-related diseases.
Related: Farmers versus big business: the politics of irrigation in Tanzania
We will encourage the provision of more water sources that will permit farmers to improve on the quality and quantity of their production and fight against poverty and hunger in the desert-stricken northern region of Cameroon and beyond. says Menye. There can be no development and improvement in livelihood without water.

Ice caves near Seattle collapse in high temperatures, killing one hiker
Following danger warnings, the popular hiking destination partially collapsed due to unseasonably warm weather, killing one person and injuring four others

Ice caves popular with hikers north-east of Seattle partially collapsed, killing one person and leaving at least four others injured, officials said.
Mondays collapse came after authorities warned that the caves were especially dangerous because of warming temperatures.
The person who died remained buried under the debris at the Big Four Ice Caves east of Verlot, Snohomish County sheriffs spokeswoman Shari Ireton said late Monday night. The recovery effort was suspended at nightfall.
All victims were believed accounted for, Ireton said.
Three of the injured, including a 25-year-old man in critical condition, were airlifted to a Seattle trauma center. They included a seriously injured 35-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman in satisfactory condition, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg said. Their injuries included cuts and leg and pelvis fractures.
A fourth person, a juvenile girl with minor injuries, was sent to an Everett, Washington, hospital, Ireton said. Providence regional medical center in Everett also expected a second patient, spokeswoman Diane Torrance said late Monday night.
The ice caves have been closed until further notice.
The first call to emergency services came in about 5.38pm Monday and the collapse probably happened about 45 minutes earlier, Ireton said. There was no cellphone service at the remote cave site.
The US forest service warned hikers in May that the ice caves were in their most dangerous state due to unseasonably warm weather. The caves about 70 miles north-east of Seattle are a popular hiking destination. Temperatures in the area Monday reportedly were in the 80s.
Multiple warning signs have been put up in the past year to indicate the danger, Tracy OToole, a spokeswoman for the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie national forest, told the Daily Herald of Everett.
On Sunday, a hiker filmed a section of the caves tumbling down. Several tourists were inside a cave during that collapse, but there were no reported injuries.
The caves are formed by avalanches that cascade down from nearby Big Four Mountain during winter and spring. Most years, one or more caves form as the ice melts.
In July 2010, an 11-year-old girl was killed near the caves by a bouncing chunk of ice. She never even went inside the caves.
Chloe Jakubowski, 18, told the Seattle Times that she and three friends drove about 15 miles to a pay phone to alert emergency crews to the injuries.
Everybody there, we grabbed everybody out and helped as best we could, she said.
Jakubowski told the Times she and a handful of others were in the cave when she heard a loud crack, then ice and debris cascaded down. She said she covered her head with her arms and crouched behind a giant rock of ice.
When she stood up, a woman next to her lay unconscious. Others nearby had cuts and broken bones.
It was extremely gruesome, honestly, said Jakubowski, who suffered scratches and other minor injuries. She said she saw the warning signs outside but went in anyway, adding she didnt see anything that seemed to point toward a collapse, and others already were in the cave.

        <title>Puerto Ricans have a message for the US: 'Give us the tools to help ourselves'</title>

The word colony conjures images of conquistadors and pilgrims, slavery and imperialism. But in Puerto Rico the supposed anachronism slips into daily conversations about the unstable present and an uncertain future.
Since the April day in 1899 when Americans formally took over the island, Puerto Ricans have felt uneasy about their status within the United States.
And as the island faces a debt crisis that has cratered its economy and sent its leaders to Washington to plead for more sovereign powers, the issue has taken on a new urgency.
Unique among US territories, Puerto Rico has a state-like government but is not a state: it draws all its authorities from Washington DC and is restricted in ways states are not. The islands ports can only do business with US ships, for instance, and the territory depends heavily on federal aid.
Most pressingly, however, the island lacks authority to either file for bankruptcy or restructure its $72bn municipal debt.
Governor Alejandro Garca Padilla argues that in its current form the debt is unpayable and that greater austerity will exacerbate already difficult living conditions . Padilla has stopped short of endorsing statehood, instead trying to focus on limited new powers.
But other politicians have been bolder. In April, Republican presidential frontrunner Jeb Bush endorsed statehood for Puerto Rico , the homeland of tens of thousands of recent migrants to Florida, the former governors home state.
Puerto Rican citizens ought to have the right to determine whether they want to be a state, he said. I think statehood is the best path, personally. To get the full benefits and responsibilities of citizenship, being a state is the only way to make that happen.
Proponents of statehood argue that its a simple matter of fairness. The islands Democratic delegate in Congress, Pedro Pierluisi , introduced a bill in February that could make Puerto Rico a state by 2021 should a majority of Puerto Ricans vote for statehood  as 61% did in a non-binding referendum in 2012.
One of the top fundraisers for Barack Obamas presidential campaigns, Andrs Lpez, has argued that the status quo is not only unequal but unsustainable.

But the issue has found virtually no traction in Congress, and even appeals over bankruptcy powers have divided the House.
Many Puerto Ricans are skeptical of statehood, saying formal inclusion in the union would do almost nothing to ameliorate pressing issues of unemployment, healthcare and housing.
Antonio Cuarro, a shop owner in Rio Piedras, said the debate amounted to empty rhetoric. Each government just uses one side or the other to get elected, he said. Its all the same.
San Juan legislator Luis Gallardo agreed, saying the campaign exists only in the imagination of our statehood politicians. A lot of people have tried to piggyback on the issue.
Gallardo said he was ambivalent: I dont know whats worse, not having federal bankruptcy powers or having federal income taxes on top of the highest local taxes in the country.
Others balked at becoming the 51st state. Attorney Manuel Rodriguez said statehood could help Puerto Ricans with access to the justice system, bankruptcy options and federal intervention, but its no magic solution and would not necessarily mean progress. Theres also no chance it will happen, given Congress.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans
Senator Ramn Nieves
A minority tapped into long-simmering nationalism and suggested more drastic changes  not quite the violent separatism of the 1960s and 70s, but a crusade for greater independence nonetheless.
Statehood is wrong for Puerto Rico because Puerto Rico is a nation, said senator Ramn Nieves. We consider ourselves Puerto Ricans, not Americans.
What Puerto Rico needs is more powers in its relationship with the US, and eventually a new relationship with the US.
Nieves said Puerto Rico should follow the model of the Marshall Islands, which entered into a compact association with the US in order to retain some rights but also to move toward sovereign nationhood.
We value our history and relationship with the US  thousands of Puerto Ricans have died in foreign wars for a century  but the traditional options of statehood or independence dont help us right now, he said.
Washington has done close to nothing to help, Nieves said, suggesting exemptions from trade restrictions, or guarantees on some bonds: The Treasury always says it will provide technical assistance but that doesnt mean anything.
I dont mean that they should hand us a check for $72bn, but if they cannot be a little more active or willing to help us, they should give us the tools to help ourselves.
Sovereignty is not the same as independence, Nieves concluded. All independent nations are sovereign, but not all sovereign nations are independent.
In casual conversation many Puerto Ricans refer to the territory as a country, and occasionally as a colony. Monuments to Spanish and Latin American history and culture dominate San Juan: Miguel de Cervantes, Juan Ponce de Len and Simon Bolvar all stand tall in the city. References to the US are rarer: a statue of Abraham Lincoln in the old city, the outposts of federal agencies and tourists.
The relationship with the US has aggravated our problems, said Ataveyra Hernandez, a former adviser to the governor. Puerto Ricans are hugely dependent on the government, which depends on federal money. Its a structural problem, and theres an urgent need to renegotiate the relationship.
The Caribbean is full of countries that are small just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies.
The Caribbean is full of countries just like us, and they control their own destinies, their resources, their policies
Ataveyra Hernandez
But with constant movement to and from the mainland, the close ties of families, and a continuing military presence on the island, emotional ties to the US remain strong for Puerto Ricans born on both shores. Both flags dot homes in San Juan.
Some view the question of independence more dispassionately. A metro employee at the Rio Piedras stop simply waved her hand toward the desolate plaza nearby.
Look at where we are, she said. Were not ready for that, no way.
In practical terms, Puerto Ricans already enjoy most of the same perks as other Americans, including US passports and billions in welfare from the federal government, though their semi-autonomous government is restricted by and depends heavily on the US. They cannot vote for president and lack a congressional representative who can vote outside of House committees.
But new arrivals to the US who change their residency will be able to vote in the 2016 presidential election, and they could potentially sway key states such as Florida.

        <title>Malcolm Turnbull: we must not amplify threat of Isis</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/07/malcolm-turnbull-we-must-not-amplify-threat-of-isis</Link>

Malcolm Turnbull has warned against over-hyping the threat posed by Islamic State, arguing it is important not to lend any credibility or currency to the grandiose delusions of the jihadists.
The communications minister used a speech delivered at the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night to make a plea for civility, calm and proportionality in Australias national security debate.
Tony Abbott has recently delivered an explicit warning that the Daesh death cult is coming for us, however, Turnbull argued it was important not to get sucked into the Isis strategy and ourselves become amplifiers of their wickedness and significance.
The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has previously made a direct comparison between the rise of Isis and the rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, but Turnbull reasoned Daesh was not Hitlers Germany, Tojos Japan or Stalins Russia.
Turnbull said on Tuesday night it was vital not to underestimate the security threat posed by Isis, but it was important also to preserve a sense of perspective given the organisations resorting to Hollywood techniques to amplify its significance.
Its leaders dream that they, like the Arab armies of the seventh and eighth century, will sweep across the Middle East into Europe itself, the communications minister said on Tuesday night.
They predict that before long they will be stabling their horses in the Vatican. Well Idi Amin wasnt the King of Scotland either.
We should be careful not to say or do things which can be seen to add credibility to those delusions.

In addition to the coming for us reference, the prime minister used the occasion of a Magna Carta lecture delivered in late June to note that Isis currently dominates an area about the size of Italy with eight million people. In the same outing, Abbott added that: Islamist terrorism confronts the world with a chilling choice: submit or die.
Turnbulls intervention at the Sydney Institute was a wide-ranging contribution which traversed the importance of the rule of law and also revisited some of the philosophical territory he invoked during the governments recent internal debate about its citizenship-stripping proposal .
An ambition by the prime minister and the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to bypass the courts and allow citizenships to be revoked at the discretion of a minister ran aground when a number of cabinet ministers, including Turnbull, objected to that proposal on the basis that it was likely to be unconstitutional.
Turnbull referred to the recent dispute explicitly, noting the government in the end chose to build on existing legal provisions instead of proceeding with a proposal which would give the minister the discretion to revoke Australian citizenship if he believed the person affected had engaged in terrorist activities.
The rule of law is respected because a person whose citizenship ceases in those circumstances has full recourse to the Australian courts under the constitution to contest the matter on its merits, he said.

The communications minister opened his address by arguing that in a policy sense, the Abbott government had got the balance between security and individual liberty right.

But he cautioned the national conversation about security policy needed to proceed in a considered manner respectful of the views and experience of others.
Echoing the principles he articulated during the citizenship policy debate, Turnbull told the Sydney Institute the Australian constitution empowered the courts for good reason.
To further nail the point, he quoted the founder of the Liberal party , Robert Menzies, from a speech from 1942, making the point that the law exists to protect individual freedom  even in a time of war.
If the day is to come when the courts are to be closed to the aggrieved citizen, when the Kings writ is not to run because popular uproar wills it so, when the appeal to the law is to be an occasion of scoffing, then that day will cast a black shadow across British freedom, Turnbull quotes Menzies as saying. The laws greatest benefits are for the minority man  the individual.
The communications minister noted that it could be hard to strike the right balance between the imperatives of delivering security for the citizenry and ensuring basic rights and liberties were not comprised.
We need to recognise that getting the balance right is not easy, not least because the balance may shift over time, and we are more likely to do so if there is a thoughtful and well informed public debate weighing up the reality of the national security threat, the effectiveness of particular proposed measures and then asking whether those measures do infringe on our traditional freedoms and if so whether the infringement is justifiable, Turnbull said.
It is important to remember that people and societies with an equal determination to defeat terrorism can have different views on what is the right balance and, indeed, what the right measures are.
Turnbull noted it was stupid to brand critics terrorist sympathisers if they questioned the effectiveness of national security policies  a description as stupid as describing those who advocate them as proto-fascists.
He said security and liberty were a complex balancing act, not an easy left/right divide.

On Tuesday evening, Turnbull was yet to rule out appearing on the next edition of Q&amp;A program.
Despite a ban on Coalition MPs from appearing on the show, Turnbull is scheduled to take part in next weeks panel and says whether he does will depend on the circumstances.
Time will tell  stay tuned, he said.

        <title>What Greek, and German, history can teach us about today's crisis</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/what-greek-and-german-history-can-teach-us-about-todays-crisis</Link>
        <Description/>

In an arty cinema at the end of the 60s I watched Costa-Gavrass stylish political thriller Z which satirised the brutal military regime then ruling Greece . When the film ended the audience enthusiastically applauded, something I had never previously seen in a cinema, and have rarely seen since.
As Europes acknowledged home of political philosophy and practice, Greece of the hated military dictatorship had a special place in the hearts of many Europeans, as it did for Lord Byron when he went off to fight (and die) for Greek independence in 1824. This weekends Solidarity with Greece demonstrations, in small villages as well as major cities, shows it still does.
In its showdown with creditors, the Greek government of Alexis Tsipras exploits this romantic attachment. And why not? Small countries have to use the assets at their disposal in a big world.
But sentiment alone is rarely an adequate guide to action, is it? The Greeks have a case against the counter-productive and excessive severity imposed on them by their creditors. But the creditors also have a case against the Greeks.
Foreigners did not make their government fiddle the entry qualifications to join the eurozone, rack up debts or force citizens to evade their taxes, unless you count the legacy of the rackety Ottoman empire which ruled Greece from 1453 to 1821.
But the very concept of Greece has always been both powerful and fragile, its existence more usually sustained by foreign or domestic tyranny than by sophisticated philosophies from the 4th and 5th centuries BC. Disunity and rebellion have also been characteristic features of Greek politics and identity.
After defeating successive invasions launched by the mighty Persian empire at Marathon (490BC), at Thermopylae (sort of), at Salamis, Plataea and Mycale, did not the Greek city states soon succumb to civil war which ended in Athenss defeat by militaristic Sparta? Yes.
And so it went on. Domination by Macedonia meant that the spread of Greek culture across the Mediterranean  previously led by the soft power of trade and settlement  was expanded east and south by the conquests of Alexander the Great (356BC to 323BC). The Romans later conquered, but deferred (though captured, Greece took its wild conqueror capture, wrote Horace the poet) to the Greeks, much as the Americans did towards Britain for a while. We are the Greeks to their Romans, the future PM, Harold Macmillan, once told a colleague.
In the western Roman empire Rome duly fell (476AD) to barbarian invasions. The eastern half, though battered, morphed into the Christian Byzantine empire which staggered on, a Greek entity, for 1,000 years before Constantinople finally fell to the Muslim Ottomans after the great siege of 1453.
Does any of this matter to the bean counters in Brussels or Berlin this summer? It should.
So should the bean borrowers of Athens acknowledge that German fear of excessive debt and a debauched currency is rooted in troubled German history, the Weimar Republic which led to the Nazi coup, and the fragility of a national identity ravaged by the brutal thirty years war (1618-48).
When Greece restored national sovereignty and unity in 1832, Germany was still 40 years away from doing the same.
If Greeks see themselves as victims, so do Germans, who have picked up the bill to rescue East Germany well within living memory and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans).
This is psychologically risky territory as Angela Merkel and her advisers decide what Germany  and the EU  must do to rescue Greece from its own brinkmanship and save Europe from its lackadaisical management of the crisis.
Germans picked up the bill to rescue East Germany and widely resented it (but they were at least fellow Germans)
But rebellion comes more naturally to Greeks than to Germans who have often traded liberty for security, not always wisely, but understandable with fluid frontiers which an island people like us should gratefully acknowledge.
In the Ottoman centuries the Greeks had an instinct to side with the Caliphs enemies, rising in revolt many times and usually being hammered for their pains. The fact that Venetian Corfu remained free and prosperous and that Crete held out until 1670 (the long siege was a fashionable cause for years) only fed an appetite for defiance which broke into open, ultimately successful revolt in 1821. Cue Lord Byron.
Two further points are worth registering here.
Greeces successive 19th- and 20th-century wars to regain its historic territory, usually involving neighbouring Turkey (as the Ottoman successor state became after defeat in the first world war), were bloody, traumatic affairs. We hear a lot about the Turkish Armenian massacres (were they genocide?), less about the one million Greeks living abroad (resident for centuries) who may have died during waves of displacement and expulsion from Asia Minor. In invading Turkey in 1919, Greece was a part-author of its own misfortune: it lost.
None of this is good for people. Greece had rival governments, once pro-German, once pro-British, during the first world war and remained divided during the inter-war years. Greeks fought like tigers against the invading Italians in 1940 who had to be rescued by the Germans. Even Hitler acknowledged the courage of the Greek resistance which continued long after defeat.
Related: A brief history of German-Greek relations
But the German occupation was savage, both to Greeks and their economy. Many starved. Worse, the European peace of 1945 was followed by the Greek civil war of 1946 to 1949 in which Britain and the US backed the Greek government and the Greek communists were backed by Titos government in next-door Yugoslavia.
Stalin had agreed to leave Greece in the western sphere of influences in his percentages agreement with Churchill at the Kremlin in 1944. He just forgot to tell the Greek comrades. After yet another savage war, they lost, Greece joined Nato  much as it did the EU in 1981 after the Greek colonels were ousted when again the Turks invaded Cyprus (1974)  and Greek democracy was restored.
So the divided legacy of modern Greece remains and is vivid well within living memory  royalist and republican, left and right, urban and rural. The Syriza coalition, led by Tsipras, represents the defeated side in the civil war as Tsipras, a youthful communist of bourgeois stock, explicitly acknowledged in gestures made when he became prime minister in January.
Geographical determinists, the people who argue we are primarily shaped by our environment, might argue that a country with Europes longest coastline  more than 8,000 miles and 2,000 islands (mostly unpopulated)  is bound to be fractious.
In one of his Outliers essays, Malcolm Gladwell, made the point differently when he argued that herdsmen who tend sheep and goats on marginal land  in Greece, Sicily, Ireland or Tennessee  have to have short fuses or their neighbours will steal their animals. Hence the importance of the blood feud which persists. Arable farmers dont have them, its harder to steal wheat.
Be that as it may, Tsipras has his new mandate to negotiate with Brussels and Berlin on an emphatic 60% no vote from a deeply divided nation. Its not hard to see how things could get nasty quickly. And remember, those Germans feel hard done by and put upon too.

A car carrying a suicide bomber hit a vehicle containing foreign forces in Kabul on Tuesday, wounding at least two people, the second such attack by the Taliban within a week.
Elsewhere in the capital, gunfire and an explosion were heard as insurgents entered a building close to an installation used by Afghanistans intelligence agency, a police official said on Tuesday. No further details were immediately available.
Taliban militants and other insurgents have stepped up attacks on Afghan and foreign forces this year, following the withdrawal of most foreign troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2014.
As security has deteriorated across the country, some districts have fallen under Taliban control. The growing presence of forces loyal to Islamic State has fuelled concern that parts of the country are slipping out of Kabuls grasp.
An Afghan security official at the scene of the convoy attack said the vehicle carrying foreign forces caught fire after the explosion in the Shah Shaheed area of eastern Kabul.
The blast blew the vehicle off course and into a wall, leaving behind an empty charred hulk.
I can confirm that a suicide car bomber targeted foreign forces, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told Reuters.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. Last Tuesday, a suicide bomber struck a convoy of US. troops.
There were no fatalities in the latest attack apart from the bomber, the coalition said in a statement, declining to give details.
In this incident, one foreigner and one bystander were wounded, police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi said.
Gunfire and an explosion were reported from a second attack in the city, he added. We have reports that insurgents have entered a building, Karimi said, adding that the attack site was near an installation used by the intelligence agency.
About 9,800 U.S troops remain in Afghanistan, down from a peak of around 100,000 in 2011. The majority are training Afghan forces but a few thousand are still engaged in combat operations against the Taliban and others.
On a visit to Kabul on Saturday, US senator John McCain called for American troops to stay longer than planned to prevent gains by the militants.
The current schedule is for the military to draw down to an embassy presence by the end of 2016.

Nobody knows exactly when or why the witnesses and small-time crooks caught up in one of Indias biggest-ever corruption scandals began dying under mysterious circumstances. But in the past two years, thats whats happened to more than two dozen people implicated in a $1bn test-rigging scheme.
Even by standards in India, where corruption is routine , the scale of the scam in the central state of Madhya Pradesh is mind-boggling. Police say that since 2007, tens of thousands of people have paid hefty bribes to middlemen, bureaucrats and politicians to rig test results for medical schools and government jobs. Around 2,000 people have been arrested and more than 500 are on the run. Hundreds of medical students are in prison  along with several bureaucrats and the states education minister. Even the governor has been implicated.
Police have had their hands full racing to meet a deadline in the criminal probe. And now they are faced with the deaths of more witnesses and suspects. Last week, police said, one of those accused died after having chest pains in prison, another drowned in a village pond and a third died of a liver infection.
The police say they keep coming up against a wall in their investigation every time someone is found dead
Last Saturday, television reporter Akshay Singh died while investigating a suspects death. Singh sipped tea during an interview and began coughing and foaming at the mouth, according to media reports. He was rushed to hospital, where doctors said he had suffered a heart attack. Police said the initial examination did not reveal anything suspicious.
The states government, run by the Bharatiya Janata party, has said that no conspiracy was found in the recent deaths. But others involved in the case fear otherwise. The states chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said last Sunday that his mind is in agony and pain and promised that all the deaths will be investigated.
The police say they keep coming up against a wall in their investigation every time someone is found dead, said Chandresh Bhushan, chairman of the special investigation team that was appointed by the state court to monitor the police probe. We ask them, Why are so many dying in road accidents in this case? Does this have any link to the scam? There is no evidence of a link yet, but we cannot overrule it, either.
Cheating on school and college tests is commonplace in India. A few months ago, photographs of parents hanging precariously from school windows to throw cheat sheets to their children caused nationwide outrage.
But in Madhya Pradesh, cheating on tests became a sophisticated racket using various approaches. High-scoring students from around the country toting fake identity cards were brought in to impersonate applicants taking tests. Applicants would be told to leave their answer sheets blank so that scorers could fill them out in a separate room. And scores would be manipulated by testing board officials to favour bribe-paying candidates.
In July 2013, after a tipoff from whistleblowers, police arrested eight impersonators taking the medical school test in Indore. Police say that the scheme was operated by a syndicate of agents, doctors, officials and politicians across five states and that there was no single ringleader.
There is so much information with the investigators that it could bring the government down, said Ashish Chaturvedi, 26, one of the whistleblowers. He has been attacked 14 times by unknown assailants, he said. Six of the assaults took place in front of a police officer assigned by a court to protect him last year.
But so far they have just gone after students, middlemen and lower officials, Chaturvedi said. They are not even probing the roles of the big fish in the state.
The news portal the Wire called the scam one of the most complex, multi-layered scandals affecting public life in India, one that is fast acquiring the shades of a macabre crime thriller.
Many of the mysteriously dead are young  either students who paid money and made it into medical schools or job seekers trying to take tests to become police officers, schoolteachers, forest rangers and food inspectors.
Bribes for admission to medical schools ranged from $15,000 to $40,000
Some of the accused, called racketeers in police files, have died from poison. Others died in freak road accidents, or by consuming too much alcohol, or by hanging. One medical college dean died in a fire. A medical student was found dead on railway tracks. The son of the state governor was found dead at his fathers home in March, ostensibly from a brain haemorrhage.
Last week, Narendra Singh Tomar, a 29-year-old veterinarian who was in prison on charges of arranging impersonators for medical school applicants, complained of chest pain, police said, and died soon after in a hospital. His family told reporters that they suspected Tomar was murdered.
A day later, a 40-year-old assistant professor at a medical college, Rajendra Arya, who was out on bail after being charged in the case, died of a heart attack.
My father had switched his cellphone off for the last six days, said Rahul Arya, his 18-year-old son. He was getting some calls that caused a lot of stress to him. If indeed there [is] no foul play in these deaths, someone needs to ask why so many people are dying of natural causes in this case.
Everybody was making money, said Vivek Tankha, a lawyer representing the whistleblowers in the supreme court. It is no wonder that we are now witnessing one of the biggest cover-up operations in Indian corruption history.
Bribes for admission to medical schools ranged from $15,000 to $40,000.
On a recent sultry morning, Chaturvedi, the whistleblower, rode his bicycle down the narrow lane in Gwalior, followed by a police constable on another cycle, sweating and panting. The guard is supposed to trail him wherever he goes, but sometimes the officer fails to show up.
I worry about my safety because my task is not finished yet, Chaturvedi said as he pedalled. If I am not careful now, my whole battle of the last five years will go to waste.

When I wrote about Georgios and Barbara Karvouniaris , destitute but dignified Greeks who had lost jobs and home, and now live in a donated caravan on food hand-outs, I realised it was a powerful story that put a human face on Greeces tragedy.
What I had not anticipated was the number of Guardian readers, from all corners of the globe, who got in touch asking how they could help: from a businessman keen to commit to a monthly stipend of 100 a month, to a family wanting to send a cheque for $300.
It is impossible for people in the UK to hear stories like this, so close to home, and do nothing at all, one reader wrote. Thanks for highlighting whats happening to the little people  the stories of institutions, broad-stroke decisions and the mistakes of bureaucrats simply dont paint a true picture of whats happening.
Another said he was very moved by the plight of the Karvouniarises, and would like to donate a few dollars, while a third said she found the story so tragic and moving  is there any way at all that I can contribute something to help make their lives easier?
I was even contacted by a group of renewable energy researchers at a leading British university who wanted  if it was logistically possible  to explore the idea of donating and installing a solar panel for Georgios and Barbaras caravan, which is not connected to the grid.
The Guardian suspects there are similar cases of private charity helping ease the pain for countless Greeks in their hour of need.

French authorities are investigating the theft of roughly 200 detonators plus grenades and plastic explosives from a military site in southern France .
The thefts at the Miramas site, which is operated by a combination of military services west of Marseille, appeared to have taken place overnight from Sunday to Monday. The break-in came with France on its highest level of alert for terrorism following deadly attacks in January and June.
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said an investigation had begun into charges of theft with break-in carried out by a criminal group and fraudulent entry into a military compound.
An official with the gendarmerie police force, which generally runs law enforcement in more rural areas of France, said the thief or thieves appeared to have cut through a fence to enter the high-security site.
The defence ministry and a spokesman for the French military did not immediately respond to calls and text messages from the Associated Press seeking details.
The mayor of Miramas, Frederic Vigouroux, said he did not know precisely what was stolen, but said it was the first theft at the site. He said the outer fences were broken into, and that nine storehouses were affected.
It wasnt cotton candy that was stolen, he said. These are dangerous munitions. Everything is inherently dangerous.
The 200-hectare (500-acre) base sits on the outskirts of the town of 30,000 and stocks munitions of the type used in French military operations in Mali and Afghanistan.

The trial of Burmese migrant workers accused of killing British tourists Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao island last September is to start this week. The high-profile case has thrown the spotlight on Thailands legal failings and distressed the grieving families.
The criminal trial of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo will begin on Wednesday at a court on the nearby and larger island of Koh Samui and is expected to end on 25 September. A verdict is expected in October.
The legal team representing the 22-year-old bar and restaurant workers is made up of pro-bono lawyers and human rights activists who accuse Thai police of improperly collecting evidence at the crime scene, intimidation and abuse of witnesses and suspects, and not sharing key forensic evidence with the defence, a move they say seriously impedes a fair trial.
Thai police have denied any wrongdoing.
The court in April ordered that DNA and other physical evidence linking the Burmese migrant workers to the murder could be independently checked, a move the suspects lawyers said could help ensure justice is served. But the defence was later told the court would only answer these requests on the first day of the trial.

The defence has also accused the UK Foreign Office of being complicit in ensuring the men will not receive a fair trial after officials in London also refused to share any details about the prosecutions case. Their lawyers say this information is vital to allow the two men to defend themselves.
Metropolitan police detectives were sent to Thailand last year to look over the case and report back to officials and the families.
In the runup to the trial, the Guardian has learned that UK authorities have now provided some information to the defence.
There has been a lot more advance disclosure from the British side, said Andy Hall, a migrants rights activist from Britain who is working for the defence.
Weve also had positive cooperation from UK-based witnesses, Hall said.

Hall refused to detail what information had been provided, which agency provided it or how it would affect the trial. A UK Foreign Office spokeswomen also refused to comment on that issue but said consular officers provided support and assistance to the families of Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Miller, 24, from Jersey.
We want to see whoever committed these murders brought to justice through a fair and transparent process, the spokeswoman said.
Hall said he and the lead defence lawyer, Nakhon Chompuchat, were working with the defence to ensure justice though a fair trial to all involved, including the families of Witheridge and Miller.
Retracted confessions
During a frantic two-week investigation last year, Thailands prime minister, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, said he believed migrant workers were the culprits. Soon afterwards, the two young Burmese men were arrested.
The men initially admitted to the murder of Miller, who suffered head injuries and drowned in shallow water, and the rape and murder of Witheridge, who died from severe head injuries. Police said they were motivated by sexual jealousy after seeing the Britons together on the beach.

They were taken to the crime scene at the beach by the police  handcuffed and wearing body armour and helmets  to make a very public reenactment of the crime. But they then retracted their confessions, saying they had been tortured and threatened with death by their interrogators.
Human rights groups including Amnesty International have become involved, noting that Burmese migrant workers, of whom there are around 2.5 million, have previously been wrongly accused of crimes by Thai police.
Rights group Reprieve has also expressed alarm that British police might have provided evidence to Thai authorities who are seeking a death sentence. Under a British government protocol, British police and officials should not normally provide evidence when defendants face capital punishment in a foreign jurisdiction without getting assurances that a death sentence will not be carried out.
[UK authorities] must ensure that the Thai authorities comply with their international human rights obligations, Maya Foa, director of Reprieves death penalty team, told the Guardian.
The start of the trial will last three days, in which the prosecution is expected to call on witnesses who first came across the bodies.
Witheridges family said in the joint statement in December that UK detectives who travelled to Thailand cooperated with Thai police.
We would like to stress that as a family we are confident in the work that has been carried out into these atrocious crimes and want to remind both press and public that they do not have the full facts to report and make comment on at this stage, the family said.
Millers family said evidence collected by the Royal Thai police will be presented at court and we hope the suspects are granted a fair and transparent trial. We are thankful of the oversight of pressure groups such as Reprieve and Amnesty.
From what we have seen, the suspects have a difficult case to answer. The evidence against them appears to be powerful and convincing, they said.
Please remember that this is above all a story of two wonderful young people, David and Hannah, killed in the prime of their lives in a senseless and brutal way.

One afternoon towards the end of May a violent wind howled through Bogand, the main town in Gnagna province, in eastern Burkina Faso . Raising a storm of dust and sand, it plunged the streets into semi-darkness, driving roaming goats crazy. In villages across Gnagna people connect these extreme climate events with deteriorating living standards. They explain how these increasingly frequent red winds wreak havoc, burying their crops in sand, destroying their homes, and spreading disease among their flocks.
In late May, on the great Gnagna plain, the earth is dry, with deep cracks. An occasional tree  usually red acacia (Vachellia seyal)  stands out as a patch of green. In the villages, most of the wells have dried up. It is the toughest part of the year, when reserves from the previous harvest run low and the next one is not yet ripe. And still there is no rain.
In 2014, just 538mm of rain fell here. Over the past 30 years, average annual rainfall has dropped by 200mm. The Sahel climate zone is steadily spreading further south. Bogand used to enjoy a Sudanese-Sahelian climate, but it is now borderline, says Claire Gaillardou, head of the risks and disasters department at the Action Against Hunger (ACF) mission in Burkina Faso. Since 1975 the [average] temperature has risen by 0.8C.
Tnidano Tissa, 78, remembers how the village looked when he was a child. There were great African mahogany, locust bean, fig and shi trees, all of which produced fruit. In the rainy season, long grass protected the ground. All year long there was a bit of plant cover. Wed see antelopes, big savannah monitors and hyenas, he says, drawing a smile from the youngest members of his audience, who have never seen such creatures.
The plant cover has vanished, and trees are now a rarity. With diminishing rainfall, the soil is blown away by winds that grow ever more violent. There are no longer any trees to slow them down, says Lankoand Diagnogou, 38, a neighbour of Tissas.
At Tindandou, 45km away, Diawari Barbibil, 63, is equally desperate. The loss of plant cover has speeded up soil degradation, and the rainy season is very short, he says.
The rain comes later and is interspersed with long periods of drought. Across the region, rainfall is increasingly erratic and increasingly intense. The rain cuts into the ground and washes away the little humus  which is essential to the fertility of the earth  it contains.
That, in turn, can cause flooding, because water has difficulty penetrating bone-dry earth. Some years the run-off rate can be as high as 40%, Gaillardou explains. ACF is trying to help communities adapt to these extreme climate events, which seem to get steadily worse. Assistance involves learning farming techniques that keep the water in the soil and reduce the effects of erosion.
This year Barbibil prepared three one-hectare fields, digging semi-circular hollows along the contour lines to trap as much rain as possible and create better conditions for sowing. He hopes this technique will yield a bigger crop.
Ten years ago, Barbibil was still harvesting five cartloads of grain. We could live very nicely on what I grew, and I could sell the surplus, he says. But in the last few years the soil has become so poor that I dont have anything to sell. The two cartloads I bring home are barely enough to feed the family. The rest of the crop is only fit for cattle-feed.
His 34-year-old son works with him now, and in all there are 16 mouths to feed. The rain stops before the millet has even had time to fully ripen. If theres no rain what you grow is worthless, Barbibil says. Due to the unpredictable rainfall he has had to give up the traditional crop of sorghum, which takes longer to ripen. He prefers to use white sorghum and pearl millet, with a shorter crop cycle.
In Burkina Faso in late May, as they waited anxiously for the next crop, more than 330,000 people faced food insecurity . In Gnagna province, with an average of seven people in each household, the situation is far worse than in the rest of the country. Farmers are producing less than half the food they need to survive. After four to six months their reserves run out. In the worst years, they have no option but to sell part or all of their livestock  if they have any  or run up debts.
When we run short of food, we have to turn to one of our neighbours in the village who has sufficient resources to lend us food, says Andr Dori, 38, who lives in Kongaye, in Gnagna province. Dori, who has four children, says he too can no longer meet his familys needs. These loans are in kind. With a 100% interest rate: for one sack of grain borrowed, I must pay back two. I am deep in debt, because my crops dont ripen properly, due to the climate. He has been unable to pay off any of his debts in recent years.
Dori hopes things will get better through the use of improved techniques. With more bountiful harvests, he says, he could feed his family and even buy livestock.

        <title>Bill Cosby: court documents open window into legal problems</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems</Link>

The release of documents on Monday from a civil lawsuit against Bill Cosby in 2005 offers the first glimpse inside the comics protracted legal problems involving allegations of sexual assaults raised over many years.
The case, brought by a former head of womens basketball at Temple University in Philadelphia, Cosbys alma mater, is the only legal proceeding relating to sexual assault allegations against Cosby that has ever been brought to conclusion, despite numerous accusations that have been brought against him by multiple women. Andrea Constand claimed that she had been drugged and molested by Cosby at his home in January 2005, but following a private settlement in the case, all documents relating to it were sealed, casting the whole matter under a deep layer of secrecy.

Constand herself has never spoken directly about the case since the settlement was reached in 2006.
Now, with the opening of the files following a federal court case brought by the Associated Press, a window has been opened into Cosbys behaviour under his own admission. It marks the first time that the actor has been heard, in his own words, directly referring to purchasing drugs for use in a sexual context.
The court documents include transcripts of the deposition of Cosby on 27 and 28 September 2005. In the course of the depositions, the comic was asked several questions about his purchasing of drugs, leading to tense exchanges between his lawyer Patrick OConnor and a lawyer for Constand, Dolores Troiani.
During the deposition, Cosby said that he had obtained seven prescriptions for the sedative quaalude.
You gave them to other people? he was asked.
Yes, he replied.
When Troiani tried to elicit from Cosby whether he had given the drug to other people knowing that to be illegal, OConnor intervened, instructing his client not to answer.
When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women you wanted to have sex with? asked Troiani.
Yes, replied Cosby.
Asked whether he had given young women the drug without their knowledge, the lawyer again intervened, advising him not to answer.
Cosby told the deposition that he got the quaaludes prescriptions in the 1970s and then kept them for several years.
The documents also include details of questions Cosby was asked under deposition about another woman, one of the so-called Jane Does who were called anonymously to give evidence in the Constand case. The woman told lawyers that at the age of 19 she met with Cosby and had sex with him after he gave her quaaludes.
In his deposition, Cosby said he met the witness in Las Vegas: She meets me backstage. I give her quaaludes. We then have sex. Cosby then goes on to say: I cant judge at this time what she knows about herself for 19 years, a passive personality.
Cosby adds that the witness was sweet in her personality. As far as I was concerned was well-mannered, didnt demand or give a feeling that she was above anyone. If anything, I think she may very well have been very happy to be around the showbusiness surroundings.
Starstruck? he was asked.
Youll have to ask her, Cosby replied.
The public opening of the documents comes at the end of a tough legal struggle for the Associated Press. On 17 June, lawyers representing the news agency delivered a motion to the federal courthouse for the eastern district of Pennsylvania requesting that they be included as an interested party for the unsealing of the court documents, including Cosbys testimony.
Cosbys lawyers argued that the unsealing of the documents would be terribly embarrassing for their client, the AP reported in June. But, on Monday, their request was granted by judge Eduardo Robreno.
Explaining his decision to release the papers, Robreno is scathing about Cosbys claim that he had a right to privacy. He said that Cosby had donned the mantle of public moralist and mounted the proverbial electronic or print soap box to volunteer his views on, among other things, childrearing, family life, education, and crime. To the extent that Defendant has freely entered the public square and thrust himself into the vortex of th[ese] public issues he has voluntarily narrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim.
Robreno said the public had a significant interest in the stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct.
The judge concludes: The nature of the allegations  sex, drugs, seduction, etc  do not cloak this case, including the depositions of one of the parties, with an automatic, or per se, seal of silence.
Since the allegations of sexual misconduct resurfaced last year, the comic has faced renewed legal actions against him. But so far all of them have floundered on the rock of time  the statute of limitations that restricts the period after an alleged crime in which prosecutions can be brought.

A Thai military court on Tuesday released 14 students held for almost two weeks for holding anti-coup protests in defiance of a ban on public gatherings, but the charges against them have not been dropped.
There had been growing calls for their release, including from the United Nations and the European Union, and public shows of support for the 14 have taken place across Thailand and among the Thai diaspora over the past few days.
Thailands military overthrew the previous democratic government last year after months of political unrest. The junta has since stifled dissent, barring political gatherings and debate.

Police asked to extend the students detention but today the court threw out that request, said Kisadang Nutjarat, a lawyer for the students.
They have released the kids from prison today. There are no conditions and there was no bail, he said, adding that charges against the students had not been dropped.
The students, part of a coalition of university groups from around Thailand, held street demonstrations across Bangkok against the ruling junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order.
They were arrested last month and charged with sedition.
Scores gathered outside a military court in Bangkok, shouting slogans and holding signs, to show their support for the students as 150 police officers stood guard nearby.

        <title>Australia's neighbours battle food security, deforestation: UN report</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/07/un-report-prompts-calls-for-australia-to-increase-foreign-aid-in-our-region</Link>

Some of Australias closest neighbours are struggling to address malnourishment, deforestation and sanitation, the United Nations final report on its millennium development goals shows, prompting aid organisations to call on the federal government to boost foreign aid.
The report released on Tuesday revealed progress towards food security in Oceania  which includes Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Nauru  had been slow, largely because of a heavy dependence on food imports by the small islands of the region.
Food security in this region is also hampered by natural and human-caused disasters, which often result in volatile prices and sudden and unpredictable changes in the availability of important staple foods, the report found.
Oceania also reported a net loss of forest in the first decade of the 15-year agenda, largely due to severe drought and forest fires in Australia, the report found.
Asia, on the other hand, registered a net gain of around 2.2m hectares annually between 2000 and 2010 following a net loss in the 1990s, it said.
This gain, mostly due to large-scale afforestation programs in China, offsets continued high rates of net loss in many countries in southern and south-eastern Asia.
The rate of new HIV infections has stagnated in south-east Asia and Oceania, the report showed, though stopped short of declining, while sanitation also remained a problem in areas of the Asia-Pacific region.
Australian Medical Association [AMA] vice president, Dr Stephen Parnis, said the Asia-Pacific region and in particular, Papua New Guinea, had among the lowest rates of access to safe sanitation in the world. A considerable number of Indigenous communities in Australia also lacked proper access to clean water and functioning sewerage services, he said.
Parnis reiterated previous calls for Australian and other world leaders to ensure that sanitation and easy access to safe water formed a key component when the next round of goals, called the sustainable development goals , were negotiated in September.
The Australian Council for International Development head of policy, Beth Sargent, said the report showed the millennium development goals had been a galvanising force for world leaders to come together to address poverty, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, disease, the environment and global partnership.
And while it showed the goals had led to progress in many of these areas, with the likelihood of a child dying before age five halved and a narrowing of disparities between boys and girls in education, there was much room for improvement in Australias region, Sargent said.
Australia needs to take away from this the need to boost our aid program and strongly focus on our region across a number of areas, she said.
We must look at issues of sustainable development, take strong action against climate change and play a fair role in refugee policy.
The UNICEF Australia head of advocacy, Aivee Robinson, said of the bad news from the report, too much of it was close to home and affected children.
In Indonesia, there were still more than 1.3m primary-school aged children not in school, she said. At current rates of progress and given projected population growth, it was estimated 68m more children under five would die from mostly preventable causes by 2030, while an estimated 119m children would be chronically malnourished.
So for all the progress we have made, we have still failed millions of children, she said.
The millennium development goals were amazing because they brought countries of the world together but, at the same time, required countries to focus on improving national averages.
In the rush to meet these national goals, many countries focused on easy-to-reach children rather than those in greatest need.
On the plus side, there had been a staggering improvement to the number of women in Indonesia with access to a skilled birth attendant, she said.
The report highlighted the responsibility Australia had to its neighbours. Were a member of the global community and we have a moral responsibilty to contribute adequate levels of overseas assistance, she said.
The repeated cuts weve seen to the overseas development aid budget, with 1bn cut this financial year , are not only deeply disappointing, but they will have real impact on childrens lives.
Guardian Australia has requested comment from the office of the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop.

International pressure is mounting on Greece and its European creditors to reach agreement and steer the eurozone away from a potentially disastrous Grexit.
The US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, told Greeces prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , and its new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, that Washington looked forward to a swift resolution to the crisis unfolding in Europe.
Tsipras told the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that Greece would bring a new proposal to the table at an emergency eurozone summit on Tuesday, days after Greeks voted overwhelmingly to reject the conditions of a previous bailout plan proposed by the countrys creditors.
Lew said he hoped a resolution would allow Greece to make difficult but necessary fiscal and structural reforms, return to growth, and achieve debt sustainability within the eurozone, a US treasury statement said.
Japans economics minister, Akira Amari, called on Greece and the EU to do everything possible to contain the fallout from the crisis, which on Monday sent share prices tumbling around Asia and saw losses for the euro.
Amari said all parties should strive towards a win-win deal that would keep Greece in the single currency, despite Greek voters rejection of austerity.
Greece has already done a lot to restore fiscal discipline, such as cutting pensions and wages, he told reporters. I understand why the Greek people are venting their frustration. Fiscal consolidation is not making progress. They are in deflation. The world expects Greece and the EU to cooperate on a final bail out plan.
Asian markets stabilised on Tuesday after suffering significant losses across the board the previous day, but investors remain cautious as long as doubts hang over the future of Greeces membership of the eurozone.
Their concerns centre on the volatility in financial markets and harm to economic growth that could follow a messy Greek exit from the eurozone.
Greece is in a difficult condition. Although there is volatility in the short term and discussion will be rough, I still expect a solution to be found to avoid a very nasty situation in the end, said Alain Bokobza, the Paris-based head of global asset allocation at Societe Generale, who is on a visit to Tokyo.
On Tuesday Japans Nikkei share index had risen 1.4% by mid-morning, having fallen by 1.2% the previous day. MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which fell to six-month low on Monday, was up 0.3%.
The euro rebounded from Mondays one-week low to fetch $1.1044.
Greece aside, Asian stocks are also being hit by rising concerns over huge losses on Chinese mainland stock markets in recent weeks.
Emergency liquidity measures introduced by Beijing over the weekend failed to halt volatile market movements, as Chinese shares fell again on Tuesday, casting doubt on the governments ability to stabilize markets in the worlds second-biggest economy.
We need to continue monitoring China shares carefully because to Japan, China could be a real risk if its market falls further, said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
Fujito warned that prolonged turmoil in Chinese stocks could lead to a slowdown in domestic consumption, which would adversely impact Japanese shares that are most exposed to movements in the Chinese economy.

The worlds oldest man, Sakari Momoi, who cited healthy eating and a good nights sleep as the secrets to a very long life, has died aged 112, Japanese media said.
Momoi, whose was born in Fukushima on 5 February 1903, was not alone in Japan in enjoying remarkable longevity : his successor is a compatriot, Yasutaro Koide, who was born just over a month later.
Momoi was born the year the teddy bear was introduced and the Wright brothers made their first powered flight. He was 42 when the second world war ended.
Local media said Momoi died at a care home in Tokyo where he had lived for many years.
We heard from his family ... that his health worsened one or two weeks ago, a local official said.
Momoi fell short of his longevity goal, revealed when he was awarded a plaque by Guinness World Records to mark his status as the worlds oldest man in August 2014.
Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and silver tie, he told reporters: I want to live for about two more years.
The former high school principal remained active well into his twilight years, practising calligraphy and joining in recreational activities at the hospital where he lived.
The title of the worlds oldest man now belongs to Koide, a resident of the central Japanese city of Nagoya, who was born in March 1903, according to the health ministry.
The worlds oldest person, New York resident Susannah Mushatt Jones, celebrated her 116th birthday on Monday. Born on 6 July 1899, the former housekeeper is known simply as T to her 100 nieces and nephews.
A recent holder of that title was another Japanese, Misao Okawa , who died in April this year, weeks after celebrating her 117th birthday.
Like Momoi, Okawa put her long life down to plenty of sleep and a varied diet .
She ate mackerel sushi at least once a month, but also enjoyed occasional bowls of ramen noodles, which many would consider less healthy.
Japan is home to more than 58,000 people aged 100 or over, 87% of whom are women, according to official statistics.
The countrys elderly population is expected to soar in the coming decades. A quarter of its 126 million people are 65 or over, according to the most recent census , and the proportion is expected to grow to about 40% by the middle of the century.

The sign outside town bears the Union flag and the Southern Cross. The streets are named after the Smiths and Kennedy families, and the blue-eyed locals could easily pass for stockmen on an Australian cattle station.
But the grizzled ranch hands wear straw sombreros, not akubra bush hats; instead of English, they speak Spanish and the South American indigenous language Guarani.
This is Nueva Londres, 9,000 miles away from Australia, in the heart of Paraguay .

Latin America has a long history of seemingly outlandish experiments in migration: Welsh miners in Patagonia , Scottish merchants in Panama , Spanish visionaries in Santa Fe. Paraguay has had its fair share of settlers from far away: Japanese, Mennonites, Ukrainians and Aryan supremacists all helped repopulate the country after its catastrophic wars (one conflict, against Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, cost Paraguay 70% of its male population).
But the case of Nueva Londres (New London) is one of the strangest tales of them all.
It was founded as Nueva Australia in 1893 by a handful of families, escaping an economic depression and a crackdown on sheep shearers unions to carve out a teetotal, whites-only communist utopia in the jungle.
They played Paraguays first cricket match, winning by one run after their English opponents enjoyed a boozy lunch, and the settlements women tied fireflies in their hair at the village dances. But the Queensland bushmen soon discovered a weakness for sugarcane rum and the cigar-smoking Guarani women, and within nine months, the colony had split in two.
New arrivals  like the Smiths of London  injected an invigorating dose of capitalism. My great-grandfather, Henry Alfred Smith, came here with his sons, explains Henry Smith. They were businessmen: they brought merchandise from Villarrica and sold it here. That was their shop across the street, he says, indicating one of the ornate plaster buildings that dot the town.
The Smiths began a cattle empire, gave their name to one of the two main streets, and now seem to employ half its residents. The other street is named after the Kennedy family, who apparently employ the other half of the townspeople.
I only remember a few words of English that my grandmother taught me: Howareyou, nicetomeetyou, says Iris Kennedy, 75, who runs the stationery shop. But that generation are all gone. There are lots of things I want to know, but theres no one left to ask.
Her grandfather was James Kennedy, an Ayrshire farmer who ran away with his maid, Sarah, and named his ranch after her. Big cats stole their chickens, and they were prey to insects like the pique, which burrows into the soles of the foot to lay its eggs. I sometimes wonder how my grandfather put up with this climate, Iris adds, as a passing cow peers into the shop.
Those who endured started families with Paraguayan-born neighbours. A few fought in the first world war; others died for Paraguay in the 1932-5 Chaco war: a cenotaph among the plazas orange trees lists Santiago Drakeford, Douglas Kennedy, and Enrique Jones amid the Aguilars and Escobars.
When was the other war? 1945? Well, they didnt even ask for us. They didnt want a bunch of lost kangaroos, says Iris. When Juan Kennedy, her uncle, wrote to Australia to rename the town Nueva Canberra, the letter was never answered  so they went for London instead.
Malcolm McCreen is descended from one of the few Australians who werent swallowed up by the British interlopers. My land isnt huge: Ive got 40 cows, pigs, sheep. I have horses, but its quicker to get around by motorbike, he says, before asking: Whats the work like in Australia?

Still living in the wooden house built by her ancestors, sheep shearers from Muttaburra in Central West Queensland, Blanca Murray holds on to some antipodean customs. They sat down to the table to eat on the dot. There was a fixed time to eat, to wash, to sleep. And giving their word meant a lot to them, she says.
Murray, 55, produces a shoebox of dog-eared black-and-white photos: forgotten Victorians in regimental uniform, posing beside a steam train, nameless family friends in carts bringing their meagre belongings to Nueva Australia. Memories of the towns beginnings are beginning to fade, but a new generation are showing an interest in their history.
Sonia Uldera, Henrys wife, has been piecing the story together for 20 years from birth certificates, government documents and letters. Ive found a lot of surprises. Its not like how people tell you, says Sonia, a primary school teacher. Everyone says their relatives were the ones that made the town. But in reality, it was a group. They worked in a team.
The New Australians may have failed to create a paradise, but Paraguay today, despite its problems, regularly ranks as the happiest nation in the world . And as the sun sets over the grasslands, and a sleepy silence settles over the town, it doesnt seem like such a bad place for a bunch of lost kangaroos to end up.

Closing summary: Last chance for Greek deal looms
Were been live-blogging the reaction to Sundays Greek referendum for around 21 hours now. Its time to wrap up and give the Guardian web servers a rest.
So, a final recap.
Greece and the eurozone will make one last, desperate attempt to make progress towards an urgently needed bailout deal on Tuesday.
Leaders, and finance ministers, will both hold crucial meetings in Brussels, after Sundays referendum result raised the risks of Grexit to new heights. Its a final chance for Greece to propose a new reform plan that could start the ball rolling towards a new aid package, but the journey looks perilous.
The leaders of France and Germany are scrambling to reach a consensus tonight in Paris, at a top-level meeting about Greece ( photos here ).
Greeces prime minister has held telephone calls with the heads of the International Monetary Fund and also the European Central Bank . Alexis Tsipras told Mario Draghi that the capital controls in Greece need to be lifted, but was told by Christine Lagarde that the IMF cannot released more funds now Athens is in arrears.
Earlier, Francois Hollande insisted that there was time to reach a deal. Angela Merkel sounded less optimistic, though, warning that there was currently no basis for an agreement. Press conference highlights start here .

Spains PM warned that time was now very short , while Dutch leader Mark Rutte said Greece must accept deep reforms to keep its place in the eurozone.
Analysts arent convinced that progress will be made tomorrow....
 Alex White (@AlexWhite1812) July 6, 2015
Vital for ECB not to have fingerprints on Grexit. Summit will be chance for leaders to say 'no deal'. ECB then has cover to do what it must
The European Central Bank has tightened the rules for giving emergency funding to Greek banks tonight . It is now imposing tougher haircuts on the assets they hand over, restricting their ability to access the funding.
The ECB also reportedly rejected a request for 3bn in extra ELA support:

#ECB said to have rejected Greek additional #ELA request for 3bn. (BBG) pic.twitter.com/7wi0b2qnJ6
This means Greek banks will remain shut for at least two more days, after capital controls were extended until the end of Wednesday.
Theres talk of a new mood of national unity , but it could be swiftly shattered.
Tsipras has also passed the honour/poisoned chalice of being Greeces finance minister to Euclid Tsakalotos, following Yanis Varoufakiss resignation this morning.
Tsakalotos was sworn in tonight , and will represent Greece at Tuesdays eurogroup meeting. Hes unlikely to don a tie for the occasion, though. Heres our profile of Euclid .
Varoufakis has denied tonight that he was a sacrifical lamb, having exited the finance ministry in classic style today:

In the UK, George Osborne has warned that the risks to the UK are rising . Britain is already providing more consular support in Greece for expats and holidaymakers, and help for businesses struggling to trade with Greek firms.

Ill pop back into the blog if there are any major developments -- otherwise, please tune in tomorrow morning for more. Thanks, and goodnight. GW

Garrick Club votes to continue with ban on female members
Bid to let women join fails at the AGM of the London gentlemens club  as one member says keeping it men only allows for camaraderie and banter

The Garrick Club, one of Londons last remaining gentlemens clubs, has voted to continue its policy of not admitting women as members. At the clubs annual general meeting at the Palace theatre on Tottenham Court Road, 50.5% voted in favour of allowing females to join. The club requires a two-thirds majority before rules can be changed.

The decision to continue to exclude women is significant because the Garrick Club has a place at the heart of the British establishment, with supreme court judges, cabinet ministers, academics, senior civil servants, diplomats and journalists among its members, as well as well-known actors.
The motion, put forward by former Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews, proposed: For the avoidance of doubt it shall be a rule of the club that membership shall not be subject to any quota system based on ethnicity, gender, beliefs or otherwise.
Members such as the actors Stephen Fry, Damian Lewis and Hugh Bonneville had indicated before the poll that they were in favour of extending membership to women, as had the justice secretary, Michael Gove, former justice secretary Ken Clarke and broadcasters Sir Trevor McDonald, Melvyn Bragg and Jeremy Paxman.
But those in favour of admitting women failed to get the required 66% of votes. Three former Conservative MPs and 11 QCs were among those who said they would vote to continue to exclude women members.
Lewis said he had voted in favour of letting women in and was disappointed at the result. Broadcaster John Simpson shrugged and said: What can you do? Nobody in the Garrick feels this is the end of the road.
But there was some optimism from pro-female members that for the first
time there had been a majority in favour. Several members said they expected the issue to be raised again in the near future.
More than 500 of the clubs members queued in the full summer heat outside the Palace theatre to vote in a secret ballot, via electronic handsets. Some men came looking dapper in a 1950s way, in rumpled cream suits with panama hats and umbrellas or walking sticks. Many came wearing the clubs salmon pink and cucumber tie or bow tie, accessorising the look with socks and handkerchiefs in the clubs colours.
The average age of those in the club is 69, according to one member. Arriving at the theatre to vote, Paxman looked at the queue and said: Bunch of old men. Im in the right place then.

Sir Eric Ash said he was voting for women, adding: It seems absolutely absurd that they arent in already.
Sir John Weston also said he was supporting the call for women to be allowed to join. About time, too. I think women will do a lot for the good sense of the club, he said.
Another member said he had been undecided about how to vote. He asked: Im a huge supporter of all things anti-racist, non-gender and anti-ageist but why shouldnt we have one or two places where chaps can get together?
The Garrick is one of a handful of gentlemens clubs in London that still refuses to allow women members, along with Whites  where David Cameron was a member until he became leader of the Conservative party  Pratts, Boodles, Brookss, the Turf Club and the Travellers Club. At various points over the past 30 years, establishments such as the Reform Club, the Athenaeum and the Carlton Club have voted to admit women.
When the 2010 Equality Act was drafted, there was some discussion by Labour MPs of whether the legislation could be used to make these clubs illegal, but this proved impossible without simultaneously making it illegal to have, for example, women-only swimming clubs. The act banned clubs from excluding people on the basis of colour but allowed them to continue excluding women.

With a large number of members well past retirement age, many Garrick members protest that the club is no longer a bastion of male influence where crucial networking takes place, preferring to cast it as a gentle backwater, where people go to relax and retreat from their professional lives. Only a few concede that it is still an important place for making informal but useful work-related connections.
But there has been growing antipathy among women in the legal profession towards a club that welcomes so many male QCs and judges, yet excludes women. Baroness Hale, Britains most senior female judge, the first and only woman among 12 supreme court judges (several of whom are Garrick club members), has expressed outrage at the clubs continued exclusion of women. I regard it as quite shocking that so many of my colleagues belong to the Garrick, but they dont see what all the fuss is about, she told a law diversity forum. She said judges should be committed to the principle of equality for all.
Trying to explain why the club was better without women, one member said: Men behave differently if there are no women there. There is camaraderie, banter  the knowledge that you can say anything you want and have a jolly good discussion about anything in a completely egalitarian atmosphere in which no one is trying to impress anyone else.
Related: Time, gentlemen: when will the last all-male clubs admit women? | Amelia Gentleman
Thats my main objection to having women members  its not against women, but the idea that some men would not be able to resist showing off to impress the women, that is an innate male characteristic, whether you are a bird or an animal. At the moment, any sort of pomposity or self-importance is punctured. You dont need to show off, you can be yourself, have uninhibited conversation, indulge in flights of fantasy. Having women members would change the nature of the club.
Women are allowed to enter the Garrick as guests of members, but there are places within the building where they (as non-members) are not permitted to go.
Club officials said there would be no comment on the vote. Members left the theatre to walk to the club building in nearby Covent Garden for an all-club dinner.

It started with the ATMs. At 11pm on Saturday, several simply stopped dispensing cash. Perplexed at first, Mahi Papaconstantinou moved from one to the next, her blood pressure rising a little as she discovered that each one was blocked.
Panicked, the retired civil servant then got in her car and headed across Athens towards home. This time she was lucky. I thought, thank God, 50, she said, shaking her head in disbelief.

The Greek economy is dying, dying before the eyes of its people. A credit squeeze that began with the imposition of capital controls has, eight days on, assumed the terrifying spectre of cash reserves drying up. In less than a week, banknotes of 5, 10 and 20 have become almost extinct; so, too, have 1 coins. There are a lot of us out there now walking the streets in tears, said Papaconstantinou. We just cant believe that at this stage of our lives this is what we have come to.
The restrictions, enforced to prevent a collapse of the banking system, were meant to end along with the closure of Greek banks on Tuesday. But at 7pm on Monday, barely 24 hours after the nation rebuffed the idea of further austerity in a referendum that has sent shockwaves through Europe , the Greek Bank Association announced that neither would happen. The cap on ATM withdrawals  a 60 limit reduced to 50 because of smaller denominations running out  would also remain.

Our economy is slowly dying, it is in intensive care, the economist Dimitris Athanasopoulos told SKAI TV amid fears that Greece was now heading for a fully fledged banking crisis. On every level it is sub-functioning.
From the flower markets of Thessaloniki to the beach bars of Crete, the effects, are being felt. Weve seen a huge drop [in trade] and because money is so scarce, credit cards are almost always being used, said Dimitris Vgengopoulos, cap on head, smile to the ready as he served customers in Meliartos, a pie shop within view of the Acropolis. The bill might be 1 in total but they still use their cards.
The dramatic drop in consumption has brought production to a halt. An inability to source supplies because of the ban on bank transfers has had a devastating effect on imports. Factories have shut, shops have closed and companies are increasingly electing to put staff on enforced leave.
Issuing a dramatic cri de coeur, the head of the National Confederation of Hellenic Commerce implored the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to save Greece. As the umbrella organisation representing some 280,000 small- and medium-sized businesses, the confederation has been especially hard hit by the controls.
The damage that has occurred with the closure of banks is incalculable, wrote Vasilis Korkidis in a letter released on Monday.
He appealed for the leftist-led government to agree to a solution that would stave off insolvency in the form of a financial lifeline from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
The economy is sinking, as one Greek to another, I am sending you a heartfelt message of anguish, he wrote. Ignore the voices in your party  respect the sacrifices of the Greek people  and at all costs save the country from bankruptcy.
Time is now of the essence. If banks collapse, the economy goes with them. On Friday, three days before his resignation, the countrys flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, acknowledged that paper money would start to be a problem as of this week. Many worry that with credit card overload, the system could crash.
A preliminary agreement really needs to be signed in the next two to three days, said Nikos Vettas, general director of the Foundation of Economic and Industrial Research. If it is not signed, the cash will run out because the ECB [European Central Bank] wont be able to keep up emergency liquidity assistance. People have been very calm, very civilised, but if they go to the supermarket and cannot find food to put on the table for their families the likelihood is they will become less so.
Panic buying has already caused shortages in drugs and foodstuffs nationwide, prompting Greeks to rush to buy up staple products.
Ive stocked up on coffee and pulses and rice, batteries and soap, said Papaconstantinou. After the no vote everyone I know is fearful of the worst; euro exit now looks so possible.
Pharmacies in central Athens on Monday reported shortages in drugs, including cancer medication.
Growing numbers now speak of survival instincts creating a siege mentality.
The tourist industry  Greeces biggest foreign exchange earner, bringing in more than 30bn a year  has experienced cancellations and a large drop in last-minute bookings. In a country suffering from record levels of unemployment, the sector is vital for jobs, employing one in five over the summer months.
This time last year we had around 120,000 last-minute bookings a day. Now, with all this, we are down to around 70,000, said Xenophon Petropoulos at the Greek Tourism Confederation. As soon as there is an agreement it will turn around but right now theres concern.
Hoteliers are not taking any chances, with many of them stockpiling too.
It is like being in a war without weapons, sighed Alex Aggelopoulos, who runs the Aldemar resort, a chain of hotels in Crete, Rhodes and the Peloponnese. Weve stocked up on meat in particular as 70% of it comes from abroad, and food and beverages, he said. Were keeping our suppliers happy with cash. Were not taking any chances.

Tokyo readies for the rise of the 'guerrilla rainstorm'
Japans capital may be known for its earthquake resilience strategies, but a recent increase in intense, sudden storms poses another threat  one that the citys flood protection systems may not be able to manage

When people speak of natural disasters in Tokyo , they usually mean the major earthquake that seismologists say will eventually strike the Japanese capital. But for the local government, weather-related disasters are as much if not more of an immediate worry. The citys coastal location puts it in the path of the Asia-Pacific regions most violent typhoons  and there has been a measurable increase in the strength of rainstorms in recent years.
Tokyos rainfall in 2014 was about 20% above normal, but the kind of storms that have struck the capital lately are different than they were in the past. Many are caused by huge cumulus clouds that form quickly and in succession when moist air from the ocean comes up against the warm air trapped among tall, closely packed buildings. Locally, these sudden, intense downpours are called guerrilla storms, because they seem to attack out of nowhere.
Two years ago, four workers who were reinforcing storm sewers drowned when such a storm hit unexpectedly. The main problem in these situations is that Tokyo is covered with concrete and has many levels of underground infrastructure: there is no ground soil to absorb water. The city has two sewer systems, one for runoff and one for sewage, and when rainfall exceeds 50mm/hour the water is diverted automatically into the sewage channels, which fill up and have to be diverted into the sea, meaning raw sewage ends up in the environment without being treated. Last year, during one storm, Taito Ward in eastern Tokyo received 150mm in one hour.

Tokyo is covered with concrete  there is no ground soil to absorb water
About 30% of the prefectures population lives below sea level, mostly along Tokyo Bay or the many rivers that feed into it. The levees that were built roughly 300 years ago to protect the downstream areas havent always been sufficient. In 1948, Typhoon Kathleen submerged most of the northwestern portion of the city under three metres of water when the Tone River breached its banks. More than 1,000 people died and 31,000 homes were destroyed. The storm was considered a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, and the low-lying areas have become even more populated in the intervening years, with landfill extending far into the bay. Levees have been reinforced, but the metropolitan government knows it is not enough.
One of the biggest recent flood prevention projects is an underground discharge channel that was completed six years ago about 25 miles north of the city in Kasukabe. The structure feeds overflow from five rivers into a man-made underground reservoir through a huge shaft and a tunnel more than 4 miles in length. Four pumps can handle as much as 200 cubic metres of water a second. The mechanism goes a long way toward diverting excess water that flows down from the upper reaches of the Kanto Plain, but may have less effect in the event of heavy rains that fall directly on the city.

Ward governments have asked private property owners to build special runoff systems under their land so that when there is excess rain it can be absorbed into the soil, alleviating the citys burden for runoff. Some even offer to subsidise such construction, but without regulations that compel landowners to do so, few have undertaken the work.
Experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms
Another flood-prevention project is the super levees that the central government is attempting to build along 540 miles of six rivers. The work involves increasing the elevation of existing levees. But if they are made higher, the base has to be widened in order for them to maintain their structural integrity, and since tightly packed residential neighbourhoods are already situated along the levees, houses have to be condemned and residents forced to move when the work is carried out. Japan has a very weak concept of eminent domain, and between the late 1980s when the project began and 2012 when it was suspended temporarily due to budget concerns, only 5.4% of the planned work had been done. At that rate it will take 400 years to complete, and many people in and out of the government believe the project is merely a public works boondoggle that has more to do with enriching construction companies than with saving lives.
In any case, experts dont think that structural precautions alone can safeguard a city such as Tokyo from extraordinary storms. This spring, Japans public broadcaster, NHK, aired a series of special programmes on mega-disasters, one of which addressed guerrilla rainstorms and super typhoons. Worst case scenarios were simulated using computer graphics, showing how subways and underground spaces would be completely inundated and streets submerged under at least three metres of water. Though such a situation would be rare, it is also seen as inevitable. Consequently, more research has gone into predicting heavy rainfall, especially when its focused on a small area.

As NHK pointed out, the best way to save lives is to make sure residents know when a storm is coming and what they can expect in their area. Local governments distribute hazard maps that tell residents whether or not their localities are subject to inundation, whether by overwhelmed sewers or by overflowing tributaries. Combined with a storm prediction system, residents can evacuate when a warning is given. This summer, a system devised by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism that predicts rain storms of more than 30mm/hour is being tested that can give ten minute warnings to affected areas.
Ten minutes isnt much time, but if people decide to evacuate, where do they go, especially if they live in a neighbourhood thats below sea level? Local governments designate evacuation points in multi-story public buildings, such as schools, but depending on where a resident lives it could be a long walk  and authorities warn against moving around outside during a flood. Some communities are making their own arrangements. Yoshii Ishii, the 83-year-old head of the neighbourhood association of Minami Senju, a cramped warren of wooden houses located near the Sumida River, told us three years ago that he had come to an understanding with several high-rise condominiums that had been built in the area since 2000. We had a meeting, he said. They said we can use their building in the event of an emergency.
The proliferation of tower condos in recent years has been controversial for their performance in earthquakes, but tall buildings also exacerbate the heat island phenomenon that contributes to guerrilla storms. For the residents of Minami Senju, however, skyscrapers make up for the flooding they could be indirectly causing by providing higher, drier ground.

On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina , one of the US deadliest hurricanes, reached New Orleans. What followed crippled the city, causing loss of life and destroying peoples homes. The levee system designed to protect the city from storm surges failed disastrously and the large majority of Greater New Orleans was severely flooded. Less than a month later, Hurricane Rita added insult to injury.
Recovery and rebuilding efforts drew mass attention, not least for their celebrity spearheading . As well as repairing the damage and restoring the city, projects have tried to ensure greater resilience for the future . One currently in progress is a hurricane-proof hospital , designed upside-down so the emergency room is above the flood line.
It is now approaching 10 years since Hurricane Katrina. No one wants another major natural disaster to hit, but if it did, what would be its impact? Is New Orleans now stronger and better protected? Is each neighbourhood as prepared as the next?
If you live in New Orleans, share your thoughts, stories, images and videos on whether the city feels stronger since Katrina. What has been done to increase disaster preparedness? Do you feel more protected than before Katrina? What else would you like to see happen to make New Orleans more resilient?

        <title>Radioactive city: how Johannesburg’s townships are paying for its mining past</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/06/radioactive-city-how-johannesburgs-townships-are-paying-for-its-mining-past</Link>

Johannesburgs mine dumps look strangely beautiful from a distance. Lustrously yellow in the sun, blazing red at dusk, their huge molehill shapes provide the city with its distinctive skyline.
Up close, its a different story. Rasalind Plaatjies has lived in the shadow of a tailing  as these piles of mine waste are known  all her adult life. Today, the 62-year-old grandmother from the citys Riverlea district suffers severe respiratory problems. For 16 hours a day, she is hooked up to an oxygen tank, her lungs debilitated by dust from the waste heap.
Sometimes I dont have the energy to get up. I just have to stay in bed and do nothing, she says. She feels fortunate, though. A number of her elderly neighbours have died from respiratory disease.
Plaatjies is one of tens of thousands in Johannesburgs impoverished townships who are paying a high cost for the citys rich mining past. More than 600 abandoned mines surround South Africas largest city, with much of their waste now piled up high next to residential communities  most of which are poor and black.

Residents here fear the wind most. When it blows, fine particles from these man-made dumps are carried up into the air and deposited on to residents homes. It is no ordinary dust, either: the residue of decades of mining, it can contain traces of everything from copper and lead to cyanide and arsenic .
During August and September, the dust is terrible. You stop cleaning the floor after a while. Its just useless, says Plaatjies.
In the local clinic, respiratory cases such as tuberculosis and asthma are ubiquitous across all age groups, says Musa Mbatha, chairman of the clinics civic committee. Rashes and skins diseases are commonplace, too.
People cant afford to buy food every day, so they leave the food and it gets contaminated, Mbatha adds. The government said that it would do a survey of the health impacts of the mining dust, but until today it hasnt happened.
Johannesburg is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world
Dr Antony Turton
An even more dangerous pollutant is lurking in Johannesburgs mine dumps, however: radioactive waste. According to one university study, an estimated 600,000 metric tonnes of radioactive uranium are buried in waste rock in and around Johannesburg  around three times what was exported during the Cold War .
[Johannesburg] is undoubtedly the most uranium-contaminated city in the world, says Dr Antony Turton, a professor at the University of Free States Centre for Environmental Management.
Uranium naturally occurs in reefs alongside gold, meaning the two are often excavated at the same time. For every tonne of gold mined in the Witwatersrand gold fields  the southern sections of which border western Johannesburg  between 10 and 100 tonnes of uranium were also mined .

For most of the gold mines, uranium was merely a waste product and therefore dumped without being recovered. Those tailing disposal facilities therefore have a relatively high uranium concentration today, Turton says.
Without the proper precautions in place, ore-bearing uranium leaches from the tailings and enters as run-off into surrounding streams and wetlands. A similar process occurs in abandoned mines underground, with polluted water seeping through porous rock as the mines flood.
Despite its vast reserves of groundwater, Johannesburg pumps most of its drinking water from Lesotho  more than 380km away  because its own water reserves are too polluted.

Mine waste is also removed illegally from tailings for use in the manufacture of bricks and for other construction purposes, some environment groups allege. Potentially, the physical infrastructure of Johannesburg could be becoming radioactive as well.
The release of uranium in dust form can be exacerbated by the re-mining of tailings  a process that happens in various locations across the city. The companies involved in this re-mining maintain that they are providing an environmental service by removing waste and depositing it in modern tailings that are better regulated.
David van Wyk, chief researcher at the Bench Marks Foundation , a church-funded non-profit based in Johannesburg, is sceptical about mining companies environmental practices. When the uranium price is very low, the mining companies simply dump it. Thats why the dust is yellow. We call it yellow cake, he says.
Bench Marks, which receives support from UK charity Christian Aid , is mid-way through a three-year impact assessment of pollution levels in an around Johannesburgs Soweto district. By systematically tracking air and water contamination, Bench Marks hopes to provide a scientific basis for the alleged health impacts of the tailings.
A handful of randomised spot-checks reveal the extent of the pollution problem. For example, in a narrow run-off canal immediately opposite Soccer City, site of the 2010 Fifa World Cup final, van Wyk picks out the colours along the bank: red for iron, white for sulphur, green for copper, yellow for uranium, and so on.
The pH level measures 4.6: within the range for acid rain (neutral water has a pH level of 7). The figure for Total Dissolved Solids (a measure of minerals, metals and other insoluble materials), meanwhile, is 2,000 parts per million  four times higher than the guideline amount in the US .

When it floods, this just goes straight into the river. Youd expect the government to check that the mine water isnt spilling into local watercourses, but they are not, van Wyk says. This is happening in the centre of South Africas largest city, close to the Department of Environmental Affairs s main office. If they cant regulate so close to their headquarters, just imagine how bad it is elsewhere?
A few miles away, the township of Diepkloof in Soweto catches the run-off from several large tailings. A few hundred feet from residents front doors, a run-off canal has burst its banks. A hardened white wasteland now stands where reeds and plants used to grow. A lifeless stream runs next to it. The soils surface, meanwhile, is scuffed with the imprint of cattle hoofs and childrens feet. The soil has a pH of 2.67  more acidic than vinegar.
Just downstream, an evangelical church carries out full-immersion baptisms in the water, points out Charles van der Merme, a representative of the non-profit Mining and Environmental Justice Community Network of South Africa . They think they are cleansing themselves, he says. Who knows? Perhaps it kills all the devils in you.

Bench Marks does not currently have a Geiger counter, but even the Chamber of Mines of South Africa admits that radioactive contamination is a major problem.
Five years ago, the government identified 36 priority areas affected by radioactive acid mine drainage for remediation . Today, not a single one of these sites has a feasible implementation strategy in place. According to the Cancer Association of South Africa , the health of up to 400,000 people could be affected.
Its totally inappropriate that communities live on waste that is widely accepted to be toxic and radioactive, says Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment .

According to the Chamber of Mines, all current re-mining meets regulations that prohibit radioactive contamination run-off. The problem lies instead with the owners of historic dumps that cannot be traced or are not in a position to take responsibility for the required remedial measures, the industry body states.
For its part, DRD Gold, which is currently involved in secondary gold mining of the Diepkloof tailing, says it is constantly searching for new methods of dust suppression. Among the measures it is currently using are netting and vegetation growth . Neither were visible on the Diepkloof dump, however.
According to the company, DRD Gold spends up to R48m (2.5m) a year managing the environmental impacts of its operations, which stretch over 70km around the city. Any [pollution] readings that exceed the legal limits are automatically flagged and managed in terms of an automated action list, a company spokesperson stated.
For those living in the shadow of the dumps, a sense of hopelessness pervades. Sixty-two-year-old Stella Adams, a long-term resident of Diepkloof, has written to numerous government departments to complain about the high levels of dust in her home. All I am asking for is some vegetation [on the tailing]. I am just asking for the most basic thing, she says. But nobody has ever given me a hearing  so I have lost hope.

Adamss grandson developed asthma shortly after moving into her home six years ago. Her sister recently died from lung cancer, despite never having smoked. Adams assumed the cancer was hereditary, so made no mention to doctors of the nearby tailing. Now I wonder if it had to do with the mine after all.
As well as cancer, high radioactive levels are linked to other health risks such as Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers, neurotoxic syndromes and growth deficiencies. Even so, residents in Johannesburgs poor townships have little choice but to stick it out.
In the Soweto district of Meadowlands, for example, hundreds of government-built houses are currently going up in the Fleurhof extension community. Mine dumps tower above the development on all sides. Yet, despite knowing the dangers, 41-year-old Charles van der Merme says he would move there in a flash.
One of the millions of unemployed residents in this city of 4.8 million, he and his family currently live with his parents-in-law in the township of Riverlea. I applied for a government house in 2000 and Im still homeless, van der Merme says. Despite all the ills from the mine dumps, I would like a house of my own. Where else can I go?

        <title>The human cost of the Tbilisi floods: 'The truth is, I'd really lost all hope'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/03/tbilisi-floods-georgia-capital-destroyed-zoo-wild-animals</Link>
        <Description/>

While viewers around the world were entranced by TV images of wild animals wandering free in the streets of Tbilisi, residents of the Georgian capital faced up to the human and material cost of the floods that hit on 13 June. The flooding, which left 19 people dead and caused damage put at $50 million (32m), was the biggest natural disaster to befall the city in living memory.
With the painful and slow cleanup operation still ongoing, Tbilisis residents are now asking whether this disaster was a freak, unpredictable occurrence  or whether its location and history of poor urban planning has left this city of 1.1 million people more vulnerable than they had realised.
Georgias environment minister, Gigla Agulashvili, stands on the edge of the Tskneti-Betania road in the hills above Tbilisi . This is the site where, during a night of exceptionally heavy rains, up to a million cubic metres of earth slid down the cliff into the Vere valley, sending a massive torrent of mud and tree trunks storming into the heart of the city.
About 60% of the land mass remains on the hillside, Agulashvili tells me. A lawyer by education, the minister of the environment has become intimately familiar with the geology of the city since the disaster struck. In heavy rains it could start to move again  but were not expecting such huge precipitation in the near future.

Behind where the minister is speaking, the ground has fallen away into a gaping pit of rocks, earth and broken trees that goes on for four kilometres. In the distance, a group of geology students huddles around a ministry official who is elucidating the workings of a new landslide early-warning system being installed in the area.
Within minutes of the Vere river breaking its banks, the flood waters had filled Keti Kurashvilis first-floor apartment up to 25cm from the ceiling. She made a narrow escape by forcing open the front door and clinging to the iron bars on the window. I just kept thinking, how can I die in all this mud? A dead dog floated up to me and touched my legs, but I kicked it with my foot and the current took it away.
Sitting with her granddaughter in her hotel accommodation, Kurashvili pauses half way through her story and starts to cry. In the corner of the room, donations of food and clothing are stuffed into thin plastic bags. To tell you the truth, Id really lost all hope, she says. I thought: OK, thats it  its over.
Generally, were seeing post-traumatic stress, anxiety and extreme neurosis, says psychotherapist Maia Begashvili, wearily drawing on a cigarette in the lobby of the modest hotel that is temporarily housing Kurashvili and other homeless flood victims. Along with her colleagues from the local mental health NGO Dendroni, Begashvili has been providing free visits to displaced families since the floods hit. Given the extent of the trauma, she says, she expects to be working with some of the children for at least a year.

The citys authorities have faced criticism for the lack of an emergency response plan
Begashvili lists the problems facing those who have lost their homes: The change in living space, the change in economic situation, the change in social environment ... this is all stressful, she says. Its hard for them to get over it. If they dont get treatment, they could develop the clinical symptoms of various illnesses.
The citys authorities have faced criticism for not having an emergency response plan in place. Some have pointed out they could have at least closed the Vere valley road upon hearing about the massive landslide outside the city. Others have accused the emergency services of responding slowly to the incident. When I first rang the emergency number, no one was there, Kurashvili tells me, and when I called again later, there was still no answer. Do you call that prepared?
Many of those affected are asking why they were not told about the risks of living close to the Vere river  which, for most of the year, is no more than a shallow stream. Much of the criticism is focused on the construction tunnels built to channel the river around the zoo from 1960s onwards. Further tunnels, built under a new arterial road in the Vere valley in 2012, became clogged with debris during the flooding, directing the surging flood waters towards adjacent residential areas.
When they built tunnels around the area of the zoo, even after the floods in the 1960s, its clear the wrong decisions were made, Agulashvili says. They kept building these tunnels and illegally issuing building permits to private individuals without considering the risks.
The future of Tbilisis zoo itself hangs in the balance. According to the zoos director, about half of the animals died in the flooding, and those that survived or were rescued from the citys streets are being housed in enclosures on higher ground.
The location of the zoo in a river valley next to several major intersections was long questioned by animal rights campaigners, but plans to relocate the zoo were dropped after a change of government in 2012. The billionaire businessman and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, has offered to finance the zoos move to a new location outside of the city, but there have also been calls for it to be scrapped altogether.

Svanidze Street in the citys Vake district was the first populated area to be hit by the flood. Here, the full force of the deluge hit homes built on cheap land next to the river 50 or so years ago. Absolutely nothing is left, says Murman Chanturashvili as he sorts pieces of broken furniture and sodden books into piles, ready to be removed by the soldiers and volunteers that are cleaning this area.
Chanturashvilis first-floor flat is caked with mud up to the ceiling and in places, the soaked parquet floor bulges underfoot. Fortunately, his wife was in Moscow at the time of the flood with their grandchildren. We were up to our necks in mud. Even the things I can wash down are useless now. Basically, everything was destroyed.
Not quite everything. Picking through the kitchen, Chanturashvili finds that his stash of homemade wine  sealed in plastic bottles and large glass jars in the cellar  are untouched. Smiling, he rinses the mud off one of the bottles with a hose outside and offers it as a present. Wine is a big deal in Georgia: a tangible link to their fertile land, their unique culture and their deep roots. Despite having to start almost from scratch, Chanturashvili is adamant that he wants to stay here.
What should I be afraid of? he asks. This house has been here for 40 years and nothing like this has happened before. Whoever thinks this place it at risk, let him think so! Our parents lived here and our children will be fine here too.
Poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen

Experts, however, maintain that there are still significant risks. Geologist Claudio Margottini is a Unesco expert and vice-president of the International Consortium on Landslides. Since the flooding, he has been working with the Georgian Ministry of Environment Protection to assess the immediate risk to the city and develop a long-term plan of action.
Although the amount of rain that fell on the night of June 13 was rare, Margottini says that global climate change is making these extreme weather events more and more frequent. In the long-term, the city needs to develop a land-use plan taking into account maximum precipitation. This needs to be the basis of future town planning, in order to reduce the impact of these phenomena.
While officials are keen not to exaggerate the risks of future flooding, for many residents, poor urban-planning has turned Tbilisi into a city where further disaster is just waiting to happen.
Tamriko Kadagidze rushed to help when she saw the disaster unfold on Svanidze Street from her nearby apartment. In other parts of the city, theyre pulling down trees and cutting through cliffs to build apartment blocks, she says. If they keep doing this, the same kind of disaster could hit us again.

        <title>Making sense of Miami: what America's refuge city says about the US's future</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/02/miami-florida-cuba-multicultural-metropolis-diversity-hispanic-haiti</Link>
        <Description/>

Just off Miamis busy Calle Ocho, the thoroughfare that is the beating cultural heart of the citys Cuban community, there rises a splendid ceiba tree whose roots erupt from the ground like waves from the sea, and whose vast branches throw shade far to either side.
All around the gnarled roots and tucked into the trees hidden crevices, one finds the offerings of the faithful: candles, bags of food, feathers, bones. In this modern metropolis, whose vaulting skyscrapers a mile away reflect the near-blinding sun, the saturnalia surrounding the ceiba attests to the lifeblood of the Afro-Cuban religion of santera, and Miamis eternal place in the imagination of el exilio, as the Cuban community is often referred to.
Ive lived in Miami off and on since the mid-1990s. As much as anywhere in the United States  my native country with which I have an often conflicted relationship  it counts as home. Landing back in Florida from Haiti, Paris or elsewhere, Miami always seems to offer the singular trick of providing some of the efficiency and convenience of living in the US while never seeming entirely a part of it.
Miami has long been a kind of quasi city-state that evokes strong reactions from visitors, especially those from more anglicised parts of the country who cannot make themselves understood in English to a large part of the local population  an experience that annoys and alarms them.
The strangest city in what is perhaps Americas strangest state, Miami is now home not just to Cubans but to thousands of Argentines, Brazilians, Colombians, Haitians, Jamaicans, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and practically every other Latin American nationality, with sizeable populations of Russians, Indians, Persians and Orthodox Jews as well.

The city has become so micronised that what is commonly thought of as Miami in the popular imagination is, in fact, a series of semi-independent small cities  some only a few blocks long  within the urban sprawl of Miami-Dade County (population 2.6 million). It fronts a long sweep of the blue-green Atlantic to the east and finally peters out in the miasma of the Everglades swamp to the west and the necklace of the Florida Keys to the south.
A young city (it was only incorporated in 1896 in what was then mostly wilderness), Miami is often said to have been founded on bootleg liquor and built its skyline on an infusion of cocaine money in the 70s and 80s (at the height of its cocaine wars in 1980 to 1981, the city had the worlds highest murder rate). Nearly 30 years ago, the crime writer Edna Buchanan wrote that Miami had been a sleepy resort that had transformed to attract year-round ... concentrations of everything corrupt, bizarre or dangerous from everywhere in the world.
Above all, Miami is a place of exile where newcomers try to construct a new life. Upon arriving from Cuba in 1980, the author Reinaldo Arenas  who as a teenaged barbudo had fought with Castros forces but was then imprisoned and tortured both for being an independent intellectual and gay  declared Miami a barren and pestiferous peninsula ... trying to become for a million exiles, the dream of a tropical island.
No fan of the city, Arenas quickly decamped to New York, where he committed suicide in 1990. Miami, however, continued to percolate like a spoonful of Caf Bustelo coffee from the cafe colada that residents traditionally drink every afternoon at 3:05 (the citys area code). And it has become something more interesting than many had thought possible.

In his office in West Miami near the citys airport  a few blocks away from a branch of the citys El Palacio de los Jugos Cuban eateries where the pan con lechn hints at the divine  Armando Valladares sits surrounded by photos of himself with political leaders: Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Florida senator (and Miami native and presidential candidate) Marco Rubio. Now white-haired, bespectacled and elegant, Valladares spent 22 years in Cuban prisons for  among other perceived offences  refusing to put an Im with Fidel sign on his desk at the Ministry of Communications in 1960. Upon his release in 1982, he became a United States Ambassador to the United Nations. After residing in Washington for many years, he moved to Miami about 15 years ago.
The Cubans have demonstrated their ability and their quality of work here, Valladares says. Its a unique case in the history of the United States where the identity of a city was born, in a sense, in another country.
The Cuban aspects of Miamis identity appear to be far less monolithic than they once were, though. Many younger Cuban-Americans support the easing of relations with Cuba that US president Barack Obama has been pursuing with the islands rulers. Events such as the O Miami poetry festival bring Cuban cultural groups such as Omni Zona Franca (from eastern Havanas housing estates) to Miami on a regular basis, demonstrating that the citys Latin vibe is more than Hoy Como Ayer (Today Like Yesterday), as one long-standing club wistfully calls itself.

If Miami represents a refuge for Cubans, it serves as no less of one for Haitians who, fleeing a downward economic spiral and the tyranny of some of the countrys leaders, have made a profound impact on Miamis cultural life over the last several decades.
Along a once-neglected stretch of Northeast 2nd Avenue in the heart of the Haitian immigrant community, a cultural flowering has taken place that has seen the opening of the Little Haiti Cultural Center and its Caribbean Marketplace  a replica of the famed March en fer (Iron Market) in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince . Exuberantly coloured murals by local artists adorn walls, and every Friday night the Rara Lakay band marches through the neighbourhood , beating on drums and blowing on plangent bamboo vaksin trumpets, whose bleat more evokes the deep Haitian countryside than an American city.
I have seen this city grow culturally, says the Haitian painter Edouard Duval Carri , who arrived in Miami from Paris in 1992. When I moved here it was really a [cultural] desert. That has changed.

Carri maintains his studio in Little Haiti. Famous for his painting of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in a wedding dress (an image that did not endear him to the regime), his space now seems a precursor of the areas renaissance. What was once a district many outsiders approached with trepidation now attracts hundreds of people to the outdoor concerts of its monthly Big Night in Little Haiti .
This is the doorway to the United States, Carri says. The particularity of Miami is that it has this very ebullient immigration that makes it quite fascinating.
But Miamis growth into the multicultural metropolis it is today has had a sinister side, too. In the 1960s, the city built the southern extension of Interstate 95 directly through the heart of the Overtown district, an area that had been a cultural mecca for black culture in the south. Overtown was a very pleasant place, says Enid Pinkney, the 83-year-old daughter of an immigrant from the Bahamas (one of the first non-indigenous communities to settle in Miami).
Dispersed to other areas of the city, black residents often found themselves met with hostility. After the 1980 acquittal of four white and Latino police officers for the murder of black businessman Arthur McDuffie, at least 18 people died in rioting and property destruction topped $100m. Fatal police shootings touched off riots in the city at three other points during that decade.
Police departments throughout the county gained a reputation for violence and corruption that intervening years have done little to diminish, with Miami Beach police famously fatally tasering teenage Colombian-American graffiti artist Israel Hernandez in 2013. That same year, a report by the US Justice Department found that City of Miami police had  engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and that the department was tainted by deficient tactics, improper actions by specialised units, as well as egregious delays and substantive deficiencies in deadly force investigations.

Outside observers often remain mystified by Miami. Three years ago, the author Tom Wolfe attempted to capture it as he had 1980s New York in The Bonfire of the Vanities , and instead spewed forth a right-wing caricature titled Back to Blood that showed no grasp of the place the city has become. Such misconceptions are helped along by gaffe- and scandal-prone local politicians, whose peccadillos include everything from floating the idea to shut down all the citys libraries to close a budget gap, to the by-now standard (for Miami) cash-for-favours schemes.
In some areas, things have gone over the top. In South Beach  once a slum for retirees and poor immigrants, now a gay mecca and nightlife hotspot  crass commercialisation has resulted in a kind of Vegas-by-the-sea ambiance, with even the famed Lincoln Road, once a redoubt of local restaurants and retailers, now housing little more than chain stores and the bewildered tourists they prey upon. The preponderance of juniors (a derisive term for the rich scions of Latin Americas economic elite) in the city can be somewhat off-putting, as it seems not only the language and music of that elite is being imported, but their class system, as well.
The city has blossomed and has a new cultural heritage
But the city has blossomed from the place that Reinaldo Arenas despised. The great Cuban poet and anthropologist Lydia Cabrera , who was during her lifetime one of the worlds foremost authorities on Afro-Cuban religion, spent the latter part of her life based in Miami, and donated her abundant collection of papers to the university here. It was home, too, for one of Haitis greatest poets, Flix Morisseau-Leroy , for the last 17 years of his life. And, as testament to the citys new cultural heritage, a new major institution, the Prez Art Museum Miami , opened next to the waters of Biscayne Bay in 2013; the Art Basel festival attracts thousands to the city every year; and the Miami Book Fair is an autumn staple of the literary calendar.
Perhaps more representative of the city than South Beach today are the northern reaches of Miami Beach, an area that is still home to many working-class residents despite spiralling property prices, where the lilting, almost Italianate sound of Argentine Spanish mixes with the caressing sounds of Brazilian Portuguese in the bodegas and on the beach. The Buenos Aires Bakery &amp; Cafe  an establishment on Collins Avenue, only steps away from the sea  sells a variety of pastries that would make any porteo misty-eyed with nostalgia as well as several different kinds of the leafy, highly caffeinated mate beloved in South America, and does a brisk business.

When one drives south towards the Florida Keys  where the last island, Key West, is a mere 90 miles from Cuba  the county begins to descend into farmland. It was here that, in the early part of the 20th century, a Latvian-born eccentric named Edward Leedskalnin created an extraordinary structure known as the Coral Castle , out of coral-formed limestone. As he worked alone and without advanced equipment, just how Leedskalnin created his castle remains something of a mystery  with explanations ranging from some secret mastery of the Earths magnetic field to telekinesis.
Today, other dreams are played out in Miami-Dades fields, and exist in the imaginings of the many migrant workers who toil here, scant miles from the glittering high-rises of downtown Miami. Surrounded by fields of squash, okra, beans and tomatoes, the community of Homestead, despite its tropical locale, evokes the somnolent Midwestern communities of a Ray Bradbury story. Low-rise buildings, train tracks and empty playground swings greet the visitor, and in the street one hears the melange of accents and dialects from the agricultural workers here: Mexican, Guatemalan, Haitian, Jamaican.
In the offices of the immigrant support group WeCount! just off of North Krome Avenue (which shares its name with one of the USs most infamous immigration detention centres located nearby), the connection between Homesteads rural lushness and the city rising only a few miles away seems obvious.
The Mexicans are the ones that put the food on Miamis table, says Catalina Santiago, an 18-year-old high school student who came to the US with her agricultural-worker parents from the Mexican state of Oaxaca a decade ago. But they are always spoken of in a condescending manner.
Related: Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away
On the street below, where Santiago sits with her brother and a number of other immigrants, dusk falls and Homestead sees Mexican families gathering for Sunday-night dinner at restaurants such as Casita Tejas. When they rise for work early the following morning, some will be met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and local police, who will be waiting to check their immigration status and arrest them for probable deportation if they are undocumented (as many are, a state of affairs on which Floridas agriculture depends).
Perhaps it is impending apocalypse, natural and man-made, that makes Miamis frivolity all the more poignant. If climate change predictions are to be believed, large parts of Miami  Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Virginia Key  will be under water in coming years, a phenomenon helped along by the fact that many Florida politicians, including Governor Rick Scott and the aforementioned Senator Rubio, deny that climate change can be linked to human activity.
Driving home north along US1, the skyline of Miami rises above the flat land, its concrete and steel wrapped in the warmth of the tropical sunset. A city of outsiders, refugees and immigrants that  in its reflection of present-day Americas diversity  feels in many ways more American than the 1950s small-town Americana that some politicians and commentators are perpetually nostalgic for.

        <title>Calcutta's architecture is unique. Its destruction is a disaster for the city</title>

I was born in Calcutta, but we moved to Bombay when I was one and a half years old, maybe in early 1964. The company my father worked in had relocated its head office in the face of growing labour unrest; the move was part of the general egress of industry from the city.
We continued to visit Calcutta once, sometimes twice, a year. My mothers brother lived there with his family in Pratapaditya Road, in the historic neighbourhood of Bhowanipore, South Calcutta. He is a Jadavpur University graduate and German-trained civil engineer. By the time I got to know him as a child, hed abandoned his job and set out with friends, establishing a factory that made machines in Howrah, Calcuttas industrial district across the river Hooghly. Given the political turbulence of the 1960s, the business was a long-drawn-out failure. My uncle, however, never wavered from his faith in the Left.
In 1977, the Left Front was elected to form the government in the state of West Bengal; it then won eight successive elections until finally being voted out of power in 2011. The tenure of the Left in West Bengal was marked by genuine achievements and plenty of failures. Perhaps one of its legacies was to create a microcosm that was entirely out of tune with the free-market zeitgeist whose vanguard assumed power in other parts of the world soon after the Left came to power in Bengal: one thinks of Margaret Thatchers election victory in 1979, and Ronald Reagans in 1981. India itself embraced free-market deregulation in 1991. Of course, theres no reason why Bengal shouldnt have explored an alternative path on its own terms; its just that actual faith in what these terms might be was, by the 80s, lacking.
I learnt two things from my visits to Calcutta in the 1960s and 70s, and to my uncles house in particular. The first was that there was an alternative to the corporate world I inhabited in Bombay. Culture did not have to be anglophone to be exciting or sophisticated. In fact in India at that time, it seemed sophistication and excitement often lay outside the realm of the anglophone. Second, it appeared that culture and learning did not have to be exclusive to privileged, stable or well-to-do lives. In my uncles house, the opposite seemed true: the energy I encountered in it as a child was a remnant of a cultural and political force-field that began to come into existence in the city in the 19th century.
My uncle's house contained an interior narrative whose echoes I'd discover later in other parts of the world

This house was the only piece of property my uncle owned, and it had been gifted to him by his father-in-law. My family came from Sylhet, now in Bangladesh, and theyd lost whatever land or property they might have owned with Partition. This was one of the reasons I never associated the sort of house of my uncle lived in with privilege. Also, Pratapaditya Road had become a slightly disturbed and down-at-heel area by the 1960s. Nevertheless, the house itself contained space and life, and an interior narrative whose echoes Id discover later in other parts of the world, but never their exact prototype.
These were the houses features: a porch on the ground floor; red oxidised stone floors; slatted Venetian or French-style windows painted green; round knockers on doors; horizontal wooden bars to lock doors; an open rooftop terrace; a long first-floor verandah with patterned cast-iron railings; intricately worked cornices; and ventilators the size of an open palm, carved as intricate perforations into walls. (Some houses built in the 1940s also incorporate perky art-deco elements: semi-circular balconies; a long, vertical strip comprising glass panes for the stairwell; porthole-shaped windows; and the famous sunrise motif on grilles and gates.)
My uncles house no longer stands. It came down as part of the property boom that happened in Calcutta in the 1990s, in anticipation of the Left Front governments resolve to bring industry to Bengal  a belated stirring of ambition arising from a desire not to miss out on the apparent benefits of economic deregulation that were transforming cities like Bombay, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore. The destruction of these houses would also be a consequence of the house-owners inability to maintain property in an economically depressed city.
Industry never came, partly because of the complex issue of land acquisition as well as the insurmountable populism of West Bengals politics. But existing houses and neighbourhoods continued to be destroyed because of the ethos created by developers  a euphemism, often, for a new breed of land sharks. This ethos dictated that houses on prime land needed to be bought up and immediately destroyed for the price of the land they stood on. So the houses were never put on the market, and their market value was never determined.

Among the principal candidates for buying the new condos were non-resident Indians: Bengalis settled abroad, mainly in America. They never thought to purchase these houses to live in, though they would, of course, be open to buying such houses to inhabit in London, Marrakech or Goa. Family-owned houses that could no longer be maintained were, meanwhile, frequently sold to developers by non-resident Indians.
Soon, the near-simultaneous purchase and destruction of a house seemed like an inevitability. So, paradoxically, did the acquisition of the accoutrements of globalisation: industry and investment didnt come to Bengal, but the ancillary features of a deregulated economy  shopping malls, new five-star hotels, multiplexes, gated properties  began to adorn Calcutta.
These days, the prices of new properties here are fuelled mainly by speculation. This means that new housing is hardly a response to demand; its an invitation to investors whod previously have put their money in equity. Advertisements are a reliable integer of the desires of the new well-to-do: in Calcutta (officially Kolkata since 2001), adverts for gold jewellery  an attractive form of investment  are ubiquitous. Yet in the last 10 years, Id hazard a guess that these have been overtaken by adverts for apartments in tower blocks and improbably named (Highland Park, Diamond City ) gated enclaves. Rival newspapers carry full-page ads for the same construction on their front pages. Until 2013, property seemed a less volatile form of investment than the market.
But property prices in Calcutta have now reached a plateau, and the only people making money off new flats are developers and estate agents. In fact, they seem to be almost the only people making money in Calcutta at all. A newspaper report revealed two months ago that there has been a dramatic and counter-intuitive surge in dollar multimillionaires in this city. The report noted that nearly all of them were making money in real estate.

It was during my travels in Europe in the last 20 years that I realised the neighbourhoods we confront there not only represent the history that produced them, but a history involving communities resisting their disappearance . Without such resistance, no vestiges of the great urban churning of the last two centuries would remain in the world today  in Europe, Australia, the United States and even Latin America. Calcutta, too, was powerfully and uniquely a part of this urban churning (I say uniquely because the neighbourhoods and type of house Ive described above have echoes, but no counterpart, in any other city  in India or abroad).
When we speak of Calcuttas architecture, we usually mean the colonial institutions that the British erected, or the aristocratic mansions of North Calcutta (once called the Black Town by the English) built by Bengali landowners. But the houses Im speaking of were built by anonymous builders for middle-class Bengali professionals: lawyers, doctors, civil servants and professors. Theyre to be found throughout the city, from north to south, in Bhowanipore, Sarat Bose Road, Lake Road, Southern Avenue, Hindustan Park, Bakul Bagan, Paddapukur, Kidderpore, Ahiritola and more.
They all possess the family resemblances Ive enumerated above, to do with slatted windows, cornices, open rooftops and red floors. What is remarkable, though, is that no two houses are identical: a house with a broad facade might stand next to a thin house, both sharing various characteristics  and there are many other ways in which each house you encounter is a fresh conjuring-up or experiment. This makes for an unprecedented, sui generis variety in a single lane or neighbourhood; a variety I have seen nowhere else (think, in contrast, of the identical Victorian houses on a London street). And the style  which can only be described as Bengali-European  is neither renaissance (hardly any Corinthian pillars, as you might spot in the North Calcutta villas) nor neo-Gothic (as Bombays colonial buildings are) nor Indo-Saracenic, which expresses a utopian idea of what a mish-mash of Renaissance, Hindu and Moghul features might be. Its a style that is, to use Amartya Sen s word, eccentric and beautiful, and entirely the Bengali middle classs.

Old is a misnomer for these buildings: theyre the products of the new Calcutta, the Calcutta of modernity and modernism that arose in the 19th century and took on a new identity in the 20th; a Calcutta that evaded, became a counterpoint to, took from, and was far richer than both the British-created city and any idea of the Black Town.
In a way, many of these buildings, which came up from the early 20th-century onwards, testify to why Calcutta continued to be a political, and especially a cultural, hub in India long after the British took away its status as capital city to contain its revolutionary nationalism in 1911  and even a century after the Renaissance, the efflorescence in Bengali culture in the middle of the 19th century. Its this Calcutta whose buildings are poised to vanish, and whose survival some of us are arguing for. Two letters were sent in May to the chief-minister of West Bengal: one signed by 15 people who cut across party lines and persuasions; the other by Amartya Sen, addressed to me and written in support of the project.
Among the ideas that have been put to the government is that of transfer of development rights  which would see a house-owner sell the developer rights equivalent to the price of the land on which his or her house stands, which could then be used by the developer to extend constructions to a commensurate value in another location. Whether or not this model will work cannot be ascertained unless its adopted.
The letter also refers to the MIT economist Esther Duflos observation  glaringly obvious to the outsider who knows a bit about Calcuttas cultural history, but perhaps not so to the resident who is inured to their city  that, properly showcased, these neighbourhoods (Duflo compares them to Pragues) could make Calcutta a tourist destination, and bring it the revenue it so badly needs. The ensuing danger of gentrification is a real one, but a fine line divides it from genuine cultural reinvention.
The basic aims of our campaign are these: first, to work towards and arrive at a working solution, however improbable this seems; second, to find new ways of looking at, and discussing whats important about, these houses and neighbourhoods. Although it would appear that the problem needs to be addressed primarily by the heritage commissions in the city, its also clear that heritage, as a notion and definition, is part of the problem.
In Calcutta, 'heritage' means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings

In Calcutta, a heritage building is a landmark that is important for either being a significant institutional building, or because a famous person frequented it or lived there. The architectural distinctiveness of the building is a secondary concern, or is a pre-ordained, generic feature of the structure: that is, we already know it qualifies as a heritage structure because it adheres to our idea of what a heritage colonial building looks like.
In Calcutta, heritage means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings and precincts. We dont periodise, falling back on catch-all terms like colonial; or historicise; or describe; or define. Simply put, heritage means we dont see, or think about, buildings. (And yet, even as a rubric to be blindly followed, heritage is ignored astonishingly in Calcutta: iconic peoples houses are unmarked and repeatedly destroyed; grade-A listed structures are torn down.)
In July, Mamata Banerjee, the chief-minister of West Bengal, whose government succeeded the Left Fronts in 2011, will make her first trip to London. It will be an intriguing event, as Ms Banerjees fascination with the British capital is well-known, and has caused mirth in the past. On assuming power, one of her first startling remarks had to do with her desire to turn Calcutta into London. She clarified later that what she meant was that both cities had grown alongside rivers, and that Calcutta could do much more with its riverfront.
If she studies her surroundings on this trip, shell discover that Calcutta doesnt actually look very much like London. The main reason has to do with the two cities notably different architectural styles: Londons elegant Victorian, Gothic, Georgian and Edwardian buildings (jealously protected from destruction, on the whole, by conservation laws) are shaped by a distinct Puritanism very unlike the slatted, openness-loving, loiterer-friendly Bengali-European style of, say, Bhowanipore. This disjunction is another reminder of why Calcuttas neighbourhoods cant be reduced to colonial history, and must be understood in terms of their own peculiar, cross-referencing cosmopolitanism.
Related: The Writers' Building, Kolkata: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 13
To move on this matter hasnt been easy, and not only because of governmental inaction and the absence of actual powers where the West Bengal Heritage Commission and the Kolkata Municipal Corporations Heritage Committee are concerned. Whats more difficult is peoples inability to recognise the architectural legacy theyve taken for granted for more than a century, and their mysterious disconnect from the history that produced these neighbourhoods.
This is the reason I provided the short personal note at the beginning: to explain my outsiders point of view. It may be why I see these buildings as I do, without that special Bengali nostalgia that expresses itself, generically, in songs by Bangla bands and in recent Bengali films, which occasionally conflate North Calcutta and any one of its decaying mansions with a sentimental idea of the citys true heritage. Theres a certain quietism, a sweet apathy, in such nostalgia that I feel even more distant from than the moral superiority Ive had to confront from people who feel this architecture is too minor and remote an issue for intelligent people to be concerned with.
Whats at stake here is a discussion on urban regeneration  which is connected to, but distinct from, economic revival. For the urban revival of any city, its a prerequisite that citizens engage with the spaces, buildings and histories that characterise it, rather than deny those features; that they understand and reuse them. Calcutta, in the last two decades, has largely failed to do this. But the narrative of every great city must contain such episodes of failure, before it begins to look at itself anew.

From Waze for crowds to Uber for street food  MIT innovations at Kumbh Mela
For the spiritual among the 30 million people descending on the Indian city of Nashik for this Augusts tri-annual Hindu festival, the event is a catharsis. For urban planners it is an opportunity to analyse city problems on a huge scale

This August an expected 30 million religious devotees, ascetics and tourists will congregate in the Indian city of Nashik for the Kumbh Mela  a 20-day Hindu festival which is one of the largest public gatherings in the world.
The mass pilgrimage of faith takes place every three years on a rotational basis in four alternating cities, and will be returning to Nashik after a gap of 12 years. For the spiritual, the event is a catharsis, where one can purge oneself of sin by taking a dip in the holy water of the sacred rivers. But for technologists, social innovators and urban planners, the staggering increase in human density is a golden opportunity to identify, analyse and study pop-up city problems at scale.
Ramesh Raskar, who spearheads the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Kumbhathon venture, is head of MITs Camera Culture group, conducting multidisciplinary research in optics, sensors, probes and software processing. The Kumbhathon was conceived as a sandbox initiative to create a prototype ecosystem with the broader vision of game-changing innovation at its core, he explains. The challenges of the 2015 Kumbh Nashik will be mapped to help address similar issues in refugee camps, concerts such as Burning Man in the Nevada desert and in emerging cities across the world.
The Kumbhathon project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology
Ramesh Raskar, MIT
Raskar worked with local innovators, students, city officials, civic groups, the police and historians in his hometown of Nashik to draw up a shortlist of key concerns, from a list of more than 500 issues received through an open crowdsourced platform, for the team to address. The project is at the vanguard of tradition and technology, said Raskar.
Over the past year, the Kumbhathon team has held three-monthly workshops and innovation camps to discuss, test and implement a range of smart solutions  from the hi-tech to the decidedly low-tech  to address challenges in the areas of access to healthcare, transportation, food and sanitation, housing and crowd control.

One hi-tech idea is an app to manage crowds and avoid stampedes  a regular problem at the festival, with at least 39 people killed in a stampede in 2003, the last time Nashik was host city. Modelled on the lines of the worlds largest community-based real time traffic and navigation app, Waze, the app uses mobile phone location data to help local police redirect pedestrians away from saturated areas.
Meanwhile, an online platform, LiveNashik, will dynamically gather and analyse data on taxis, train and bus schedules, free rooms in hostels, and the availability of hospital beds, ambulances and blood stocks. Within that citywide project, a person tracking app, called Milap, aims to address the major problem of children and others being lost during the frenzy of the festival. Under the scheme, individuals can be registered at entry points via a barcode that serves as an identification tool. If someone is lost, they can visit a store, where the shopkeeper can read their barcode with a smartphone  and a match with the missing persons database can be made.
Other hi-tech initiatives include the Epidemic Tracker, which is a combination of a mobile app and cloud-based backend analytical engine to monitor the health of festival attendees in real time. Not only does this serve as a check on potential outbreaks of disease, but also helps medics offer relevant prescriptions and medication.
However well constructed the technology, it depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace
Tarun Khanna, Harvard
Another challenge being tackled is food distribution, where the team has devised an Uber -like logistical network that connects festival-goers with quality and hygienic food suppliers. This enables customers to have access to information about when and where the food was cooked and make more informed decisions about consumption. According to the Kumbhathon team, this model could be expanded into a multibillion-dollar nationwide service.
Its about tapping into smart citizens to make smart cities, said Raskar. Citizens watch more TV, carry smartphones and are highly mobile and connected. Their participation is crucial.

The ability of low-tech innovations to bring about greater social impact has been an eye-opening experience for the team. WikiNasik, is one such example, where more than 300 volunteers worked to update Nashiks Wikipedia page, so that outsiders had access to up-to-date and comprehensive information about the city. Students took cameras and used pictures to document the heritage and history of the city, said Raskar. Personal compilations can help enhance the experience for visitors and can also add value in the tourism sector in building an extensive city guide for the future, he added.
Another low-tech solution with high social outcome is a Shops Online portal that displays detailed information about retailers in the city. From specifics on the owner, the nature of the business and the hours of operation, to the location and a profile of the surrounding area, the platform could open up wide-ranging data-mining possibilities. The repository of data is key for potential investors who want to start a business during the Kumbh Mela.

Participants at a Kumbathon workshop talk MITs John Werner through their idea
While citizen participation on the ground in Nashik has been significant, the correlation between technology and the public acceptance of that technology must be kept in mind, according to Tarun Khanna, director of the South Asia Institute at Harvard University. As part of a team mapping the Allahabad Kumbh in 2013, he was surprised to find that a person-tracking app using photos wasnt as effective as the age-old solution of setting off a balloon in the air when a person was lost. However well constructed the technology, it all depends on what society is ready to absorb and embrace, he said.
Rahul Mehrotra, chair of the Urban Planning and Design department at Harvard, who led the venture for the Allahabad Kumbh, said that technology should not be considered a fix in itself. Cities are broader, more sensitive and more complex ecosystems in which technology is just one instrument and cannot be treated as an end in itself, he said.

If a city could embody a rainbow, it would be San Francisco . It is home both to the LGBT pride flag  which was first used in the citys 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade  and a wealth of architecture and street art in multicolour.
For photographer Kristen Simar ( @home_schooling ), the character of the city is bound up with this multitude of colours. San Franciscos lifeblood is in its neighbourhoods. Each colourful house is a celebration of the citys history and the people who have chosen to call San Francisco home. No two houses are the same and each story is unique.
As the closest major city to Silicon Valley, the city has become the urban home of the tech scene, bringing with it a significant dose of gentrification  and change . San Francisco, historically home to trailblazing movements, has become a city of wealth, which has forced out many who cant keep up financially, including artists and activists. The old quirkiness and character is slowly being washed away, Kristen explains. Im trying to capture every bit of beauty, colour and individuality while its still there.

        <title>How to build a city from scratch: the handy step-by-step DIY guide</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/30/how-build-city-step-by-step-diy-guide</Link>

Building a real city from scratch isnt like playing Minecraft , Civilization or SimCity . Well, it is a little. But problems arise in reality that dont come up in cyberspace, including vainglorious dictators, pompous architects, bureaucratic impedimenta and the fact that much of the best land is already inhabited by those intractable objects: pesky humans.
Nevertheless, after studying several urban planning projects around the world, weve mastered the step-by-step process of how to build your very own real city.
Part 1: steps one to five
Step 1: Choose a location
Before you begin, you need a spot. Deserts, undeveloped jungles and uninhabited islands are popular: you dont want to sink your budget into detoxifying brownfield sites, bulldozing slums or fighting legal battles over ancestral land rights. Plus, very few camels attend planning meetings, still less are they capable of forming coherent objections to your masterplan for a desert metropolis.
Tajikistans president, Emomali Rahmon, recently laid the foundation stone for Saihoon , a new city for 250,000 people on a 14,000-hectare (34,580-acre) desert site. When complete, it will have 19 residential districts, 50 schools, 40 sports centres, shopping centres and bazaars  and, my favourite design feature, 7,000 hectares (17,290 acres) of orchards blooming in the former desert. Egypts new capital, too, is going to be built on sand  to the east of Cairo, its functionally inadequate predecessor. Meanwhile, President Teodoro Obiang is currently overseeing the creation of Oyala as his new capital deep in the jungle of Equatorial Guinea , remote from the seaborne assaults that have menaced the dictator and his government in the existing capital. Crystal Island was to be built on a river island near Moscow.
If you dont have a desert or uninhabited island to hand, build one. Songdo, the new city near Seoul in South Korea, is built on land reclaimed from the Yellow Sea. In the early 1960s, Buckminster Fuller dreamed up a giant floating pyramid in Tokyo Bay which would have housed 1 million people  in part as a response to the problem of acquiring building land in Japan. Perhaps sadly, it never got built.
Step 2: Ensure a reliable water supply
This may sound elementary, but consider what happened to the city of Fatehpur Sikri . The Mughal emperor Akbar commenced the construction of this walled city in 1569, to serve as the Mughal capital. Over the next 15 years, he and his lackeys built royal palaces, harems, courts, mosques and private quarters, all from locally available red sandstone. Shortly after completion, however, Akbar abandoned Fatehpur  in part because of inadequate water supplies.
Today, Rawabi  the first Israeli city built for Palestinians  has a similar problem. Work started in 2011 and, when complete, it will have homes for 40,000 residents, as well as cinemas, shopping malls, schools, landscaped walkways, office blocks, a conference centre, restaurants and cafes. But, until as recently as this spring, apartments stood empty because negotiations failed with Israeli authorities over connecting the city to the countrys water grid .
Egypts as-yet-unnamed new capital is set to be built in the desert  a popular choice for planned cities
Step 3: Ensure a reliable money supply
Again this may sound elementary, but you dont want to run out of liquidity halfway through building the high-speed train link to the financial quarter. There are various options available to you when it comes to securing the cash. Rawabi, denounced by some Palestinians for normalising Israeli occupation and by some Israelis for the possibility of providing a base for terrorists, has drawn a third of its $1bn (640m) investment from the private Palestinian conglomerate Massar International, and the rest from Qatar .
Oyala has been described as  a multibillion-dollar plaything for Africas longest-serving dictator  and is funded chiefly by oil, timber and gas revenues. Equatorial Guinea is the third largest sub-Saharan oil producer, and much of that money is being lavished on the new capital, which will have a championship golf course, the Library of Central Africa (which looks like a spaceship docked in a jungle clearing), a luxury hotel and a presidential villa. Meanwhile, according to the International Business Times,  the people are starving .
In Egypt, the nameless 700 sq km city that is set to replace Cairo as the countrys capital will be partly funded by Emirati businessman Mostafa Madbouly, who recently unveiled the 30bn projects plans. He told Guardian Cities that he already has the money to build at least 100 sq km of the new capital, including a new parliament. But he needs more: which is why he invited kings, presidents, 30 visiting emirs and hundreds of would-be investors to the March launch at Sharm el-Sheikh.
Step 4: Think about jobs
If your city is to be economically sustainable, it needs jobs. Herbert Girardet, author of Creating Sustainable Cities, argues that Egypts planned new capital has a better chance of success than other purpose-built Egyptian cities, mainly because the vast government will be relocated there. Indeed, many of the most famous planned cities were new capitals  Brasilia, Canberra, Abuja, Canberra, Ottawa, New Delhi  that, whatever their other shortcomings, benefited from the employment opportunities and economic uplift of being a national administrative hub.
The first three of 100 smart cities that prime minister Narendra Modi is planning in India will be built as part of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, which the government aims will be a  global manufacturing and trading hub . At Lavasa in Maharashtra, theyre planning animation and film studios, software-development companies, biotech labs, and law and architectural firms, focusing the knowledge industries at the heart of the new India.
Step 5: Do not alienate locals
Dont do what they did in Lavasa. The developers of the 12,500-acre site have been accused of intimidating indigenous farmers into selling their land at rock-bottom prices. They have also been accused of cutting down millions of trees. Human rights activists have reported that up to 5,000 original settlers have been forced to leave. In 2010, the Indian Environment and Forests ministry ordered that construction on Lavasa cease because the project violated environmental laws.
Step 6: Devise a masterplan
Part 2: steps six to 10
You dont even need to set foot in the country where your plans will be realised. For example, Garsdale Design, which specialises in masterplans for war-ravaged cities in Iraq, is a family practice operating out of a converted barn in the Yorkshire Dales. Such 3D modelling applications as Esri CityEngine make it possible to devise city masterplans for homes, sewerage, water and electrical systems and integrated public transport, and then to amend these plans according to the needs on the ground. Increasingly, too, masterplans involve setting out Wi-Fi hotspots, fibre-optic grids and sensors (more on this below).
Step 7: Integrate transport
Narendra Modis 100 planned cities in India all involve integrated transport with bus rapid transport (or BRT, a sort of overground metro system), suburban trains and cycle networks. Smart transport might well mean digital parking meters that text you when a parking space opens up, or real-time transport displays that give data about traffic jams, availability of buses and train services. Helsinki  admittedly not a planned city, but a good model to follow  is going so far in the integrated transport direction as to say that private cars may soon be obsolete .
The proposed Lusail Iconic Stadium in Lusail City - part of Qatars 2022 World Cup bid
Step 8: Consider banning cars
Speaking of private cars being obsolete, Masdar City  designed by architects Fosters + Partners and being built by the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company  has banned cars within its walls. Similarly, Dubais Ziggurat Pyramid , a metropolis planned in 2008 to house 1 million people, would have made cars redundant  its public transportation system, which would run horizontally and vertically, would be more efficient than private vehicles. (Sadly, since 2008 weve heard little of this putatively carbon neutral pyramid.)
Step 9: Make rubbish clever
Forget bin lorries, fetid dumpsters and the excrescence that is the wheelie bin. At Lusail City in Qatar , theyre planning a system of pneumatic tubes to transport rubbish to a central location for processing. At Songdo in South Korea, similarly, there are no rubbish trucks or bins in the street: all household waste is sucked into a vast underground network of tunnels and dispatched to waste-treatment centres where it is sorted and deodorised. Alternatively, information and communications technology can involve sensors that detect when waste disposal pickups are needed, or to measure energy consumption and emissions. Citizens may question whether they want ICT sensors checking their emissions. Ignore them. Whose city is this, anyway?
Step 10: Maximise connectivity
Broadband infrastructure that combines cable, optical fibre, and wireless networks is a basic requirement in such hi-tech cities as Songdo. Whats more, if youre serious about creating a smart city, then youll need so much fibreoptic cabling that its not even funny  not enough just to ensure high-speed access to the internet, but also so that the sensors that are key to the development of intelligent solutions for the city can work properly. Otherwise youll have created not so much a smart city as a stupid one.
Part 3: Steps 11 to 15
Step 11: Aspire to carbon neutrality
Destiny, the Florida city that developer Anthony Pugilese wanted to be a Silicon Valley of green technology, was, for a while, held up as a model: it aimed to reduce waste to close to zero and to meet its energy needs entirely through renewable sources including solar, wind, geothermal and the worlds largest hydrogen power plant. The city never got built: Florida authorities nixed the development, arguing that the ostensibly green and pleasant city amounted to urban sprawl .
Step 12: Start again, clown, youve forgotten parks
Look at your masterplan. Is it all sprawl and mall, dazzling plate glass, and more cloverleaf junctions than you can shake a stick at? Of course it is: most masterplans are. Humans cant flourish in that environment, as good planners increasingly realise. Lavasa, for instance, is the first Indian city to be planned according to the principles of New Urbanism , which advocates walkable cities that commingle business and residential development, offer mixed-income housing, and preserve green space. Songdo has been planned around a central park, and designed so that every resident can walk to work in the business district  a big draw for attracting new residents. Sixty per cent of Great City , a high-density metropolis outside Chengdu in China, will consist of buffer areas of gardens and greenery that are at most 10 minutes walk from the city centre. And Egypts planned new capital will have a park double the size of New Yorks Central Park.
Step 13:  and culture
Abu Dhabi has splashed its oil cash on a cultural city called Saadiyat Island , a few miles off the coast. It features a branch of the Louvre , due to open this year, and before 2020 will also see a Guggenheim museum  designed, like the one in Bilbao, by Frank Gehry  and a Performing Arts Centre by Zaha Hadid . Just along the coast in Dubai, theyre playing catchup with D3 (short for Dubai Design District), in tacit recognition of the fact that shopping malls and gyms arent enough to make a city a decent place to live. Wags are already comparing the industrial Al Quoz area  which now has more than 30 galleries among its 1970s and 80s warehouses  to Shoreditch or Williamsburg. Just dont expect any illegal raves or warehouse parties. Meanwhile, in the Congolese jungle, the Dutch artist Renzo Martens is trying something similar  to create an arts scene in one of the most impoverished parts of the world and thereby gentrify the jungle .

Step 14: Please, not another funny-shaped island
Does the world really need another state-of-the-art golf course? (At Lavasa they obviously think so: along with the medical campus, luxury hotels, boarding schools and sports academies, there is a Nick Faldodesigned golf course .) The worry about new cities built from scratch is that, as anthropologist Nick Simcik Arese of the Oxford Programme for the Future of Cities puts it , they offer a secessionary envelope for the rich  a form of class apartheid. He argues that new cities often fail to provide enough jobs for poorer residents or affordable transport to areas where they could find more work.
Its an important point. Around the world, new cities often exclude all but the wealthiest. For instance, the least expensive apartments in Lavasa now sell for between $17,000 and $36,000  well out of reach for most middle-class Indians. The developer says it has modified its plans to offer affordable rental apartments for young professionals. New cities are thus often confounded by the inverse relationship between maximising real-estate proceeds and making new cities livable. Or, to put it another way, if you want your new city to become something other than a ghost town or a large-scale gated community, it must be socially diverse.
What the world doesnt need is any more unimaginatively shaped developments for those with more money than sense, such as the Palm Islands in Dubai . The entire point of the islands is that you can see them from space. On the ground, however, it means long spits of land that dont connect to each other and leave you in a kind of endless residential street hellscape. Besides, what must our alien neighbours think?
Part 4: Steps 16 to 20
Step 15: Make a statement
The Palm Islands might be ridiculous, but who wouldnt want to live in the worlds first inhabited volcano? When, in 2008, Norman Foster unveiled plans for a new city on an island on the outskirts of Moscow, the centrepiece was to be (at that point) the tallest building in the world: 450m high, covering almost half a million square metres and with a total floor area of 2.5 million square metres, housing theatres, exhibition spaces, 3,000 hotel rooms, 900 serviced apartments and a school.  Crystal Island is one of the worlds most ambitious building projects , and it represents a milestone in the 40-year history of the practice, he said. But the economic crisis put paid to the grandiose scheme, which is perhaps a shame. After all, whats the fun in building a new city if it doesnt look cool?
Step 16: Treat workers with respect
In 2013, Nepalese migrants working in Lusail City in Qatar told the Guardian that their employers were making them work long hours in the heat and were withholding pay to keep them from running away. The International Trade Union Confederation estimates that 4,000 workers will die in Qatar by 2022 . The countrys kafala system  where employers exercise broad power and influence over the lives of their workers  has been called modern-day slavery by human rights watchers. It doesnt have to be this way. Building a new city from scratch can be socially beneficial. For instance, perhaps one of at the most heartening features about the Palestinian new city of Rawabi is that one third of its engineers and architects are women , a gender balance without precedent in the Arab world.
Step 17: Build fast. No, faster 
Egypts new capital city, according to the developers brochure , will have exactly 21 residential districts housing 5 million residents, span 700 sq km (a space almost as big as Singapore), with 663 hospitals and clinics, 1,250 mosques and churches, and 1.1m homes. Oh yes, and according to the brochure  it will be built within the next five to seven years. No pressure.
Lavasa in India
Step 18: Re-educate your new urbanites
In Kangabashi, a new city for one million people in the Ordos region of Inner Mongolia, China, new residents are handed a welcome pack that includes fans and a list of instructions : Dont spit, dont throw rubbish on the streets, dont play loud music, dont drive on the pavement, says the introductory brochure. The thinking is that most of the residents are country dwellers from nearby villages who dont know how to behave in cities. I know what youre thinking: when are the urbanites of London, New York and Paris going to get forcibly re-educated so they dont continue to befoul their built environment with their phlegm and unspeakable music?
When work started on Kangbashi five years ago, it was derided as a ghost city. But rural workers are now indeed moving into the citys new high-rises, lured by generous compensation packages. The Chinese authorities idea is that such cities help diversify the countrys economy: subsistence farming was becoming less economically worthwhile, owing to poor soils and increasing water shortages. The enormous wealth of the regions coal industry helped pay for much of the citys infrastructure, and there was cheap land to build on. Kangbashi is just the beginning: a test run for Beijings plans to urbanise the vast rural interior of China, and relocate 250 million farmers over the next two decades  a social experiment as much as an economic one.
Step 19: If you build it, they will come
As any planner knows, it doesnt matter how sophisticated your 3D-imaging software or how smart your urban vision. The test will be when the hookers come there, when the gay pride parade is flagged off on the promenade, and an organisation of deviants has its annual convention in town, Ajit Gulabchand, the developer of Lavasa, has said . I dont want to plan for that, but Ill be happy if it happens. Quite so: one of the pleasures of creating a city from scratch must surely be that it goes rogue and becomes something other than you imagined.
Step 20: Oh, yes  give it a name
The planned new capital of Egypt doesnt yet have a name, though the safe money says it wont be called Mubarakville, Cairo 2.0 or Sisi City  though I kind of like the last one. And what of the new city rising on the coast of the Red Sea? It has a lot of things going for it. It will house one of the largest sea ports in the world. It will provide more than a million jobs. And, if construction sticks to schedule, it will be complete by 2020. Only one problem: its called King Abdullah Economic City . Perhaps it sounds nicer in Arabic.

The goal of free, high-speed internet for everyone in New York City has jumped much closer: Sidewalk Labs , the new Google-backed startup that was created last month to improve city life though technological innovation, has announced it is investing in a project to turn the citys payphones into Wi-Fi hotspots.
The company is among a group of investors acquiring two New York-based firms that have been leading the effort to turn disused payphones into 10,000 Wi-Fi hotspots and information kiosks, beginning later this year. In a stroke, it puts Sidewalk Labs  and, by proxy, Google  in the lead of the worlds highest-profile rollout of free, citywide Wi-Fi.
The project, LinkNYC , was the winning entry in the Reinvent Payphones Design Challenge , a competition that solicited innovative ideas for reusing some of the citys roughly 11,000 public payphones. The service contracts for those phones expired in 2014, and LinkNYC  which launched in November 2014  envisioned converting the disused phone booths into 21st-century information portals. They would provide free Wi-Fi to a radius of up to 150ft, mobile device chargers, and an interactive screen that would itself offer internet access, free nationwide phone calls and access to local services and information.
The kiosks will also hold large digital advertisement screens, which will pay for the project and augment the citys coffers.
By integrating new technologies into existing infrastructure, cities can reinvent these assets  providing not just more modern, free services to citizens but even more revenue to cities, said Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff, who previously served as a deputy mayor of New York from 2001 to 2008.
Intersection says it can help other cities update ageing infrastructure, such as old street lights and bus shelters
Sidewalk Labs was launched earlier this month , with money from Google and a broad mandate to foster urban innovation. The goal, according to Google CEO Larry Pages announcement, is to develop and grow civic technologies that can reduce the cost of living, make transportation more efficient and reduce overall energy usage. Hes likened Sidewalk Labs to Google X, the lab within the company focusing on so-called moonshot projects like autonomous cars and a network of internet-connected balloons that can provide service to far-flung areas.
As the concept of the tech-enabled smart city edges closer to reality, Google sees opportunity to apply its technological expertise to the complex and often interrelated issues of the city  and to make some money along the way. In Doctoroff, Google has an experienced businessman and city official who helped enable New Yorks popular and successful High Line park and led its ultimately failed bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. Fancy parks and mega-events, however, dont rank highly on the list of day-to-day concerns in the worlds growing cities. As Page put it, the general purview of Sidewalk Labs is to find technological solutions to help transform cities to be more livable, flexible and vibrant.
Until the recent announcement, it was unclear what Googles new focus on cities might mean. But  by taking a small stake in Control Group, the company providing the interfaces for LinkNYCs kiosks, and Titan, which helps run the advertising side  Sidewalk Labs has shown it is interested in finding existing projects and speeding them up. The two firms will merge into a new company, Intersection, with Doctoroff as chairman. Again, exactly what that means  and how much influence Sidewalk Labs and Google will have  is unclear. Neither Sidewalk Labs nor Intersection representatives were available to comment.
Related: Will Google's $5m plan make cycling in the rest of Silicon Valley easier?
With 10,000 kiosks being converted over the next 12 years, the LinkNYC project is estimated to cost about $200m. CityBridge, the partnership of companies that will build, install and operate the kiosks, estimates that advertising will generate at least $500m in revenue for the city over that 12-year period, roughly half of the projects anticipated gross revenue.
New York is only the beginning: Sidewalk Labs envisions spreading this concept to other cities. The model is scalable, according to company officials. And Intersection says it will help other cities update ageing infrastructure, such as old street lights and bus shelters, to create a cohesive network of dynamic messaging across these assets  including emergency notifications, real-time transit information and wayfinding.
Making such information widely accessible alongside advertisements aligns neatly with Googles main strengths  indexing the internet and serving ads  so its not hard to see why the company, through Sidewalk Labs, would be investing in this realm. For its part, Sidewalk Labs claims to be less interested in Googles ad business and more focused on exploring how technology can be used to change the ways people experience and interact with cities, and to make them more efficient, responsive, flexible and resilient.

Why developing countries need to toughen up on taxes
Dutch minister Lilianne Ploumen explains how implementing a fairer, more transparent tax system will be vital in the financing of the SDGs

Next week, the UN financing conference in Addis Ababa will take decisions that will have a profound impact on the global community over the next 15 years and beyond. Tax collection in developing countries will determine whether the sustainable development goals can rival the success of the millennium development goals , which expire this year.
For most developing countries, tax revenue lies somewhere between 10% and 15% of gross domestic product. Thats low compared with an average of about 35% for developed countries. In historical terms, however, its not that low. Throughout the 19th century, in all western countries tax revenue was below 10%. In his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century , Thomas Piketty shows us that it was only after 1910 that tax revenue slowly started rising.
Low tax revenues meant that governments were able to fund only the most basic services, such as policing, the courts and the armed forces. Universal access to healthcare or education, infrastructure and a social safety net  in short, the foundations for decent, prosperous lives  call for much higher tax revenues.

This goal can be achieved, perhaps sooner than many of us ever dared dream. Success in the fight against hunger and poverty, under the banner of the MDGs, has changed our perception of what is possible. Now, the worlds bold new ambition is to leave no one behind.
To achieve this, we will have to, at last, realise the full potential of developing countries. This is known as domestic resource mobilisation, and it all starts with higher rates of tax revenue collection.
In order to be able to finance their share of the SDGs, developing countries will have to increase tax revenue collection to about 20% of GDP, according to the UN . I see three main areas for action.
First, ensure fair taxation. The urgency here is overwhelming. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that multinationals avoid $100bn worth of corporation tax in developing countries. Governments and international institutions now have to make good on promises to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion.
Second, strengthen tax inspectors. Developing countries need support to broaden their tax base and build tax collection capacity. Two years ago, the Netherlands started giving technical assistance to developing countries, and we now plan to double our current contribution. Today, we are active in 10 countries and we are starting an initiative to generate extra resources for building tax collection capacity.
I believe this is a good investment, because internationally the rate of return on such support is way over a factor of 10. We plan to launch this initiative at the Addis summit.
Countries that want to use these extra resources will need to express the political will to reform their tax systems. In developing countries, tax systems often have a regressive effect because they tend to rely heavily on consumption taxes, like VAT and excise duty, or on import levies. The poor end up paying a relatively high amount of tax because they spend all their income on goods subject to VAT, such as groceries and phone credit. And they pay import levies on their mobiles. There is no tax-free shopping for the poor.
Third, broaden the tax base. Developing countries need more capacity to administer and collect more complex forms of tax, like income and wealth taxes. Apart from VAT, countries need a progressive income tax regime. Because the poor are often hit harder by income tax too.
In Zambia, for instance, the sugar picker and the woman with a market stall pay more tax than the sugar factory itself. Businesses can use smart tax arrangements  tax avoidance tactics, in other words  to ensure they pay less than 1% in tax. While the market seller has to pay four times that rate on the couple of dollars she earns. That is not only wrong from a gender perspective; its completely unfair.
Thats why I am delighted that we have already agreed with five countries to revise our tax treaties. We have signed a new treaty with Malawi, and signed an amendment with Ethiopia, and we are holding discussions with seven other countries on updating treaties.
In total, we are looking to revise our treaties with 23 countries. Anti-abuse provisions  defining which companies get access to the treaty benefits  will ensure that the Netherlands is no longer an attractive option for companies that use tax avoidance tactics. Theirs is the kind of business we would rather do without.
These anti-abuse provisions are meant to exclude companies that only establish themselves in a third state to benefit from tax treaty advantages through that country, without having any other activities in that third state.
Finally, we regularly urge developing countries to be more discerning when awarding tax exemptions. The Netherlands is now putting its money where its mouth is. Along with other countries, we are prepared to forgo tax exemptions on goods and services that fall under official development assistance.
The task before us is daunting. The leap from the billions we needed for the MDGs to the trillions we will need to make the SDGs a success is a big one. But just consider what weve achieved already.
Ending hunger is within the grasp of this generation  a feat that seemed inconceivable only a generation ago. We must redouble our efforts if we want to do the same with poverty. It is possible to make the billions we provide in official development assistance spark the trillions that we need in private sector resources.
Above all, I see ways for developing countries to increase their tax revenues. That will enable them to unleash their full potential at last.

The goals were intended to serve as a precise, memorable and measurable way to focus development policy in the first years of the 21st century and to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the worlds poorest people.
Underlying them, however, was a simple if stunning ambition; an epochal call to arms.
We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected, ran the Millennium Declaration that was adopted at the summit.
We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want.
Related: UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people
If progress on the MDGs has been mixed  and the final report plainly admits that it has  then their architects can at least claim that progress on ending extreme poverty has been spectacular: between 1990 and this year, the number of those living in extreme poverty has fallen from 1.9 billion to 836 million.
Improvements in many other areas have been less impressive, however. Last year, the the UN deputy secretary general, Jan Eliasson, bemoaned the lack of action on clean water and sanitation , warning that the slow progress in building toilets and ending open defecation was having a staggering effect on the health, safety, education, prosperity and dignity of 2.5 billion people.
His comments came two months after Unesco admitted that there was no chance whatsoever that the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015 would be met.
The MDGs have often been criticised for their naivety, their narrow interpretation of the ethos behind the millennium declaration and for their lack of focus on longterm, sustainable development. But they are at least acknowledged to have concentrated global attention on their separate eight areas.
Many fear that the MDGs replacements  the sustainable development goals , which will be agreed by the UN in September  will struggle to do even that.
Whereas the MDGs consisted of eight goals supported by 21 specific targets and 60 indicators, there are currently 17 SDGs comprising 169 targets. The number of indicators has yet to be set but there are likely to be hundreds .
The sheer number of goals, targets and indicators has prompted some to worry that the SDGs will be a hard sell.
The British prime minister, David Cameron, has made it clear that he favours fewer.
I dont believe they will cut it at 17, he said last year . There are too many to communicate effectively. Theres a real danger they will end up sitting on a bookshelf, gathering dust.
Despite this, the numbers look unlikely to change as reaching agreement even on 17 has been a long, hard slog.
But the UN is acutely aware of the need to grab peoples attention with the SDGs, which will set the development agenda until 2030. During last years SDG negotiations, the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, grouped the goals into six essential elements: dignity, people, planet, prosperity, justice and partnership.
If the numerous SDGs are to make an impression on the global consciousness, they will need careful packaging and a simple, unifying message.
As Helen Clark, the head of the UN Development Programme , put it in January : We need to catch peoples imagination with this because if you just say sustainable development, eyes glaze. If you say, 17 goals, it takes a genius to recite the 17.

At the end of a school day in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, young girls in light brown uniforms walk home, chatting in the late-afternoon sun. The scene should be repeated all over the country but over the past year and a half the civil war has forced hundreds of thousands of children out of school nationwide.
Education is one of the hidden casualties of South Sudans latest conflict, which began in December 2013 and shows little sign of ending. School buildings have been requisitioned by soldiers, pupils and their teachers have been press-ganged into armed groups, and an estimated 400,000 children have been forced out of school.
In the three worst affected states, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity, 70% of the 1,200 schools have been closed. In some counties, not a single school is open.

The education sector was a concern even before the war broke out: the national literacy rate of 27% was one of the lowest in the world, and primary school enrolment (47%) and completion (10%) rates were also unimpressive, though better than they had been during the long years of conflict before South Sudan seceded from Sudan.
At independence four years ago this week, South Sudan was one of the least developed countries in the world, and the new schools created in peace time were often extremely basic. Nevertheless, some progress was made. The countrys subsequent rapid descent into civil war reversed many of those slight gains.
Aliza Ruai knows what that feels like. She had been a student in Lich primary school, in Unity state, when the war began. In June 2014, she was forced to flee as the violence surged towards her home.
We could only move at night, says the 17-year-old. I couldnt see the fighting but I heard the guns. I was feeling very bad. I was afraid. My father was taken in April before we fled. I have not seen him since.
She missed her exams because of the fighting, and spent more time out of school as she looked after younger siblings. Now, though, she is studying again, at a makeshift school in the UN camp where she lives on the outskirts of Bentiu, the state capital.
Because I want a good life, I will study, she says. Maybe I can be a doctor or a teacher.
Samuel Liom is at the same school. He was 14 before he first went to school, since there wasnt one in his village. At first, he found it difficult to be in a class with much younger children, but he enjoyed learning so much that he overcame his embarrassment.
My favourite subject is social science because you learn how other countries are doing on justice and social issues
Samuel Liom
Like Aliza, Samuel was forced to flee the fighting in Unity state  what he calls the shooting and lootings  and dead bodies by the side of the road. At first, he wasnt sure whether it was worth going to school in the camp, but sitting around doing nothing became frustrating. Now he is back at school, and hopes to get a job with the UN. The civil war has sharpened the focus of his studies.
My favourite subject is social science because you will learn the world story  how other countries are doing in terms of justice and social issues, he says. If you do social studies, you know the heart of the country.
South Sudan needs peace, Samuel says, to allow him and others to lead normal lives.
Both Aliza and Samuel are studying at a school supported by Unicef as part of its Back to Learning Campaign , which has reached 121,000 children and hopes to help three times as many. Funding, though, is in short supply.

When a war breaks out, education sinks down the list of priorities. In 2014, around 1% of humanitarian spending went on education.
As the world meets in Oslo this week for a Summit on Education for Development , Unicef will argue for a higher priority for education in humanitarian emergencies.
We have to keep in mind that conflicts today, like in South Sudan, are lasting much longer, so we have to rethink the way traditional humanitarian assistance is provided, says Phuong T Nguyen from Unicef, in South Sudan.
Aspects of education are life-saving: how to protect yourself from cholera, the use of clean water, how to protect yourself from gender-based violence. Its not in the same sense as food but it is life-saving.
Many in South Sudan would agree. Edmund Yakani is a prominent activist who organises programmes to help provide schooling for children affected by conflict. Hes concerned that an entire generation is growing up without a proper education  making South Sudans future prospects even bleaker.
Even areas not directly affected by conflict are overwhelmed, he says. Class sizes have grown from around 45 to well over 100 in many cases, reducing the quality of education. And many teachers are getting work as humanitarians because the money is better. The educational cost of this war is high.

        <title>UN: 15-year push ends extreme poverty for a billion people</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/united-nations-extreme-poverty-millennium-development-goals</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
The millennium development goals (MDGs) have driven the most successful anti-poverty movement in history and brought more than a billion people out of extreme penury , but their achievements have been mixed and the world remains deeply riven by inequality, the UN s final report on the goals has concluded.
Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general, said that while the 15-year push to meet the eight goals  on poverty , education , gender equality , child mortality , maternal health , disease , the environment and global partnership  had yielded some astonishing results, it had left too many people behind.
MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet, he said.
Yet for all the remarkable gains, I am keenly aware that inequalities persist and that progress has been uneven.
While the world has reduced the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed.
Between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of undernourished people fell from 23.3% to 12.9%. Current estimates suggest around 795 million people are undernourished  the overwhelming majority of them in developing regions. Progress has been hindered by higher food and energy prices, extreme weather, natural disasters, political instability, humanitarian crises and the economic recession of the late 1990s and in 2008-2009.
Ban noted that in 2011, nearly 60% of the worlds extremely poor people lived in five countries  India, Nigeria, China, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo  and that familiar divisions and inequities were as stark as ever.
Too many women continue to die during pregnancy or from childbirth-related complications, he said. Progress tends to bypass women and those who are lowest on the economic ladder or are disadvantaged because of their age, disability or ethnicity. Disparities between rural and urban areas remain pronounced.
MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education
Progress on education has been mixed: the goal of achieving universal primary education has also just been missed, with the net enrolment rate rising from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year. The literacy rate for those aged 15 to 24 showed an identical rise, while the number of out-of-school children fell from 100 million 15 years ago to 57 million today.
Despite having to contend with a rising population, high levels of poverty and armed conflicts, sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment of all the developing regions, with its rate growing from 52% in 1990 to 78% in 2012.
Related: Sustainable development goals will be hard sell for United Nations
The push for gender equality and to empower women has led to about two-thirds of developing countries achieving gender parity in primary education  underlining the fact that the aspiration of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education has not been met.
When it comes to employment outside the agricultural sector, women now constitute 41% of paid workers, up from 35% in 1990. Although the proportion of women in parliament has nearly doubled over the past 20 years, only one in every five seats is held by a woman. Efforts to narrow the gender divide continue to be stymied by discrimination in law and practice, violence against women and girls, unequal employment opportunities and unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work.
While the child mortality rate has declined by more than half over the past 25 years  falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births  it has not declined by the MDG aim of two-thirds. Vaccination helped to prevent nearly 15.6m deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013, but that progress has slowed since 2010, with an estimated 21.6 million infants not receiving the vaccine in 2013. The biggest preventable causes of death for children under five are pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, which between them claim 16,000 lives a day.
MDG 4: Reduce child mortality
The aspiration of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters has not been realised, with the ratio falling by nearly half (from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births to 210). Today, only half of pregnant women in developing regions receive the recommended minimum of four antenatal visits, and a quarter of babies worldwide are delivered without skilled care. Postpartum haemorrhage accounted for 27% of maternal deaths in developing regions between 2003 and 2009; other major complications were high blood pressure during pregnancy, complications from delivery and unsafe abortion.
Progress on combating HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases has also varied. The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013, from 3.5 million cases to 2.1 million. The fight is being hindered by risky sexual behaviour and a lack of basic knowledge about HIV among young people in many countries.
The target of halting and reversing the incidence of malaria has been achieved thanks to a tenfold increase in international financing since 2000 and sustained malaria prevention and treatment initiatives. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying, diagnostic testing and the use of effective drugs have helped prevent more than 6.2m deaths from the disease between 2000 and 2015. The global malaria incidence rate has fallen by more than a third and the mortality rate by more than half. Significant progress has been made in the fight against tuberculosis: improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment saved an estimated 37m lives between 2000 and 2013.
The push for environmental sustainability has brought some 2.6 billion people access to improved drinking water since 1990, meaning that the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010  five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million are still without improved drinking water.
MDG 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Efforts on sanitation have fared far less well: 2.1 billion people have gained access to improved sanitation (a toilet that hygienically separates faeces from human contact) since 1990, leaving the target of halving the number of people without access to basic sanitation short by nearly 700 million people.
Some 2.4 billion people in developing countries  a third of humanity  still lack access to improved sanitation facilities, while 946 million people still practise open defecation.
The differences between rural and urban areas are often considerable. While four out of five people in urban areas have access to piped drinking water, the figure for those in rural areas is just one in three. Nearly half of those in rural areas lack access to improved sanitation facilities compared with less than a fifth of those in urban areas.
Moves to improve the way the world works together on development have been aided by an increase in the amount of official development assistance (ODA) that rich countries give to developing nations. Between 2000 and 2014, ODA increased by 66% in real terms and hit a record high of $134.8bn (80.3bn) in 2013 .
Ban said that lessons had to be learned from the MDGs as the world prepares to agree their successors, the sustainable development goals , which will set the agenda for the next 15 years.
We need to tackle root causes and do more to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, he said.
Reflecting on the MDGs and looking ahead to the next 15 years, there is no question that we can deliver on our shared responsibility to end poverty, leave no one behind and create a world of dignity for all.

The new Ebola outbreak in Liberia last week was not unexpected, and more like it may occur, according to the UN special envoy on Ebola, Dr David Nabarro.
The 17-year-old whose death signalled the outbreak in Liberia may have come into contact with an infected animal or picked up the virus from a person in whom it had lingered beyond the 21-day quarantine period, experts believe.

Two more people from the teenagers village have fallen ill since the boys death last Sunday, but although the new cases have dismayed the government, population and health experts, Nabarro said that because of the large amount of virus that has been in circulation, this could be the pattern for some time to come.
Were still pretty confident it is going to end, in a period which is not unreasonable, but I dont think the end will necessarily be the end. There will be subsequent mini flare-ups occurring all over the place, he said.
How the teenager became infected is the subject of rumour and speculation, because he is not thought to have come into contact with anybody from Sierra Leone or Guinea, where there are still cases.
But, said Nabarro, there has been an awful lot of virus around. Some of it may have gone back into the animal kingdom. That could mean the virus occurring in animals in locations where there was none in the past, increasing the chances of disease if people eat or are in physical contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats.
This epidemic has also shown that the virus can linger beyond the 21-day quarantine period in the prostate in men and in the eyes in both men and women, he said. It has been found in amniotic fluid and in the foetuses of women who were pregnant when they became infected with Ebola but survived.
We dont know yet whether they are an undetected chain of transmission, because Margibi [the county where the cases occurred] was one of the last parts of Liberia to be declared Ebola-free, or whether they are the result of some kind of perpetuation of the virus, survivors that we hadnt known about, or whether they represent a brand-new arrival of the virus from outside the human race  a new Ebola appearance  and that answer will not be known for some time, Nabarro said.
Examination of past Ebola outbreaks since the disease was first identified four decades ago shows a 50% probability of isolated mini outbreaks within a year after the main one has been declared over, he said. While there is not absolute clarity on this, it appeared that the reasons were perpetuation of the virus in survivors or re-introduction from animals which may have picked it up from infected humans.
Nabarro praised the calm and confident Liberian response to the new cases, as well as the handling of the continuing epidemic in the other affected countries. The communities in Sierra Leone and Guinea where there are still cases now need to be approached with great sensitivity, said Nabarro.
These are communities that want to be left alone, with their cultural values and traditions undisturbed, he said. It was important to focus on individual households in a quiet and non-aggressive way and listen to them. People are very, very scared, he said. They are scared they are going to get into trouble with the authorities but they are scared that they will get into trouble with the spiritual world if they dont do their burials right. It needs a very sensitive response.
Nabarro was speaking before a major UN conference aimed at encouraging donations to help the three hard-hit west African countries recover from the damage of the epidemic.
At the secretary generals international conference on early recovery, which begins on Friday in New York, donors are expected to offer help with restoring health and education systems, but it is thought likely the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will hope for more assistance to rebuild their economies.

        <title>Make poverty history? A decade on from Gleneagles, it is a genuine possibility | Adrian Lovett</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/make-poverty-history-campaign-gleneagles-sustainable-development-goals</Link>

It is hard to believe that, when world leaders met at Gleneagles 10 years ago on Monday , nobody on the planet had an iPhone, YouTube was preparing to open its first office above a Silicon Valley pizza house, and tweeting was confined to birds. But looking back on that day, when the Make Poverty History campaign reached its climax at the G8 summit, it is clear the world has changed in many more ways.
On 6 July 2005 I was in Edinburgh, preparing to head to Gleneagles to make our case. Days earlier, we had mobilised half a million people at the huge Edinburgh Make Poverty History rally  the largest in Scottish history  and at the Live 8 concerts in London and around the world. Seven million white campaign wristbands had been worn in the UK, and tens of millions more worldwide, challenging leaders to act. The G8s answer included a promise of $48bn (31bn) in new aid  half of it to Africa  and outright debt cancellation for many of the worlds poorest countries.
It wasnt everything the campaign had asked for, and it hasnt all been plain sailing since. Shamefully, some of the richest countries have reneged on the promises they made that day. But the deal done at Gleneagles, unlike the faded Nokia 3310 I clutched back then, has looked better with the passing of time. Those who kept their word, along with strong political leadership from within Africa itself, have helped transform the world since.
Related: What can G7's dwindling anti-poverty protesters learn from climate activists?
The change becomes real when seen up close. A while ago I visited a government health clinic supported by Save the Children in South Wollo, Ethiopia, eight hours drive from the capital. With increased aid and its own resources, the Ethiopian government has been able to extend the treatment of deadly childhood illnesses like diarrhoea and pneumonia, with a new army of equipped and empowered community health workers.
I was shown a meticulously maintained record book listing each patient that came in  mainly children  with names, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. The final column on the ledger was headed outcome; in each row, the entry almost invariably contained a single word: better. The same was true in one clinic after another. Seeing that combination of real, micro-level data with demonstrable success and progress was exhilarating. I wished that every white-band wearer in the world could have stood there too and read that roll call of hope.
Perhaps the most profound change is in the perceived achievability of Make Poverty Historys mission. In 2005, despite Nelson Mandelas insistence that extreme poverty could be overcome just like slavery and apartheid, many observers  and even some campaigners  assumed it was an unreachable pipedream.

Ten years on, that aim of ensuring that nobody should live in absolute poverty by 2030 is set to be enshrined in the sustainable development goals , which will be signed by world leaders at the UN this September. The campaign slogan has become the first item on the worlds to-do list. And the reason for that new sense of possibility? Were halfway there.
The extreme poverty figure has dropped from 43% of the worlds people in 1990 to 21% in 2010 . And its continuing to fall. The virtual elimination of extreme poverty in the next 15 years wont be easy  in fact, it will be an increasingly hard slog. But nobody now says it cannot be done. The question is whether we will choose to do it.
Policymakers need to start to answer that question this month when they gather for the financing for development summit due to be held, neatly, in Addis Ababa  capital city of the country that became a byword for famine 30 years ago and is now at the frontline of the data-driven fight to end hunger and extreme poverty for good.
If the map of poverty and development has transformed in 10 years, the way we run campaigns has changed almost as much  and thats a change for the better, too. Networks like Avaaz and change.org , unheard of in 2005, have harnessed internet and social media platforms to put power in peoples hands and turn leadership pyramids upside down.
A growing movement of global citizens is forming. And that movement is more authentic and representative than ever, no longer directed from Washington, New York or London. One s membership of nearly 7 million people includes 2 million from Africa. After watching 250 One youth ambassadors from across Europe and beyond, who came (with some very big balloons) to southern Germany for last months G7 summit , I know we are in great shape for the fight ahead. These are smart, savvy, passionate advocates who know their facts. They also know that facts are nothing without activism  and activism means little unless we take it to where decisions are made, get them changed, and hold decision-makers accountable.
Not so different from Make Poverty History perhaps, at its best. But  I hope  more global, more sustainable and more empowering. Oh, and now we can tweet about it too.

        <MainBody>Financing for Development
In global healthcare, quality and access are what matters  not who delivers it
In fragile states, private sector healthcare is vital in plugging the gaps in public services. We need to engage with it  like it or not, it may be the only option

When the UN financing for development conference begins in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, theres likely to be a big elephant in the room: the private sector.
Some commentators have warned of the possible implications of pursuing ultra-free market ideologies that see private companies as key providers of basic public services. Ignoring the private sector rather than working with it would seem like the most morally defensible approach when faced with the prospect of large corporations selling health and education services with the sole objective of turning a profit.
Related: Health sustainable development goal must tackle inequity head on to succeed
Sometimes, though  whether we like it or not  the private sector might be our only option. Take fragile and conflict-affected states: the World Bank estimates that more than 1.2 billion people live in countries affected by widespread conflict and political unrest. The UK Department for International Development and other donors have flagged these countries as a priority category.
Given their vulnerability, fragile and conflict-affected states simply do not have access to the large amounts of state expenditure needed to provide widespread coverage of basic services. World Health Organisation data from 2013 shows that in Afghanistan, government expenditure on health amounted to just 21% of total health expenditure (compared with 84% in the UK).
Donors are also unlikely to commit to long-term aid funding where they cant easily link this expenditure to immediate, tangible outcomes  an unrealistic expectation in fragile states where, by definition, the focus needs to be on long-term systemic change.
In these contexts, it is hardly surprising that privately run services step in to plug the gap. In Somalia, despite the population having one of the lowest rates of GDP per capita in the world , the private sector delivers more than 60% of the countrys healthcare services . In these situations, where the private sector is already a fixture, the question is not how to prevent companies from filling the gap left by ineffective state structures, but rather how to work with these companies to ensure the gap-filling is good enough to promote positive, lasting impact.
Related: Financing the sustainable development goals  podcast
There are some fundamental areas that need addressing.
First, a lack of regulatory frameworks and inspection procedures can result in huge negative social and economic consequences. Our work , investigating private healthcare provision in Somalia, highlighted some disturbing results: the proliferation and sale of unregulated and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical products not only puts patients at risk but is also likely to lead to a greater burden on public health services when remedial treatments are needed further down the line.
Poor market oversight can also make life difficult for businesses trying to tailor their products and services to appropriate customer bases. In Somalia, the unfettered boom in hospitals and smaller clinics has made it difficult for enterprises to differentiate themselves, resulting in negative competition that benefits neither the business nor the customer.
The public sector has a key role to play in addressing these issues, helping to ensure the introduction and enforcement of minimum standards and accreditations. This will necessitate meaningful collaboration between the sectors  working with, rather than against, private enterprises. In some cases, NGOs are stepping in to fill the void. In Somaliland, PSI s network of recognisable BulshoKaab Pharmacies is a good example of a successful attempt to give credibility to quality services in an ever-expanding marketplace.
In Somaliland and Puntland, we are seeing the emergence of informal referral systems whereby the private sector sends emergency cases to the public sector, and public sector facilities pass on cases requiring specialist skills and equipment to their private sector counterparts. We found a general desire among health workers to formalise these relationships to help improve basic efficiencies  for example, by establishing systems allowing data on the availability of beds to be shared.
In critically vulnerable environments, it is clearly important that we work with what is already in place to support the delivery of basic services. Private sector facilities spring up to plug the gap left behind by weak public institutions and a lack of capacity and funding. Their continued existence is testament to the demand for them. While this might not be to everyones ideological taste, it is sometimes the reality on the ground. In fragile and conflict-affected states, it is often the only reality.
The public sector has an important role to play in promoting the regulation and oversight of these services, ensuring they are really working for the customers they aim  and claim  to serve. Sustainable development goal 17 talks of engaging with the private sector to help strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development.
It is time to catch up with private service providers to ensure this engagement is truly sustainable. What should matter is quality and access. Not who delivers it.

Murder, drug cartels and misery counter Argentina's claims of falling poverty
President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchners suggestion that Argentinas poverty rate has been cut to less than 5% rings false with experts and locals alike

The gangland murder of four youths in a notorious slum in the south of Buenos Aires came as little surprise to residents. The victims of last Aprils attack had each been shot in the head by hitmen amid an ongoing turf war between rival gangs.
Known as  villas miserias   literally, slums of misery  the sprawls of redbrick shacks that punctuate the Parisian-style architecture of the Argentinian capital have become synonymous with violence.
These marginal neighbourhoods have little or no state presence to oppose the growing influence of drug cartels. Despite often being located in urban centres, most residents do not have access to mains electricity, running water or sewers.
In 2013, the NGO Techo identified 1,834 of these informal settlements across Argentina, saying they were home to 500,000 families. In Buenos Aires alone, the number of people living in villas miserias grew by about 50% between 2001 and 2010.
These fringe communities have become the focal point of the fight against poverty in the South American country, with investment from the government and NGOs focused on providing basic services and integrating them into wider society.
After Argentinas devastating debt default in 2001/2, a boom in social security spending did much to sustain high growth rates. But the success of these social programmes has been threatened by another default and an inflation-inducing currency devaluation last year.
This bleak picture seems to sound a false note given the governments claims that Argentina has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world.
At a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation summit in Rome in June, President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner said the poverty rate was now lower than 5%, compared with a crippling 54% in 2003.
When Anbal Fernndez, head of the Argentine cabinet, was later asked on national radio if the country had truly achieved a poverty rate lower than, say, Norway, Denmark and Germany, he replied: Yes, although you might not like it and it is difficult for you to accept. Countries like Germany are having a difficult time with poverty.
Even discounting the fact that poverty rates in Germany and other European countries are based on different calculations, the validity of figures published by Argentinas Indec statistics agency has long been challenged.
In terms of fiddling the figures, the [Fernndez presidency] has considerable form  from cooking the books on inflation, to massaging growth data and  fudging poverty data, said Colin M Lewis, professor emeritus and Argentina expert at the London School of Economics .
A regime that presents itself as a champion of the poor has even more reason than most for making exaggerated claims about poverty reduction, particularly as inflation accelerates and a decline in the rate of inequality appears to be stalling, he added.

It is widely acknowledged that Indec has long published an artificially low consumer price index (CPI). Private economists estimate inflation at more than 25% , while the government has said it is about 15%.
But despite evidence of creative accounting, there has also been real progress in tackling poverty, some analysts say.
The reason why the president has high approval ratings of around 50% is that many people have seen their living standards rise  unemployment is low and average wages have risen faster than prices during her tenure, even when you use the estimates of inflation favoured by the opposition, said Paul Segal, a senior economics lecturer at Kings College London .
Argentina measures its poverty rate by calculating the number of people who cannot afford a basic basket of goods and services, such as education and housing. This basket is directly linked to the CPI, which statisticians say can lead to abuse.
If inflation is high, the basket value increases, and therefore poverty increases. This is politically inexpedient for a president whose election, and continued popularity, is partially grounded in a promise to reduce poverty, said Christopher Wylde, associate professor of international relations at Richmond, the American International University in London .
Manipulating the official inflation rate serves a wider set of priorities, and its impact on poverty data could be interpreted as somewhat tangential. These wider priorities include: lower repayments on inflation-indexed bonds, better gross domestic product data  the impact on the real effective exchange rate and the concomitant impact on balance of payments through the trade channel, and a better bargaining position with unions, who use inflation data to negotiate pay increases, Wylde said.
An independent study by the Universidad Catlica Argentina , released in April last year and using more realistic CPI data, reported a poverty rate of roughly 26% in 2013.
Away from the rarefied air of pure statistics, in the low shacks of the villas miserias, people echo the charges of official exaggeration and manipulation, grounding their anger in daily deprivations.
In our neighbourhoods, entire families are homeless and theres no drinkable water. Where is this reduction in poverty? said Viviana, an NGO advocate who works in a slum in the gentrified barrio of Retiro in Buenos Aires. She did not want to give her last name for fear of harassment by the authorities.
Its a joke that the president would announce that [poverty rate] to the world. That number, so untenable to the Argentine eye, is something shed never say to the people who live in las villas miserias. Thats only something she could have said in Rome.
Indec has agreed to reform its methodology on measuring inflation and poverty but, given that no fresh data on poverty has been published since December 2013, it seems unlikely anything will change before legislative and presidential elections in October. Fernndez, whose Front for Victory party has held power since 2003, is barred from standing for a third consecutive term .
With persistent economic instability, fears about the prevalence of drug cartels and a creeping fiscal deficit , the ghosts of 2001 haunt every Argentine politician.

Yemen's humanitarian crisis leaves a million people in dire straits  in pictures
The UN has declared its highest-level humanitarian emergency in Yemen, where months of fighting and a blockade by a Saudi-led coalition have left about 80% of the population in need of aid. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has called for a pause in hostilities until the end of Ramadan so that assistance can be delivered. But a senior UN official warns the country is one step from famine

On Wednesday, a Saudi Arabian billionaire, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, announced he would donate his $32bn (20bn) fortune to charity over the coming years . The decision, he said, had been motivated by his life-long commitment to helping to build a more peaceful, equitable and sustainable world for generations to come.
If the money were split equally among the eight programmes the prince suggested  with $4bn going to each  what might it achieve? Here are some of the options.
Modernisation and infrastructure
The full $32bn, meanwhile, could take energy supplies to more than half the places off the grid in Africa (source: Overseas Development Institute ).
Poverty alleviation
A $4bn windfall would go about 80% of the way to ensuring every person in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  one of the poorest countries on the planet  has access to basic services such as health and education (source: ONE campaign ).
The same sum would cover the funding gap for essential health and education services for everyone in Tanzania , Zambia and Liberia (source: ONE campaign).
Disaster relief
$4bn would cover the total bill to help the Syrian refugees who have fled to nearby countries , providing essentials like clean water, adequate shelter and food assistance (source: Oxfam ).
A $4bn injection would fully fund roughly 20% of the current worldwide humanitarian needs. Or, more specifically, it would just about cover the gap in funding for the entire Syrian regional refugee response and the funding gap on South Sudan combined (source: Care International).
The same sum would almost cover the funding gap for 12 other ongoing humanitarian crises around the world (source: Care International).
Education and empowering children
With support worth $4bn, the 58 million children left behind by the millennium development goal on education would be able to go to primary school (source: Care International ).
Just $500,000 could enable 1,000 schools in Pakistan to use the latest technology to plan, prepare and manage against the risk of attacks, enabling children to attend school more safely. The sum would cover the creation of school safety strategies using analytical software, and working with communities to implement them (source: Unicef ).
A $1,000,000 investment would enable 10,000 nomadic children in Eritrea to go to school. This could include establishing new nomadic learning centres, expanding existing ones, and training teachers to enable the most marginalised children to access their right to a quality education for the long term (source: Unicef).
$3.2bn would feed the 66 million school-aged children who go hungry . Being well-nourished would give poorer children a far greater chance of getting an education and bringing themselves out of poverty through better paid work (source: Oxfam ).
Promotion of health
For $4bn, more than 12 million people could be provided with antiretroviral drugs  more than the total number of people living with HIV/Aids across the least developed countries. Alternatively, the money would pay for 190 million children to be fully vaccinated, saving more than 6 million lives (source: One campaign).
Spending $4bn on water and sanitation services would also go a long way to relieving a health crisis that kills 1,400 children every day (source: WaterAid ).
A $4bn investment would also build 666m basic pit latrines, or 111m improved latrines  which include a ventilation pipe and mesh to reduce odours  to serve 555 million people (source: WaterAid).
With $4bn, it would also be possible to reach as many as 167 million of the 179 million people living in the 17 countries worst off for access to clean water. Assuming there were no other obstacles, that means every person who right now lives without water in Angola , Chad , DRC, Guinea , Eritrea, Ethiopia , Haiti , Madagascar , Mauritania , Mozambique , Niger , Tanzania and Papua New Guinea (source: WaterAid).
Empowering women
Given that the median income of womens rights organisations worldwide is $20,000 a year, $4bn would fund 10,000 womens rights organisations for 20 years (source: Mama Cash ).

The slow unfolding of the sustainable development goals continued last month with the unveiling of the zero draft that will be negotiated in the runup to the summit in New York in September.
How does the draft of 17 goals look from the perspective of an organisation dedicated to helping countries to strengthen democracy? The answer is not bad, but not good.
Related: Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption
On the plus side, it is good that there is a goal 16 at all. The draft goal reads: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
There was no equivalent in the millennium development goals (MDGs), and it is welcome that goal 16 includes a target of ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.
I like all those words, which embody a commendable set of ambitions. The target of effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels is a good transposition of text from the UN high-level panel report on the post-2015 development agenda co-chaired by the presidents of Liberia and Indonesia and the British prime minister, which included all three adjectives.
On the minus side, there are two main gaps.
First, the word democracy itself has not been used, nor any variant such as democratic accountability. That is disappointing but not surprising, even though the Millennium Declaration , which formed the basis of the MDGs, did make specific calls for these conditions to be included.
Perhaps the word democracy is less popular than 15 years ago and it was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics
My guess is that the word democracy, perhaps less popular now than it was 15 years ago, was blocked by the sensitivities of UN politics.
The second gap is the failure to address the key instruments of representative democracy, namely parliaments or political parties. Again, this is disappointing but not surprising. There is a presumption in the text that the executive are the main actors, rather than the representatives of citizens. Indeed, the high-level panel called for someone (implicitly governments) to grant rights (such as freedom of speech) to people, rather than for people to act to curb the powers of the executive.
So what should be the response of those interested in strengthening democracy? We need to do two things.
First, we should demystify democracy. Democracy is not a western plot, it is a universal value. Virtually all countries have aspects of democratic culture in place to some degree, and absolutely every country has room to strengthen the quality of their democracy.
I would like to build common ground about the aspects of democracy that are important regardless of region or political grouping. That would make work on achieving the targets in goal 16 much more useful.
Related: Nigeria's free and fair elections are an inspiration for nascent democracies | Kofi Annan
Second, the Millennium Declaration is still relevant when it says that we should work collectively for more inclusive political processes, allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all our countries. We should rebalance our thinking about national responsibilities, taking up that challenge of putting people and their representatives first. This links back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The central task of the declaration, and of the Magna Carta for that matter, was to curb the power of the executive  which, unchecked, tends to be abused.
In the vast majority of countries, we should look at the role of parliaments, the judiciary, civil society and the media, as well as the executive, when considering how to secure objectives encapsulated in goal 16.
A report by Civicus called for new forms of representation and oversight, such as citizens panels. Institutions should be tested on their ability to respond to and achieve progress on issues identified by people rather than just governments, it added.
The sentiment certainly reflects the level of concern many people feel about traditional representative institutions. Building common ground on what democracy means, and helping to improve the quality of representation in our countries, go hand in hand and are both worth pursuing.
Goal 16 is imperfect and is almost at the bottom of the list of proposed SDGs. But the glass is half full. Politics and the development community have been uncomfortable partners in many ways, and this is a chance to work together to help political systems do a better job. If we succeed, then we will have fulfilled the promise of the Millennium Declaration  citizens of all countries working together to put sustainable development at the centre of the agenda and hold governments to account for their actions.

Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, the founder of Brac , the largest non-governmental organisation on the planet, has been awarded the 2015 World Food prize for his unparalleled work on reducing poverty in Bangladesh and 10 other countries.
Abed established Brac  formerly known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee  in 1972 as a relief operation to help the country recover from its war of independence with Pakistan and the destruction wrought by a tropical cyclone.
The organisations focus soon switched to finding new ways to tackle poverty and empower women socially and economically, and it is estimated to have brought nearly 150 million people out of poverty since its foundation.
Today, it has a staff of 110,000 and works in 11 countries: Bangladesh, Afghanistan , Pakistan , the Philippines , Sri Lanka , Liberia , Sierra Leone , South Sudan , Tanzania , Uganda and Haiti .
Dr MS Swaminathan, chair of the World Food prize selection committee and the first World Food prize laureate in 1987, described Abed as a strategic thinker, and a man with a future vision. He also praised the NGO for its constant innovation and bold use of funding.
It's a great satisfaction for us to to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years
Fazle Hasan Abed
While funding was important, Abed realised that the organisation needed some internal financial resources in order to steer its course, rather than become diverted by donor agendas, he said.
He therefore set up a considerable number of commercial enterprises as part of the Brac brand. These include printing presses, manufacturing industries, a hotel, conference facilities, retail outlets and the private Brac University, among others. Surpluses from these enterprises go into supporting Bracs development programmes.
Abed, who was knighted by the Queen in 2010, described the award as a tremendous honour, adding: Im sure this will be a great joy for our staff and energise them even more. Its a great satisfaction for us to receive recognition of the work weve done for the last 43 years.
He said he was particularly proud of Bracs work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s, which saw the number of deaths halved over a decade.
Brac's work on tackling child mortality in Bangladesh in the 1980s saw the number of deaths halved over a decade
We went to every household in Bangladesh teaching mothers how to make oral rehydration fluid at home to combat diarrhoeal deaths, he said. That also made it possible for Brac to become a very large organisation very quickly and to expand our programmes throughout the country.
Equally productive, he said, had been Bracs push to raise the rates of child immunisation in the last few years of the same decade. Between 1986 and 1990, the proportion of immunised Bangladeshi children rose from 2% to 70% . In the areas where Brac works, he added, the immunisation rate is now at 95%.
Abed said that although Bracs approach is multifaceted, it was founded on a simple principle.
We have worked on many different aspects of poverty: mortality reduction; maternal mortality and health; family planning; financial services for women; womens empowerment; agriculture, and all kinds of livelihoods for poor people so that they could come out of extreme poverty and malnutrition, he said.
Everything we did in Bangladesh we did with one focus: getting poor people out of poverty because we feel that poverty is dehumanising.
With the world preparing to adopt the sustainable development goals  which will replace the millennium development goals and set the global development agenda for the next 15 years  Abed called for a renewed focus on eliminating extreme poverty.
He said that Bracs work with the poorest 8% of Bangladeshis had shown that even the ultra-poor could be reached if sufficient resources and commitment were available. Bracs two-year programme, designed to help those who are too poor for microfinance loans, involves using grants, monthly stipends and health services to support families while they learn about making money and household budgeting.
The programme has since been rolled out in several countries  Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Honduras and Peru where it has also proved successful.
Taking people out of extreme poverty can be done but you need the commitment to do it in every country throughout the world, said Abed.
Thats the problem  do we have the commitment in every country to take the extreme poor out of their misery? Do we have good governance in every country? There are many factors that affect development and hopefully these will also be part of the sustainable development goals: good governance and the eradication of corruption from societies.

Schools have the potential to transform girls lives, unlocking the door to future opportunities, better health and greater autonomy. But in many places, schooling falls short of that aspiration.
In May, global educators gathered at the World Education Forum in Korea to agree on a post-2015 global education agenda. In June, the US first lady Michelle Obama visited the UK to help launch a UK/US partnership that will invest nearly $200m (128m) in supporting girls education in countries affected by conflict, starting with the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Next week, global educators will gather again, this time in Norway at the Oslo summit on education for development . There, they will work to strengthen and renew political commitments on education and improving learning outcomes for children worldwide.
And in September, world leaders will gather at the UN general assembly in New York to adopt the sustainable development goals , which will replace the millennium development goals and shape the international development agenda until 2030.
Given this growing momentum, now is clearly the time to ensure global organisations are committed to using rigorous evidence to improve education.
Girls face more barriers to learning than boys, particularly around the time of puberty . Understanding the relationship between events in girls lives and their ability to succeed in school will be key to achieving not only the post-2015 education goals but arguably the other development goals as well.
Over the past 25 years, access to school has increased dramatically. The gender gap has narrowed. More girls than ever are in school, and they are staying in school longer. Even in the developing world, adolescent girls are more likely to be in school than out of school. We need to celebrate that success.
But as girls stay in education longer, the challenges they face outside school have the potential to disrupt their education. Factors including early pregnancy , sexually transmitted infections, child marriage and sexual and gender-based violence all pose challenges. Many girls are grappling with these issues today  and those in the education sector need to know how to respond.
For decades, the Population Council and others have been studying disparities in education  disparities between girls and boys, between the poorest and most vulnerable populations and those who are better off. We have looked at what works in girls education, and analysed what girls need to complete primary school, and to gain access to a high-quality, safe secondary school where they can complete their education. We have looked at how to ensure girls learn in school and go on to become healthy, productive adults.
One thing we have noticed is just how difficult it is to pinpoint what causes girls to struggle in school or to drop out during adolescence. So many life changes happen during this time. A lot can depend on where a girl lives, how she is doing in school, and what pressures her family is facing.
But while it is difficult to tease out the exact reasons girls leave school, its crucial that we do try, because the causes determine the solutions. Pregnancy and early marriage are not necessarily the only issues. We must look deeper at which girls are most likely to become pregnant, get married or leave school prematurely. For example, if a girls family is poor and unable or unwilling to pay school fees, she may not have the support she needs to continue her education. Her parents may decide marriage is a better option for her future security.
In 2009, we conducted a review of more than 300 adolescent girls education programmes from around the world. The study revealed that the majority of these programmes were not based on evidence and were not evaluated to demonstrate whether or not they were achieving their goals.
Of the 11 most common programme interventions for adolescent girls, only two having female teachers and providing financial help  had been proven to be effective.
Too often, the scarce resources invested in girls education are going to programmes that lack evidence-based proof of success. These programmes are not being rigorously evaluated to see if they help girls stay in school longer, retain skills, and live healthy, productive lives.
To reap the benefits for girls and societies, we need evidence, not just intuition, to guide our efforts. Donors and policymakers must commit to using evidence  about the problem and what works to address it  when developing policies and deciding on funding.
Donors and implementing organisations should hold themselves to high standards: let no programme be implemented or funded without a solid base of evidence behind it, or a significant commitment to evaluation within it.
As world leaders put the final touches to the post-2015 education goals, a commitment to rigorous evidence must be a top priority. We are heartened by the new US/UK investment in education, because the agreement includes a welcome commitment of 10m from the UK to build the evidence base around adolescent girls education. We encourage others to follow this example.

The millennium development goals have driven the most successful anti-poverty movement in history , the UN said in its final report before the targets expire. While the MDGs have ended extreme poverty for more than a billion people since they began in 2000, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon warned that inequalities persist and progress has been uneven.
The EU must plan 25 years ahead in its strategy for dealing with surging numbers of refugees and migrants , warned Franois Crpeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. Crpeau said increasing aid spending to help stabilise turbulent countries would not immediately help stem the flow of migrants and refugees.

Should the economy go South, then I imagine there might be a revived interest in democracy, but that would be as a means to an end (prosperity) rather than as a goal in itself.
So - no, democracy is not a universal value, and it is highly dangerous to treat it as such. Trying to impose democracy on people who have no desire for it leads to chaos, bloodshed, and racial and ethnic strife, as many recent examples (Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Libya) unfortunately prove.

The millennium development goals have targeted eight key areas  poverty , education , gender equality , child mortality , maternal health , disease , the environment and global partnership . Each goal is supported by 21 specific targets and more than 60 indicators. Below, weve looked at what has been achieved on some of the targets within each goal.
MDG 1: The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day has been reduced from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015, although the target of halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger was narrowly missed.
MDG 2: Primary school enrolment figures have shown an impressive rise, but the goal of achieving universal primary education has just been missed, with the net enrolment rate increasing from 83% in 2000 to 91% this year.
MDG 3: About two-thirds of developing countries have achieved gender parity in primary education.
MDG 4: The child mortality rate has reduced by more than half over the past 25 years  falling from 90 to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births  but it has failed to meet the MDG target of a drop of two-thirds.
MDG 5: The global maternal mortality ratio has fallen by nearly half  short of the two-thirds reduction the MDGs aimed for.
MDG 6: The target of halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/Aids by 2015 has not been met, although the number of new HIV infections fell by around 40% between 2000 and 2013.
MDG 7: Some 2.6 billion people have gained access to improved drinking water since 1990, so the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was achieved in 2010  five years ahead of schedule. However, 663 million people across the world still do not have access to improved drinking water.
MDG 8: Between 2000 and 2014, overseas development assistance from rich nations to developing countries increased by 66% in real terms, and in 2013 reached the record figure of $134.8bn (80.3bn).

        <title>Greek referendum: smart response from Tsipras, but triumph may be brief</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/greek-referendum-alexis-tsipras-moment-triumph-may-be-brief</Link>

Alexis Tsiprass response to the Greek referendum was smart. A dumber politician might have been tempted to turn up the volume following the thumping victory for the no side in the referendum. But instead of striking macho poses, the Greek prime minister was emollient. He said Greece wanted to resume talks with its creditors, and backed up his words by getting rid of his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who relished being a figure of hate in Brussels.
Emollient and realistic, because, without question, Tsipras is in an uncomfortable position. The Greek economy is even closer to seizing up than it was before Sundays vote. The banks remain shut and it looks as if the cashpoints will run out of cash within the next 48 hours. Even if a deal is done in the next few days, Greece is in the early stages of another deep and painful recession.
All that said, Tsipras is better placed than he might have feared in the middle of last week, when it looked possible that the gamble of holding a referendum would blow up in his face.
Winning the vote decisively has refreshed the anti-austerity mandate he got from the Greek people at the general election in January. Far from securing the regime change they were seeking, the creditors now find that Syriza is being supported by all Greek political parties apart from the communists and the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn. By demonstrating that he wants to reopen negotiations, he has put the onus on Greeces 18 single-currency partners to respond.
Abrupt changes of tack have been a feature of the way Tsipras has behaved in the past five months. David Marsh, of the thinktank OMFIF, said: The failure of the creditor countries, led by Germany and the Netherlands, to recognise a central maxim of guerrilla fighting  the enemy will always surprise  provides a key reason for the Oxi win. If youre outnumbered, practise the unorthodox. Tearing up the rules of Brussels conduct, Tspiras and Varoufakis, his finance minister-cum-field marshal, have outmanoeuvred and divided the surplus states by constantly re-engaging, over five months, from unexpected, demanding and outrageous battle positions.
It is, of course, possible that Tsipras has overplayed his hand. Rebuilding trust with the other eurozone members may require a lot more than simply removing Varoufakis, such is the ill-feeling towards Greece. Marsh, for one, thinks Tsiprass moment of triumph will be brief.
The fruits of victory will turn sour, Marsh said. Varoufakiss decision to resign from the finance ministry  saying he will wear the creditors loathing with pride  seems sensible. Creditors and debtors alike will be punished. Greece faces a wrenching period of infighting and pain, during which devaluation-stamped banknotes, rationing of high street goods and exchange controls enforced by armed police will be only the least of the ills.
There are now only three outcomes from the crisis: Greece stays in the euro on slightly more advantageous terms that were on offer before the referendum; Greece and the troika stitch up a short-term funding deal in the hope that a lasting solution to the crisis can be found later; or the creditors reject the olive branch held out by Tsipras and force Greece out of the euro.
If it is the first, Tsipras will be seen as a hero in Greece. If it is the second, he will be able to say he forced the troika to blink first. If it is the third, he can say he did everything in his power to avoid a return to the drachma, but was left with no choice due to creditor intransigence.

Value of Taser use remains uncertain amid lack of transparency
Home Office says stun guns are important tactical option but lack of data over use of potentially lethal weapon worries rights campaigners

At the last count 33 people a week were shot with Taser stun guns in England and Wales. Children as young as 14 and pensioners as old as 82 were among those to feel the shock of the Metropolitan polices X26 Tasers last year.
According to one former police weapons expert the overwhelming pain of the pulsing charge from the device, which hooks into your flesh, floods every area of your consciousness.
But as the use of Tasers steadily grows, opinions about their value remain dramatically divided. The Home Office describes them as an important tactical option to help specially trained police officers resolve potentially violent situations safely. While Amnesty International says they are a potentially lethal weapon, which should be withdrawn from use by non-specialist firearms officers, many of whom currently carry them.
Related: Police Taser shooting contributed to man's death, jury finds
The inquest into the death of Jordan Begley, who died in Manchester after being hit by a police Taser, is just the latest to have asked whether Tasers kill. The jury concluded it did contribute to the 23-year-olds death in 2013. Between 2004 and 2013, the Independent Police Complaints Commission received 11 referrals about Taser use where someone died. In none of them was the use of a Taser found to have directly caused a death.
Inquests have been carried out into the deaths of Taser targets, Martin Baskeyfield and Andrew Pimlott. Baskeyfield was admitted to hospital days after he was Tasered in Stoke-on-Trent and died three months later. The coroner concluded he died of natural causes and said an investigation determined that the deployment of the Taser did not impact upon [his] death. Pimlott burst into flames after he was hit by a taser in Plymouth having already covered himself in petrol. He appeared to be striking a match to set himself alight and the police officer Tasered him to try to stop him. It sparked a fireball and Pimlott died from severe burns.
Concerns about their use are now being exacerbated by a lack of up-to-date information. The home secretary, Theresa May, has suspended the publication of Taser data after her officials uncovered inaccuracies in the data held on the Home Office Taser database and in the polices own recorded data.
The last national figures are for the first six months of 2014 and show that Tasers were drawn on 5,107 occasions and fired 826 times, but May has ordered an in-depth review of the publication of Taser data and other use of force by police officers, according to a spokesperson, who added: It is vital that its use is appropriate and proportionate, and transparent to the public.
It is expected that the publication of statistics will resume on 9 July and overall Taser use is likely to have increased again. Across England and Wales, Taser use has risen around five-fold since the start of 2009, according to the latest data .
But the recent lack of information over the use of the weapon has worried human rights campaigners. Amnesty International UK said it was concerned about ongoing problems with records about Taser use and transparency.
Amnesty has been calling for a consistent approach to the way Taser use is recorded, said spokesman Niall Couper. The group saidd that without proper records it was impossible to give the British public confidence that Tasers are being used appropriately and only in response to the most serious incidents.
In a report on Taser use (pdf) last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission warned of mission creep and said it was important to ensure that Tasers were not being used inappropriately or as a default choice where other tactical options, including communication, could be effective.
There are big variations in their usage, IPCC data shows . In 2013 police in Staffordshire used Tasers three times more per 100 officers than their counterparts in Lancashire.
The pain of being hit by a Taser is difficult to describe, according to one expert in police use of restraint and pain techniques.
It totally and utterly floods every area of your consciousness, he said, on condition of anonymity.
It really is extreme. I suffered the typical effects of going quite rigid. It is like your muscles contract into one mass. Immediately I could feel myself starting to fall. When the current was switched off, the muscles relaxed again. With the Taser your body is flooded with a painful sensation.
Data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act shows that in London, the police force area where Tasers are most often used, officers drew Tasers 1,934 times in 2014 and fired them 215 times.
Of those stunned, 11 were children, aged under 18. Officers also fired them at two 85-year-olds in 2013 and one 82-year-old in 2014.

With a return to the drachma unwanted, could Greece just print its own euros?

Faced with shuttered banks and ATMs all but drained of cash, but with most of its citizens saying they would rather stay in the eurozone than revert to the drachma, could Greece simply decide to print its own euro notes?
It is certainly physically capable of doing so: the Greek central bank owns a press in Holargos, a suburb of Athens, that once printed drachma and is currently one of 14 high-security currency printing works across the eurozone producing euro banknotes.
But actually going ahead and printing unauthorised notes would amount to a declaration of war on the European Central Bank .
Since the currencys introduction in 2002, all euro banknotes have been produced jointly by the national central banks of the eurozone area according to a strict schedule. According to the ECB, each national bank takes charge of  and pays for  a fixed proportion of the total annual production of one or more denominations of notes, which are then shipped to their destinations as required.
Volumes for the years ahead are set in advance using forecasts provided by each of the national banks combined with a central forecast made by the ECB. The overall number and denominations of notes produced then has to be approved each year by the ECBs governing council, and must be enough to meet expected and unexpected increases in demand and to replace worn notes.
Aside from moral and legal questions that would undoubtedly arise if Greece were to go ahead and print more of its own euros, however, there is another issue that makes this scenario highly unlikely: according to the ECBs website , the Greek press is only set up to print 10 notes. It would need to print tens of billions of those to produce enough money to meet its needs.

'The Greek blokes resigned. Hes run rings round em'
UK analyst predicts Yanis Varoufakiss departure may help in Greek crisis talks but, as the City will admit, no one really knows what will occur next

The Greek blokes resigned. Hes run rings round em.
Those words were how one City trader was overheard explaining the resignation of Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis , as he chatted on the phone in early trading, following the Greek referendum.
It represented what was a brief hum of excitement in the City as the markets opened on Monday morning, for the first time since the Hellenic Republic voted no. Like eurozone officials, the Square Mile had been expecting that last weeks taster of capital controls would spook the country into a yes vote in the countrys austerity referendum, and financial spread-betting firm IG Group last week priced a no vote as having only a 40% chance.
So what now? Monday mornings initial dips in the value of the euro and the worlds stock markets have been swiftly reversed  the euro is now down less than 1% against the dollar, while the FTSE is off by even less  as investors quickly started to buy again in the hope of a deal.
Related: Yanis Varoufakis: Angela Merkel has a red and a yellow button. One ends the crisis. Which does she push?
Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG, said: [Stock markets] opened down but are surging back - much like they did last Monday and much like the euro is doing. The markets are coming back on Varoufakiss resignation - possibly more in hope than expectation, but if you take out the most irritating man in the room then you might get a more reasonable response from Germany and France.
That could happen but, the City will also admit, so could almost anything else. Despite Greece being the worlds biggest financial story since the last time Greece was the worlds biggest financial story, there was surprisingly little activity in the equity markets, where volumes remained stubbornly low. The explanation from the trading floors was that this was because the City doesnt like uncertainty (or turning up for work during the summer), while nobody really seems to know what is going to happen next.
Related: Greek referendum: what happens now after the no vote?
IGs Alastair McCaig added: Ask politicians what is happening with Greece and they say, I dont know. Markets are the same. Greece has surprised at every opportunity. Last week they surprised by calling a referendum. This week they surprised by voting no. They have the propensity to surprise again.
Still, there are some in the City with unequivocal views about how they believe this will all play out  and if you desire a firm prediction, intertwined with multilingual wordplay, then you need some French analysis.
Simon French, that is, the chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, who is heroically eschewing his professions love of fence-sitting and prices the chances of a Grexit at 100%. Or, as the economist drolly puts it, its a feta-ccompli.
