The leader of the Islamic State (Isis), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remains incapacitated due to suspected spinal damage and is being treated by two doctors who travel to his hideout from the groups stronghold of Mosul, the Guardian has learned.
More than two months after being injured in a US air strike in north-western Iraq, the self-proclaimed caliph is yet to resume command of the terror group that has been rampaging through Iraq and Syria since June last year. Three sources close to Isis have confirmed that Baghdadis wounds could mean he will never again lead the organisation.
Isis is now being led by a long-term senior official, Abu Alaa al-Afri, who had been appointed deputy leader when his predecessor was killed by an air strike late last year.

Details of Baghdadis condition, and of the physicians treating him, have emerged since the Guardian revealed he had been seriously wounded on 18 March in an air strike that killed three men he was travelling with. The attack took place in al-Baaj, 80 miles (128km) west of Mosul.
The Pentagon subsequently denied that Baghdadi had been killed and, while it acknowledged that it had carried out the attack, claimed to be unaware that the worlds most wanted man had been among the casualties.
Sources within Mosul, who refused to be named, said a female radiologist from a main Mosul hospital and a male surgeon had treated Baghdadi. Both, along with their extended families, are strong ideological supporters of the group.
The womens sons work in the hospital, said one Mosul resident with knowledge of Baghdadis wounds. They dress like Kandaharis and even carry guns inside. Both are on the regional health board.
The man is not a renowned surgeon, but he is absolutely with them [Isis]. His daughter married a Salafist and said she was going to have as many children as she could to fight the enemies of Islam.

Only a small clique of Isis leaders know the extent of Baghdadis injuries, or where he is being treated. Fewer still have visited him. However, word of his wounds has started to spread to the groups second-tier leadership, where talk is rife of avenging the most serious blow to Isis since the group overran half of Iraq.
Afri is a professor of physics and a long-term member of Isis. He was touted as successor to the groups previous leader, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, who was killed in a US-led raid near Tikrit in April 2010. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi assumed the mantle of leader in the days following his predecessors death, but has dramatically risen to prominence since early 2013, when the group first made its presence felt in Syrias civil war. In June last year, less than 1,000 Isis fighters ousted the Iraqi army from the north of the country, and took control of Mosul, Tikrit as well as Anbar and Nineveh provinces.
Since then, Isis has menaced Baghdad and Irbil and drawn the US military back to a country it had left in 2011.
They have a lot of confidence in al-Afri, said Hisham al-Hashimi, senior adviser on Isis to the Iraqi government. He is smart, and a good leader and administrator. If Baghdadi ends up dying, he will lead them.
Two Isis insiders told the Guardian that the US-led air strikes, which have also involved Jordanian and GCC fighter jets, have taken a heavy toll on the organisations numbers, and increasingly its morale.
They are planning to fight back against Europe, one member said. They want to take revenge for Baghdadi.
While boasting technical skills that can monitor telephone calls and internet traffic, the US and its allies have limited access to on-the-ground sources within Isis  a fact well understood by the groups senior members, who largely avoid using technology.

Nepal earthquake death toll exceeds 6,000 with thousands unaccounted for
Thousands of villages devastated and 90% of clinics and schools in some districts unusable as Kathmandu slowly returns to normal

The death toll in the massive earthquake which struck Nepal on Saturday has passed 6,000, and many thousands are still unaccounted for.
A home ministry official said the 6,134 fatalities had been confirmed, with 13,906 injured. The head of the European Union delegation in Nepal said 1,000 people from the EU are missing and 12 are confirmed dead.
Although the battered south Asian nation celebrated the rescue of two people pulled out alive from the wreckage of buildings in Kathmandu on Thursday , the sheer extent of the destruction is becoming clear.
Thousands of villages have been devastated, with up to 90% of clinics and schools in some districts rendered unusable.

Ram Sharan Mahat, the Nepalese finance minister, said it at least $2bn would be needed to rebuild homes, hospitals, government offices and historic buildings and he appealed for help from international donors.
This is just an initial estimate and it will take time to assess the extent of damage and calculate the cost of rebuilding, Mahat said.
Other estimates have been higher. Huge numbers of ancient monuments and important cultural buildings will also need to be restored, if they are not demolished. Major palaces in Kathmandu have been damaged and cracked.

Hundreds of thousands of people made homeless by the quake, which registered 7.8 magnitude, are yet to receive aid because of logistic bottlenecks, poor infrastructure and a chaotic government response.
Three thousand people are still unaccounted for in the badly hit Sindhupalchowk district , while little is known about northern areas of the Gorkha district where about 10,000 live. Local officials fear widespread destruction.
A local religious leader who had flown over the zone said people there were living in appalling conditions.
There are still injured there who have not been treated. Whole villages are flattened. They need tents very badly, Kempo Chimed Tsering said.
EU ambassador Rensje Teerink said the unaccounted Europeans were mostly tourists in the Langtang and Lukla areas. Langtang is a trekking region to the north of Kathmandu that has been hit by a huge avalanche and mudslides, while Lukla is the jumping off point for walkers and climbers making the nine-day trek to Everest base camp.
Diplomats are finding it hard to trace the missing because many backpackers do not register with their embassies when they arrive in the country.
Kathmandu is slowly returning to normal with power supplies and communication networks restored to most of the city.
I think its over now. I feel safe now, said Vivek Ksimdung, 20, a student in the city.
However, many remain terrified of another tremor. Police have arrested two men for spreading rumours that a second major earthquake had been predicted. They will be charged with inciting panic among the public.
On Thursday night watching crowds cheered as Nepalese rescuers, assisted by a US disaster team, pulled a 15-year-old boy from the debris of a seven-storey structure, where he had reportedly stayed alive by eating jars of ghee and drinking water dripping from his clothes.
Just streets away, rescuers worked into the night to free a woman from the rubble of a hotel.

The dust-covered teenager, who had been trapped in a small gap behind a bike under two metres of rubble, was eventually lifted blinking into the sunlight and placed on a stretcher, with a blue brace around his neck and a drip in his arm.
All of the sudden I saw light, said the teenager, named variously in reports as Pemba Tamang and Pemba Lama, after he was extricated. He did not know whether he was alive or dead. I thought I was hallucinating, AP reported him as saying.
Libby Weiss, from an Israeli military-run medical centre, said he was doing well and did not appear to have any major injuries.
I dont have any logical explanation. It is miraculous. It is a wonderful thing to see in all this destruction, she said.
He was under the rubble for 120 hours and it is certainly the longest we have heard anybody of being under the rubble and surviving.
We understand he didnt have any food and just two jars of ghee, which he had at the time he was under the rubble.

The second survivor was carried by stretcher to a waiting ambulance after Nepalese soldiers and a huge team of experts from France, Norway and Israel worked to rescue her.
She was injured but she was conscious and talking, a Nepalese army major said.
She has been sent to a military hospital, he said, identifying the woman to AFP as a kitchen worker in her mid-30s called Krishna Devi Khadka. It is as though she had been born again.
However, such stories remain rare after the great quake, as local media have called it.
Officials said Pemba had been talking to two other people trapped in the rubble until early Thursday, but they had gone silent. The body of a teenager was removed soon afterwards.
Emergency teams have mainly been pulling bodies from the rubble, a task made all the more perilous by more than 70 aftershocks, the strongest measuring 6.9 magnitude, the Indian meteorological department in Delhi said.
Rain has left many people with the dilemma of risking a return to damaged homes which could collapse in an aftershock or sleeping in tents or other temporary shelters.
Large numbers have left Kathmandu on free buses provided by the government, often to check on relatives in other regions.

The weather has cleared over much of the country, allowing rescue and relief missions to be stepped up. Much of the famous Khumbu valley, around Everest, had been cut off by bad weather for several days. Flights have now resumed.
The British and Chinese governments have said they are sending additional helicopters, and on Thursday, a group of Gurkhas serving in the British army arrived in the capital to lend a hand with the recovery. The soldiers from the Queens Gurkha Engineers Unit set up a portable water purification unit on the grounds of what used to a royal palace in Kathmandu.
Anger over the slow pace of the rescue flared earlier in the week with protests outside parliament.

The official death toll does not include the 19 people killed at Mount Everest  five foreign climbers and 14 Nepalese sherpas  when the quake caused an avalanche at base camp on the worlds highest peak.
The UN has launched an appeal for $415m (270m) and Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters.
There are widespread fears of disease in remote areas and in Kathmandu. One pharmacist in the Lalitpur area of Kathmandu immediately sold his entire stock of anti-diahorrhea medicine and oral rehydration salts.

At the Chemsun Global pharmaceutical laboratory in an industrial park in Shanghai, the smell of fumes is so intense it leaves a bitter, chemical aftertaste in your mouth. At midnight on a recent Friday, a Chinese chemist who called himself Terry was eager to close a deal.
In the laboratory outside, a bright yellow liquid whirred around a flask. The place was filthy: surfaces were strewn with discarded rubber gloves and in one corner a sack of white powder spilled onto the floor.
I was there to inspect the lab, to take stock of the wooden barrels full of drugs, but Terry wasnt interested in small talk. You just take the samples, right? he said, near shouting. Lets just be quick. Tell me what you want, how much you want, then we can talk about price, we can talk about shipment.
In the last decade, the global trade in drugs has changed in profound and unpredictable ways. The reality of drugs in the digital age is that on deep web markets any illegal drug, from marijuana to methamphetamine, is a click or two away.

Meanwhile the newly interconnected, globalised drugs scene has grown too complex and fractured for existing laws to control  a situation vividly illustrated by the rapid emergence of legal highs, or what official bodies call novel psychoactive substances (NPS).
Legal highs are chemical compounds synthesised in labs that stimulate or depress the central nervous system in a way that mimics banned substances such as cannabis or cocaine. Chemists tinker with the structure of NPS compounds so that they fall outside international drug controls  at least when they first emerge.
And more of them are reaching the market every year: since 2009, the number, type and availability of these drugs has seen an unprecedented increase, according to a report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). Scores of new substances are reported in Europe and the US each year, and drug control agencies have now categorised more than 400 substances.
Drug policies in consumer countries such as the US and UK were conceived long before the internet and globalisation radically transformed the drugs market.
The deluge of toxic substances, hyperventilating media coverage and a recent spate of hospitalisations have shattered any illusion of government control.
In the last month, New York, Mississippi and Alabama have all issued state health alerts following a dramatic rise in NPS overdoses , while Arizona, Florida, New Jersey and Texas report a similar surge. In Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, where one person died and two dozen were hospitalised after taking spice, police declared a public safety crisis.
Curtailing NPS has been a priority for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) since 2012, but last year one in five Americans told the Global Drugs Survey that they had taken a legal high in the last year  more than any other country in the world.

All this has happened in a relatively short time. The mass production of legal highs began only in 2008, when UN drugs officials destroyed 33 tonnes of safrole oil, a precursor of MDMA, in Cambodia.
As MDMA stocks in Europe dwindled, suppliers shopped around for an alternative  and found mephedrone, a substance that was chemically similar to MDMA but not controlled in the UK. For the two years before it was banned, users could not get enough of this cheap, cocaine-meets-ecstasy high.
Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer originally developed synthetic cannabinoids  drugs designed to mimic the effect of cannabis  as research tools to investigate the mechanisms of the brains endocannabinoid system for clinical therapy.
Vendors began trawling obscure scientific journals for compounds, consumers described their highs on online drug forums, and the nascent market took shape. Wholesale importers in the UK, US and Europe put in bulk orders from chemical companies to be delivered through the post or by international couriers.
China has long been the worlds factory for anything from iPhones to Christmas tree lights, so it was perhaps inevitable that it would fill the same role for drugs: local labs churn out huge amounts of chemicals for legitimate pharmaceutical or industrial purposes  so it was not hard for importers to find dozens of firms in Shanghai able to produce vast quantities of legal highs.
Local officials, if adequately bribed, would look the other way; the Chinese government was more concerned with rising domestic consumption of banned drugs than chemicals that are legal and headed abroad.
China, as one headline in Time magazine put it, soon became the  new front in the global drug war .
I had been emailing another Shanghai chemist named Charles for months about a hypothetical order of a cannabinoid called AB-Chminaca (AB-C), a substance which is banned in the US, but not the UK. The headquarters of his company is on the 12th floor of a near-deserted office building on the edge of the city. On arrival, I am ushered into a meeting room and given a paper cup of steaming, loose-leaf green tea.
Charless company will sell 1kg of AB-C for 1,120 ($1,720). On a UK vendor site, 10g costs 60 ($92). Based on this sales price, the vendor makes 4,880 ($7,500) profit per kilogramme before shipping, processing and packaging.
I ask whether Charles can guarantee delivery. We divide into one kilo packages and can ship all in one day, he says. If you write down a couple of addresses, I can deliver 50 kilos.
After a lunch of prawns with rice noodles and pumpkin  Charles chain smokes throughout  we drive across the city to an industrial park in the district of Pudong.
At the door a chubby woman in her 30s with cropped hair and a white coat greets us: she is the head chemist. We walk through a spotless lab of quietly industrious technicians (I like a clean lab, Im a girl, says the chemist) to an expensive-looking machine that performs gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Our purity is above 99%, she says with pride.
A large plastic bag contains some 50 samples of off-white powders and crystals  stimulants, depressants, opioids. We sit down to talk. Im afraid this [compound] is not good, the chemist says in accented English. Firstly, somebody give us the feedback that its not strong. Second, it seems it has already [caused] dead in Russia. Do you know the news? So why do you still want it?
She has a theory that the drugs uneven performance is the result of clumsy synthesis, of molecules substituted in the wrong places. Does she know anything about its potency? We know nothing about the performance side, she says, hastily. We are just chemists.
AB-C was first mentioned on drugs forums in early 2014. As a synthetic cannabinoid it is one of the most popular types of NPS and is a derivative, or close chemical cousin, of AB-Fubinaca, a substance banned in February 2014 in the US .
Cannabinoids are designed to work in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the constituent of cannabis that acts on receptors in the brain to produce a psychoactive effect, or a high.
Today they are typically dissolved in solvents and sprayed on plant material before being packaged in 1g-3g foil packets with brand names such as Spice, K2 and Herbal Haze. They are labelled as incense, research chemicals or potpourri and marked not for human consumption so as to be sold legally in convenience stores, head shops or online. Vendors do not include dosage advice to avoid condoning use and breaking the law.
In order to keep ahead of legal control, the NPS market must constantly evolve: a small variation on the chemical structure of a banned drug allows the new substance to skirt most legislation  but this tiniest molecular tweak can create a drug with dramatically different psychoactive effects.
AB-C is active at a far lower dose than its parent compound, so mistakes are easily made. In a February post on an online drug forum, one user  who described himself as very experienced  described his accidental overdose of AB-C: I drop onto my bed, towel over my face, wet hair, wet body, split naked, open windows at freezing point, blankets underneith [sic] me, I couldnt care less. Im so stoned, so so stoned  Am I gonna die?

Under a haze of misinformation, the reality is that most people smoke whatever spice comes in the packet.
On 2 April, Alan Jones, chair of the emergency department at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, received a phone call from a nurse in the ER. She told me that we were receiving our fourth patient by ambulance who had reportedly used spice  the fourth patient in two hours, he said. We dont typically see that.
Over the next 72 hours, a further 25 patients arrived, and Dr Jones notified the state health department. I have been working in emergency medicine for almost 20 years, and Ive never seen anything like this, he says.
Since early April, more than 500 people from almost every county in Mississippi have sought emergency medical treatment after overdosing on spice. The youngest patient seen at the hospital was 14.
Most arrive hallucinating, agitated and profusely sweating. Often, because they are confused, they are violent. A couple of patients have had problems with their breathing  not breathing sufficiently to maintain life, Dr Jones says.
A toxicological analysis of the Mississippi compound identified MAB-Chminaca, an AB-C derivative.
Since the DEA first encountered AB-C in March 2014 it has caused at least four deaths in the US. Adverse effects from taking the drug includes coma, loss of motor control, difficulty breathing and convulsions, according to the DEA notice that temporarily banned AB-C and two other cannabinoids in December 21014 . (AB-C is legal to sell in the UK.)
Soon after the ban, users of online drug forums started discussing which compounds could be compared to or better than AB-C. MAB-Chminaca was considered a sound alternative, and the endless game of whack-a-mole, as one DEA official has put it, continued.

The emergence of NPS has created an unprecedented challenge for drug policymakers worldwide. The current global prohibition on drugs was established by UN treaties dating back to the 1960s and has been incorporated into the domestic laws of 150 countries. Its roots are in the US prohibition of alcohol 1920-32, a costly experiment that failed to stop people drinking and instead fuelled a black market in moonshine run by rapacious gangs.
In 1971, US president Richard Nixon rebranded prohibition as a war on drugs.
Within prohibition, the UK and US use subtly different legislation, though neither approach has successfully stemmed NPS.
The US analogue controls can designate a substance not named in legislation illegal if it is substantially similar to a drug already controlled  a system criticised for being ambiguous.
In contrast, the UKs generic controls list individual drugs or families on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), a body of scientists, academics, police and other experts.
But this system proved too clunky  it could take months for the experts to conclude a drug was unsafe  so in 2011 the UK introduced new measures called Temporary Class Drug Orders , allowing the government to temporarily ban a substance while evaluating its harms. Despite these measures, only 60% of known cannabinoids are currently controlled in the UK.

Danny Kushlick, head of external affairs at Transform, a British drugs reform thinktank, calls the UKs legislative response to NPS terrible.
One of the unintended consequences of prohibition, according to the UNs Office on Drugs and Crime, is substance displacement, whereby the control of one substance causes suppliers and users to move to another drug with similar effects but fewer controls.
Legal highs appear to have arisen because of success in the enforcement on the supply side for cocaine and ecstasy particularly, Kushlick says. The demand remains and the entrepreneurs, whether they be criminal or legit, move in to exploit that demand.
Mike Power, author of Drugs 2.0, argues that the answer to the legal high dilemma does not lie in punitive controls and the annual spending of millions of taxpayers dollars . Drugs law should be progressively dismantled, he says, recommending the introduction of a controlled, regulated market of cannabis as seen in Colorado.
The strength and potency of the drug would be limited by law, with accurate labelling and age requirements for prospective users demanded as we currently have with alcohol, he says.
Kushlick, too, advocates legalising the more benign substances. When prohibition goes and we have legally regulated markets for drugs that have been used, in the case of cannabis, for millennia, people will choose to use those, he says. Why would you want to use a random white powder?

After elections in which her far-right party gained power in local and regional elections across France , Le Pen has sought to capitalise on discontent over President Franois Hollandes handling of the economy and rising unemployment.
Her speech took aim at the Socialist president and his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, who is trying to put his conservative UMP party back on track before the 2017 presidential election.
They have allowed massive immigration to install itself in France. They have unpinned the Islamic fundamentalist grenade, Le Pen said. We are right on everything.

Before she was able to start her speech to hundreds of FN supporters in central Paris, Le Pen was twice caught off guard.
Her father and party founder, Jean-Marie, who usually speaks at the event, unexpectedly took to the podium to cheers despite a party disciplinary procedure against him over his repeated controversial comments about the second world war.
The 86-year-old former paratrooper left the stage without uttering a word and did not wait to listen to his daughters speech.
Minutes later, the Femen activists chanted anti-FN slogans from the balcony of a building overlooking the stage, to boos from the crowd.

Lots of surprises on this May 1, a visibly unsettled Le Pen said. Its quite a paradox when you call yourself a feminist and try to disturb a tribute to Joan of Arc.
Femen activists had earlier disrupted FN supporters laying a wreath at a statue of the 15th-century French heroine, who has been seized on by the far right as a nationalist symbol.
After about 10 minutes, four FN security men seized the protesting women, who were later arrested.
Since succeeding her father as party chief in 2011, Le Pen has sought to rid the FN of its antisemitic image and position it as an anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic force advocating protectionist policies.

The war in Yemen has intensified in recent days, with the southern city of Aden rocked by some of the most ferocious street battles since the start of hostilities and the capital, Sanaa, enduring one of the worst sustained air raids in the last month.
The humanitarian situation is growing increasingly desperate after five weeks of aerial bombardment and blockade by a Saudi-led coalition, with major shortages in fuel, food, water and medicine causing a generalised catastrophe in the Arab worlds poorest country, aid workers say.
The fighting is at its worst, an Aden resident who fled the frontline and took refuge in another area of the city said by telephone on Thursday.

Fierce street battles raged through much of Aden, a stronghold of supporters of the ousted president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is in exile in Saudi Arabia. Popular committees made up of local youth and other fighters are battling Houthi rebels and troops loyal to the longtime strongman of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was replaced by Hadi in a deal brokered by the Gulf states after Arab Spring-style protests.
The Houthis, who hail from the northern province of Saada and are members of the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, took control of Sanaa in a surprise offensive last autumn, and later placed Hadi under house arrest . After he fled his detention to Aden, the Houthis and their allies launched a campaign to seize the southern port city, prompting a Saudi-led coalition, fearful of the rebels close ties to Iran, to launch Operation Decisive Storm , a series of air strikes to block the rebels advance.
The Saudis renamed the campaign Operation Restoration of Hope last week, and the air strikes have intensified in recent days, signalling the coalitions resolve in fighting the Houthis.
We are barely getting our daily food, we are besieged everywhere
Aden resident
The resident from Aden said the Houthis and their allies were shelling residential streets to terrorise civilians and were taking refuge from air strikes in densely populated neighbourhoods. He also said the rebels had posted snipers in buildings and many locals were too terrified to leave their homes for fear of being shot.
We are barely getting our daily food, we are besieged everywhere and things are deteriorating for the people, he said. There is a great wound in the peoples spirit.
The man, who said two of his close relatives had been killed fighting the Houthis, said some weapons and ammunition had been supplied by the coalition to aid local fighters in the battles, and that the resistance is now better organised, but that it was not enough to reverse rebel gains.
I think reconciliation with the Houthis after this would not be possible, he said. The people can never forget these massacres.
On Friday, the Saudi defence ministry said three Saudi soldiers and dozens of Yemeni rebels were killed overnight after the rebels and their supporters launched a cross-border attack on the kingdoms southern Najran province.

The air strikes, which appear to have checked the Houthi advance in the south and destroyed large quantities of military gear and ammunition, have done little to alter the balance on the ground.

The campaign has killed more than 1,000 people in five weeks, and injured more than 4,300, according to UN figures. About 9 million Yemenis are believed to be in dire need of humanitarian assistance, and 150,000 have become internal refugees, often fleeing the city to village homes that lack basic services and infrastructure. More than 100 children have been killed in the conflict and more than 170 injured, according to figures released last week by Unicef, which said the estimates are conservative because not all the casualties have been documented.
In Aden, residents often hide in their homes. Ambulances and health workers have been attacked in the course of the fighting, and health facilities and schools have been occupied by fighters in the southern city. Children have also been recruited to take part in combat, Unicef said.
Many residents in areas affected by the fighting now fear dying in the crossfire if they make the journey to undersupplied hospitals for treatment.
Widespread fuel shortages are also taking their toll, with hospitals quickly running out of material to run their generators, which are crucial amid the electricity outages affecting most of the country. The lack of fuel also means water pumps that provide clean drinking water cannot be operated, leaving many civilians forced to drink dirty water.
An ongoing siege and blockade has worsened the humanitarian situation. Only limited food and medical supplies are getting to the country in recent weeks by boat or air, with damaged airport runways now unable to receive large cargo planes after initial consignments of emergency aid were flown in.

The security situation, along with fuel, food and medical supply shortages feed into each other. Aid workers cannot move supplies to affected areas due to security restrictions, and limited fuel means vehicles are unable to drive along exposed and vulnerable roads.

After a recent air strike at Faj Attan, a suburb of Sanaa, which wounded hundreds, a local hospital urged residents to donate fuel so it could operate generators to treat the wounded.
Its a vicious cycle, said Marie Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Sanaa.
Feghali said fuel and electricity shortages are severe, with the capital getting just one hour of electricity a day. Yemen also imports 90% of its food, leading to major shortages and skyrocketing prices amid the blockade, she said.
Hospitals cannot function due to the lack of fuel and electricity and combatants are not respecting the neutrality of medical workers, who have been forced to evacuate hospitals close to the frontlines, including Adens al-Joumhouria hospital this week.
You cannot imagine how painful it is to see the patients that were just so afraid that they were getting out with IVs and everything still attached to them, Feghali said.
She said the fighting in Aden has prevented civilians from going out to obtain food and water or to leave the city to seek shelter elsewhere. No one is moving bodies still l ying in the street for fear of being shot.

Feghali called for an immediate humanitarian pause in the fighting to allow crucial supplies in and to permit civilians to get out of combat zones.
Andr Prache, the head of mission of Mdecins sans Frontires in Yemen, said all hospitals are facing fuel shortages as well as a lack of emergency medication, surgical material, IV fluids and medicine for chronic illnesses such as diabetes.
He described the humanitarian situation as a generalised catastrophe that was likely to become increasingly desperate as time wore on.

Turkish police have fired teargas and water cannon at hundreds of stone-throwing May Day protesters in Istanbul, after they defied a ban and tried to march on Taksim Square.
Europes biggest city was under a security lockdown on Friday, as thousands of police manned barricades and closed streets to halt demonstrations at Taksim, a traditional rallying ground for leftists that saw weeks of unrest in 2013.
Riot police unleashed water cannon and chased protesters down sidereets in the nearby Beikta neighbourhood, where they fired canisters of teargas, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene. Several people were detained after demonstrators lobbed stones and bottles at police and set off fireworks.
Citing security concerns, much of Istanbuls public transport had been shut down and police helicopters circled over the city. Tens of thousands also gathered to march in the capital, Ankara, where the mood was more festive, with dancing and singing.
Critics say President Tayyip Erdoan and his government have become more authoritarian in the buildup to elections in June. People want to express their problems but the government doesnt want those problems to be heard ahead of elections, opposition politician Mahmut Tanal told Reuters.
The normally busy Istiklal shopping avenue leading to Taksim was deserted, with shops closed and metal barricades blocking sidestreets. Police helicopters circled overhead.
Taksim, a usually bustling square lined with cafes and hotels, was filled with police buses, ambulances and satellite broadcast trucks. A pair of tourists emerged from a hotel to find the area sealed off as they nervously made their way around police lines.
The government had said Taksim would be open only to those who came peacefully and not for illegal demonstrations. I wish May 1 to be celebrated in a festive mood without provocations, Erdoan said. Opposition parties and unions called on the government to lift the ban.
Erdoan has previously dismissed protesters as riff-raff and terrorists, outraged by the unrest in 2013 that brought unwanted international attention and posed the biggest challenge to his AK party since it came to power in 2002.
He is aiming for a massive victory for the party in the forthcoming parliamentary polls, which would allow it to change the constitution and give him broad presidential powers.
The 2013 Taksim protests began as a peaceful demonstration against plans to redevelop Gezi Park, a leafy corner of the square. After a police crackdown, the demonstration spiralled into weeks of nationwide protests against Erdoans rule.
The May Day demonstrations are the first large-scale protests since the government passed a security bill this year giving police expanded powers to crack down on protesters.

        <title>Freddie Gray protests: second prisoner in Baltimore police van comes forward</title>

A man identifying himself as a key witness to Freddie Grays death in custody has come forward to reject previous reports suggesting he told investigators the 25-year-old caused his own fatal injuries inside a police van.
Donta Allen, interviewed by two TV channels on Thursday, said he was the second prisoner authorities had said was inside the vehicle with Gray on 12 April. According to a police timeline, the second prisoner was placed in the vehicle around 20 minutes after Gray was arrested at 1700 Presbury Street, in west Baltimore .

The city remains on edge after a small group of protesters attempted to challenge the 10pm curfew on Thursday.
Investigators have said Gray and the other prisoner were separated by a wall and never saw each other. But the testimony of the second prisoner has become crucial in piecing together the circumstances of Grays death. Baltimore city officials have maintained it is likely Gray sustained his injuries inside the van.
On Thursday, a leaked police document, reported by the Washington Post , stated that the second prisoner believed Gray was intentionally trying to injure himself by banging against the walls. But Allen, interviewed by CBS Baltimore , denied saying this.
And theyre trying to make it seem like I told them that, I made it like Freddie Gray did that to himself, Allen said. Why the fuck would he do that to himself ?
In another interview with WBAL TV , Allan said that when he was placed in the van he didnt hear anything and described the journey to the Western District police station as a smooth ride. All I heard was a little banging for about four seconds, Allen said.

Asked again if he had heard Gray banging his head against the van, Allen responded ambiguously: I told homicide that. I dont work for the police. I did not tell the police nothing.
The comments came as local media were reportedly briefed on the findings of a police investigation into Grays death , which concluded that his fatal injury was sustained after he slammed his head against a bolt in the back of the van. Police have conceded Gray was not wearing a seatbelt throughout the journey, leading to speculation he was subjected to a rough ride  where a prisoner is thrown violently as a vehicle is driven erratically.
On Thursday, police handed their findings to the state attorney for Baltimore, who will decide whether to charge any of the six officers involved in Grays arrest. Police said they had uncovered a fourth stop on the vans journey to the station, raising further questions.

In Baltimore on Thursday night, a crowd of around 200 people, including protesters, journalists and legal observers, gathered at the intersection of Pennsylvania and W North Avenues, with the demonstrators carrying signs and chanting slogans.
Their numbers dwindled as 10pm neared, until they were outnumbered by journalists, but they were nonetheless faced with a line of officers dressed in riot gear.
In an attempt to ward off a clash, several volunteers from the nearby Simmons Memorial Baptist ministry formed a line near the burned-out CVS grocery shop  which had been looted and set alight on Monday night  to nudge protesters home.

Sheirmiar White, a young Simmons volunteer, was holding the line with several members of his church, who wore white T-shirts with #DoBetter printed on the front. Were out here as a community that has come together to make sure everybody gets home safe tonight, White said, conceding that he didnt mind the enforced curfew because it was putting the people first.
Congressman Elijah Cummings, who has been a fixture at the citys protests since the curfew came into force on Tuesday night, was again urging the gathered few to go home.
Police helicopters circled overhead warning protesters to disperse. But over a megaphone, the Democratic representative led the group in prayer before guiding the line down Pennsylvania Avenue to the tune of This Little Light of Mine. The song did little to drown out the voice of one angry protester who was arrested by police after the curfew deadline.

Cummings asked God to bless the Maryland state attorney, Marilyn Mosby, and spoke of the difficult work ahead of her. Amid the media circus the dead body of a man was retrieved from a truck parked at the scene, though the incident appears to have been unrelated to the protests .
The final group of protesters dispersed after police brought out two German shepherd dogs. Its like the 60s out here, said one protester as he left.
With most peoples indoors for the night, the roads of the city were deserted, save a few civilian cars and a host of law enforcement vehicles winding their way back to the carpark of the Baltimore Ravens M&amp;T Bank Stadium. The parking lot is the makeshift headquarters for all of the out-of-town law enforcement units, which included the New Jersey and Pennsylvania state police and the national guard.
On the largely empty streets a second person was seen by the Guardian being arrested for what police said was a violation of curfew. Two officers were separately seen downtown handing out food, shoes and clothes to several homeless people gathered outside the Healthcare for the Homeless shelter.

The emergency calls became increasingly desperate. When are you coming? Its already burning and there are people inside, a woman told the fire brigade dispatcher. Minutes later, callers started describing how people were jumping from the upper floors.
Have you lost your minds? one man asked, his voice breaking. There are women and children in the building! another man yelled.
In one of the most deadly episodes in Ukraines turbulent 2014 power transition, 48 people were killed and hundreds injured on 2 May last year in the Black Sea port of Odessa. Street battles culminated in a fatal fire at Soviet-era building where hundreds of pro-Russia activists were barricaded in .
As the one-year anniversary approaches, multiple investigations have shed little light on events. There is not even an official list of the dead, and none of the pro-Ukraine activists involved have been put on trial. Many allege that investigators are dragging their feet for political reasons, possibly to cover up high-level complicity. At least one participant formally accused of murder and attempted murder remains free while awaiting trial.
The events in Odessa last year played a key role in the unfolding violence further east, where Russia-backed separatists rose up against Ukrainian authorities. Russian state-owned media characterised the days events as a massacre planned by fascists in Kiev, a narrative that has gained widespread traction.
Rumours swirl of a higher death toll, the use of poisonous gas and the body of a pregnant woman garrotted by pro-Ukraine fanatics. Russian officials have compared the events to Nazi war crimes, and many Russian fighters battling Kiev in eastern Ukraine cite what happened in Odessa as their motivation for joining the separatist cause.
On the other side, some in Kiev see a pro-Ukraine victory on 2 May that prevented a local attempt to form a Russian-backed separatist state, and hail those who threw cobble stones, or even fired guns, as heroes.
Interviews with witnesses and amateur footage from the day present a very different version of events. While questions remain over decisions made by top officials, a narrative can be pieced together. Most of what is known is thanks to work done by the 2 May Group, an organisation of 13 local experts investigating the tragedy on a volunteer basis.
There was a lot of heroism and cruelty on both sides, said Tatyana Gerasimova, the head of the group.
Most of the deaths occurred in Odessas Trade Union building, a large five-floor structure on the edge of the city centre, which was defended by outnumbered pro-Russia activists and attacked by hundreds of pro-Ukraine protesters.
But street battles first broke out several hours before the Trade Union building fire. They were sparked when a group of masked pro-Russia activists allegedly led by Sergei Dolzhenkov, a former police officer known as Captain Kakao, attacked a pro-Ukraine march mostly made up of football fans. The pro-Russia men were armed with clubs, fireworks, homemade grenades and guns.

The first person to die was 27-year-old Igor Ivanov, a pro-Ukraine member of the extreme nationalist organisation Right Sector. He was gunned down on Odessas main street, lined with cafes, bars and restaurants and usually thronged with tourists.
The head of the local pro-Ukraine Maidan self-defence group, Dmitry Gumenyuk, recalled the effect of the homemade grenades, fashioned by taping bolts and nails to firecrackers. One of ours was very badly injured. They threw a smoke flare and he started to gasp for breath and broke ranks. When he let down his shield they threw a grenade and it exploded under his bullet-proof vest and four nails entered his lungs, he said.
In clear evidence of police complicity, video footage from these clashes shows a pro-Russia activist, shielded by police, shooting with a modified AK-47. Dmitry Fuchedzhi, a deputy police chief in Odessa reportedly known as Uncle Dima to pro-Russia activists, was said to have been seen mingling with shooters.
In a visit to Odessa this month, the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko , accused Fuchedzhi of distributing arms to both sides. Fuchedzhi, believed to be hiding in the pro-Russia Moldovan breakaway region of Transdnistria, claims he has been scapegoated by Kiev.
Odessas police have a long history of cooperation with pro-Russian activists, according to local journalist Oleg Konstantinov, who was injured while covering events on 2 May. He estimated up to 80% of the police force had Russian sympathies. They understand very well that Russia is a police state, he said.
I saw a lot of people who were shooting. Half the town had a weapon that day
Sergei Khodiak, pro-Ukraine activist
Spurred on by the cooperation of police and pro-Russia activists, the pro-Ukraine side quickly gathered its supporters and the fighting escalated. Four pro-Russia activists were killed by gunfire from the Ukrainian side.
Pro-Ukraine activist Sergei Khodiak, who has brown hair and was said to be wearing a blue jumper that day, is officially accused of murder, although he is not under arrest. Footage shows a man wearing the same jumper as Khodiak firing a hunting rifle into the pro-Russian crowd. Khodiak, who denied the charges in an interview, said he had at least five acquaintances with the same jumper.

I saw a lot of people who were shooting, and shooting from real weapons  half the town had a weapon that day, he said.
Fighting in the city centre continued for several hours, with activists playing a vicious cat-and-mouse game, trying to outflank each other in Odessas grid-like streets. Eventually pro-Russians were pushed back, and they fled the city centre, many streaming towards the square outside the Trade Union building where a pro-Russia tent camp had been in place for several months.
Central Odessa where street fighting broke out in May 2014.
In a running confrontation, both sides threw molotov cocktails, one of which set alight a makeshift barricade in the foyer. Piles of wooden pallets, a generator and other equipment from a dismantled pro-Russia tent camp quickly began to burn. Smoke and flames sped up the main stairwell, drawn by smashed windows on higher floors.
The smoke was so strong that I couldnt see, recalled Nina Kochanovskaya, 60, a pro-Russia activist trapped on the second floor. I was between smoke and fire  I stood on the windowsill and realised I had no choice but to jump. At the last moment, a man outside gestured her to move to another room where there was less smoke. That corridor was hell, it was pitch black  if someone hadnt opened the door I would never have found it, she said.
Initially, people huddled on the landings between floors, where a light breeze had created small pockets of fresh air by open windows. But shortly before 8pm, the fire suddenly intensified, creating a pillar of flames in the main stairwell as high as the fourth floor, causing a sharp rise in temperature and throwing out dense clouds of black smoke and toxic fumes.
The air pockets disappeared, and many died trapped next to the now ineffective windows. At least eight people, including one 17-year-old, jumped to their deaths to avoid suffocation. Amateur video shot from the outside shows bodies falling, one after the other, from the upper floors. Fifteen people were overcome on the fifth floor by carbon monoxide fumes generated by the blaze.
In a matter of seconds the corridor was completely filled with black smoke ... there was nothing to breathe
Elena, Trade Union building occupier
Witnesses recalled the rapidity with which the relatively small fire became an inferno. In a matter of seconds the corridor was completely filled with black smoke  there was nothing to breathe and I couldnt see anything, said Elena, a doctor who manned a makeshift first-aid point on the second floor.
The chaos was intensified by groups of armed pro-Ukraine activists who attempted to storm the building through side doors. There were pitched battles in the buildings corridors and stairways.
Of several hundred people who took refuge inside the Trade Union building, 42 died. The rest were evacuated. Dozens survived in rooms untouched by fire or smoke, while one group sheltered on the roof.
While many pro-Ukraine activists helped the rescue effort, others punched, kicked and beat those who fled the burning building. There was blood and water all over the courtyard, said Elena, who escaped via a firemans ladder. They were shouting on your knees, on your knees.
Throughout the fire, hundreds of local riot police were drawn up outside the building, but they mostly did not intervene.

The 2 May Group has proposed one theory for the development of events. Citing multiple sources, they argue there was an unofficial deal between the police and activists on both sides. As part of the deal, football fans were to be allowed to burn tents erected by pro-Russia activists near the Trade Union building.
Police, local officials and pro-Ukraine activists thought the destruction of the encampment would improve the security situation in Odessa, while pro-Russia activists, increasingly marginalised, counted on it raising their profile.
Such a deal would be in keeping with the Black Sea citys history of trade and colourful local mafia structures, said Gerasimova of the 2 May Group. There was an attempt to resolve the confrontation through the famous Odessa bargain, she said.
Pro-Russia activists point out that one obvious outcome of events has been the complete dismemberment of Odessas pro-Russia political movement.
Dolzhenkov, who is alleged to have led the attack in the city centre, is on trial with 19 associates on a charge of causing mass unrest. Other leaders have fled to Transdnistria or Russia. Several are living in Crimea, seized by Russia last year and just 300 miles from Odessa. An estimated 1,000 people from Odessa have joined separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine.
Odessa, on Ukraines Black Sea coast, is close to pro-Russian enclaves in Moldova and Crimea.
With the 2 May anniversary just days away, 12 people linked to pro-Russia groups were arrested in an anti-terrorist operation on Wednesday, according to security services. Those detained reportedly included the mother of pro-Russia leaders Artyom and Anton Davidchenko, who fled Ukraine last year, as well as a local pro-Russia journalist.
None of the pro-Ukraine activists have been put on trial for the events that led to the deaths in the Trade Unions building. The slow progress and incompetence of the official investigation was probably attributable to a general feeling of guilt as well as a desire to shield influential figures in Kiev, according to journalist Konstantinov.
He said witnesses have been questioned using standardised forms and that he had to press investigators to accept unique photo and video material collected by the news website where he works. The courts are under colossal pressure from both sides, he said.
All the 48 dead were from Odessa or the surrounding region, and it is an unavoidable fact that the violence on 2 May was perpetrated by Odessans against Odessans. Activists from both sides admit that the port city remains divided into two approximately matched camps  those who favour closer ties with Russia, and those loyal to the government in Kiev.
The threat of a pro-Russia coup in Odessa has receded since summer 2014, but tensions in the city remain high with a series of bomb blasts in the city centre targeting pro-Ukrainian organisations, and waves of arrests by the security services of radicals allegedly seeking closer ties with Moscow.
The bestiality accumulated over years, said journalist Konstantinov. Most participants were Odessans who just hated each other.

        <title>Tesla's new low-cost battery: 'the missing piece' in sustainable energy?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/01/tesla-battey-elon-musk-energy</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
Will the world become battery-powered? Thats certainly the ambition of Elon Musk , the PayPal billionaire turned would-be space explorer and electric car baron.
On Thursday night, Musk unveiled what he called the missing piece in sustainable energy: a range of batteries that can be used in homes and businesses to store power from wind or solar or take advantage of cheap electricity to charge up overnight and then be used in peak hours.
Related: Tesla announces low-cost batteries for homes
Two billion Powerpacks  as the batteries are called  could store enough electricity to meet the entire worlds needs.
That may seem like an insane number, Musk said. Were talking about trying to change the fundamental energy infrastructure of the world.
The first place to feel the battery charge will be Nevada. Next year, Musks Tesla Motors is set to start operating a power-storage-device gigafactory across nearly a thousand acres of Nevada real estate. Its required to contribute $3.5bn to the local economy, in return for a $1.25bn tax break.
Battery expert Davide Andrea, an engineer at Colorado-based battery manufacturer Elithion , worries about costs. The most basic home unit will cost $3,500. No details have yet emerged about the cost of the large units Tesla is reportedly supplying to companies including Apple and Google to help manage their power supplies.
Electricity is way too cheap to store in an expensive battery, Andrea said. Its like saying Im going to be storing my potatoes in a safe. Potatoes are too cheap to store in a safe.
But Andrea is sold on the idea that batteries are part of a more efficient energy future. He is currently involved in a new project in Boulder to install batteries in homes, in order to ease the strain on power plants and avoid costly rewiring as the sizes of neighborhoods change.
Felix Kramer, a clean energy entrepreneur in California, said he hopes Musks presentation on Thursday evening changes minds.
Tesla demolished the idea that EVs [electric vehicles] were golf carts, Kramer said. And maybe theyre about to do it again now. Maybe theyre about to demolish the idea that we cant switch from coal and gas to wind and solar because of reliability issues. If they convince consumers, that changes the conversation.
But Andrea and Kramer are enthusiastic about the possibility of greater infrastructure improvements with greater adoption of electric cars. Power provision could get a lot more efficient if cities can be persuaded to draw power from those car batteries, as well as supplying it. That would provide electricity and diminish local reliance on expensive, fossil fuel-powered generators during times of peak demand  when everyone in New York turns on the air conditioner, for example. Nissan is already trying to do this with the Leaf in Japan.
In a home, the cost of the storage becomes much more important, Andrea said. It solves so many problems  the power company no longer has to turn on a dirty power plant during high-demand times. You can use the present wire infrastructure.
If those sound like lofty goals, they had frankly better be: Musk will have to impress a great many people in order to justify the gobs of money the state of Nevada is giving him  the gigafactory will be allowed to operate essentially tax-free for 10 years and wont pay property taxes for another 10 afterward. Beyond even that, the state is giving Tesla $75m in transferable tax credits, which the company can sell to other businesses in the region.
Nor is it the first time Musk has asked the government to chip in: SpaceX receives $685m in help from Nasa .
Still, if Musks batteries can merge wind, solar and electric car power into existing grids, that would constitute tremendous economic savings for cash-strapped municipalities everywhere.
This is within the power of humanity to do, Musk told the large crowd gathered at Teslas design center in a Los Angeles suburb on Thursday. We have done things like this before. It is not impossible.

Hundreds of students from a Burundi university closed by the government have been seeking refuge outside the US embassy in the capital, amid escalating tensions before a presidential vote on 26 June.
The east African state has been rocked by days of protests , triggered by President Pierre Nkurunzizas decision to seek a third term, a move opponents say violates the constitution and a peace deal that ended an ethnically charged civil war in 2005.
Citing security fears, on Wednesday the government closed the University of Burundi, a prestigious institution where Nkurunziza taught physical education in the mid-90s. Students said they left halls on Thursday but feared making the journey home in case they were targeted by the government.
We are here for security because we have been chased from the campuses, said Donation, a student who did not wish to give his surname. Hundreds of others were by the embassy perimeter wall.
Next door, at a construction site, students queued for handouts of soup, bread and oranges. Several said they opposed Nkurunziza seeking a third term. They said Dawn Liberi, US ambassador to Burundi, visited them and said she had raised their plight with the authorities but did not promise them asylum, as some of them wanted. The embassy had no immediate comment.
Tom Malinowski, US assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, told Nkurunziza on Thursday that Burundi risks boiling over, especially if political space was closed for opponents.
We have urged the government not to let the situation get past a point of no return, because if that happens the gains of the last decade really will be at risk, Malinowski said, adding there would be consequences if violence continued.
Bujumburas suburbs, scene of five consecutive days of protests, were calmer on Friday, a Labour Day holiday.
The crisis is being closely watched in a region still scarred by the 1994 genocide that killed more than 800,000 people in neighbouring Rwanda, which, like Burundi, is divided between ethnic Tutsis and Hutus.
Burundis electoral commission started accepting applications to stand for president on Friday, but it was not immediately clear if any opposition figures have submitted bids. They have until 9 May to do so.
Diplomats say the opposition leader, Agathon Rwasa, who, like Nkurunziza, is a former Hutu rebel commander turned politician, stands the best chance of challenging the president.
Rwasa has trodden a cautious path during the protests that erupted on Monday, criticising the governments heavy-handed tactics and defending peoples right to rally, but refraining from calling for mass protests.
Analysts say Rwasa does not wish to give the government  which describes the protests as an illegal insurrection  justification to detain him and exclude him from running for presidency.
The constitution and the Arusha peace accord limit the president to two terms in office, but Nkurunzizas supporters say he can run again because his first term, when he was picked by legislators and not elected, does not count.

The United Nations is guilty of reckless disregard for serious allegations of wrongdoing in its treatment of a whistleblower who disclosed details of alleged child abuse by French peacekeepers in Africa, according to a former staff member.
James Wasserstrom, a veteran US diplomat who was sacked and arrested by UN police when he exposed suspicions of corruption by senior officials in Kosovo, said the case of Anders Kompass revealed how the organisation turned on the whistleblower rather than dealing with the wrongdoing he had revealed.

Kompass, director of field operations at the office of the high commissioner for human rights in Geneva, has been suspended for passing to prosecutors in Paris an unredacted internal UN report detailing allegations of the sexual exploitation of boys in the Central African Republic by French peacekeepers.
When the Guardian revealed details of the allegations this week, the French authorities admitted publicly for the first time that they had begun an investigation after receiving the report last July. It details accounts from children as young as eight and nine of serious sexual abuse at a centre for internally displaced people in the capital Bangui.
At the time, the French troops stationed there were part of their countrys peacekeeping mission run independently of the new UN operation Minusca. The UN had commissioned the report following claims on the grounds of sexual misconduct. It was completed in June last year but not passed on until Kompass leaked it directly to the French.
On Thursday, the French president, Franois Hollande, vowed to pursue the allegations vigorously . If some soldiers have behaved badly, I will show no mercy, he said. French judicial authorities said more than a dozen soldiers were under investigation.
Wasserstrom won a landmark case against the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, that was later overturned by the organisations appeals tribunal. He said the Kompass case seemed to offer further evidence of the organisations reckless disregard for very serious allegations of wrongdoing in order to go after the whistleblower.
He said: Over and over and over again, the UN goes into denial, into dismissal and into coverup, and then tries to retaliate against the whistleblower.

The fact that the French authorities have decided to take these allegations seriously underlines this.
Wasserstrom was one of nine signatories to a letter from former whistleblowers to the UN secretary general published earlier this month.
While working for the UN mission in Kosovo in 2009, he was sacked and detained by UN police after revealing suspicions about corruption within senior ranks of the UN mission.
The UN dispute tribunal  a body set up in 2009 to improve the system of internal justice  condemned the organisation for an unauthorised and unwarranted investigation into Wasserstrom, ruled that the its ethics office had failed to protect him and that its mechanism for dealing with whistleblowers was fundamentally flawed. But the findings were overturned when the secretary general applied to the appeals tribunal.
Without proper whistleblower protection, wrongdoing at the United Nations, be it sexual exploitation, abuse of power, fraud or corruption, will not be reported and will continue to go unchecked. There will be no accountability. This can only damage the UNs moral standing and ultimately its legitimacy, the letter said.
This week, the UN in New York stood by its actions. In a statement, it said the leak of internal documents did not constitute whistleblowing but was a a serious breach of protocol.

Any issue of sex abuse is a serious issue, the statement said. At the same time, there are concerns we have about the protection of witnesses and victims.
Kompass, a Swedish citizen, faces dismissal after more than 30 years working in the humanitarian field. His government said on Thursday it was worrisome if Kompass had been suspended for sharing information about sexual abuse of children on an international mission.
Anders Ronquist, legal chief of Swedens foreign ministry, said: The UN must have zero tolerance toward sexual abuse of children and ensure that suspicions of such abuse are investigated.
The treatment of Kompass was carried out with the knowledge of the high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, according to communications seen by the Guardian. He was the author of the Zeid report on preventing sexual exploitation by peacekeepers commissioned a decade ago after a scandal involving UN troops in Congo.
In France , the claims against more than a dozen soldiers who were part of the peacekeeping mission in CAR continue to cause shockwaves.
The report contains interviews with six children who disclose sexual abuse predominantly at the hands of French peacekeepers. Some children indicated that several of their friends were also being sexually exploited.
The interviews were carried out by an official from the OHCHR justice section and a member of Unicef between May and June last year. The children, who are aged between eight/nine and 15, disclosed abuse dating back to December 2013. Entitled Sexual abuse on children by international armed forces, it is stamped confidential on every page.
The allegations include claims that Chadian soldiers, who are part of the peacekeeping mission, were also involved in abuse.
The children all talk of being abused in return for food rations handed out by the soldiers. One interview details how two nine-year-old children were sexually exploited together by two French soldiers.
One of the children tells the interviewers: One was short and smoking a lot, the other was thin and not smoking. They asked us what we wanted. We answered that we were hungry. The short man told us to first put his bangala [penis] out of his pants.
The bangala of the thin one was for my friend, the child said. Their bangala were straight in front of us, at the level of our mouths.
The child goes on to describe how he and his friend were told to carry out a sex act on both soldiers before being given three packs of military food rations and some money.
Another nine-year-old child described how he went to ask for food from the French military at the IDP camp at MPoko airport.
He says the soldier told him to carry out a sex act on him first. The report states: He [the child] had friends who had done it already, he knew what he had to do. Once done, the military gave a military food portion and some food. X said the military had forbidden him to tell anything about him to anybody and that if he would do so he would beat him.
A French judicial source revealed that a number of French soldiers accused of the abuse had been identified from the descriptions provided by the children.
In Bangui on Thursday, the mother of one child told Associated Press her son was just nine when he was assaulted by French soldiers. Her family had fled to the airport on the first day of the sectarian clashes in December 2013 and she and her son are still living there.
The children were vulnerable because they were hungry and their parents had nothing to give them, so the children were forced to ask the soldiers for food, she said.
They took advantage of the children forcing them to perform oral sex and also sodomising them, she said. The moaning of children in the area often started around 10 pm or 11 pm.
Another resident said other abused children ranged in age from 10-13.
In exchange for cookies, the soldiers demanded oral sex, she said, recounting what the children told her. Afterwards, they were given bottles of water. They even sodomised the children.
Figures obtained by the Government Accountability Project (GAP), which supports whistleblowers, reveal that the UN ethics office had received 447 approaches until July 2014 from those alleging they have faced retaliation for exposing wrongdoing.
They completed reviews into between 113 and 135 of these cases, identifying prima facie cases of retaliation in 14, and ultimately establishing there had been retaliation in just four cases.

        <title>Bali Nine: Indonesian ambassador offers sympathy to families of executed men</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/01/indonesian-ambassador-offers-sympathy-families-executed-men</Link>

The Indonesian ambassador to Australia has expressed sympathy to the family and friends of two Australians executed in the country this week for drug offences, signalling Jakartas willingness to rebuild this important bilateral relation.
Nadjib Riphat Kesoema said he understood the views expressed by Australians and the federal government on the law-enforcement measures taken against the two Bali Nine drug-smuggling ring leaders.
It was also reported on Friday that the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo , had been offered political cover by a rival if he postpone[d] the executions indefinitely.
Prabowo Subianto, who was defeated by Widodo in a presidential election last July but remains influential, wrote to the president at the weekend saying he would publicly offer his support if the executions were indefinitely delayed, the West Australian reported .
Widodo, languishing in polls and said to be under pressure from his political patron, former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, ignored the offer.
The pair, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed along with six others in the early hours of Wednesday , drawing international condemnation. Australia has responded by recalling its ambassador to the country.
Kesoema said the executions had made relations difficult, but links between the two countries remained strong.
The Indonesian people and government express our sympathies to the families and friends of the deceased, Kesoema said. This is a difficult and challenging period for Australia-Indonesia relations.
It was the first sign of rapprochement after the killings, which Tony Abbott said had triggered a dark moment in relations between the countries.
Kesoema said the Indonesian government remained strongly committed to improve and strengthen our overall bilateral relations.
We trust that currently personal, cultural, business and academic links between the peoples of Australia and Indonesia remain strong, he said.
Christopher Pyne said on Friday he noted the gesture and agreed that rebuilding relations was important.
The federal education minister said the decision to recall Australias ambassador to Indonesia was one of the strongest actions the government could take following the killing of the two Australians on Wednesday morning.
The Indonesian ambassador is talking soothingly today about the need to make sure our bilateral relationship is a strong one and gets back on an even keel, Pyne told the Nine Network.
Obviously, the whole country is in shock ... but there is a wider issue, the wider issue is a strong bilateral relationship.
Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said the statement was a sign that decent people in Indonesia appreciate the anger that Australians feel at these cruel and unnecessary deaths.
Its a sign that the good and strong relationship with Indonesia can be resumed, he sad.
This is a difficult moment in the relationship between Australia and Indonesia, but I am confident that decent people in both countries will now pause, take stock and do whatevers necessary to restore the relationship.
Julie Bishop, the Australian foreign minister, said she had not had the chance to speak to the ambassador but said he was one of a number of Indonesians who regretted the circumstances that have taken place.
Its time for us to seek to move on, she said. We will need to build relations at the government level, the people-to-people level and I think that we need to look at the long-term future of the relationship.
What happened this week is to be regretted, deeply regretted. I spoke to the family members last night and they are devastated and one cant help but feel so deeply for what they are going through, but we must focus on the long-term relationship with Indonesia, she said.
Along with the two Australians, four Nigerians, a Brazilian and an Indonesian were also executed by firing squad on Wednesday. The bodies of Chan and Sukumaran were expected to arrive in Australia within 48 hours.
Reports in Indonesia on Friday said an appeal for the Indonesian man, Zainal Abidin, had languished in the system for 10 years before being hurriedly sent to the countrys highest court just weeks before he was killed.
Abidin had a legal challenge to his death sentence rejected two days before the executions. The Jakarta Globe reported that the appeal, called a PK, had been filed 10 years ago, but was not forwarded to Indonesias highest court for review until 8 April, when it was apparent Abidin would soon be killed.
The Supreme Courts assistant clerk for special crimes did not receive the PK until April 8, 2015, chief clerk Soeroso Ono said in the statement on the Indonesian supreme courts website.
That means that from May 2, 2005, until April 2015, the case was not in the hands of the Supreme Court clerk. The Supreme Court had less than a week in which to hear the review, from April 21, 2015, when it reached the judges, to April 27, 2015, when the ruling was handed down.
Soeroso said the delay was worrying and urged courts to adhere to judicial procedures.

An Irish priest has been jailed for hiring men who said they were IRA paramilitaries to issue death threats and intimidate his nephew into dropping legal action against him.
Former hospital chaplain Father Francis Kelleher, 59, pleaded guilty to four counts of coercion at the circuit court in Cork in southern Ireland and is facing action by the local Catholic diocese.
The court heard that Kelleher paid three men who said they were from the Continuity IRA, a breakaway faction of the Irish Republican Army, to threaten his nephew, Niall Kelleher, in 2012 and 2013.
Niall Kelleher had been planning to take a civil case against his uncle and sent the priest a solicitors letter before the threats began.
Shortly afterwards the father of three received a number of intimidating visits and phone calls from the men.
Telling him they were from the Continuity IRA, the three men demanded he drop his case against his uncle and threatened that if he did not, he would not see the following week.
Sources close to the hardline paramilitary movement denied their members had helped the priest, saying those involved in Cork were connected to a criminal gang and a blight on the name of republicanism.
According to dissident republican sources, the men belong to a breakaway faction of CIRA based in southern Ireland who were expelled from the organisation several years. They have no links to CIRAs political wing, Republican Sinn Fin (RSF).
Irish police arrested Francis Kelleher in November 2013 and the priest admitted that he had paid 4,000 to have his nephew threatened.
In sentencing Kelleher to four years jail, judge Sen  Donnabhain described what happened as appalling behaviour and said it was a profoundly upsetting case.
In a statement after the verdict, the bishop of Cork and Ross, John Buckley, said the diocese would initiate canonical proceedings against Kelleher, who has been suspended from performing religious duties.
It is deeply regrettable that such an offence could have been committed by anyone, and particularly by a priest, Buckley said.
I sincerely sympathise with those whose lives were endangered or who may have been harmed in any way by these events.
CIRA was the first armed faction to be formed in opposition to the peace process. Its membership split away from the mainstream Provisional IRA at the end of the 1980s. The group is regarded as the most ideologically rigid and hardline of all the three main dissident republican factions still waging armed struggle against the Northern Ireland state. In March 2009 a CIRA sniper shot dead Constable Stephen Carroll in County Armagh  the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer killed by paramilitaries.

Thick clouds boiled out of 6,500-foot (2,000-meter) cone, bringing the threat of new, heavy ash fall over villagers struggling to clean up from two huge blasts last week.
The area was evacuated after the volcano first erupted last Wednesday afternoon, but many people had begun to return to their ash-drowned homes.
The eruptions at Calbuco are the first in more than four decades . About 4,500 people have been evacuated since the volcano roared back to life on 22 April, sending ash about 11 miles (18km) into the sky.

The ash spread across the southern part of the continent, disrupting flights in Argentinas capital, Buenos Aires.
This latest eruption is much smaller than the other two, deputy interior minister Mahmud Aleuy said in a press conference, adding that while the situation is not dangerous so far, some 2,500 people will be evacuated.
Were talking about a plume that is about 4km and that is directed toward the southern part of the volcano, so we shouldnt have major problems except for those who live in the south of the volcano and who will be hit by ash.

The director of the National Mining and Geology service said that new eruptions greater than those last week are not expected. But he warned that rains could lead to devastating volcanic mud, known as lahars, which are capable of leveling anything in their path once in motion.
Lahars are possible if we get heavy rains, so its still a concern, said Rodrigo Alvarez, the head of the service. This eruption should begin to lessen in the coming hours and well have new forecasts. For now we remain on high alert.
Residents are bracing for rain forecast to fall on Friday.

Coverup claims over revelation that Germany spied on EU partners for US
Embarrassment for Berlin after reports about inquiry into NSA surveillance say German spies monitored French presidents office and EU institutions

Germany has been spying and eavesdropping on its closest partners in the EU and passing the information to the US for more than a decade, a parliamentary inquiry in Berlin has found, triggering allegations of lying and coverups reaching to the very top of Angela Merkels administration.
There was outrage in Germany two years ago over the revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden of US and British surveillance activities in Europe. The fresh disclosures are embarrassing for Berlin, which stands accused of hypocrisy in its protests about the US spying on its allies.
You dont spy on your friends, said the chancellor when it was made known to her that her mobile phone was being monitored by the US National Security Agency (NSA). Since then, both sides have been embroiled in arguments about data privacy, with much talk among officials and diplomats of a collapse of German trust in the Americans.
But according to reports on a confidential Bundestag committee of inquiry into the NSA scandal, under a 2002 pact between German intelligence (BND) and the NSA , Berlin used its largest electronic eavesdropping facility in Bavaria to monitor email and telephone traffic at the lyse Palace, the offices of the French president, and of key EU institutions in Brussels including the European commission.
Thomas de Maizire, the interior minister and a Merkel confidant, is in the firing line for allegedly lying about or covering up the German collaboration with the Americans. The minister has denied the allegations robustly and promised to answer before the parliamentary inquiry the sooner the better.
The best-selling tabloid Bild depicted de Maiziere as Pinocchio this week and accused him of lying with impunity. From 2005-9 he served as Merkels chief of staff, the post in Berlin that exercises authority over the BND. He is said to have been told of the spying activities in 2008.
German media reports are asserting that if De Maizire knew what was going on he has covered it up, and that if he did not know he was failing in his job while the BND ranged out of political control.
According to the newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and the public broadcasters WDR and NDR, citing information from the closed parliamentary inquiry, the BNDs biggest listening post at Bad Aibling in Bavaria was abused for years for NSA spying on European states.
The core is the political spying on our European neighbours and EU institutions, an unnamed source said to be familiar with the evidence told the Sddeutsche.
As well as the political intelligence activities, the NSA also got the BND to spy on European aerospace and defence firms, the reports allege. German and American individuals and companies were not monitored under the terms of the espionage pact.
The Bad Aibling complex of listening posts was an NSA facility for years. Under an agreement in 2002, it was handed over to the Germans in 2004, since when much of the information gleaned was routinely passed to the Americans.
According to the Sddeutsche, the Americans supplied search terms on a weekly basis to the Germans  totalling 690,000 phone numbers and 7.8m IP addresses up until 2013.

'Am I being executed?' Brazilian killed by Indonesia unaware until end, says priest

A Brazilian man executed by firing squad along with seven other prisoners in Indonesia on Wednesday had no idea he was about to be killed until his final minutes, the priest who counselled him has said.
He also revealed that Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipino woman who won a dramatic reprieve, had been aware a new suspect in her case had surrendered to police but was only removed from the prison about an hour before the killings.
Rodrigo Gularte, 42, was shot dead alongside seven others, including four Nigerians, two Australians and an Indonesian, for smuggling cocaine into Indonesia in 2004.

Doctors had diagnosed the Brazilian with paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A second diagnosis, commissioned by Indonesias attorney general, has not been made public.
Father Charlie Burrows, a priest who ministers to prisoners in Cilacap, said he had tried in vain to explain to Gularte for three days that he was about to be killed.
He was hearing voices all the time, Burrows told Irish radio. I talked to him for about an hour and a half, trying to prepare him for the execution. I said to him, Im 72 years old, Ill be heading to heaven in the near future, so you find out where my house is and prepare a garden for me.
But when they took [the prisoners] out of the cells  and when they put these bloody chains on them, he said to me, Am I being executed?  Burrows said.
I said, Yes, I thought I explained that to you. He didnt get excited  hes a quiet sort of a guy  but he said, This is not right.
Hes lost because hes a schizophrenic. He asked if there was a sniper outside ready to shoot him, and I said no, and whether somebody would shoot him in the car, and I said no, Burrows said.
After Gularte was strapped to a wooden plank, Burrows was permitted to see him again: He said, This is not right, I made one small mistake, and I shouldnt have to die for it. So he was annoyed more than anything else, because hes a soft-spoken, quiet and sensitive man.
Burrows told Guardian Australia that guards on Nusa Kambangan, the prison island where Indonesia executes convicts, had broken down crying when 30-year-old Mary Jane Veloso said goodbye to her two children for what was thought to be the final time.
He said Veloso had shown a false sense of joy during her final visit with her family and sons, aged 12 and six, but broke down at 2pm on Tuesday when told it was time to say goodbye. She begged for more time, Will I not get longer with my children? Theyll never see me again, Ill never see them again, Burrows said.
The whole place broke down in tears. The warden and attorneys felt real bad about it. They said to me they didnt agree with the thing, they just had to do their job, that there should be a moratorium.

He said some of the guards had asked him: Are we responsible for the suffering of this poor woman and the families?
Veloso, sentenced to death after arriving in Yogyakarta in 2010 with 2.6kg of heroin in her suitcase, has claimed she was set up by a human trafficker. She was granted a reprieve late on Tuesday after the suspected trafficker surrendered to Philippine police. Veloso was told of the development on Tuesday afternoon, Burrows said, but her fate seemed sealed.
It was between 10pm and 11pm, when the prisoners were locked in their cells for the final time, that she was taken away. We were in the cells, just the time they give to the spiritual companions, and they took her out, Burrows said.
In the last minute she was actually in the cell with the police, there was three police, and they took her out back to Yogyakarta.
Just after 11pm the prisoners were taken individually from the cells and driven to the execution site. They would not have been aware Veloso had been spared until they assembled at the firing range, he said.
He said the two Australians, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, led hymns among the prisoners as they waited to be killed, joined by their spiritual advisers 30 metres away. They were all trying to be strong because it was uppermost in their minds that they had made a mistake and that mistake has had a devastating effect on their families, he said.
Nigerians Raheem Agbaje Salami (also known as Jamiu Owolabi Abashin), Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Martin Anderson and Okwuduli Oyatanze were also executed on Wednesday morning , along with an Indonesian, Zainal Abidin.
The Indonesian attorney general, HM Prasetyo, said on Wednesday the eight men, all drug offenders, had been executed simultaneously at 12.35am local time. They were declared dead three minutes later.
The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last, he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more humanely this time.
Out of the eight executed, four, according to their last requests, are to be buried in their home countries, Prasetyo said. Two in Australia, one in Brazil, and one in Nigeria .
Abidin, the only Indonesian among the eight, was buried in Cilacap, near Nusa Kambangan, on Wednesday morning. Salami was to be buried in Madiun, East Java, and Anderson in Bekasi, West Java, he said.
The bodies of Chan and Sukumarun were expected to arrive back in Australia for burial on Friday.

Jozef Paczynski, a Polish political prisoner at Auschwitz who became the personal barber to camp commander Rudolf Hss, has died. He was 95.
For much of the second world war, Paczynski was led to Hsss home and ordered to cut the hair of one of the worst mass murderers in history.
For decades afterwards he was repeatedly asked why he did not use his tools to slit the throat of the man responsible for more than a million deaths at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the most notorious of the Nazi death camps.
His answer: it would not have stopped the killing, but would have meant certain death for himself and many others. I thought about it, Paczynski said in a speech in January in Krakow. But when I realised what the consequences would be I simply could not do it.
Paczynski died on Sunday in Krakow, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum announced on Thursday. Officials did not say what the cause of death was.
Paczynski was imprisoned at Auschwitz in June 1940 as punishment for trying to flee German-occupied Poland to join the Polish army in France. He was arrested after crossing into Slovakia and was taken in the first transport to Auschwitz, becoming prisoner number 121.
At the camp he was assigned to work in a barber shop where the SS men got their haircuts. One day Hss turned up and singled out Paczynski from other barbers to come to his family home at the edge of the camp to trim his hair.

Paczynski recalled in a lecture in Krakow this year that he was terrified when he was brought to cut Hsss hair.
My voice was shaking, my hands were shaking and my legs were shaking, he said. Yet Hss was apparently satisfied and asked Paczynski to return again and again, although he never said a word to him.
Paczynski, who remained at Auschwitz until 18 January 1945, was one of the prisoners who survived there the longest. He was among a group that the Nazis moved out just days before the Soviet army liberated the camp and was later freed by US soldiers in Germany .
Paczynski said he never witnessed any brutality by Hss, who developed and oversaw the implementation of gas chambers where more than a million Jews and others were murdered.
Hss was tried by Polish authorities after the war and was sentenced to death by hanging in 1947. The punishment was carried out at Auschwitz next to a crematorium.
After the war, Paczynski became a mechanical engineer and a teacher. In 2001 he was honoured with the Commanders Cross of the Order of the Rebirth of Poland.

North Koreas leader, Kim Jong-un, will not travel to Moscow for the celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war, a spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has revealed.
Although information about the planned visit on 9 May was scarce, Russian officials had expected Kim to attend the military parade and were also planning a bilateral meeting with Putin. It would have been his first foreign trip since he took power following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011.
Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Thursday: He has decided to stay in Pyongyang. This decision is related to internal Korean affairs.
Peskov said the information had come via diplomatic channels.
There has been very little information about the logistics or arrangements of the potential visit. Calls to the North Korean embassy in Moscow went unanswered, and Pyongyang made no public statement regarding it.

At Koryo, a North Korean restaurant in Moscow not far from the countrys embassy, the television was playing a Kim Jong-un speech on Wednesday evening, but staff said they were not aware of plans for the leader to come to Moscow.
One waitress, who moved to Russia from Pyongyang two years ago, said: I dont know anything about that.
Some analysts have suggested that the 9 May celebrations would be a strange time for Kim to make his first foreign trip. The North Korean leaders public events inside the country are carefully choreographed, and by attending a major public event involving many other world leaders in Moscow, he would have much less control than during a bilateral visit. Peskov did not say whether a visit would be planned for another occasion.
Russia and North Korea have warm relations dating back to the Soviet period. Kim Jong-il made occasional visits to the country, travelling by armoured train as he was scared of flying. Putin sent Kim Jong-il lavish birthday gifts including, on one occasion, a plane full of horses.

Kim Jong-un has been pictured inside a private jet, but he has not made any foreign trips since he took over, and has not received any major leaders in Pyongyang, instead meeting with the former basketball player Dennis Rodman .
On Wednesday, South Koreas intelligence agency claimed 15 senior officials have been executed in North Korea since the beginning of the year.
A bilateral year of friendship has been declared for 2015 between Russia and North Korea, and several North Korean ministers visited Moscow earlier this month to officially declare the beginning of the friendship year in a ceremony that was closed to media.
Russia has been seeking to boost relations with non-western countries after coming under EU and US sanctions for its actions in Ukraine. The leaders of China, India and Brazil are expected at the parade on 9 May, but there will be few western leaders, most of whom are boycotting the event .
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will miss the parade but instead travel to Moscow a day later to lay a wreath at a war memorial. The UK Foreign Office says it is still deciding whether British officials or politicians will travel from London to attend the ceremony, which comes just two days after the general election.

40 years since Saigon's fall, napalm attack haunts woman in iconic image

On 8 June 1972, Ho Thi Hien was at her cousin Kim Phucs house in the village of Trang Bang in South Vietnam . The adults were out when the children heard the plane overhead and fled, trying to outrun their terror. A South Vietnamese Skyraider had just dropped a napalm bomb, propelling civilians down Vietnams Highway 1.
One of them was nine-year-old Phuc who, in a moment captured by photographer Nick Ut, was shown screaming as she ran naked down the road, having stripped off her clothes to rid herself of the poison on her skin. From that moment on she was known as the napalm girl. Ho, then 10 years old, ran alongside her cousin. Clothed but barefoot, she was captured on the right-hand side of Uts photograph.

The image, for which Ut won a Pulitzer prize, was widely credited with turning the tide of public opinion against the war. Decades later, it lives on as one of the most iconic images of the century. Although her face displays no obvious sign of trauma, so do Hos nightmares. Every time I hear a plane I get scared, she says.
As she has for thousands of days before, Ho sits patiently in the relentless Trang Bang heat on Thursday, occupying one of the weathered plastic chairs in her dusty roadside cafe, footsteps away from where her pain was immortalised. A framed print of the photograph hangs from a post.
But the day is not completely unremarkable: it is the eve of the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, and Ut, as he does every time he returns to Vietnam, has come to visit. Theyre like family, he says.
Forty years ago, on 30 April 1975, North Vietnamese tanks rolled into the former Saigon, seizing the South Vietnamese capital and capping a humiliating defeat for the US after a misguided decade of war. In chaos, Americans scrambled, abandoning the city. The conflict killed over 3 million North Vietnamese, 250,000 South Vietnamese and over 58,000 Americans.
Early on Thursday morning, in a move aimed at beating the tropical midday heat, Vietnam held a massive Liberation Day parade. It celebrated with thousands of goose-stepping soldiers, costumed performers, and card-flipping mosaics for its own dignitaries and representatives of other communist nations. The streets of downtown Ho Chi Minh City around the Reunification Palace have been blocked for days. Civilians watched from home.
Forty years of liberation may have unshackled this country from the US military, but not necessarily American-style capitalism. A conflicted legacy looms over the city. Red banners declare: Long Live the Glorious Party of Vietnam.
The US normalised relations in 1995. Now flags emblazoned with the hammer and sickle punctuate avenues that boast Prada, Chanel, Kia, Lotte, Honda and Starbucks storefronts and adverts, revealing the welcome extended to investment by former enemies America, South Korea and Japan despite anti-American remarks during the ceremony.

After centuries of war, the Vietnamese psyche looks forward. Half of the countrys population of 90 million was born after the American war and an estimated 16,000 Vietnamese currently study in the US. The US is one of the biggest investors in Vietnam. South Korea, enlisted by the Americans to fight for the South Vietnamese, is also a major investor, and Korean culture in the form of K-pop music and soap operas is as welcome as its cash.
While Vietnam has changed hands and governments, Ho, now 56, continues to live and work steps away from the napalm attack that altered the course of her life and of her country.

Her cousin Phuc lives in Toronto, has written a book and raised a family. Phucs brother  Phan Thanh Tam, the boy on the left side of the photo  lost an eye in the attack. He died of cancer a few years ago and his widow operates a cafe next door to Hos on the first floor of the Phuc family house. Phucs home is modernised, funded by donations from around the world. Money from Swedish benefactors provided refrigerators, furniture and a television.
On Thursday, Ut photographed the military splendour of a liberated Vietnam for the Associated Press, the news agency for which he continues to work. The pictures are good, he says, but none will ever compare to the napalm photograph. It lives on for Phuc, for Ho, and his own family.

As a teenager in 1966, Ut followed in the footsteps of his older brother, Vietnamese actor-turned-AP photojournalist Huynh Thanh My, who was killed by the Viet Cong.
My brother, very good photographer, Ut says, stepping away from where he shot his most famous photo. I really love him. Every time he came back from assignments and showed the pictures, people die, the war. He showed his wife, he showed me. He was very angry. He said one day he was going to take a picture that would stop the war. But he never did. When he died, I heard his words in my ear. When I took the picture of Kim Phuc, I told my brother: I have it for you.

The French-based aviation giant Airbus has challenged the German government over allegations that Berlins foreign intelligence agency engaged in industrial espionage against the company on behalf of the Americans.
The Airbus threat of legal action on Thursday came amid reports that Germany has been spying and eavesdropping on its closest partners in the European Union and passing the information to the Americans for more than a decade.
A closed parliamentary inquiry in Berlin has heard evidence of how the BND, Germanys foreign intelligence agency, used its biggest eavesdropping complex in Bavaria to monitor communications at the Elyse Palace, the office of the French president, the French foreign ministry, and the European Commission in Brussels and then passed on the information to the Americans, according to German media reports. The disclosures triggered allegations of lying and cover-ups reaching to the very top of Chancellor Angela Merkels administration.
The snooping was also said to extend to big defence and aviation companies in Europe , including Airbus, but none of them were German or American under the terms of the alleged spy pact between the BND and the American National Security Agency (NSA) going back to 2002.
There is a concrete suspicion of industrial espionage, Airbus said in a statement. We are alarmed  We have asked the German government for information.
It added: We will now file a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industrial espionage.
Amid persistent frictions between the US and German governments because of the Edward Snowden revelations two years ago of US and British surveillance activities in Europe, the fresh disclosures are embarrassing for Berlin which stands accused of hypocrisy in its protests about America spying on its allies.
Spying on friends is not on at all, Merkel responded when it became known her mobile was being monitored by the NSA. Since then, both sides have been embroiled in arguments about data privacy, with much talk among officials and diplomats of a collapse of German trust in the Americans.
But under a 2002 pact between the BND and the NSA, Berlin used its largest electronic eavesdropping facility at Bad Aibling in Bavaria to monitor email and telephone traffic at the Elyse Palace and of key EU institutions in Brussels including the European Commission, according to the reports.
Thomas de Maizire, the interior minister and a Merkel confidant, is in the firing line for allegedly lying about or covering up the German collaboration with the Americans. The minister has denied the allegations robustly and promised to answer before the parliamentary inquiry the sooner, the better.
The best-selling tabloid Bild-Zeitung depicted de Maizire as Pinocchio this week and accused him of lying with impunity. From 2005-9, he served as Merkels chief of staff, the post in Berlin that exercises authority over the BND. He is said to have been told of the spying activities in 2008.
The German media are asserting that if de Maizire knew what was going on, he has covered it up, and that if he did not know, he was failing in his job while the BND ranged out of political control.
According to the newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung and the public broadcasters WDR and NDR, citing information from the closed parliamentary inquiry, the BNDs biggest listening post at Bad Aibling in Bavaria was abused for years for NSA spying on European states.
The core is the political spying of our European neighbours and EU institutions, an unnamed source said to be familiar with the evidence told the Sddeutsche.
The Bad Aibling complex of listening posts was an NSA facility for years. Under an agreement in 2002 it was handed over to the Germans in 2004 since when much of the information gleaned was routinely passed to the Americans.
The Americans supplied search terms on a weekly basis to the Germans, according to the Munich newspaper  690,000 phone numbers and 7.8m IP addresses up until 2013.

A shark killed a 65-year-old woman in an attack off the shore of Maui on Wednesday, officials said.
Maui fire department said in a statement that the unresponsive woman was found by snorkelers about 200 yards from shore and was taken to the beach at a popular surfing spot. Paramedics attempted lifesaving efforts but were unsuccessful.
Injuries on the victims torso suggest she was attacked by a shark, fire officials said in the statement.
The Hawaii department of land and natural resources released a statement saying the attack occurred in the Kanahena Cove area of Ahihi-Kinau Natural Area Reserve on Maui.
Kekoa Kaluhiwa, first deputy director of the department of land and natural resources, said at a news conference in Honolulu that the incident is being investigated. He said staff would be posting additional signage along the coast.
Our condolence goes out to the family of the victim, he said.
Crews cleared the water using jet skis, and the department of land and natural resources closed the area to swimmers, divers and other ocean activities. The area will be closed until at least noon on Thursday, when officials will assess the scene and decide if it is safe to reopen.
There are no reported witnesses of the shark attack, which was the first fatal encounter of the year in Hawaii.

Related: Black woman's 'lynching' charge: an unsettling tactic to punish activism?
Prosecutors in Sacramento, California have dropped a controversial charge of lynching that was made against an African American woman who allegedly interfered with the arrest of a fellow activist during a rally against police brutality.
Maile Mae Hampton, a 20-year-old local leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, made headlines with her arrest in January at the state capitol, mostly over the provocative-sounding felony charge.
Californias lynching law was put on the books in 1933, to prevent mobs from forcibly taking people from police custody for vigilante justice. But the statute has long been used against protesters as well and refers to any riotous conduct aimed at freeing a person from police, according to court documents. It carries the possibility of four years in jail.
Sacramentos chief deputy district attorney, Steve Grippi, the second-highest-ranking prosecutor in the local office, appeared in court to present an amended complaint against Hampton, which now only includes a single misdemeanor charge of interference with a peace officer in the performance of his/her duties.
That complaint said the lynching charge was being dropped because the misdemeanor count is equally applicable to the conduct alleged in this action but does not carry with it the racially charged and inflammatory terminology associated with the lynching law.
Surrounded by dozens of supporters outside the courthouse, Hampton said: I am very surprised that Sacramento chose to do the right thing but happily surprised. That could have straight-up ruined my life.
While the remaining charge could carry a penalty of up to a year in county jail, it is more commonly resolved through fines and jail diversion programs and does not have the stigma of a felony, which often must be disclosed on job applications and prevents certain licenses from being granted.
Hamptons pro-bono attorney, Linda Parisi, reiterated her clients not guilty plea to the lesser charge. A court date was set for late May.
Were going to take our victories one step at a time, said Parisi.

A US-organized event on North Korea s human rights briefly turned into chaos at the UN on Thursday as North Korean diplomats insisted on reading a statement, amid shouts from defectors, and then stormed out.
The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, tried to quiet the North Korean diplomats at the event that featured more than 20 defectors.
The North Korean diplomats did not comment as they left the chamber after reading out a statement in protest at the event, even as North Korean defectors stood and shouted in their faces.
Nuclear-armed North Korea has been on the defensive ever since a groundbreaking UN commission of inquiry detailed vast rights abuses there . International pressure behind last years report led the UN security council to place the issue on its agenda of matters of international peace and security.
Defectors stood up and shouted in Korean as Power and others called for calm and a UN security team assembled.
An observer who speaks Korean said the shouts included Shut up! Free North Korea! Down with Kim Jong-un! and Even animals know to wait their turn.
There is no need for a microphone, Power said as one North Korean diplomat persisted in reading out a statement that referred to ungrounded allegations and hostile policy toward his country. A microphone was briefly turned on for the diplomats.
As soon as the next featured defector, Jay Jo, started speaking, the North Korean diplomats stood and walked out.

The brief chaos came minutes after the UN assistant secretary-general for human rights, Ivan imonovi, told the audience that North Korea had shown new signs of engagement on human rights issues in recent months.
But after the uproar, the South Korean ambassador, Oh Joon, told the crowd that we thought there was a glimmer of hope  but the delegation of the DPRK today disappointed us. I think its a pity. He referred to the countrys official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.

Friends of Giovanni Lo Porto, the Italian hostage killed in a US drone strike in January that targeted an al-Qaida compound, are pleading for his remains to be returned to Italy and demanding information about his death.
A demonstration in Lo Portos hometown of Palermo has been planned for Thursday evening. The mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, has called for a formal inquiry into the circumstances of Lo Portos death and said this week that he would write a letter to the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, urging him to find Lo Portos body and return it to his family.
Barack Obama, the US president, admitted last week that Lo Porto and another innocent hostage  an American named Warren Weinstein who was a government aid worker  were accidentally killed in a US counter-terrorism attack that took place in January in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The decision to establish an investigative commission might be one way to restore the central role of parliament and confirm our condemnation of what occurred, as well as showing solidarity to the family, and ascertaining a truth that must be known by the country, Orlando said in a statement.
Friends of Lo Porto  who they knew as Giancarlo  have expressed their demands for the return of his body on a Facebook page that was created for the aid worker in March 2012, when he was kidnapped while working for a German aid group in Pakistan .
Excuses are not good enough, says one message, according to Corriere della Sera, the Italian daily. We cannot allow there to be silence surrounding the tragic death of Giancarlo, and even worse, for his family and friends to be deprived of the right to place a flower on his grave.
Fabrice Calabrese, a friend who met Lo Porto in 2005 when both were living in London, told the Guardian that the event, A Flower for Giovanni, was organised as way to remember a person who was devoted to helping people.
We wont forget him, and we hope that this will help remember him and spread his ideas of peace and tolerance. We are gathering in the street now, but all we want is a proper place and a grave to remember our Giovanni, Calabrese said.
Political reaction in Italy has been muted following news of the drone strikes. Opponents of Renzi initially criticised him for apparently not being informed about the killing until a day before the news was released by the White House, even though he had met Obama in Washington a week earlier. But the initial controversy has since died down as attention in Rome is currently centred on a government reform bill making its way through parliament.
The deaths of Lo Porto and Weinstein marked the first known instance in which a US drone strike has inadvertently killed hostages, forcing the Obama administration to disclose unprecedented amount of information about a classified operation.
The Italian foreign ministry did not return a request for comment. Last week, it said the ultimate blame for Lo Portos death lay with the terrorists who were holding him captive.

Brussels has warned Hungary that a fight is looming unless Budapest distances itself from statements about reintroducing the death penalty , which is outlawed in the EU.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission , told Viktor Orbn, Hungarys rightwing prime minister, on Thursday that he had to immediately renounce statements suggesting that the reintroduction of capital punishment was being considered.
Following the murder of a woman in southern Hungary, Orbn had said on Tuesday: The death penalty question should be put on the agenda in Hungary  Hungary will stop at nothing when it comes to protecting its citizens.
On Wednesday his spokesman, Zoltn Kovacs, denied Orbn was talking of bringing back the death penalty. It was Hungarian citizens and voters, not politicians, who were talking about the death penalty. We abide by the international laws.
And after Junckers intervention on Thursday, Orbn appeared to back away further from his original comments, telling leading European politicians that Hungary was not planning to reintroduce the death penalty, but only to talk about the issue. There is a debate about the introduction of the death penalty. A debate, so it is not like there is a plan to introduce the death penalty, Janos Lazar, his chief of staff, said. He said Orbn had told European parliament president Martin Schulz this, adding that Hungary will respect the European Unions law.
Orbns remarks had triggered an international outcry.
Mr Orbn must immediately make clear that this is not his intention. If it would be his intention, it would be a fight, said Juncker. He noted that the EUs charter of fundamental rights forbids the death penalty.
Hungary joined the EU in 2004. The death penalty in the country was scrapped following the collapse of communism in 1989.
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and leader of the Liberals in the European parliament, said that under Orbns policies, Hungary would no longer qualify for admission to the EU if it applied to join now.
The EU executive in Brussels said on Wednesday that moves to reinstate the death penalty could incur curbs on Hungarys EU rights and entitlements.
Orbn is a persistent critic of the EU, who holds up Russias president, Vladimir Putin, as a model leader. His Fidesz party is allied with Germanys governing Christian Democrats and other mainstream centre-right parties in the European parliament. There were calls on Wednesday for it to be expelled from the group.
Leaders of the various caucuses met on Thursday and decided that the chambers civil liberties committee will address the situation in Hungary as a matter of urgency, further to the statement by prime minister Viktor Orbn about a possible restoration of the death penalty and the preparation of a questionnaire designed to encourage Hungarian citizens to state positions on immigration questions.

New analysis reveals likely impact of global warming on plants and animals if we fail to take action, and comes ahead of crunch climate talks in Paris

One in six of the planets species will be lost forever to extinction if world leaders fail to take action on climate change, according to a new analysis.
The stark warning on the scale of global warmings impact on animals and plants comes just months before nearly 200 governments meet for UN climate talks in Paris in an attempt to forge a global deal on cutting carbon emissions.
Conservationists said such a large loss would be a tragedy with serious ramifications for people as well as ecosystems.
Creatures in Australia, New Zealand and South America will be hit much harder than North American and Europe, due to a high number of species not found anywhere else, such as Australias white lemuroid ringtail possums , which can die within hours in higher temperatures.
Relatively small land masses in Australia and New Zealand mean that many species there will be unable to migrate to cope with rising temperatures, found the study, published in the journal Science on Thursday .
The study is the most comprehensive look yet at the impact of climate change on biodiversity loss, analysing 131 existing studies on the subject. The stresses on wildlife and their habitats from global warming is in addition to pressures such as deforestation, pollution and overfishing that have already seen the world lose half its animals in the past 40 years .
The risk if we continue on our current trajectory is very high. If you look out your window and count six species and think that one of those will potentially disappear, thats quite profound, said the studys author, Mark C Urban, of the University of Connecticut.
Those losses would affect our economy, our cultures, our food security, our health. It really compels us to act.
Any deal that emerges from the UN climate summit in Paris is not expected to initially be enough to hold warming to 2C , the safe level of warming world leaders are committed to, though the hope is governments carbon-cutting pledges will later be strengthened sufficiently to meet it.
But even if governments do manage to hold global warming to 2C, one in 20 species (5.2%) still face extinction, the study found.
If manmade greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current record-breaking rate , leading to a temperature rise of more than 4C by the end of the century, 16% of species, or one in six, face extinction.
The study also emphasises that even for the animals and plants that avoid extinction, climate change could bring about substantial changes in their numbers and distribution.

Jamie Carr at the climate unit of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which compiles the most authoritative list of endangered species worldwide , said: The loss of one in six species, would be an absolute tragedy, not only because it is sad to lose any part of our rich natural world, but also because biodiversity is fundamental in providing important functions and services, including to humans.
Such significant changes to biological systems would undoubtedly have knock-on effects, and could potentially result in the collapse of entire systems.
Richard Walters, lecturer in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Reading, said: Ecologists have attempted to predict the risk of extinction under climate change for some time now but this meta-analysis provides our most comprehensive guesstimate to date.
We know that the accuracy of forecasts are dependent upon a whole suite of assumptions, but what this study helps us to identify is which are the most important unknowns.
Climate change affects wildlife directly and indirectly, through changing weather patterns that may affect the food they rely on or the habitat they live in. Species in the Arctic are considered particularly vulnerable, with polar bears being forced to swim further distances for food as sea ice melts to record lows . Ringed seals depend on the sea ice, which they rest on and mate below.
But the slow-motion rate at which some of the predicted extinctions will happen means that targeted conservation efforts for some at-risk species could help them survive a warmer world  while other species may be able to adapt in time.
This isnt just doom and gloom. We still have time. Extinctions can take a long time. There are processes that could be important in mediating these effects, for example evolution, but we really need to very quickly start to understand these risks in a much more sophisticated way, said Urban.
His meta-analysis looked at 131 previously published studies on warmings impact on wildlife, dating back to the early 1990s, most of which modelled how much habitat becomes unsuitable for species under future climates.

For example, the Haleakal silversword, a striking-looking plant that is only found on the Hawaiian island of Maui, was saved by conservationists from overzealous collectors in the 19th century but its habitat is now increasingly too dry and warm for new seedlings .
Urban said that his findings should inform the Paris climate summit, and showed the importance of acting now on cutting greenhouse gas emissions rather than waiting for 20 years, when the evidence of species loss under global warming becomes identifiable beyond the background noise of natural extinctions.
Dr Stephen Cornelius, WWF-UKs chief adviser on climate change, said: This study further highlights the urgency of taking strong action to address climate change and that business as usual is no longer an option. We have the technology to tackle climate change, what we need now is the political will and investment in a clean, low-carbon future.
Walters added: Worryingly this study suggests that the risk of extinction accelerates with every degree increase in global temperature, which has important implications for our understanding of what constitutes a safe increase in global temperature.

Ten men involved in the attempt to kill Malala Yousafzai have been sentenced to life in prison by a Pakistani court, lawyers involved in the case have said.
None of the men was in the team who shot the education activist in the head as she sat in a school minivan in 2012, but a security official said they had been part of a wider group of plotters involved in the planning and execution of the attack.
The point-blank shooting of the then 15-year-old at the behest of the Pakistani Taliban caused global outrage and Malala later became the youngest ever winner of the Nobel prize.

One military source said on Thursday that only two of the 10 men had been sentenced by the anti-terrorism court in the city of Mingora, the capital of Malalas native Swat.
However, court officials and lawyers involved in the case insisted all 10 had been given sentences of 25 years.
The mens sentences for attempted murder could be increased if additional charges are brought against them.
They were arrested in September last year in a swoop involving multiple security agencies and accused of being part of a group tasked by the Pakistani Taliban leader, Mullah Fazlullah, with killing a series of high-profile people, including Malala.
She had infuriated the militants both with her advocacy for female education and her fearless public criticism of them.
Malala first began exposing the miseries of life under militant rule in 2009 when, at the age of 12, she began blogging about life under the Taliban in Swat for the BBC Urdu website.
A Pakistani offshoot of the Taliban had gradually come to dominate the picturesque region of Swat, implementing its version of Sharia law, which included public floggings and banning girls from going to school.
The man believed to have fired the bullet at Malalas head, a militant called Ataullah Khan, is believed to be hiding in Afghanistan .
Although Malala is celebrated around the world as a symbol of the struggle for female education, many in Pakistan are suspicious of the praise heaped on her by the west. She has lived in the UK since being taken there for life-saving treatment at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.

Ethical questions have been raised after a CNN crew covering the Nepalese earthquake filmed its chief medical correspondent perform emergency brain surgery on an eight-year-old girl using a saw and resuscitate a woman mid-air on a helicopter, using a cardiac thump .
Dr Sanjay Gupta, the feted neurosurgeon and CNN journalist, who was reporting on the devastating 7.8-magnitude quake, has regularly stepped in to save lives while covering a story for the broadcaster.
Gupta is no stranger to carrying out medical procedures in front of the camera. He treated a two-year-old boy on assignment in the Middle East, and as well as examining patients on camera after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
Connie St Louis, director of the Science Journalism programme at City University in London, told the Guardian that she was really, really worried about the ethics of filming a journalists medical intervention.
As a journalist with medical training, do you really need to film the times when you get involved? Theres certainly a possible confidentiality issue, as well as the potential for self-promotion. If you film the journalist doing the medical procedure, they become the story.
My feeling is, why do it in Nepal when there is no way you could possibly do this in America?
Several ethics experts have previously raised questions over the conflicting instincts of a physician-journalist. Bob Steele, journalism values scholar at the Poynter Institute, said after the Haiti disaster he had uneasy feelings over how news organisations at some point appear to be capitalising for promotional reasons on the intervention by journalists.
Tom Linden, professor of medical journalism at the University of North Carolina, proposed after the disaster in Haiti, where several medical correspondents treated patients on camera, new guidelines should be drawn up. He suggested in the journal Electronic News that physician-journalists prioritise their duty to save lives, but that a reporter who treats a patient shouldnt feature that person on a television report, or even ask for their permission to do so.
In Nepal, the CNN crew filmed surgery on eight-year-old Selena Dohal, who had a fractured skull after a roof collapsed in her home town of Panchkhal, 26 miles (42km) from the capital, Kathmandu.
Doctors at Kathmandus Bir hospital said Dohal arrived with her grandfather and urgently needed surgery to remove blood clots that had collected on the right frontal area of her brain.
Gupta, who is also assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine, said he was summoned on Tuesday by Nepalese doctors to assist them with a craniotomy  the surgical removal of a section of the skull to expose the brain.
He scrubbed up in what he described as a makeshift operating room, using iodine and sterilised water to clean the injuries. He had no surgical drill to cut open Dohals skull because of the lack of electricity and had to use a saw.
Ive seen a lot of situations around the world, and this is as bad as Ive ever seen it, Gupta said on CNN. Theyre barely able to keep up right now. Its part of the reason they asked me (to help); I think theyre asking anybody to try to pitch in.
In a separate incident, it emerged on Friday that Gupta was again filming in a scenario in which his medical skills were needed when the crew were on an aid flight in Sindhupalchowk, east of the capital.
Sabina Lama, 18, was taken in a makeshift straw stretcher on board a helicopter, which was carrying instant noodles and water to people left homeless by the quake. Mid-air, Lama suddenly stopped breathing and Gupta could no longer detect a pulse.
With no defibrillator, Gupta delivered a heavy blow to her chest in a last-ditch attempt to restart her heartbeat. It is aggressive  but I just delivered a cardiac thump, a quick, strong hit to the chest in a last ditch effort to shock Sabinas heart back into action, he said.

Irans foreign minister is facing a backlash from his supporters, after claiming in a recent US interview that his country does not imprison citizens solely because of their opinions.
Mohammad Javad Zarif, who remains popular in Iran for his handling of the nuclear negotiations, appeared on the Charlie Rose talkshow this week while on a visit to New York for a review conference of the non-proliferation treaty at the UN.
We do not jail people for their opinions,he said when asked about the detention of Jason Rezaian , the Washington Post reporter held in Iran for the past nine months.
Related: Iran flexible on sanctions timing in order to seal nuclear deal, Zarif suggests
The government has a plan to improve, enhance human rights in the country as every government should. I believe we have an obligation as a government to our own people to do that, he said. But people who commit crimes, who violate the laws of a country cannot hide behind being a journalist or being a political activist, people have to observe the law.
Speaking to the Guardian on Friday, Irans most prominent human rights activist and lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, said those comments were simply not true. I certainly cannot accept that, she said by telephone from Tehran.
I didnt expect these remarks from Mr Zarif. There are plenty of prisoners of conscience behind bars in Iran held solely because of their opinions, including journalists, lawyers, student and labour activists, political prisoners and many people who are in jail for their beliefs, such as Bahais, Christians, many of whom I personally met while I was in prison.
Mohammad Javad Zarif appears Charlie Roses talkshow.
Sotoudeh was detained in September 2010 after falling foul of the authorities for representing several political activists and highlighting the execution of juveniles in Iran. She has been awarded the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought by the European parliament. Previous recipients include Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela. She was freed in 2013 after Hassan Rouhani became president.
Following Zarifs remarks, many Iranians took online to express their discontent, posting comments beneath his latest posts on Facebook . Nobody is jailed in Iran for his or her opinion? Liar, wrote one user. When you lie, there is no difference between you and [former hardline president] Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said another.
One user posted: You broke many hearts in Iran. We are expecting you to apologise. Another reminded Zarif of a popular religious saying in Iran: One who lies is the enemy of God.
Another post said: Youre making Pinocchio look truthfu.
Maziar Bahari, a prominent journalist who was jailed in the aftermath of Irans post-election protests in 2009, tweeted: Mr. @JZarif is, unfortunately, lying. Many innocent people are in prison in Iran just for being a journalist or an activist.
Fellow journalist Bahman Ahmadi Amouie, awho was sentenced to more than five years inprison over the protests, wrote a letter to Zarif, saying: As a prisoner who was jailed, interrogated and mentally and physically tortured because of my opinions and my writings in the newspapers that had been legally licensed..
I testify that Rouhanis government and his foreign minister are lying on this issue.
Sotoudeh said Iranian authorities are holding many civil and political activists on bogus security charges. She added that while in jail a guard told his senior in front of her and fellow inmates that one prisoner was jailed because she was Bah. Bahs are the most persecuted religious minority in Iran.
When I was in jail, from 30 women in our ward at least six were Bah women but now there are even more Bahs in jail, Sotoudeh said.
Others held because of their opinions and beliefs include Mahvash Shahriari, Fariba Kamalabadi who are among seven leaders of the Bah community that are each serving 20-year jail sentences.
Before international workers day on Friday, Iran also arrested at least five labour activists and leaders  including Ebrahim Maddadi and Davood Razavitwo, who are members of the union of workers at the Tehran and suburbs bus company.
In March, the UN special rapporteur of human rights, Ahmed Shaheed, said situation in Iran was worsening under Rouhani , warning that Iranian authorities continue to harass, arrest, prosecute and imprison many members of society who express criticism of the government or publicly deviate from officially sanctioned narratives.
Rouhani and his administration are not seen as directly involved in the arrests and harassment of activists. They are mainly carried out by the countrys security apparatus and its judiciary, which operate independently of the president and his government. But critics said Zarif was misrepresenting the rights situation in Iran.
This week, Zarif was interview by David Ignatius of the Washington Post in front of an audience at the New York University. The Iranian foreign minister was again defiant on human rights.
One audience member held up a sign. End sanctions against Iran, it read in English. Release [opposition leader] Mir Hossein Mousavi, it read in Persian.

A New York woman whose fiance has been missing since a kayaking trip 11 days ago has been charged with second-degree murder.
State police say inconsistencies in 35-year-old Angelica Graswalds statements led to her arrest in the death of Vincent Viafore. The Orange County district attorneys office announced the charges against the Poughkeepsie woman on Thursday.
Graswald originally told troopers she and the 46-year-old Viafore, also of Poughkeepsie, were kayaking April 19 when his boat capsized near the town of Cornwall-On-Hudson. Graswald called 911. She reported falling out of her own kayak and was later picked up by a boater.
Authorities believe Viafore did end up in the river, but his body hasnt been found. They arent commenting on how he died or a motive.
Court officials werent available to say if she has a lawyer.

A gay Muslim film-maker has said he has received numerous death threats and online abuse before his latest film, A Sinner in Mecca, premiered at the Hot Docs festival in Toronto on 29 April.
Parvez Sharma  an award-winning documentary-maker and LBGT activist, born in India but now based in New York  filmed his experience of undertaking the hajj, the devotional pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that Muslims are required to go on at least once in their lifetimes. Homosexuality is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia, and photography, even with cameraphones, is frowned upon, if not officially banned.
A Sinner in Mecca was well received at Hot Docs , with critics praising Sharmas deeply felt attempt to reconcile his sexuality with his faith, as well as his critique of the Saudis custodianship of holy sites. However, Sharma has said he received a barrage of hate mail from Muslim countries before the film was even screened, including direct threats to me. Some examples are published on the films website . One poster writes: How dare you call yourself a Muslim, while you have commented [sic] the biggest sin ever? while describing the film as a peace [sic] of crap. As a result, the festival took the precaution of increasing security for the screenings .
Sharma describes himself as a defiant pilgrim, and his film as a call to action to all Muslims to change the things that need to change within 21st-century Islam.

        <title>'Chaos? This is open-heart surgery': Medellín risks a massively expensive plan to bury its highway</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/01/medellin-bury-highway-urban-intervention</Link>
        <Description/>

The body of water that runs through Medelln can be called many things: an open sewer, a barrier, a crime alley or even a highway median strip. Anything but a river.
The city, however, is determined to change that. For years, the city had a reputation as the most violent city in the world . But in the last decade it reinvented itself through innovative urbanism, with projects like cable cars and outdoor escalators credited with successfully overhauling depressed and crime-ridden neighbourhoods. Its new plan, though, is its largest, boldest and  by far  costliest urban intervention yet.
Parks of the Medelln River (Parques del Ro Medelln) aims to completely transform the surroundings of the river, turning a highway into a public space and, with luck, sparking urban renewal. More than 1.1bn, 20km of riverbanks and 15 years will be needed to complete this ambitious project. It is the highest bet the city has placed. If it goes wrong, it could overshadow all the previous urban hits that brought the city fame.
The first step of the plan is the most controversial: to bury a 392m stretch of highway along the river and build a park on top. It will mean Medellns main highway will close for 11 months, cost 43m of public money and require the cutting down of large trees. Many citizens are enraged, saying it will cause chaos.
Chaos? How could that not happen? asks Catalina Osorio, the projects social deputy director. This is open-heart surgery for the city, and everyone is involved. We are touching what we never wanted to touch: the most frightening place of Medelln.

Particularly vocal in opposition are the residents of Conquistadores, a quiet, wealthy neighbourhood that would be the starting place for the project. Locals fear that noise, crime, street vendors and unregulated parking will invade the neighbourhood.
When the works began, a group of Conquistadores neighbours blocked the highway in protest. They felt the project would hurt the value of their apartments. That is my patrimony, what I worked all my life for, says Hernando Medina, one of the protesters. Among their main concerns is that new pedestrian bridges will connect them with the east bank of the river, where the highway will be buried and a large boulevard built instead. There are economically depressed neighbourhoods nearby, and the bridges will be located less than a kilometre away from a place by the river where dozens of homeless people dwell. We dont need a park here, says Olga Ruiz, a resident of Conquistadores. People will come down from everywhere. Some protesters have suggested building a wall to separate their neighbourhood.
Medelln always had a troublesome relationship with its river. The city is located in a narrow mountain valley, and the river often floods violently. The riverbanks were pastures until the 1950s when the river was channelled, the highway built and the citys development skyrocketed.
As industrial areas mushroomed along the axis of the river, residential areas began growing up the steep slopes of the Aburr Valley. It is difficult to provide utilities and public transportation in these places, and landslides have killed hundreds, rich and poor alike.
Meanwhile, the river became a frontier that separated paisas  the inhabitants of Medelln   from themselves. The highway blocked access to the river, which became invisible to the city. Paisas only go down to the river in December, when a section of the highway is closed for people to walk and enjoy enormous arrays of Christmas lights.
To correct this historic problem, a new metropolitan urban plan was adopted in 2011, which later gave birth to Parks of the Medelln River. The project is not an end, but the means to materialise the zoning plan, says Juan Pablo Lopez, the projects operating director. He claims the parks will attract dense residential developments near the river.
After four years, an international urbanism design contest and tenders for engineering designs and construction, the project was given the green light. Still, many paisas dont see the project as a priority, considering the more pressing social issues in Medelln. Lopez admits they did a bad job selling it. We were unable to show the project as a complete city strategy, showing infrastructure instead, he says.
Historic projects seem to be just the standard operating procedure in this town

Medellns highway also serves as the main national road, so heavy cargo transportation in western Colombia will be affected by years of partial closure. Parks of the River will condemn us, for decades, to a heart attack of the metropolitan economy, says Johel Moreno, former president of the Society of Engineers and Architects of Antioquia. He is afraid the river wont serve as the transportation axis it was conceived to be 60 years ago, and the park will rule out the possibility of an elevated highway.
Technical aspects also concern Moreno, who remembers the problems faced during the construction of the Big Dig in Boston: water leaks, billion-dollar cost overruns and years of delays. If that happened in Massachusetts, in the first world, what would happen here? he asks.
Morenos vision is contrasted by experts like Janette Sadik-Khan, New Yorks former transport commissioner, who is remembered for pedestrianising Times Square. When it comes to massive infrastructure projects that actually have immediate, important impacts on the lives of its citizens, Medelln is showing the world how its done, she says. Historic projects seem to be just the standard operating procedure in this town.

Sadik-Khan thinks the project will continue to power the economic engine that has transformed Medelln, thanks to the real-estate investment opportunities that come with it. The mayors office is creating a company to boost urban renewal across the river in partnership with two of Colombias largest utilities companies.
This new company would invest in civil works and manage the new urban developments. In exchange, it will receive long-term income from urban tolls, real-estate development rights and taxes from capital gains, allowing Parks of the Medelln River to be financially sustainable.
This financial scheme was inspired by Rio de Janeiro, which allied with one of Brazils bigger pension funds to build Porto Maravilha: an ambitious urban project that became famous for the implosion of 4.8km of elevated highway over the last two years.
Medelln and Rio could join Madrid, San Francisco and Seoul in the group of cities that have rethought their highways for the sake of public space. The experience of these cities could shed new lights in urban debates worldwide, and help cities decide what to do with their freeways.

These debates often go on for decades. The Gardiner Expressway, a six-lane elevated highway that runs through downtown Toronto and effectively blocks access to much of the Lake Ontario waterfront, requires hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs. There are proposals to bury it and build a boulevard, but city authorities are reluctant to let go of their highway. Success in Medelln could inspire other cities, such as Toronto, to action.
With a year to go before the completion of the first stage of Parks of the Medelln River, the city is anxious. Success or failure now will define the future of the project. In the best-case scenario, it will be yet another reasons for paisas to feel proud of their city. In the worst, it could ruin Medellns reputation for being at the forefront of innovative urbanism.
They gave us these instant photos that were so beautiful, says Blanca Ruiz, an elderly lady who was present at the launch of the project. The detailed renders show glossy projections of the new parks and spaces next to the river. I am keeping the pictures to see what the park comes out like.

Sergey Dyomins dystopian paintings have played around with images of everything from pigs to sewing machines and railway cars, but its his treatment of monkeys that got him noticed.
The Latvian artist won international acclaim in 2010 with his painting Boris And Gleb. Featuring two monkeys dressed up a 11th-century Orthodox saints, it reached the final in an online competition for international artists hosted by Londons Saatchi Gallery.
Another simian painting earned him a second-finalist spot in 2014 in the same competition  Blue Monkey, featuring a solemn, blue-faced baboon dressed as an Orthodox cleric. The painting was so popular it was purchased before it hung in the winners exhibition.

The holy monkeys have raised his profile in the art world. Most of his paintings now sell for upwards of $10,000 (6,500) apiece. The logic is hard to explain, but somehow the monkeys really scored, says Dyomin, 41.
But his casual merging of primates with Orthodox iconography is almost certain to ruffle feathers among the Russian Orthodox faithful. Something the artist insists is not his intention.
Im not attaching any significance to it, says Dyomin, an atheist . Im not striving to offend anyone. I simply like the icon style  its very beautiful, with its rich colours and the static figures.
Some people see the pictures as deliberately offensive; others an eclectic mix of old and new.

I let the critics search for philosophical meaning, Dyomin says, adding that the majority of his buyers are Russians . If theres anything that pushes me to paint this way, its probably partly irony.
The monkeys in Dyomins work fare better than his humans, often portrayed as blackened, skeletal figures sitting alone in kitchens, or being sick in the shower.
In a particularly provocative painting , he portrays three women clad in black burqas, wearing suicide vests and riding bicycles under a banner reading Think Green in Arabic.
The painting, he says, is as much about Greenpeace  a totalitarian movement in its own right  as it is about terrorism.
Im an atheist, but Im not opposed to people being religious, the artist says. If their convictions are really deep, then they should be impervious to offence.
Dyomins other paintings are sometimes affectionate, sometimes ominous depictions of Riga, his hometown.

In one called Premonition Of War, white airships float in a cloudless sky. Dyomins response, he says, to Latvian concerns about a Russian invasion.
He thinks its likely but what can Latvia do? Whether or not were part of Nato and the EU, to the ordinary person here, it doesnt matter.
For Dyomin, who has a day job in the Latvian public archives, only one thing matters: I need to work less so I can paint more.

Millions of people will be voting for the first time when Britain goes to the polls next week, but none of them have quite the same story to tell as 72-year-old Park Seong-cheo.
Park is a North Korean defector living in London who received his British citizenship two months ago in time for the election. He says that because of the language barrier he is relying on South Korean television for most of his news about the campaigns.
The concept of voting is unfamiliar to me, says Park, who has lived in the UK for eight years.
Another first-time democratic voter Jihyun Park says she has been taken back by the variety of policies in the campaign manifestos. She has been following the TV debates and says her personal priorities are refugees and tuition fees. Her eldest son is set to go to university next year.

Jihyun, 46, arrived UK in 2008 with the support of a South Korean Christian association. Her escape, which was portrayed in the film Under a Different Sky , involved fleeing from North Korea twice. The first time she was caught and repatriated back to prison camp before she escaped again. She now lives in Manchester with her husband and and three children.
Little Korea
We meet in the Free NK newspaper  a democracy newspaper for North Koreans  offices above the canteen of Korea Foods in New Malden. Nestled in an unassuming industrial park in earshot of the A3, the wholesale supermarket is one of the areas most successful businesses and a hub for the Korean community.

The European Alliance for Human Rights in North Korea says that in 2013 there were 686 North Korean refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, more than half of the 1,200 living in Europe.
Many find their way to New Malden, a suburb of south west London. Also home to 20,000 South Koreans its been dubbed Little Korea, even Little Pyongyang , by the media. The community began to establish themselves when the residence of the South Korean ambassador was based there in the 1970s.
The town is in the Kingston and Surbiton constituency represented by Liberal Democrat MP Ed Davey, but its not clear whether he gain their votes. Park says he heard a man called David was standing but hadnt had contact with his campaign team and wasnt aware what he stood for.
Elections were reminders of surveillance
There are elections in North Korea , but they cant be considered democratic. Voters are watched by party officials and are only able to say whether they support the only party the country has ever known  or not.
An election was always a reminder that I was a target of surveillance, said Park. People go in to the ballot box, look at me, look at each other to see if anyone dares to vote against the party. But the UK campaign period has reminded him that I have human rights and I can exercise these rights.
Jiyoung Kang, who has been living as a refugee in the UK since 2009, said the result is never in doubt. There is never a case where a representative running for elections does not get elected, she said.

Jiyoung is not able to vote in Britian as she does not yet have citizenship, but says she is following developments on TV and through the Korean community. She says she is pleased to be living in the UK as a country where democracy is guaranteed and each party has a vision on how to improve the welfare of the people.
Ukip make me very angry
For both Park and Jihyun, two people who have gone through the British citizenship system, the immigration debate dominating this years election is very real.
Jihyun says she agrees with the Liberal Democrats that refugees should work when they come to the UK, as not only will they make a contribution but it can them to assimilate in to their new communities.
Jihyun works for the European human rights group building ties and fostering solidarity with other members of the North Korean community in the UK. This sets her apart from fellow refugees who, according to the Telegraph , tend to keep a low profile and work in menial labour.
Related: Immigration: in Enoch Powell's former seat jobs and the economy matter more
Talking through her voting options, Jihyun says that Ukips stance makes her very angry and the Greens are not too bad but they are a small group  maybe next time.
She says her husband, who is also North Korean, has decided to vote for whoever improves the economy, but she is biding her time before making the decision. .
Park is also reluctant to be tied down: I am old and I have many difficulties contributing to society, but I was given asylum refugee status and for that I am very grateful, he says. Whilst reticent to criticise his new home, he would like to vote for someone who interested in getting rid of discrimination in society.
Park, who lives in a council house with his wife, recounts a recent problem with his accommodation. His fire alarm kept falling off and he spoke to the housing manager six times but they never came. A few weeks later he was taking a shower and the water leaked into the floor below, his neighbour complained and someone came round straight away.
That, he says, was one experience of discrimination, before reiterating once more how grateful he is to have become a citizen.
Painful memories

Whilst the numbers of North Korean arriving in the UK are relatively low, border agency guidance dictates that most are likely to be refused asylum on the grounds that they are also citizens of South Korea where they are not at considerable risk.
In a quiet voice Park refuses to talk about how he got to the UK in 2008. I am not keen on going through painful memories again, he said, and was unwilling to have his photograph taken. Other North Koreans were wary about talking to a national newspaper.
Park changed the subject back to the election. The Conservatives areinterested in improving the economy, he said, and although this is good the Labour party is more interested in improving the lives of ordinary people, from my background I think it would be a better vote.
What about his wife? She will vote Labour too  thats why we live together, he adds, laughing.

        <title>Periphery: Israel’s search for allies in the Middle East by Yossi Alpher</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/apr/30/periphery-israel-iran-relations-yossi-alpher-book-review</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
A new book by Yossi Alpher, who has been both a Mossad operative and co-editor of the Israeli-Palestinian newsletter Bitterlemons, examines the history of the Periphery doctrine, a general rubric covering Israels search for allies in the Middle East.
Despite originating in the office of prime minister David Ben Gurion around 1957-8, the doctrine has been more influential in Mossad and other intelligence agencies than in Israeli diplomacy or covert politics. Its basic aim has been finding regional partners against the Arab core, originally understood as a coalition of states led by the Egypt of Gamal Abdul Nasser.
These allies have been both countries and ethnic or religious minorities within countries, and have at various times included Turkey, the Shahs Iran , Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco and Greece as well as the Maronites of Lebanon, the Iraqi Kurds, the south Sudanese and the Berbers. The doctrine was most significant, argues Alpher, from the 1960s to the late 1980s, when faded in response to apparent progress in peace talks with the core Arab states and the Palestinians, before re-emerging after 2010 with the Arab Spring as years of Arab state dysfunction spawned a new era of Arab revolution.
The highpoint of the periphery doctrine - the flagship operation - was Trident, an intelligence alliance with Turkey and Iran beginning in the late 1950s. This lasted with Iran until the 1979 Revolution , and with Turkey until prime minister Recep Erdogan took a distance from Israel around 2009.
How useful Trident was to those involved remains unclear. A Trident headquarters in Israel was paid for by the CIA  with a blue section for Iranians and a yellow one for Turks  but never really used and soon became a Mossad training facility.
Iran did at least export oil to Israel, beginning when Mohammad Mossadegh was prime minister, and by the later 1970s there were also arms sales and several thousand Israeli businessmen living with their families in Tehran. While there was almost daily sharing of raw intelligence data, writes Alpher, mainly concerning Nassers Egypt or the Soviet Union, both Turkey and Iran kept a distance, a kind of plausible deniability, especially to defray Arab fears.
Alpher argues Trident had little practical value for Israel: he quotes David Kimche, a Mossad veteran, that its astounding how shallow in vital areas their [ie Irans] intelligence was. Its importance, argues Alpher, was rather in sending an important message to the Americans, the Soviets, and the Arabs: Israel was not alone; it had important regional allies.
Perhaps the most gripping part of Alphers book for those most interested in Iran is his critique of what he calls periphery nostalgia, which he defines as the presumption that because Iran has historic tensions with the Arab world and because one Iranian regime, that of the shah, seemingly allied itself strategically with Israelthis pattern of alliance and shared strategic interests mustcontinue
Alpher ridicules any notion of a natural affinity between Jews and Persians going back to King Cyrus in the 6th century BC allowing Jews exiled in Babylon to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. He cites Trita Parsi, who studied the Iran-Israel relationship in depth for his book Treacherous Alliance, quoting an interview where Parsi sums up his discussions with diplomats from the Shahs time, contrasting, on one hand, the Israelis for whom there seemed to be not only an ideological [tie] but also a fulfilment of destiny... [a belief in] a new chapter of the Bible being written with, on the other hand, the Iranians who had no idea of these supposed ties and who couldnt care less.
Alpher analyses Iran-Contra and Israels arms supplies to Iran during the 1980-88 war with Iraq as examples of the same fallacy, through a misplaced conviction that a moderate faction involved in a power struggle in Iran would be strengthened...thereby paving the way to a strategic breakthrough in Israeli-Iranian relations.
Alpher sees more recent advocates of regime change as another instance of Israelis who willfully or erroneously engage in wishful thinking and ignore the dramatic change that has taken place in Irans power structure since the shahs day. The reality, he argues, is that the majority of Iranians appear to support at least the idea of the regime, which has struck deep institutional and cultural roots.
For those weary of the rhetoric of politicians or the propagandizing of think tanks, Alphers sparkling book, based on information and experience acquired over 30 years, including interviews with several heads of Mossad, is a torrent of fresh air. As a former intelligence operative, he well knows that all rulers  Israeli or Iranians  combine pragmatism with core beliefs and ideology.
He is also aware they can come to believe in their own half-truths and wishes. Hence his argument over periphery nostalgia is not just that it distorts reality but that it is dangerous.
For Alpher is among those Israelis who still believe that, despite formidable obstacles, peace with the Palestinians and the Arab core is both possible and desirable. The danger in a nostalgic approach to Iran is that it encourages Israel consciously or inadvertently [to] ignore prospects for coexistence with its immediate Arab neighbours because it convinces itself of the seeming immutability of its periphery relationships.

African cultures Photographer Mahdi Ehsaei documented the African presence in Iran over two months last year. Although Iran is home to various ethnic groups  who have migrated to the region through the centuries  Afro-Iranians and those of African descent are often forgotten in the countrys history.

I began my project with the intention to reveal new facets and unfamiliar faces of Iran. Most often, Afro-Iranians are the descendants of those who arrived via the Indian Ocean slave trade in the 19th century. When slavery ceased in Iran in 1928, many settled in the south

A Russian Duma deputy has asked Russias attorney general to investigate Apple for distributing gay propaganda to minors.
Alexander Starovoitov, a member of the rightwing LDPR party, says Apple spammed youths with illegal content when it released U2s latest album, Songs of Innocence, to more than 500 million iTunes customers worldwide in September 2014.
Apples gift of free copies of U2s new album to iTunes users triggered a significant backlash ..
I had this beautiful idea and we kind of got carried away with ourselves, said frontman Bono , responding to widespread criticism of the automatic download. Artists are prone to that kind of thing.
The album cover in question features the bands drummer, Larry Mullen Jr, embracing his 18-year-old son, Elvis, shirtless. The image was taken by photographer Glen Luchford, and the group says it is a visual metaphor for the album and its theme of how holding on to your own innocence is a lot harder than holding on to someone elses.
But Starovoitov disagrees. He says the U2 album art promotes sex between men, and the newspaper Izvestia, known for its pro-Kremlin reporting, quotes Evgeny Tonky, a lawyer , who says hes ready to sue Apple for compensation for moral damages on behalf of his own son.

If Apple is convicted of distributing gay propaganda to youths, the company could be forced to cease operations in Russia for as many as 90 days, or pay a fine of up to 1 million roubles (13,000).
The album initially launched with different cover art, the two shirtless men only appeared later, when physical copies of the album went on sale.
In November 2014, following Tim Cooks announcement that he is gay, a university in St Petersburg removed a monument to Steve Jobs and Apple . The decision was widely viewed as a direct response to Cooks coming out.

The South African government has condemned the recent wave of xenophobic violence that has claimed at least seven lives and shattered the countrys reputation for tolerance and goodwill. But instead of pointing the finger at a small minority , the ruling ANC should recognise its own role in creating this situation.
While the attacks on immigrants cannot be justified, there is no denying the fact that foreigners are increasingly competing with South Africans for jobs and resources. The government estimates that there are more than five million immigrants in the country  with by far the majority of them being Zimbabweans fleeing political and economic instability.
Related: 'South Africa is not a xenophobic nation': a letter from Jacob Zuma
Its clear that if South Africa had not been so reluctant to intervene in the crisis next door, it would not be suffering the consequences at home.
The ANC fought hard for democracy in South Africa but it has not used its influence as the ruling party in the regional powerhouse to encourage democratic practices among its neighbours. Instead the party has been cosying up to the Zimbabwan president, Robert Mugabe , despite his record of rigging elections and intimidating opponents.
ANC heavyweight Jessie Duarte has defended this hands-off approach, arguing that South Africa has no right to tell the people of Zimbabwe how to run their country  but this fails to recognise the realities on the ground.
The South African economy makes up more than 70% of the regional GDP, and it was just a few weeks ago that Mugabe came on a state visit seeking trade opportunities and presumably a financial bailout.
With this much leverage, South Africa is extremely well placed to lobby for political and economic change.
Yet successive ANC governments have failed to press Zimbabwe to have credible elections and have covertly endorsed an illegitimate government. A newly released report compiled by South Africa high court judge Sisi Khampepe found that Zimbabwes 2002 elections were not at all free and fair  and that the South African observers were well aware of this despite declaring them to be legitimate.
Indeed, South Africa is guilty of trying to patch up the Zimbabwean problems with band-aid solutions, including former president Thabo Mbekis attempts to mediate between Mugabes ruling Zanu-PF and the opposition MDC parties. Mbeki denied that Zimbabwe was in a crisis, despite evidence of human rights abuses and election irregularities. He was effectively shielding the country from western intervention, declaring that the Southern African Development Community was capable of handling the situation.
For Mbeki this was partly motivated by his desire for an  African renaissance , which made him unwilling to join in the western condemnation of Zimbabwe. The solidarity between Zanu-PF and the ANC as former liberation movements also added to the reluctance to criticise. Yet in the process South Africa has given Mugabe and Zanu-PF free rein to destroy the economy.
Related: South Africa's xenophobic attacks: are migrants really stealing jobs?
Rather than turning a blind eye to failures of democracy in the region, South Africa has a duty to support development and political stability among neighbouring countries and not to be an island of economic growth. After all, its not hard to work out that if the situation in Zimbabwe were different fewer people would leave, and there would be fewer refugees.

My dear brother,
Its a pity that we are reconnecting under sad and painful circumstances, which have prompted you to write an open letter to me .
I remember you from our days in Mozambique , and I cannot forget the friendship that your country accorded my comrades  and to me personally.
You are in pain as your letter indicates, because of the deaths of Mozambicans and the general attacks on foreign nationals in parts of our country. South Africans are also in pain because of the tragic and senseless killings of seven people in the past weeks.
This is a difficult period for our country and its people. Millions of peace loving South Africans are in pain also because they are being accused of xenophobia, which is not true. South Africans are definitely not xenophobic.
The actions of a small minority should not be used to wrongfully label and stereotype more than 50 million people.

Since 1994, we have worked tirelessly to rebuild our country and to reverse the legacy of apartheid colonialism. We have made progress in building a society that is based on the respect for the right to life, human rights, equality and human dignity.
We continue to build a society free of discrimination. We are doing so because we know the pain of being discriminated against because of skin colour, language or nationality.
You reminded me of the hospitality and generosity that was accorded to me by Mozambicans during my stay in your beautiful country in exile. We agree that we benefited immensely from international solidarity and friendship during our struggle against apartheid. Many were killed for supporting our struggle for freedom.
Like most countries that have emerged from conflict, we have deep-seated challenges
It is for this reason that we embrace our African brothers and sisters who migrate to South Africa legally. In fact our migration policy is advanced because we integrate refugees and asylum seekers within our communities. They live among our citizens, they are part of us.
Mozambicans and South Africans enjoy deep bonds that go far back into our history. These are bonds created by our living together, our working together, and of our fighting together against colonialism and apartheid.
We built our movements together in the early years of the anti-colonial struggle. We shared camps in Tanzania. Umkhonto Wesizwe (MK) cadres fought side-by-side with the Angolan MPLA and the Cubans to defend Angolas independence.

South Africa has not changed  and has not forgotten such comradeship and solidarity. But like most countries that have emerged from conflict, we have deep-seated challenges.
We appreciate the contribution of foreign nationals in South Africa. They add to our economic development by investing in the economy, bringing critical skills and through adding to the diversity that we pride ourselves in.
But there are also some complaints that citizens have raised which need to be addressed. These include the increasing number of illegal and undocumented immigrants in the country, the displacement of many local small traders by foreign nationals, and that some of the migrant traders operate illegally.
There are accusations that foreign nationals commit crimes such as drug peddling and human trafficking, that they take the jobs of locals as theyre prepared to take lower wages, and complaints about free government housing that is secured by foreign nationals.
We have emphasised that none of these grievances justify any form of violence and that it will never be tolerated by government. We are also pointing out that not all migrants are in the country illegally and not all are involved in criminal activities.
I invite you to join us as we move beyond the anger and pain, and promote peace and friendship
The grievances of the South African population have to be balanced with the plight of many refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants from the continent and beyond. We therefore have a lot of work to do to find long-term solutions.
I have appointed an Inter-Ministerial Committee of 14 ministers to look into the broader management of migration. Drawing support from all sectors of society, they will help us address the underlying socio-economic causes of the tensions between citizens and brothers and sisters from the continent  and from countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh  to prevent another flare-up of violence.
In the short-term we will also improve the implementation of the existing migration policy, including tightening controls at the ports of entry and borders and also ensuring adherence to the laws of the country, while protecting migrants and the local population from criminal elements who are taking advantage of the tensions caused by socio-economic challenges. Work has also begun to review the countrys migration policy based on the current and recent experiences.

What gives us strength as a government, is that we are working with the full support of our peace-loving population. The peace and friendship marches that are being held throughout the country embody the South Africa we know and the South Africa we are proud of.
That is the South Africa which condemns hatred, violence, racism, xenophobia and all other related intolerances.
I invite you to join us my dear brother, as we move beyond the anger and pain, and promote sustainable and inclusive development as well as peace and friendship all over Africa.
Sincerely yours,

Dear President Zuma: a letter from Mia Couto
In the aftermath of last weeks xenophobic attacks the prominent Mozambican writer penned an open letter to president Jacob Zuma which was published by the Daily Maverick last week.
Couto reminded him of the high price South Africas neighbouring countries, including Mozambique, paid in supporting the liberation of apartheid.
The fragile Mozambican economy was wrecked. Our territory was invaded and bombed. Mozambicans died in defence of their brothers on the other side of the border
A history which, as Couto argues, makes it hard to comprehend why South Africans would brutally turn on foreign nationals.
The attacks left seven dead and thousands displaced on the streets of South Africas cities, shops were looted and torched, and South Africas  rainbow nation was thoroughly shaken: The fabric of the nation is splitting at the seams, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said last week.
Zuma and his African National Congress (ANC) party have been accused by Couto, among others, of failing to do more to protect fellow Africans.

Aelita (1924)
Dir: Yakov Protazanov
An extract from the film Aelita, in which an engineer builds a rocket that flies to Mars
Based on Tolstoy s novel of the same name, Aelita is considered a classic not only of Soviet filmmaking, but of world cinema. It tells the story of an engineer, Los, who creates a spacecraft capable of flying to Mars.
Los sets out for the Red Planet in the company of Gusev, a Red Army soldier, and a sleuth called Kravtsov. On Mars, the trio encounters an alien humanoid civilisation. While Gusev plots a revolution, a love affair blossoms between Los and Aelita, the daughter of the Martian leader.
The novel is regarded as an original work of fiction with strong topical resonances. Alluding to the real-life rocket engine developer Iuzef Dominikovich , the book also features an ideological dimension,referencing the trans-humanist teachings of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky .
Cosmic Voyage (1935)
Dir: Vasily Zhuravlev
Rocket launch and moon exploration sequence from the silent film Cosmic Voyage
Initial attempts at a moon landing end in failure. A rabbit launched into space perishes en route. A second rocket, this time with a cat on board, vanishes without a trace. The third, manned by a small party of scientists, proves a success. Finally, the moon is colonised by the USSR. And on the way back, they even find the cat, long presumed dead, alive and well.
This naive Soviet pop sci-fi flick makes for impressive viewing even today, and for good reason. It is this very film that gave rise to the now standard practice of employing real-life scientists as on-set consultants (with Christopher Nolans Interstellar being a recent example ).
The scientific aspects of Cosmic Voyage were supervised by none other than Soviet rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , who created 30 technical drawings of the spacecraft for the film.
Meteorites, The Universe, Road to the Stars, Planet of Tempests, The Moon, et al. (1947 - 1970)
Dir: Pavel Klushantsev
Road to the Stars mixes documentary footage and fictional drama
A fan of the Soviet documentary-meets-sci-fi genre, it was director Pavel Klushantsev who pioneered this hybrid, combining elements of pure documentary with live action fantasy .
His films juxtapose talking heads documentary and laboratory footage with carefully choreographed scenes set on alien-inhabited planets. Klushantsevs Planet of Tempests made such an impression on US filmmakers that it ended up spawning two American adaptations. The first of these, Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet , was produced in 1965 by Roger Corman; the second, actually an adapted version of Cormans film, was directed by Peter Bogdanovich and released in 1968 under the title Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women .
According to a story that sometimes does the rounds in film circles, George Lucas, who regarded Klushantsev as the godfather of Star Wars , desperately wanted to meet the Soviet director, but ultimately the two sci-fi pioneers never crossed paths.
Solaris (1972)
Dir: Andrey Tarkovsky
Trailer for Tarkovskys sci-fi masterpiece Solaris
Tarkovskys film tells the story of Kris Kelvin, a psychologist who has travelled to the space station Solaris to evaluate whether the scientific mission being conducted there should continue. The scientists on board the station have been driven to the verge of madness, and soon Kelvin finds himself haunted by a manifestation of his beloved, who had committed suicide back on earth.
Needless to say, no overview of the Soviet sci-fi tradition would be complete without mention of Tarkovsky and his films Solaris and Stalker , both classifiable, to some extent, as science fiction. Like the rest of Tarkovskys filmography, these two works have received extensive analysis .Coming on the heels of the shelved Andrei Rublev , long withheld from release by the Soviet government, Solaris enjoyed such a degree of success that Tarkovsky was effectively given carte blanche for any future projects.
American director Steven Soderbergh remade Solaris in 2002, with George Clooney as Kelvin . However, Soderberghs Solaris lacks the artistic and conceptual power of the original.
Pilot Pirxs Inquest (1978)
Dir: Marek Piestrak
A still from the Soviet-Polish co-production of Pilot Pirxs Inquest Photograph: The Calvert Journal
This joint Soviet-Polish production revolves around a mission to Saturn. A big corporation succeeds in creating humanoid robots and, paying no heed to the skeptics, decides to put them into mass production. A crew of robots and humans  headed by a captain named Pirx  is sent out into space to launch two satellites into Saturns rings. True to the finest traditions of the genre, things dont go quite to plan.
Even today, this film feels contemporary  and all because its Polish director, Marek Piestrak , strived to achieve maximum realism. Costumes and models were devised on the basis of existing American and Soviet prototypes. Its electronic soundtrack, written by progressive Estonian composer Arvo Prt , also feels very contemporary, and was an influence on The Prodigys Smack My Bitch Up.
Per Astra ad Aspera (1981)
Dir: Richard Viktorov/Nikolai Viktorov
Poster for Per Astra ad Aspera Photograph: The Calvert Journal
The action of this film, whose Latin title translates as Through the Thorns to the Stars, is based on a screenplay by cult Soviet sci-fi writer Kir Bulychev and is set in deep space . A reconnaissance craft  named Pushkin in homage to Russias greatest poet  encounters a derelict starship. Inside is a humanoid woman with the inhuman abilities of teleportation and telekinesis.
Richard Viktorov directed the original 1981 version of this film. He died soon afterwards in 1983and Viktorovs son, Nikolai , released a new version in 2001, having remastered the sound and special effects and shortened the running time by cutting several set pieces laced with Soviet ideology.
Hard to be God (2013)
Dir: Aleksei German Sr
Trailer for Hard to be a God
On a planet mired in its own Middle Age, chaos, darkness and degradation reign. The situation is carefully monitored from Earth, and when it finally appears that a renaissance is imminent, Don Rumata Estorski is sent to the planet to investigate. He must remain a detached observer of events, butwitnessing rabble-rousing and lawlessness amongst the local inhabitants, he breaks his neutrality and interferes in the process of an alien civilisation.
Related: Ten great post-Soviet films
This adaptation of the Strugatsky brothers novel was a long time coming, and was due to become Aleksei German Srs directorial debut. However, when Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia in 1968, the story of how power in the city of Arkanar is seized by the black brotherhood took on an overly anti-Soviet tone. It was only in the late 1990s that German Sr reprised work on the film, and continued to do so until the end of his life. His son, director Aleksei German Jr , put the finishing touches to the project which was released in 2013.

Sudans president Omar al-Bashir was re-elected on Monday with 94.5% of a vote boycotted by major opposition parties and denounced by western governments as lacking credibility.
The number of votes obtained by candidate Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir of the National Congress Party was 5,252,478, or 94.5% of ballots cast, the head of the election commission Mokhtar al-Assam declared in the capital, Khartoum.
Bashir  the only sitting head of state facing genocide charges at the international criminal court  faced few challengers for the presidency. His closest competitor, Fadl el-Sayed Shuiab of the small Federal Truth Party, won 79,665 votes, or 1.43%.
Sudans principal opposition parties refused to take part, saying there was little chance of a free and fair contest.
Related: 'There is no such thing as an election in Sudan'
Political activists had campaigned for an unprecedented mass boycott, denouncing the vote as  a political charade .
Polling stations in Khartoum were largely deserted despite a nationwide one-day extension. The African Unions election observer mission said there had been a generally low turnout of voters throughout.
But Assam insisted reports of low turnout were not accurate. He put the figure at 46.4% across the four days of polling in which representatives of the national and state parliaments were also chosen. Nearly 13 million people were registered to vote at some 11,000 polling centres.
The controversial ballot has faced international condemnation, with the US, Britain and Norway last week criticising Sudan for its failure to create a free, fair and conducive elections environment.
Rights campaigners were quick to denounce the result. Suliman Baldo, executive director of the Sudan Democracy First Group , said: It is the opposite of a great day for democracy. There was general apathy, a sort of fatalism that Bashir and his party were competing with themselves. The boycott was systematic, including even from the membership of the ruling party.
Baldo predicted that fighting in the Darfur region and other hotspots would now intensify. Major battles are being fought as we speak now. The political crisis will become more serious and aggravated because there is now no room for dialogue between the government and opposition.
A national dialogue was launched by Bashir in January last year but, as the elections approached, several opposition leaders were detained and there was a renewed crackdown on the press.
Olivia Warham, director of the UK-based campaign group Waging Peace, said: I can hardly say Im surprised  everyone knew Bashir would win from the day he announced his candidacy. This was a farce of an election.
Even those who could vote just didnt show up. Polling stations were deserted, or filled with more police officers and ruling party plants than actual voters. Victims of the genocide in Darfur and elsewhere are terrified that Bashir is adding another five years to his already almost 26-year rule.
Warham added that the UK should now act : We were delighted that the UK joined the US and Norway in declaring the result illegitimate. What we need now is action, not business as usual for Bashir and his cronies. For starters, we cant let him continue to evade arrest for charges of genocide.
Bashir seized power in a 1989 Islamist-backed coup, and won re-election in a 2010 election marred by opposition boycott and claims that the vote did not meet international standards.
Related: Sudan activists call for mass boycott of presidential election
The 71-year-old now looks set to tighten his grip on the country. He told voters during the campaign that only he could shield Sudan from the chaos engulfing other Arab countries, where he said western-backed aspirations for democracy  that flourished in the 2011  Arab Spring   took priority over stability.
He also campaigned on issues such as access to water and farmland. Nearly half Sudans population of 37 million people live in poverty, and unemployment is high.
Bashir is wanted on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide over his long military campaign in the western Darfur region. He is fighting to crush another insurgency in Blue Nile and South Kordofan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011.

Global media remain fascinated with North Koreas supposed weirdness.
Yet on the face of it, the North Korean government is neither uniquely authoritarian nor the population uniquely economically badly off. From Laos to Turkmenistan in Asia; Equatorial Guinea to Zimbabwe in Africa; and Syria to Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, political dissent is brutally suppressed and freedom still to be won elsewhere, too.
But such is the power of the global media clichs that these simplistic understandings dominate global thinking about the country.
The impression is of a society of 24 million people  more or less the same size of the population of Australia  as frozen in time.
These caricatures need to be jettisoned. North Korea , like every country in the world, is idiosyncratic  but not inexplicable.
North Koreans are different from you and me

Perhaps the most pervasive myth is that North Koreans are ignorant of the world outside, and believe everything the government tells them.
Related: Do North Koreans know their country is the butt of so many jokes?
This is extended by the assumption that North Koreans are educationally backward, and lack the sophistication to understand the world beyond their borders.
Images of public behaviour at events  such as the funeral of Kim Jong-il in December 2011  are presented as evidence that North Koreans are brainwashed, bizarre and inexplicable.
North Koreans are indeed subject to a relentless socialisation campaign that glorifies the exploits of the Kim family and inflicts sanctions on those who criticise the countrys rulers.
Yet despite the best efforts of the North Korean government, the picture of the DPRK as an absolutely closed society is far from the truth today.
The North Korean government works hard to prevent the free flow of information into the country. Students studying in Pyongyang have access to the major state libraries in the capital, which contain foreign books and films, but are only permitted to access these resources if they can demonstrate a need to do so, while access to the internet is limited.
However, a small number of students study abroad  about 500 were in Asia and Europe in 2002. The Universities of Warwick and Cambridge in the UK have hosted North Korean students, although Chinese universities provide a more common home: in 2012, 96 North Korean students were studying at Chinas Northeastern University alone.

Chinese traders and local trading networks have also provided routes for non-state sanctioned information for nearly a quarter of a century. Many Chinese traders and visitors are of Korean ethnicity, and three of North Koreas north-eastern provinces  Chagang, Ryanggang and North Hamgyong  border the Chinese prefecture of Yanbian, which is populated by ethnic Koreans of Chinese nationality.
In addition, Pyongyangs population of three million frequently come into contact with foreigners in the service sector  hotels, shops, bars  and workplaces where foreigners also work.
Outside Pyongyang, the port towns of Nampo, Chongjin and Rajin also host foreigners; so too has the southern tourist development zone of Kumgangsan, and the South Korea-sponsored free-trade zone of Kaesong.
Its true that short-term visitors to the country are carefully minded by accompanying North Korean officials, but long-term residents have more freedom. They are permitted to obtain North Korean driving licences, learn Korean and freely operate without permanent watch.
North Koreans are anything but ignorant. With almost universal literacy, and despite economic deterioration, school enrolment  for girls and boys  remains near universal. About 35% of high school graduates went on to university education in 2002.
The impressions of North Koreans derive partly from the skewing of domestic and foreign broadcasting. The television footage of weeping crowds after Kim Jong-ils death in 2011 was not balanced by images of the millions more who did not stop all their activities and rush onto the streets to engage in public mourning, for example.
North Korea is a dangerous and irrational military power

The country is routinely portrayed as a fearsome state that poses a serious threat to its neighbours.
Related: China warns North Korea's nuclear arsenal is expanding, report says
This is based on the alleged military capacity, aggression and irrationality of the government and the threat of nuclear proliferation .
But these threats are often exaggerated and shift focus away from the more real military threats North Korea poses just by its geography.
The proximity of Pyongyang to Seoul (the two capitals are 121 miles apart) means that most types of weaponry could be used to cause mass destruction. The risk of war comes about, not because the DPRK is inherently irrational, but because the underlying conflict between North and South Korea remains unresolved .
In reality, reports suggest the DPRKs conventional weaponry and hardware is out of date, its military infrastructure decrepit and its armed forces hungry and disaffected.
These weaknesses were the reason for building nuclear weapons in the first place; the intention was to use the countrys limited resources to develop the ultimate deterrent against invasion or coercive regime change.
This nuclear activity has provided the core of its military threat since 2006, when it conducted its first nuclear test; but the CIA, global intelligence agencies and academics have differed over how many nuclear bombs the North Koreans posses  and how successful it really has been in engineering usable nuclear weapons.
In 2011, the International Institute of Strategic Studies estimated that North Korea may have four to eight operational warheads, although it pointed out that North Koreas ability to produce a deliverable nuclear weapon remains in doubt.
Comparatively, North Koreas military technology and nuclear capacity is insignificant compared to the sophistication of the United States , which in 2011 possessed 2,200 operational nuclear warheads.
In contrast to its adversaries, the DPRKs scope and scale of military investment is pitifully small. It is nowhere near South Korean defence forces in terms of the quality and quantity of modern armaments.
In 2009, North Koreas defence expenditures amounted to some $4.38bn. South Korea on its own outspent the DPRK on defence by a factor of nearly four to one.
North Korea is a criminal state

The caricature of an omniscient criminal state misses the point. Photograph: Rodong Sinmun/EPA
North Korea is, allegedly, a criminal state for three reasons: firstly, because state representatives are alleged to systematically abuse diplomatic immunity to smuggle counterfeit currency, narcotics, counterfeit cigarettes, endangered species and other illicit goods across borders.
Secondly, because state-owned companies manufacture counterfeit currency, cigarettes and narcotics for sale abroad.
Thirdly, this activity is apparently directed by the North Korean leadership for personal gain.
These criminal acts, it is argued, should be understood as state-sponsored, and are managed by a shadowy party organisation called Bureau 39 .
But the caricature of an omniscient state guided by a leader sitting in central Pyongyang planning day-to-day how to manoeuvre 24 million people to commit criminal activity for his sole benefit misses the point.
The US government and international media reports derive from a small number of US government publications that are in turn largely founded on allegations from defectors and unnamed US officials .
The major source in the public arena for alleged DPRK narcotics production and smuggling is an unverified list of incidents from a 1999Intelligence Section report by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency.
Such reports acknowledge the tentative nature of the evidence: data should be considered a far cry from anything that might be remotely considered as evidence in a US court of law, an official US report said on the DPRKs alleged drug trafficking.
Perhaps surprisingly, given the vehemence in the wests belief of North Korean state criminality, there have been only a few international court cases where North Korean nationals have been charged and found guilty of producing counterfeit goods or smuggling.
North Korean officials corruption would, however, be far from unique in having abused diplomatic immunity for profit. Its not uncommon for diplomats from poor and rich countries, including for example South Korea , to exploit postings abroad to enhance income.
It's not uncommon for diplomats from poor and rich countries to exploit postings abroad to enhance income
The question as to the level of state involvement in such activity is again more of an open question.
At least since the onset of marketisation in the 1990s, there is evidence of DPRK citizens engaging in licit and illicit activity as a means to survive and prosper, but this is because the central state could not provide or deliver economically  and in spite of the states efforts to control such activity.
Thus the cartoon picture of the country obscures important changes in North Korean society, and handicaps our understanding of their political consequences.

North Korea accused of upping 'material support' for terrorism
A new report urges Washington to consider placing Pyongyang back on list of state sponsors of terror after arms deals and cyber attacks

Share on WhatsApp
North Korea has increased its material support for terrorist organisations and should be placed back on the United States list of nations that are state sponsors of terrorism, a report released on Monday said .
The Pyongyang regime, at the time under the command of Kim Jong-il, was taken off the list in 2008 under President George W Bush, who hoped to engage the reclusive nation in dialogue.
But according to a new report, written by North Korea expert Joshua Stanton for the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK), US standards for defining a state sponsor of terror are vague and inconsistent.
North Koreas recent conduct poses a particular threat to human rights activists and dissidents in exile
Titled Arsenal of Terror, the report recommends that the US Congress and State Department clarify the legal standards that define state sponsorship of terrorism and consider re-listing North Korea as a sponsor.
Since 2008, North Korea has increased its use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy, and also appears to have increased its material support for designated terrorist organisations, HRNK Executive Director Greg Scarlatoiu said.
North Koreas recent conduct poses a particular threat to human rights activists and dissidents in exile. It has also repeatedly threatened the civilian population of South Korea and other nations, including the United States, he added.
The US currently lists Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba as state sponsors of terrorism, though it is expected to remove Cuba as part of a historic rapprochement with the communist island.
The report details several instances of North Koreas alleged support of terrorism.
In 2009, just one year after it was removed from the blacklist, there were several interceptions of North Korean shipments to Iran and its terrorist clients [that] evidenced the importance of North Koreas role as a supplier of arms to terrorists backed by Iran, the report states.
News reports have alleged that these arms were destined for Irans terrorist clients, including Hezbollah and Hamas, Stanton writes in the report.
Stanton also details several cyber attacks that have been blamed on North Korea, including last years hack of Sony Pictures .
Washington accuses Pyongyang of being behind the breach that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused Sony executives to halt the debut of the film satirising the DPRK, The Interview .
The report describes several other suspected North Korea cyber attacks, including 35 that took place in 2009 against US and South Korean government and commercial websites.

The lease on my old 55-square-meter apartment in Tehran is up, and that means another long, arduous search for a new place. My landlords excuse for driving me out this time was that his daughter, who is coming back to Tehran from Canada in May, needs a place of her own. As the Persian New Year begins, I begin my search for a better place than the one Ive just been kicked out of: a ground floor unit in a 40-year-old, three story, 11-unit building on Daman Afshardar Street near Vanak Square.
In Iran , like many other big cities, people generally rent apartments by paying both a monthly rent as well as a security deposit. Some landlords prefer to get most if not all of the money up front. In Tehran, for every 30,000 tomans of monthly rent, a 1 million toman - or 10 million rials - security deposit is generally required [$300 US]. Renting without a security deposit is virtually unheard of. The monthly rent on my quiet apartment on Daman Afshardar Street was 1.95 million tomans, for which I had paid a 15 million security deposit. Im now willing to pay up to 2.4 million a month for a bigger place (70 square meters at least). I have also managed to save up an additional 15 million tomans over a one-year period to double the size of the security deposit I can afford to put down for something in an acceptable neighborhood.
Neighborhood is key.
In Tehran there is a widely held belief that substantive differences exist between those who live in the north and south. Many see this issue as a historical one. When Iran was modernizing in the early to mid-20th century under Reza Shah Pahlavi, the aristocracy and the moneyed classes largely moved to the northern parts of town, whereas the poor and working classes (and many traditional ones) stayed put in south Tehran. Valiasr Street , the longest north-south street in Tehran, serves as the most frequent point of reference when asking where in Tehran a new acquaintance lives. A lot hangs on the answer, too, and it can even have implications among friends and loved ones. Tehranis derive a sense of respectability from being able to provide the right answer to this question, to strangers at parties, whose smiles grow wider and wider depending on how far north an address is located. Even at work, the question is not uncommon, and people use it as a standard to judge others and rely on it as an indicator of how they can expect to be treated.

My adventure to secure a new home began just two days after Iranian and western negotiators hammered out a framework agreement over Irans nuclear program. Unfortunately, however, the news that brought Tehranis out into the streets in celebration didnt have the intended effect on the housing market, and rents in Tehran shot up. While Ive never had a great deal of patience for socialists rambling on about living in a classless society, Ive also never entertained fantasies about living on Elahieh Street, Zafaranieh, Aghdasieh, Farmanieh, or any of the other more glamorous spots in north Tehran. For me, a car, occasional trips, decent clothes, and cologne are much higher priorities than a trendy location. But the problem is that Tehran has a way of convincing you that location really is everything, and it leads many to allocate ever-larger portions of their monthly income to rent.
Even though we dont even live together, my girlfriend has also played a role in my present predicament. She occasionally complained about my place, saying that if it were up to her, she would never have guests over. So in hopes of securing a bigger, newer place - maybe one near Vanak Square - Im prepared to pay around 90,000 extra tomans per month.
Im looking to score a place on Molla Sadra, Gandhi , Vozara, Mirza-ye Shirazi, Karim Khan, Argentine , or somewhere near the beginning of Africa Street. Altogether there are three major pros to living on these streets: first, you have easy access to other areas of Tehran, the main squares, and the rapid bus and metro stops. Second, even though they dont have quite the prestige of streets like Mirdamad and Jordan, theyre still respectable areas that are mostly home to educated, middle-class people. Third, rents there are much lower than in some adjacent, more luxurious areas.
The most important source for information about available homes in Tehran is the classifieds section of Hamshahri, a newspaper owned by the Tehran city government and the newspaper with the highest circulation in the country. Apartment listings in Hamshahri are by size: there are categories for 50 square meters, 50-70 square meters, over 70 square meters, over 90 square meters, and over 100 square meters. I found only a few suitable apartments in the 50-70 category, and most of the listings advertised places far to the west, like Jannat Abad, or very far south, like Pirouzi. The only two or three in the areas I wanted asked for too much up front, plus a monthly rent, so they were out of the question.
Many of the ads dont even publish the prices in hopes that more people will call in to inquire. Contrary to what Id expected, most of the numbers I called didnt connect me to building owners, but to real estate rental agencies. Building owners hand over the job of renting out their apartments to these places, which publish the ads with the rents in Hamshahri in hopes of renting them out faster. Calling these agents on the phone can be a stressful and ultimately fruitless affair: at any moment, they can put a caller on hold and start chatting with someone else, only to forget the first caller altogether. And even if youre lucky enough to get through an entire conversation without being cut off, you still wont walk away with a great deal of information. For example, when you ask about the specifics of an apartment, an agent might respond, Well, I cant discuss that over the phone; youll need to come down and see the place for yourself. Here, write down our business address... They also seem too hurried to answer many basic questions that people might have about an apartment, such as the age of the building, the unit floor, elevator, parking, and storage space.
Tehrans 3.5 million vehicles are engaged in an unending search for a place to park. Even though people now park on Tehrans narrowest streets, and many other streets have been turned into free or paid parking zones by the municipality, finding parking near ones home is still a constant struggle. My old place didnt have parking, so I paid 100,000 tomans a month to the guard at the municipal parking lot to let me park across the street. For my new apartment, Ill need a place with secure parking, as Im not looking to add a stolen car to my list of potential troubles.

After a while, it starts to seem like calling the agencies is a waste of time and that simply showing up at their offices might be the best option. There are also numerous apartment hunting websites that promise more information on available apartments, such as Iran File, The Wall, and Home Bazaar, but even the phone numbers there often lead right back to one of the agencies.
Iran has two major types of real estate agencies: old-school and modern. The agencies operating the old fashioned way are generally 20-30 square meter operations run by people over 50 and featuring only one or two desks, and a handful of chairs arranged around the office. When you ask about the size and price of a home, they refer to thick tomes containing the desired information.
The modern offices are typically much bigger - 100 square meters of open space - and they inevitably have an attractive young lady greeting guests at the front door. After asking whether the potential client is looking to rent, buy, or sell, she directs them to a commensurately young, attractive and well-dressed man. There are generally around ten desks in such offices and as many real estate brokers. They adhere to the practice of introducing themselves by their first names and have clients fill out and sign a lengthy intake form. The form even has a place for level of education and occupation, and it asks customers preferences in terms of location and a variety of other factors, although desired rent and area are notably absent.
The first home I saw was just a little bit above Valiasr Square on Karim Khan Street. Even though I had specified that living in peace and quiet was of the utmost importance, the apartment is in an area just off one of the most congested and noisy parts of the city.
Relax, buddy! the agent reassured me when I asked why he bothered bringing me to such a noisy area. First of all, youre at the back of the building where there is less noise. Second, youve got double paned windows up there. And third...well, youll just get used to it!
Karim Khan Street is one of Tehrans commercial hubs, and the traffic there is so frenetic and unceasing that the area always finds itself the target of municipal traffic plans, meaning that only buses, taxis, and cars holding special traffic plan tickets can travel through the area. The street is also bursting at the seams with shops: the center of Irans gold exchange market calls it home, as do a number of large booksellers and confectioneries. One of the largest national pharmacies in the country, 13th of Aban, is also there. Many of Karim Khan Streets residents are middle class, educated, and frequently employed in offices or as teachers.

Upon opening the front door, we walked into an old, dirty hallway and took a minute-long elevator ride to the fifth floor. The house was 70 square meters and, at first glance, didnt inspire much confidence: the ceiling had numerous cracks, there was obviously no room for a washer and dryer, and the noise from the street filled the room, contrary to what the agent had just said downstairs. Whats more, the price was higher than similar places on Karim Khan: 2 million tomans monthly rent plus 30 million tomans up front. After seeing a few more places on Karim Khan and in nearby South Mofateh to no avail, I figured that the average rent in these areas had risen sharply since last year.
One apartment on the relatively well-to-do Mirdamad Street was so nice that I was all ready to sign the contract. Mirdamad has many of Irans biggest commercial buildings, meaning rents are pretty high. For example, a relatively new but otherwise average 65 square meter apartment on South Razan was going for 3 million tomans per month and 45 million tomans up front.
Still, I was able to find a quiet apartment on small Nesa Street just off Mirdamad, and the price wasnt half bad either: 2.5 million toman per month and 30 million up front. The six-story, thirty-unit building had a mostly granite front, a big parking garage, and two elevators. The interior of the apartment was equally pleasing. It had parquet floors and bright wallpaper that brought the whole place together, a chic, open kitchen, MDF cabinets, and an advanced ventilation system. It had one 20 square meter bedroom with an ideally situated window and a 35 square meter living room with sofas and a dining table with enough room for six people. The apartments main drawback was the 2.5 by 1 meter bathroom, which had a toilet and a shower smashed up next to each other.
The agent told me he would try to get a good discount from the owner, a middle-aged woman, and negotiate the contract to 2.2 million tomans per month and 30 million up front. He called the owner to arrange a meeting between us at the real estate agency and we planned to meet at 8pm in Vanak Square. This was the fourth straight day that I had been out apartment hunting from 8 in the morning to 9 at night. Id fallen behind in my work and my editors were giving me a hard time about deadlines, but I was nonetheless overjoyed to have found a place not only at a decent price, but in an area I knew I would really appreciate.
Just a few hours later my euphoria was shattered by a call from the real estate agent, who said that the owner wasnt answering her phone to confirm the 8pm appointment in Vanak. He told me to wait for his call. After 24 hours, the agent finally got a hold of the owner, who said she was extremely sorry but shed given the place to someone else. The news hit me like a sledgehammer. I shuddered at the thought that all of that schlepping around Tehran, suffering through the heat and breathing in all the exhaust, had been for naught. But there was nothing else to do; I had to go down the treacherous road once again. I ended up seeing between 10 and 15 more places in Molla Sadra, Yousef Abad, Vozara, Argentine, and Sanaei. Either the rents were astronomical or they were tolerable but the places were totally unsuitable.
Even when there were decent apartments with decent rents, I ran up against my one fatal problem: Im a bachelor. Landlords and single people in Iran have a historical enmity towards each other, and the former typically prefer to rent homes out to families or young couples. Their main reasoning is that single men and women are only going to throw wild parties and do nasty things there. To my chagrin and outrage, many landowners wouldnt even agree to show me the place in question upon learning that I was unmarried. Despite all of the love I have for my Iranian culture, its sometimes difficult to suppress the hate and frustration that bubbles up when Im reminded that being single is depriving me of finding a place to live.
The real estate agents assume almost no responsibility either; after all, their main job is pulling the wool over peoples eyes. You can now count me among the many Tehranis who have a negative view of these real estate agents. Some of the listings they sent made me wonder if theyd even bothered to look at my intake form. The supervisor at an agency on Shariati Street set up an appointment for me to check out a building on Farid Afshar in a pretty fancy area called Zafar. The rent was 2 million tomans per month with 10 million up front, and the apartment was 90 square meters. I arrived to see the place at 11am. It was old, had no private parking, and was on a dead end with very little room for parking on the street.
An attractive, well-dressed woman of about 50 opened the door for me. I could tell by the endless ceremonial hellos she was giving me that my bachelorhood would pose no problem for her. Contrary to what Id been expecting, the apartment was actually underground. I hate living in a basement apartment, and as we trudged down through what felt like a dusty, musty garage, I remembered exactly why that is.
Meanwhile, the woman did her best to try to rent the place out to me. I have only one condition for you if you rent the place: You have to have at least two parties a week, she said at one point with a hearty laugh. Otherwise, what good are you? I forced my own laugh, but my gut told me that she was preparing me for a real eyesore of an apartment. Even listening to my gut wasnt enough warning. When she opened the door, my heart sank. It had a big living room, but with the oldest and dirtiest walls I had probably seen since the Iran-Iraq war. The floors were an oily, muddy stone, and the cabinets in the kitchen were literally falling apart. Even at 11am, so little light made it into the apartment that the place looked like a dank cave. The adjacent bedroom was even filthier than the living room and so dark that I had to use the light from my mobile phone just to look around a little bit, and the toilet was full of broken tile. The scene reminded me of stuff Id imagined while reading Oliver Twist at a young age.
As I reeled from taking the place in, I heard the womans muffled voice from the other room. You can hang your whiskey glasses up here if you want, she said. Rent here and Ill give you a great discount because youre such a nice young man.
After hurriedly bidding her farewell, I called the agent who had referred me there and took out all of my anger and frustration from the past several days.
I told you I wanted a place with light and you sent me to a mausoleum! I yelled. The agent was about to start explaining when I hung up the phone. I was disappointed and hopeless and had nearly lost all my patience. I decided that I would have to rent a slightly more expensive home if I was going to be happy. I was willing to pay 3 million tomans a month for one of the decent apartments Id seen earlier. Sure, that amounted to about 80% of my monthly income, but my common sense had basically run out too.
As I walked farther and farther away from the apartment that had so sharply resembled the Dickensian soup kitchens, I turned toward Molla Sadra, near Vanak Square, a relatively calm area near the Kurdestan Freeway that has mostly new apartments. There a miracle occurred in the form of a 75 square meter apartment that fell right into my lap. It had white ceramic floors, beautiful wallpaper, a western toilet, a large living room and bedroom, plenty of light, parking, and storage.
The final stage in the process is signing the contract back at the rental agency, and the final moments leading up to it provide the best opportunity to get a last minute discount from the landlord. The landlord in my case was a retired high school teacher who bought the remodeled apartment in 1997 with a government loan.
Ive got a duty to help you out, she said upon hearing that I was a journalist. Ill be really flexible with you. Here, Ill even knock a million rials off your rent. Even when I ask for a bigger discount a moment later, she obliges me. When all is said and done, the year-long lease comes out to 30 million tomans up front and 2.2 million a month. I was even able to score a major victory in the form of a roughly 200,000 tomans a month discount.
In order to finalize the contract, I have to sign and date twelve checks, one for each month of the year, up front. The rental agent also gets the equivalent of the first months rent from both parties; in addition to that commission, I also have to deposit 1.1 million tomans into the account of the agencys owner. As I was thinking to myself what a sweet gig those real estate agents had - all that pay for so little work, after all - I overheard two of them speaking near the exit about a colleagues income.
You can bag twenty billion rials a month from that complex, one of them said. Even someone building high rises doesnt make that much money.

When Anna Sharogradskaya attempted to leave Russia to visit the US in June last year, customs officers confiscated her iPad, laptop and 11 memory sticks.
Sharogradskaya shrugged it off, assuming it was part of the normal pattern of suspicion and scrutiny she is subjected to as director of the Regional Press Institute in St Petersburg, an NGO that promotes an independent media in Russia.
When her iPad was returned, she got a nasty shock. Ipad is locked, said a message on the home screen. Try again in 23,420,874 minutes.
Thats 45 years, she said. Im already 74. What kind of a joke is that?

Its the kind of joke, low-level harassment, intrusion and pressure that leaders of Russian NGOs have been subjected to since Russia introduced a restrictive foreign agents law in 2012. The law requires NGOs that receive foreign funding, and conduct what the ministry of justice deems to be political activity, to register as foreign agents  a term that has strong connotations for Russians of cold war-era espionage.
Accepting the term means youre persecuted as a national traitor, said Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of the Golos Association, the only independent election watchdog in Russia, which was the first NGO added to the list of foreign agents in 2013.
Once labelled as foreign agents, organisations struggle to gain access to government officials and public institutions such as schools. Authorities are afraid to go to events run by foreign agents, said Melkonyants. They are obliged to mark all their publications with foreign agent and to begin each oral statement with a disclosure that it is being given by a foreign agent.
We are being punished, said Sharogradskya when she, Melkonyants and a group of Russian civil leaders met at the Guardian offices in London. Were being punished for providing a podium for people the government doesnt like, providing a floor for those who are blacklisted.
The laws, Melkonyants suggested, are a means of silencing the last independent voices in Russia through bureaucracy. Were not doing anything illegal, so its not simple to shut us down, he said.
Prosecutors come to offices and ask for documents [detailing the] activity of the organisation for the past three years. Different inspectors come at the same time and demand multiple copies. They all have different demands: one says Register as a foreign agent, one says Pay fines [in order] not to be registered as a foreign agent, the third says Pay taxes on donations.
If they fine you 40,000 you cant pay, so thats a reason to shut down the organisation and begin a criminal procedure against the head of the organisation.
The so-called foreign agent laws, which were introduced in 2012, originally required NGOs to voluntarily register as foreign agents. When they did not comply, the government responded with a wave of inspections in 2013, targeting more than 1,000 NGOs across the country. Many were fined for failing to register voluntarily and their leaders now face criminal prosecution for violating the law.
In March this year, Sharogradskaya paid a fine of 400,000 roubles (5,000) for refusing to register the Regional Press Institute as a foreign agent  the largest fine yet to be paid under the law.
There are currently 55 Russian NGOs that have been added to the foreign agent blacklist, including Citizens Watch, the Human Rights Resource Centre and the Committee Against Torture.

Six Russian organisations have been forced by the laws to shut down operations to avoid criminal prosecutions for repeatedly violating the law, including Side by Side  an LGBT film festival  and various branches of the Golos Association, run by Melkonyants.
The decision about what constitutes political activity from an NGO is at the discretion of the Russian government. The group tells of one organisation forced to register as a foreign agent because one of its offices had a book about Russian election results on a bookshelf, which the inspectors cited as evidence that it was involved in political activity.
Sergei Lukashevsky, director of the Sakharov Centre, which is named after the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and aims to continue his work of defending human rights, said the laws were an attempt to suffocate opposition.
The situation for independent NGOs is not a case of destruction or genocide but ghettos. You can receive foreign money, but if you do, you then talk with foreigners. You have no contact with any government bodies, he said.
The group reels off difficulties it has encountered since the laws were introduced: being shunned in social circles, participating in drawn-out court cases, struggling to recruit staff when the situation is so precarious. When asked if they believed the Russian government listened to their phone calls or read their emails, they shrugged  of course.
Melkonyants said he was certain his calls were listened to on three occasions, as plans he made only over the phone were known about by the authorities.
When asked why the Russian government would feel the need to crack down on their organisations so heavily when opposition in Russia was so anaemic, Melkonyants said: Just like an army always needs war, the authorities need an enemy to justifytheir existence. Its very convenient for them to talk about foreign agents. They need people who they can fight against.
Everyone in the group knows of people for whom the pressure has become too intense and who have left Russia, yet none of those who met the Guardian had plans to leave.
We are critical patriots, said Lukashevsky.
Sharogradskaya said: I love Russia, but I dont like whats happened to Russia. Ive had plenty of opportunity to leave the country, but decided I wanted to stay to do something. Its my home.

Kazakhstan election avoids question of Nazarbayev successor
The 74-year-old president is set to be reinstated by his loyal followers on Sunday, but the failure to consider a successor is making the outside world nervous

From nervous students to frail war veterans, state television anchors to professional sportspeople, one by one they climbed on to the stage to unleash breathless eulogies in honour of their leader.
The president of Kazakhstan since its independence in 1991, and officially known by the title Elbasy, Leader of the Nation, Nursultan Nazarbayev was informed in quivering tones that he was the teacher of all the Kazakhs, a historical giant, a philosopher-ruler, and the man whose heart was big enough to find space for all 8 million of the Kazakh women who loved him.
At Thursdays pomp-filled Assembly of the Peoples in Astana  a surreal, sparkling capital city Nazarbayev himself decreed should emerge from the wastelands of the Kazakh steppe over the past two decades  the 74-year-old smiled coyly with acknowledgement as the praise gushed forth. Sometimes he engaged in repartee with his admirers. At one point he joined in a duet with a young man who wanted to sing him a song, and he even offered a peck on the cheek to a young history teacher who told him he was an inspiration to every child in the country.

Elbasy can afford to relax as he goes into an election on Sunday in which the only question is just how overwhelming his majority will be. His popularity among large sections of the population of the resource-rich nation is compounded by strong authoritarian control and a ruthless clearing of the playing field of anyone with even mildly oppositionist inclinations.
Related: The most one-sided elections in recent history
But as Nazarbayev prepares to win yet another five-year term, the most pertinent question is the one that few in Kazakhstan dare to ask out loud: what comes after him?
Some years ago, foreign investors would mainly ask about tax issues and rule of law, said Dosym Satpayev, who runs a risk advisory consultancy in the country. Now, they have only one main question: who is next?
Related: Kazakhstan's long term president to run in snap election  again
Nobody has an answer. Kazakh officials admit privately that the main reason for holding the election a year early was to give Nazarbayev a new mandate ahead of what could be more testing economic conditions. Kazakhstans economy is extremely vulnerable to falling oil prices and the weakened Russian rouble, and the recent economic downturn has come as a shock to a country where the windfall of the oil boom years has lined the pockets of the elite and led to modest but noticeable economic growth.
What officials are not willing to talk about is what comes next: nobody knows, and speculation could be dangerous. Nazarbayev has ruled Kazakhstan since before it even existed, transitioning from his post as local Communist party boss to become first president of the newly independent nation when the Soviet Union collapsed. It is hard to imagine what the country would look like without him.
Perhaps with the question in mind, in 2010 Nazarbayev ordered scientists to investigate the creation of an elixir that would prolong human life, presumably first and foremost his own. However, the researchers at Nazarbayev University who were given the task have come up with little, leaving Elbasy facing mortality like the rest of us. He appears in good health, but will be on the cusp of his ninth decade when this next term expires, and the vertically integrated system around him is postponing the question of what comes next rather than addressing it.
When Nazarbayev was named Elbasy in 2010, many thought it would be the moment for him to nominate a successor. By law, as Elbasy, he would still have had a veto over all decisions until his death, and would still hold the real power.
That was the logical time for him to name a successor; then whoever the new person was would have had time to build up some kind of legitimacy with the public, Satpayev said. Instead, it was business as usual. And there has been no indication during the current election campaign that Nazarbayev is preparing a successor.

Prospects of a dynastic succession involving one of Nazarbayevs three daughters have faded. Rakhat Aliyev, who was married to Nazarbayevs eldest daughter, Dariga, was once one of the most powerful people in the country but fell from grace when their marriage fell apart. He was sent away to be Kazakh ambassador to Austria, before having his diplomatic immunity lifted and an arrest warrant put out for him. He took his own life in an Austrian prison earlier this year, though his Austrian lawyer is convinced he was murdered.
There are no charismatic politicians with a public profile; all top officials are meant to fade into the background to allow Elbasy to shine.
In Times and Thoughts, one of 15 books supposedly authored by Nazarbayev, the president writes: Any leader, especially a successful one, needs criticism. But he is remarkably insulated from such. The two candidates opposing him on Sunday are unknowns and have made no campaign promises, the smattering of opposition media outlets that existed a few years ago have been shut down , and it is illegal to insult the president or his family.
He listens to all the toadying with such happiness in his face, said Kazakh political analyst Tolganay Umbelataliyeva. His circle knows what he wants and they give it to him. Hes isolated from any real information about the country.
Western leaders have preferred to turn a blind eye to the countrys democratic shortcomings and reap huge financial proceeds instead, servicing the countrys resource industry and its leaders ego. In 2006, Dick Cheney, the then US vice-president, made a famous speech in Lithuania attacking Russia for its lack of democracy, then flew to Kazakhstan and lavished praise upon the country.

Nazarbayev retained Tony Blair on a vague advisory contract which has seen little in the way of visible results in governance but was reportedly worth several million pounds to the former British prime ministers foundation. The British architect Norman Foster has built a number of buildings in Astana, including the pyramid where Thursdays assembly took place. More than 1,000 delegates of the body, which was officially responsible for asking Nazarbayev to call early elections and stand again, gathered inside the pyramids congress hall.
Another Foster building in the capital is the Nazarbayev Centre, which resembles a vast eye looking up at the sky. The officials in charge of the centre, which houses a suite of offices for the president, a museum dedicated to him, and his personal library, claim it is just like the libraries devoted to US presidents. But inside, it feels like nothing short of a shrine to a living deity.
The atrium contains a larger-than-life bronze statue of the leader perusing a map of Kazakhstan, while the upper floors display oil paintings, carpets and embroideries featuring his image. A small part of Nazarbayevs 20,000-book library is on display. The guides said it was hard to know if he had read them all, though the complete works of Marcel Proust, among many others, looked distinctly unthumbed. There are also copies of Nazarbayevs own books, and his personal archive, which is currently closed off.
Its hard to think of him as an ordinary person, but there are some documents which he has actually written on in his own hand, said Marian Abisheva, one of the centres directors. Take the plans for Astana for example, there are handwritten corrections, where the architects didnt understand how he wanted it built, and he was explaining it to them. Can you imagine? What a man!
Even many of the presidents critics grudgingly concede he is a canny leader who skilfully negotiated the difficult first years of Kazakh independence, voluntarily renouncing the countrys nuclear arsenal and avoiding inter-ethnic strife. He has also played a delicate geopolitical balancing act, maintaining good relations with the two behemoths on Kazakhstans borders, China and Russia, and also with the west.
But critics say the system may be more vulnerable than it looks. In 2011, Nazarbayevs security forces opened fire on protesters in the town of Zhanaozen, killing at least 14, suggesting the Kazakh model might not be as immune to violent upheaval as Nazarbayev had insisted.

There are a lot of things in common with Arab countries here: socially, economically and politically, said Rasul Zhumaly, an independent political analyst and former diplomat who headed Kazakhstans mission to Libya. Nobody in any of the Arab spring countries would have predicted those systems could collapse. Like here, there was powerful police and security services, and a leader who was respected. But these systems are much more fragile than we think.
At the event on Thursday, Nazarbayev said he had brought 20 years of stability, 20 years of collective work, during which time Kazakhstan had gone from a place where people stood in queues for hours to buy bread and milk, to a land of economic plenty.
People questioned on the streets in Almaty and Astana, the countrys business and political capitals, expressed almost unanimous support for Nazarbayev. Most said they were emotionally attached to their leader and could not imagine life without him.
Of course, youve hit on the most difficult question. If only he could live forever, or at least for another 20 years, said a 52-year-old shopkeeper when asked who might follow Nazarbayev. Without him we will be a ship without a captain.
Without Nazarbayevs legitimacy, the next president might need to use widespread repression, religious or nationalist ideology to back up his rule.
Absolutely any scenario is possible, its impossible to predict, said Aidos Sarym, an analyst who briefly worked in the presidential administration. He said, however, that the longer Nazarbayev goes on without a clear plan of succession in place, the more nervous foreign investors will get and the higher the chance of instability.
Concluding his speech on Thursday, Nazarbayev said Fosters pyramid represented a striving upwards, with good energy from the heavens being pulled into the land around it. Sarym, however, invoked a different kind of pyramid.
The current system resembles an upside-down pyramid with the president at the bottom and everything else growing upwards on top of him. If you pulled out the president, it could all collapse, he said.

Like millions of Armenians, Movses Haneshyan will mark the centenary of the 1915 genocide today. He will visit the village cemetery near Vagharshapat, where he will say a prayer for all of those killed in the tragedy  and for his wife who died earlier this month.
But unlike others attending solemn ceremonies around the world, the 105-year-old has first-hand memories of the events 100 years ago in which he lost his mother and most of his family.
Haneshyan was a five-year-old boy when soldiers entered his village as part of a campaign to eradicate Armenians from Anatolia in present-day eastern Turkey . He still has vivid memories of that day.
Soldiers came and gathered us in the village, pushing their rifles against us, he said. My mother was visiting a neighbouring town - we never found out what happened to her.

I was with my father, holding his hand. Half the road was covered with dead people.
Up to a million and a half Armenians died during the mass deportations into the Syrian desert. Haneshyan and his father, Ibrahim, might have shared that fate had their march not passed through the town of a wealthy Arab man his father had once worked for.
He saw us and he bribed the soldiers to free my father and me. He put us on his horse and took us to his house, a big house with a garden full of animals, Haneshyan said.
The pair hid in the house for three years, terrified of being discovered. His father worked as a servant for the family while Haneshyan spent his time playing with the rabbits and chickens. Only when France occupied Hatay in 1918 were they able to return to their village.
After the province was returned to Turkish rule in 1938, Haneshyan moved to Lebanon, then Armenia , where he worked as a grape farmer and factory worker in a village close to the historic capital of Vagharshapat.
With six children, 20 grandchildren, and more great-grandchildren than he can remember, he lives surrounded by family. But the death of his wife Iskuhi, at the age of 99, has left a massive hole.
We spent 80 years together. She always looked after me. After her death, there is nothing left here for me, he said, nodding at a portrait of his wife opposite his bed. Now I will wait for recognition and then I will die.

By recognition, Haneshyan is referring to the ongoing controversy over Turkeys failure to acknowledge the Ottoman-orchestrated massacres and deportations of Armenians as genocide. The ongoing debate has threatened to overshadow the commemorations, but for Haneshyan, demanding recognition is what the centenary is all about.
Turkey has to recognise it so it never happens again. If they do not recognise the genocide, they leave open the door for another one, he said.
If you had seen it with your own eyes, if you had heard the noises on the way to Deir Ezzor [the site of concentration camps in Syria], you would know its all very simple: thousands were killed. You cannot deny that.
Haneshyans bedroom is decorated with a large poster of his village Kebussieh near Musa Dagh, where he lived before being deported in the summer of 1915. Despite his age he still tends to his garden, trying to grow a tree from seeds he brought from his childhood home. Even now, though, he says he is afraid to return to the village.
I should be happy to see my place of birth again. Just for one day. But how? If I go back, they will kill me, he said.

Letter from an Ethiopian prison

Dear John Kerry ,
I first came to know about you back in 2004, during the US presidential election, when you were running for office against George Bush. At just 17 years old I knew little about US politics  or politics in general  but I discussed the campaigns with my schoolmates.
A year later, the historic 2005 Ethiopian national election took place. This election differed from previous votes in that the lead up to it was mostly democratic. This left many Ethiopians hoping they would witness the first elected change of government in the countrys history. But it was not to be.

After the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front realised they couldnt win the election without rigging the vote, the true face of the regime emerged.
After polling day, we saw civilian bloodshed , and the arrest of thousands  including journalists and opposition leaders.
I was only young then, but the election gave me my first real experience of politics. It also left me with a strong desire to follow the repressive situation that was unfolding in Ethiopia .
It was this interest and commitment that led my friends and I to form the bloggers and pro-democracy activist group we called Zone 9.
The birth of Zone 9
All nine members of the blogging group are young and passionate about encouraging Ethiopias democracy.
We aimed to create a platform for Ethiopian youth to discuss political, economic and social issues when we launched our blog, with the motto, we blog because we care.
Although our arrest came two years after launching, our site was blocked in Ethiopia early on, but we continued to share our views via social media.
Finally, the regime took drastic measures: in April 2014 they arrested six members of Zone9 , and three other journalists too.
We are now facing between eight and 18 years imprisonment.
This hasnt come as a surprise. Whenever Ethiopians exercise their constitutional rights to free expression, the regime resorts to its security apparatus to silence them.
My charges are tied up with our meeting back in 2013. We met in Addis Ababa University: the minister of foreign affairs Tedros Adhanom invited me and a couple of others for a discussion, in which I raised my concerns about the regimes tactics to push young citizens away from participating in politics.
I highlighted the negative impact this was having on the political sphere. I told you that I was risking a lot merely by expressing my thoughts freely. At that time, my arrest was only an abstract possibility.

The conditions
The regime continues to silence any form of dissent using the strict anti-terrorism proclamation.
Since the 2005 Ethiopian election the government have prosecuted more than 200 people  journalists, dissidents and activists  and has shut down many weekly magazines and newspapers, sending most journalists into exile.
In the last eight months alone 17 journalists have been forced to flee the country.
This has made it nearly impossible for citizens to exercise their constitutional rights.
It is quite common for the federal police and the national intelligence and security service (Niss) to use force to solicit confessions from suspects. My friends and I fell victim to this type of mistreatment at the police crime investigation sector, commonly known as Maekelawi .
The abuses they are reported to have committed there include beatings with electric wire, forcing heavy physical exercise, lengthy interrogations with no rest, and keeping people in solitary confinement until suspects agree to incriminate themselves, or others. The mistreatment is more extreme under Niss.
My fellow bloggers and I spent the first 85 days of our arrest at the police station. We were given a 20-minute toilet break twice a day. In case of emergency, we found an understanding officer, or a bucket.
The rooms were crowded, filled with suspects from all over the country. We slept and ate in the little space available.
The suffocation was sometimes unbearable.

Halt the millions
The investigation has so far been a farce.
I have been, for instance, repeatedly asked what kind of relationship I had with you, and why I was invited to ask a question on the BBCs Hardtalk program , hosted by Zeinab Bedawi, when it was filmed in Addis Ababa in May 2013 to mark the 50th anniversary of the African Union.
But to be honest, the amount of time I will be spending in prison is not the most pressing issue on my mind right now. Rather, I am worried about what will happen unless the international community, and specifically your government, assumes a firm stance on Ethiopia, demands progress with democratisation, and halts the millions of dollars pouring the regimes way.
Having said this, I want to assure you that I understand the question of liberty and democracy in Ethiopia should be primarily answered by Ethiopians ourselves.
Ultimately, it is the willingness to suffer and sacrifice [for our cause], in the words of Nelson Mandela, that will determine our fate.
Your sincerely,

In 2012, nine Ethiopian men and women came together to create a blogging collective known as Zone 9 . In an autocratic country rife with political corruption and where state-run media is utterly dominant, this was a bold move.
Writing in both English and Amharic, the bloggers covered some of the countrys most pressing social and economic issues, giving life to stories all but absent from local media.
Zone 9 believed it was imperative to speak publicly about the national constitution, which claims to protect freedom of expression and the right of assembly, and which demands elections every five years. The bloggers thought that if citizens could hold their government accountable through a free press, the countrys civic fabric could become stronger. Citizens could have some say in how the country was run.
There is a discord between the Ethiopian public and government ... they never work for the communities which they claim representation of. They are just nominal representatives; in fact they are representatives of the ruling regime
Mahlet Fantahun , Zone 9 blogger, August 2012
A year ago today, the writers were taken from their homes and detained by police. After 11 weeks behind bars, they were charged under Ethiopias anti-terrorism laws .

Nothing new
Ethiopia currently ranks fourth on a list of the worlds most censored countries, according to a Committee to Protect Journalists report released this week .
In the run-up to elections in May, the report found that the government had filed lawsuits accusing six publications of encouraging terrorism, forcing 16 journalists to flee into exile, while the sole internet provider, Ethio Telecom, stand accused of routinely suspending critical news websites.
This is nothing new: over the last 24 years the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front has fine-tuned its social and political control, whilst simultaneously being credited by western governments for transforming the once poverty-stricken country into a rising, dynamic and stable one.
They werent the first. A series of Ethiopias successive and diametrically opposed regimes  from the military regime under Mengistu Haile Mariam (ousted in 1991) and the imperial rule under Haile Selassie before him  have had one thing in common: all have jailed and killed opposition activists, journalists and dissidents.
The Zone 9 name is in part inspired by this history. Kality, a prison on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, is divided into eight different zones, and its the last which has gained infamy  zone eight  home to journalists, human rights activists and dissidents.
Endalk Chala, one of the three Zone 9ers who remains free today, said that when the group formed we decided to create a blog for the proverbial prison in which all Ethiopians live: this is Zone 9.
The Ethiopian government accuses the bloggers of attempting to overthrow, modify or suspend the Federal or State Constitution; by violence, threats, or conspiracy.
The bloggers are expected to face trial later this year. If convicted, all of them face a minimum of eight years in prison.

Ethiopia is the beneficiary of significant flows of foreign military and humanitarian aid, largely intended to bolster and maintain the country as a security stronghold in the Horn of Africa, where levels of ethnic tension, corruption and crime are high.
With a genuine terror threat emanating from neighbouring Somalia, the government has developed sweeping anti-terrorism laws with the blessing of the international governments. But these laws are frequently used to suppress any hint of dissent within its own population.
From late 2005 until 2012 there were no major public demonstrations from the political opposition. There was also little critique: Ethiopia does not have a single independent daily newspaper , only a handful of state-sanctioned FM radio stations, and one government television station.
After the 2005 national elections, the regime banned opposition groups and labour unions, including religious groups, and imposed state control over their websites.
After the following 2010 election, where the government claimed to have won 99.9% of seats in parliament, the regime took control of all of the countrys major institutions including the courts, the media, mosques, churches, schools and universities. By 2012, the internet became the sole option for public communications and discourse.

Freedom of expression is considered immoral
In 2013 amidst a climate of mounting intimidation and surveillance the Zone 9ers let their blog go quiet for six months.
They were unnerved by the treatment of award-winning journalists such as Eskinder Nega , Reeyot Alemu and Wubeshet Taye who had been, along with nine others, sentenced to between eight and 18 years in prison.
All had written columns criticising the anti-terrorism laws, the very same legislation they were later charged with violating.
But in 2014 the bloggers decided they could not remain quiet any longer. They published a letter explaining their silence.
Last time we published a piece on our collective blog was about six months ago, they wrote. We know that Ethiopia is a country where freedom of expression is effectively repressed ... Our rulers consider freedom of expression as something immoral.
When we became quiet, we thought we would be at least forgotten. But they werent.
I am worried about what will happen unless the international community assumes a firm stance on Ethiopia
Natnael Feleke, Zone 9 blogger
On 25 April, just a week after posting the letter on Facebook, six members of the blogging team and three journalists apparently affiliated with them were arrested.
One year on they still await trial. The charge sheet accuses the bloggers of having received training in communication encryption in Security-in-a-Box  a digital security toolkit to help human rights groups protect themselves from surveillance, which is widely available online.
It also highlights their efforts in organising social media campaigns to engage more Ethiopians in conversations about human rights and national law.
In a letter about his experiences in prison and his hopes for the future, imprisoned blogger Natnael Feleke recently wrote: To be honest, how much time I will be spending in prison is not the most pressing issue on my mind right now. Rather, I am worried about what will happen unless the international community assumes a firm stance on Ethiopia, demands progress with democratisation, and halts the millions of dollars pouring the regimes way.
But ultimately, Feleke writes, it is the willingness to suffer and sacrifice [for our cause], in the words of Nelson Mandela, that will determine our fate.

        <title>May Day: workers of the world unite and take over – their factories</title>

A 19th-century slogan is getting a 21st-century makeover. The workers of the world really are uniting. At least, some of them are.
The economic meltdown unleashed by the 2008 financial crisis hit southern Europe especially hard, sending manufacturing output plunging and unemployment soaring. Countless factories shut their gates. But some workers at perhaps as many as 500 sites across the continent  a majority in Spain, but also in France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey  have refused to accept the corporate kiss of death.

By negotiation, or sometimes by occupation, they have taken production into their own hands, embracing a movement that has thrived for several years in Argentina .
In France , an average of 30 mostly small companies a year, from phone repair firms to ice-cream makers, have become workers co-operatives since 2010. Coceta, a co-operative umbrella group in Spain, reckons that in 2013 alone some 75 Spanish companies were taken over by their former employees  roughly half the total in the whole of Europe.
A gathering in Marseille last year of representatives from worker-controlled factories drew more than 200 delegates from more than a dozen countries  including pioneers from Argentina, whose turn-of-the-century economic crash sparked a wave of fabricas recuperadas that today has left around 15,000 workers in charge at more than 300 workplaces. The fast-developing phenomenon is now a field of academic study; there are websites, such as workerscontrol.net and autogestion.coop , dedicated to it.
No two self-managed ventures launch in the same circumstances, and many face daunting obstacles: bureaucratic inertia and administrative red tape that can delay or even prevent production; legal opposition from former owners; a still-chilly economic climate; outdated machinery, or products no longer in demand. Lifelong union militants can find themselves, for the first time in their lives, making tough commercial decisions.
But many  for the time being at least  are making it work.
France: We decided to fight
Twenty minutes drive from the old port of Marseille, on a green and well-groomed industrial park outside the Provenal village of Gmenos, is Fralib, the largest tea factory in France.
Every year, 250-odd workers here turned six tonnes of carefully cured leaves into more than 2bn sachets of Lipton and Elphant brand flavoured and scented teas  lemon, mint, Earl Grey  and soothing herbal infusions: linden, camomile, verbena.
But in September 2010, having spent five years steadily shifting half the factorys production to Poland, its owner, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever, summarily announced it was closing the site.

It was  shocking, said Olivier Lerberquier, a CGT union convenor at the factory. Unilever France had just paid a huge dividend to shareholders. Fralib, this place, was profitable, even at half capacity. We decided to fight.
It has been, by any standards, a long battle, but it seems nearly over: next month, 57 ex-Fralib employees, now reformed into a self-managed workers co-op, will switch on their machines again, and a factory silent for half a decade will once more produce tea.
Standing four-square in the cavernous main production hall at Gmenos, as long-underemployed operators checked pristine machinery and freshly trained technicians tested new quality-control equipment, Leberquier said few in France would have bet on the factorys remaining workers getting this far.

In the end, though, the length of the fight  1,336 days, it was  almost helped us, he said. We got time to build solidarity, and a solid business plan. And even if, like our lawyer says, were now condemned to succeed, at least we know, for sure, that we have as good a chance as anyone.
The workers also got money. Unilever submitted four successive redundancy plans for the 182 people still employed at Fralib in 2010. All  including one proposal to relocate to Poland on an annual salary of 6,000  were thrown out by the employment tribunal in Marseille.
While more than half the workers, exhausted, eventually accepted a payoff, those who held out to the end were rewarded: first, the greater Marseille authority, keen to preserve jobs, agreed to buy the factory site from Unilever for 5m and pay a symbolic extra euro for the machinery. Then in June last year, the company agreed a remarkable 20m settlement to cover compensation for all unpaid wages, retraining, market research, brand promotion  and 1.5m of startup capital for the new business.
I wont lie  it was hard, said Xavier Imbernou, a machine operator retraining in quality control and food safety. We went months without pay; dug deep into our savings. Whole families suffered. But we had such support, from around the country. Our struggle became symbolic.
Marie Sasso, who has been filling little sachets with Elphant tea  the brand was first made near Marseille St Charles station in 1896  since she was 17, said she never expected to find herself without a job at 55, and never for a moment considered not fighting for it.
She said she was counting the days till the machines restart. All this time weve been maintaining them, running them once a month to see theyre working. This time, when they start, itll be for us. No bosses. Thats what kept us going.
The Socit Cooprative et Participative Ths et Infusions, or SCOP-TI, as the new venture is known, failed in two of its early objectives: Unilever rejected its suggestion that the factory continue to supply it with bulk tea on contract, and it refused to surrender the Elphant brand.
We had to rethink, radically, said Leberquier. The co-ops new plan has it processing 350 tonnes of tea and infusions this year and 500-600 tonnes by 2017: enough to pay its members a fair wage. It is negotiating contracts with French supermarkets to supply fairtrade teas under their own labels, but is also developing a more upmarket own-brand range. These are premium, organic, local or regional products, said Leberquier.
The south of France used to produce 400 tonnes of linden a year; now it mostly comes from Latin America and the harvest here is barely 15 tonnes a year. Weve already signed deals that will bring Provenal orchards back to life.
The former Fralib workers road to self-management has involved almost everyone learning something new. You have to realise: we did production, said Gerard Cazorla, 57, along with Leberquier a leading light in the struggle, and recently elected president of the co-op. Purchasing, transport, marketing, sales, distribution  all of that was Unilevers responsibility. Roles have been decided democratically, and actually quite naturally, he said, through a horizontal structure of frequent general assemblies and an elected (and instantly dismissable) 11-person managing board.

Some debates  salaries all equal or reflecting professional expertise?  have been tougher than others, Cazorla conceded. And the more militant members of the new co-operative  among them, he would be the first to admit, himself  have had to adjust to some uncomfortable realities.
There was disquiet, for example, at the necessity of working directly with Frances famously ruthless big supermarket chains, and soul-searching at the prospect of a self-employed sales team working essentially on commission. We have to be pragmatic, Cazorla said. Sometimes I have to take my union cap off. We have a big factory to run and 60 salaries to pay. Were not going to change society. Theres still going to be capitalism. But we try to do what were doing as best we can, and according to our values.

Spain: This was new for us
In a small green space tucked between tall apartment buildings, two teenage girls giggle self-consciously as they begin singing softly into their microphones. A crowd forms around them, clapping along as the videographer calls out instructions.
This hastily formed band is recording a video tribute to their citys music school, which for five years has offered drum, piano and band lessons, among others, to around 800 students in Matar, a small city 20 miles from Barcelona.
Most music schools wouldnt elicit a tribute, but Matar is different. In 2012, the school was on the brink of closure, a victim of changing political priorities and cutbacks driven by Spains economic crisis. As the schools 40 teachers prepared for imminent unemployment, the students and their families took to the streets to demand that local authorities kept the school open. Finally a compromise was reached: the school would continue but its management would be privatised.
With little to lose, the schools teachers decided to bid for the contract. We just threw it together, said piano teacher Aradia Snchez de la Blanca. The motivation was so pressing and the rage over everything we had been through was so intense that we started going down this path without thinking too much about the next steps.
From this kneejerk reaction Musicop was born, a co-operative that marries together music education and co-operative values.

All together now: a Musicop public performance. Photograph: Facebook
Their elation at winning the tender soon gave way to panic. We went from basically being teachers to being members in a co-op, said Snchez de la Blanca. All of a sudden we had to think about how we were going to organise ourselves, manage our finances - this was new for most of us.
Most members had no idea what it meant to be in a co-op, said teacher Montse Anguera Gisbert. The first year involved a lot of swearing, she said laughing. The co-operative is now in its third year and despite the steep learning curve and the countrys economic crisis, it is growing. Today the co-op offers classes to nearly 2,000 students in seven municipalities, bringing music education to students who range from 36 months old to octogenarians.
The backbone of their growing enterprise is their monthly assemblies, where everything from management to expansion opportunities is on the table. To meet their obligation, Musicop has taken on another 40 or so part-time workers. Once there is enough fulltime work for these workers, the hope is that they can become members of the co-operative.
As Musicops members grapple with the challenges of self-management, they have relied extensively on the resources around them. About a year ago, Musicop set up offices in Can Fugarolas, a repurposed car dealership and repair shop that now serves as headquarters for several other co-ops dealing in everything from solar energy to consumer goods  along with other community groups.
The city of Matar boasts a rich history of co-operatives, said Ignasi Gmez, president of Musicop. The first co-operative launched here in the late 1800s, he said, citing a co-op dedicated to construction launched in 1887. Co-operatives are part of the local culture on many levels.
Spain today is home to some 18,000 co-operatives, a vibrant movement whose international face has often been that of Mondragon, one of the worlds biggest workers co-operatives. Founded by local priests in the Basque country in the 1950s, Mondragon today employs nearly 75,000 people and racked up global sales of more than 11.6bn in 2013.
Mondragon offers inspiration on whats possible, said Paloma Arroyo, of Coceta, a group that represents co-operatives in Spain. In 2013 alone, she said, some 75 companies across Spain were turned into co-operatives by their workers, out of 150 companies across Europe.
On a Friday afternoon, Musicops teachers were spread out across Matar, offering classes in four places.
In a quiet primary school, pianos had been crammed into a small room where three girls were learning to play the theme song from Frozen. Elsewhere, another teacher had his hands full with eight pre-schoolerslearning the basics of rhythm in a class called Music and Movement. In an abandoned school that hosts many of Musicops classes in Matar, more than a dozen pre-teens sang and waved their hands in the air as they wandered around a room singing along to Vivaldi.
For 16-year-old Aida Garcia, the classes offer a window into a world she would have never known otherwise. I love being in these classes, she said, adding that her dream was to play clarinet in an orchestra.
Propelled by the enthusiasm of their students, Musicops members have pushed forward, even though salaries dropped by 30% initially. They have begun climbing back up, and are now about 12% shy of what they were before, said Gmez. The salaries we make are respectable, but not ideal, he added.
Even so, few members hesitate when asked if it was worth it. Were better off today, because were empowered, said Gmez.

Greece: This is about equality
Marius Kostopoulos was painstakingly dripping lemon essential oil into the 300-odd plastic bottles that he and his three colleagues had spent the past hour or so filling with all-purpose liquid household cleaner. This was not the job he was taken on to do in 2004 at Viome, a once highly profitable manufacturer of building supplies  ceramic tile adhesives and grouts, to be precise  on the industrial outskirts of Thessaloniki, Greeces second city.

But Viome no longer really exists. Faced with the near-total collapse of the Greek construction industry, a consequent 40% slump in sales and a 30% increase in energy costs, its parent company, Philkeram-Johnson  majority owned by the local Philippou family went spectacularly bust four years ago.
Kostopoulos and his 45 fellow production workers were already working shorter hours. In May 2011, their pay cheques stopped coming (although they have never officially been made redundant, meaning they are deprived of even minimal Greek jobless benefits). Then in September that year, Philkeram-Johnson simply abandoned the site. So Kostopoulos and 20 of his colleagues are occupying its echoing, increasingly rundown machine halls and warehousing and  for the time being, at least  making a bit of money.
It certainly isnt enough to survive on, said Kostopoulos, whose wife, a daycare worker, is now at home looking after their 16-month-old son. I need other work to get by, so I help out on evenings and weekends as a waiter at weddings, bar mitzvahs, that kind of thing. Other peoples festivities  But its up to half the 500 or 600 we live on each month. I couldnt do without it.
When Philkeram-Johnson left, the workers first thought was to prevent the machinery and stock being taken by the company. If that disappeared, they feared, there would be no chance of them ever seeing the 1.5m they were owed in backpay and compensation.

But what they really wanted, from the outset, was simply to keep working. No one wants to be unemployed, said Dimitris Koumatsioulis, 45, another ex-worker and founding co-operative member. In Greece in particular, here and now, we couldnt have another 45 workers unemployed, another 45 families deprived of an income.
At the very first of their general assemblies, a proposal to stay on in the factory and run it as a self-managed co-operative won 97% approval. A delegation of workers went to Athens for talks with the employment ministry; the Philippou family, majority owners of Philkeram-Johnson, made it clear they did not envisage restarting production on the site.
By mid-2012 the Viome workers had contacted solidarity networks in Greece and abroad, exploring the possibility of producing a range of environmentally friendly soaps, washing-up liquids, softeners and detergents. The products had to be cheap to make, using existing machinery and raw materials that were simple to source.
Local citizens associations and unions promised to distribute a proportion of the factorys output, followed by many of the dozens of small co-operative stores and markets then starting to spring up around Greece as the countrys formal economy spiralled downwards.
In February 2013, after a three-day solidarity event in Thessaloniki that included a benefit concert attended by more than 6,000 people, production at Viome restarted under the workers control, and in April last year a court recognised them as a legally constituted, not-for-profit social co-operative.

Viome products are now sold through charity and solidarity networks in Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. Its co-operative statutes, which emphasise the key principles of collective decision-making and ownership, refer to the ventures solidarity supporters: organisations and individuals who have pledged to purchase a percentage of the factorys output every year.
The co-operative has fought a series of court cases against Philkeram-Johnson and the Philippou family, who have repeatedly said they have no plans to use the factory themselves but now want to sell the land to pay off outstanding debts to banks, suppliers and employees.
Greeces new radical left government is considering legislation allowing workers to legally take over factories abandoned by their owners. But ultimately, said Koumatsioulis: We dont want to hide it: above and beyond our own jobs and our families futures, this is about equality, democracy, the whole employer-employee relationship.
If Viome eventually succeeded in its target of producing up to a tonne a day of soaps, detergents and cleaning fluids, said Kostopoulos, well be better off here  psychologically, politically, economically  than we ever were when we had bosses. Were working for each other. Thats the difference.

Argentina: At first it was rough
All his life Jos Pereyra had been a waiter. For 20 years he served tables at Los Chanchitos (The Little Piggies), an old-style parrila (grill) at a strategic corner in Buenos Aires, on the borderline between two of the most densely populated middle-class neighbourhoods of the city.
Specialising in finger-licking grilled pork and generous helpings of homemade pasta, and with a faithful clientele that had kept it in business for three decades, Pereyra expected Los Chanchitos to provide firm job security.

But two years ago Pereyra realised its proprietors, who owned four other restaurants, were heading for a crash. They owed rent on the building, they owed us back wages and had fallen behind on our social benefits payments, said Pereyra. I realised they were planning to close Los Chanchitos behind our backs.
In previous decades, there would have been little Pereyra could have done to save his own job and that of his 27 other co-workers. But after Argentinas cataclysmic economic collapse in 2001, when the country defaulted on its massive foreign debt and the government impounded all bank savings accounts, so many firms went into bankruptcy that workers were forced to find innovative solutions to save their jobs.
Faced with the closures, instead of folding their arms and going home, many workers took the decision to form co-operatives, said Andrs Quintana, spokesperson for CNCT, the National Confederation of Work Co-operatives.
Worker-managed firms existed before the crash. There are probably between 5,000 and 6,000 co-operatives in Argentina today, said Quintana. The largest growth has been in recent years. They provide jobs for more than 60,000 people.
For many, such as Pereyra, who worked the night shift at Los Chanchitos, forming a co-operative was a matter of survival.
I remember the date, 23 April 2013, I spent all afternoon wandering around trying to figure out what to do, Pereyra recalled. The owners were pulling out and we had to take a decision. That night I called together all the waiters and the rest of the staff and proposed forming a co-operative.
The restaurants employees kept the takings from that night and the next day, but when the meat and vegetable suppliers arrived, Pereyra took his first brave step. He informed the suppliers that the employees had taken over the restaurant and that daily deliveries would be paid in cash from then on.
The switch is not an easy one. Its a very difficult process for workers, said Quintana. Some are suddenly thrust from behind the counter to putting on a suit and going to work out a deal with the bank.
The first months were very rough, I was a traumatic wreck, confessed Pereyra, 50. But we had no other choice, our jobs were at stake. Many of us were over 45and would have had a hard time finding work again. For the first nine months I had to sleep at Los Chanchitos to get the business on its feet.
On a larger scale, the workers at the large Bernardi oil storage plant in the Dock Sud area of the port of Buenos Aires were forced to take the firm over after it went bankrupt as Argentinas economy imploded 14 years ago.

It was a typical case of a company that collapsed during the 2001 crisis, said Jos Sancha, of Decosur , the 30-member co-operative that now runs the formerly privately owned plant.
Decosur stores gas oil, petrol and fuel oil that is unloaded from tankers arriving at Buenos Aires in its 42 tanks with a combined capacity of 39,000 cubic metres.
The first years were very tough, Sancha recalled. Its an activity that requires meeting strict environmental norms, dealing with very diverse clients and securing the necessary concessions with the port authorities.
But once the switch had been completed, business blossomed for the new cooperative. We have now expanded to include an adjacent lot owned by another firm and we have even put in a pipe that connects us directly to the Dock Sud power plant, said Sancha. Decosur now pipes liquid fuel to the 775-megawatt plant that feeds electric energy to a large slice of Buenos Aires.
Umbrella groups such as CNCT have stepped in to smooth the bumpy transition. We provide training tools, we set up networks, many firms have fallen by the wayside, said Quintana.
The most complicated part for us was the legal settlement with the previous owners, said Pereyra, who continues waiting at tables despite his new business role.
A pleasant surprise that followed after the co-operative took over was the return of many clients lost as the quality of the food dropped when the previous owners stopped reinvesting in the restaurant.
If you stop paying your cook on time and you lower the quality of the meat, the client notices straight away. But when they saw that things started improving after we took over they started coming back.
Unlike a normal business, which must turn a profit for its owner, a co-operative run by its workers tends to provide better conditions for its employees.
We dont retire our older employees, we find other tasks for them, Pereyera said. One of us needed surgery which he couldnt afford, for example. So we got together between us and decided that the co-operative would cover the operation, because he had been working at the restaurant for 20 years. As a matter of fact, he just had the operation yesterday. A normal business maybe wouldnt have cared, but we did.

Turkey: We like coming to work now
At a first glance, the workshop appears to be a run-of-the-mill textile factory. Long lines of knitting and weaving machines dominate the hall, while boxes filled with garments and colourful spindles of yarn are piled up in corners.
But zgr Kazova is not like any other factory in Turkey: the four workers perched over their tables, sewing, ironing and supervising the whirring machinery, do not answer to any bosses.
Their struggle began in early 2013, when the owners of Kazova Textiles, mit and Mustafa Somuncu, put all 95 workers on leave after withholding their pay for several months, blaming poor business conditions. The workers were told they would receive all back-paylater, but upon their return they were informed by the company lawyer that everyone had been dismissed without compensation for unaccounted absence from work.
We were dumbstruck, said Aynur Aydemir who worked at Kazova Textiles for more than eight years. Up until then we had been working seven days a week, up to 10 hours a day. Business seemed to be thriving. It was hard to believe that the company was really too broke to pay us.
What was more, the owners dismantled all working machinery overnight and disappeared together with more than 100,000 finished jumpers and 40 tonnes of high-quality yarn, leaving the unpaid and now unemployed workers with knitting machines that were almost half a century old and did not work properly.

At the end of April, a handful of the former Kazova Textiles employees set up a tent in front of the old factory in order to prevent the owners taking the remaining valuables inside. Undeterred by what they said were threats and intimidation from the owners and the police, their reluctant struggle grew into a full-blown political movement.
At first we were timid, because we had never been involved in any political movement before, Serkan Gns, 42, explained. We were scared, but little by little our confidence grew when we saw how much support we had from bystanders during those demonstrations.
In the aftermath of Turkeys protests in the spring of 2013, the workers decided to occupy and reopen the factory. A court ruled that the machines should go to the workers in compensation for their lost wages, and Muzaffer Yigit, 43, who has worked for Kazova Textiles since 1990, set out to repair them. Using the yarn that the old owners had left behind, the first jumpers, branded Diren Kazova (Resist Kazova), were produced. In September, the group hosted its first public fashion show.
But discord led to a split, and four workers decided to found the co-operative Free Kazova. We found that it was not enough to just talk about workers rights and resistance in theory, Gns said. We wanted to come up with a sustainable model for fairer work, and be able to support ourselves.
The Free Kazova workers have reached out to other self-managed factories and co-operatives worldwide in order to share experiences and expertise. Their aim is to produce high-quality, affordable garments for everyone interested in supporting a labour model that presents an alternative to exploitative wage work, with customers being told exactly how the money paid for each jumper is used.
We dont want to work for a profit, just enough for all of us to get by, Aynur Aydemir said. We work six hours a day, and we like coming to work in the morning now, because we are our own bosses.
She added that zgr Kazova jumpers were now sold not only in Turkey , but in France, Italy and Poland. Its actually hard to keep up with demand, she laughed. It proves that we are on the right track, and that many people agree with us and what we are defending.

Despite complex ties to the motherland, expats living in Israel remain wary of Irans motivations

Few nations have watched the talks over Irans nuclear programme more closely than Israel, which views the Islamic republic as an existential threat. And within Israel , among those especially unsettled by the idea of a final agreement are Iranian Jews.
We are the Persians, Avi Hanassab, a cook in a Tel Aviv market where many Iranian Jews sell spices and dried fruit, said. We know how to negotiate.
Hanassab, like many Israeli Jews with Iranian roots, said he still feels a deep bond with Iran, which his parents left in 1964. Yet, like others in the community, he said he feels his knowledge of Iran gives him reason to be fearful as an Israeli.
They sent their best negotiators to negotiate with the States and Europe, he said. The Persians are very smart.
Hanassab is among about 140,000 Jews of Iranian descent in Israel, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics , a population that dwarfs the 30,000 or fewer Jews who remain in Iran. Iranian Jews are prominent in Israeli public life: Rita , one of the countrys most famous singers, was born in Iran, as was former Israeli president Moshe Katsav .
Israeli officials have denounced the preliminary agreement recently reached between world powers and Iran ; prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has called it a dream deal for Iran and a nightmare deal for the world. In interviews, some Iranian Jews echoed those sentiments, saying they felt that Iran couldnt be trusted to keep its end of the bargain.
Despite leading their lives in Israel, many families of Iranian origin speak Persian and celebrate Iranian holidays. While most cannot visit Iran anymore, they often keep in close contact with relatives who stayed behind with regular phone calls or, fearful of surveillance, by using messaging apps like WhatsApp or Facebook.
I dont know a single person that hasnt any relatives in Iran, Soli Shahva, a Iranian-born professor at Haifa University, said of Iranian Jews in Israel.
These ties dont endear the Iranian regime to Iranian Jews living in Israel, however, many of whom fled the country before the Islamic revolution in 1979 and remain deeply wary of the countrys religious authorities. In fact, many said that it is precisely their deep ties to Iran that allow them to see the situation clearly.
Shamshiri, the restaurant Hanassab runs with his mother in a dense Tel Aviv neighbourhood known as Levinsky Market , is praised by many Iranian Jews as the best Iranian eatery in the city. Over steaming bowls of soup and plates of Persian kebabs, the two explained why they had reservations about the prospect of a nuclear deal with Iran.
I am both excited and worried, said his mother, Molouk Hanassab.
Ari Hanassab, who was born in Israel, was more pessimistic.
What the Nazis have done, Iran are saying that they will do, he said, referring to the comments some Iranian leaders have made calling for the elimination of the Jewish state.
Analysts say such doubts are widespread. I think its safe to assume that they are sceptical, said Meir Javedanfar, an Israeli journalist and a professor of Iranian politics. Javedanfar, who was born in Iran, has criticised what he sees as an overreaction from Israeli politicians to the deal.

Many Iranian Jews came from conservative religious communities in Iran, Javedanfar said, and they often remain politically or religiously conservative in Israel. Those political leanings probably made them natural supporters of Netanyahus hard stance on Iran, said Meir Litvak of Tel Aviv Universitys Alliance Center for Iranian Studies .
Historically, most Iranian Jews have voted for the Likud in the past 30 years, so they are not likely to dispute Netanyahus position, Litvak said, referring to the prime ministers political party.
At Tel Avivs Levinsky Market on a recent day, opposition to a nuclear deal with Iran was not hard to come by.
We are a very small country. They are a very strong country, Aharon Davidi, who works as an accountant for many of the markets traders, said of Iran.
Some said they worried that even if Iran never develops a nuclear weapon, a deal that ends economic sanctions against the country would lead to other problems.
If they lift all the sanctions, the Iranian economy will bloom, said Baruch Davidi, Aharons brother. Then the money will go to Gaza and to Hezbollah, he said, referring to the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Hamas , and to Hezbollah . Both have attacked Israel, and both receive support from Iran.
Some were critical of the United States leading role in the negotiations.
The Americans dont understand this region, said Reuven Haimpir, a fabric cutter. Thats their main problem.
But amid all the opposition to the Iranian regime, no one seemed to fear the Iranian people themselves, the vast majority of whom are Shia Muslims.
I have family living in Iran now, said Izhak Makani, a shop worker whose parents left for Israel before he was born. They are friends with the Muslims. The Muslims over there, they like the Jewish. They dont hate them.
These mixed feelings are not unusual, Shahva said. Many Iranian Jews in Israel left the country before the Islamic revolution in 1979 and have fond memories of their homeland, he said.
Menashe Amir, a Persian-language radio host who moved to Israel in 1959, is one example. He has not been to Iran in decades, yet he said he loves both countries equally.
I was born in Iran, and Iran is like my mother, he said. I live in Israel, and I am a Jew. [Israel] is like my father. You cannot ask anybody if they like their father or mother more.
Some feel even stronger. I consider myself more Iranian than Israeli, Shahva said with a laugh. My Israeli friends dont like it when I say that.
In Shamshuri, where Avi Hanassab spends every day making Iranian meals for a largely Iranian clientele, the pull of the homeland wasnt quite the same.
Its not Israeli or Iranian, Ari said. I have a Jewish identity. No matter where I am, Im a Jew. That, he explained, was why he had to be worried about a nuclear deal.

A man died and as many as 15 other people were injured as clashes over a bid by the countrys president for a third term continued on Thursday in Burundis capital, Bujumbura.
It was reported that a soldier was shot dead and and a civilian injured in one incident. There were conflicting reports on who fired the shots, with some suggesting it was an intelligence officer.
At least six people have now been killed in clashes with the police, according to the Burundi Red Cross.
The unrest moved into its fifth day on Thursday, following the announcement that the incumbent Pierre Nkurunziza had been nominated by the ruling CNDD-FDD party on Saturday to stand in the presidential election in June.
Nkurunziza has been warned that his candidacy is unconstitutional, while a senior US diplomat said on Thursday that Burundi risked boiling over if it smothers political opposition.
Social media sites including Twitter and Facebook have been blocked by authorities, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
AFP said the soldier died and the civilian was hurt when an intelligence officer opened fire near a barricade erected by protesters. The agency cited a senior police officer speaking on condition of anonymity.
It quoted the source as saying that the officer was at a spot where the demonstrators had built a barricade. He felt threatened. He shot and hit a soldier who was killed. The source described the shooting as an unfortunate incident.
But the Reuters news agency reported that the identities of the gunmen, of which there were six, were unknown. It said they had been arrested by the army.
The countrys national university was closed on Thursday. Students could be seen heading home under police watch, according to AP.
UN rights experts warned that Burundi could lapse into fresh conflict following the presidents move to extend his mandate.
Opposition figures and rights groups say Nkurunzizas bid to stand for a third straight term goes against both the constitution and a peace deal that ended a civil war in 2006.
Over the past days, Burundi has suffered a wave of killings, arbitrary arrests, detention, the closure of media outlets and the targeting of human rights defenders, the experts said in a statement.
They said the ruling party openly condoned the violence, adding that an electoral process that lacks credibility - not to speak about one that triggers outright violence - is a huge setback for Burundi.
The UN experts said the gains made by Burundi over the past 15 years will be put in jeopardy if the authorities fail to take measures to prevent further violations.
They added: In a society which has witnessed cycles of recurring violence on a massive scale for close to 50 years, and in which victims have seen no redress for the violations suffered, no one can afford another conflict.
Washington also expressed its disappointment. Tom Malinowski, the US assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, arrived in Burundi on Wednesday to try to prevent unrest from escalating.
Protesters say Nkurunziza is violating the constitution and jeopardising a peace deal that has kept ethnic tensions in check since a civil war ended in 2005. The presidency says the protests are an insurrection.
Nkurunzizas supporters say he is eligible to run again, since his first term in office followed his election by parliament  not directly by the people as the constitution specifies.
After meeting Nkurunziza, Malinowski told reporters he had urged him to allow peaceful criticism and room for political opposition before the vote.
I left the president with the thought that this country with its very complicated and difficult history is like a boiling pot, and that if you try to put a lid on that pot it doesnt stop boiling. It risks boiling over, Malinowski said.
Nkurunziza told Malinowski that protests against him were illegal but that the opposition would not be restricted, according to presidential spokesman Gervais Abayeho.
According to Reuters, the president said political space would be respected and there is no restriction whatsoever to anybody who is engaged in political competition. Everyone has a role to play.

Up to 150 more women and children have been rescued from Boko Haram extremists in the remote Sambisa Forest, Nigerias military said  amid reports that some of the women fought their rescuers fiercely.
A community leader from the area of northeast Nigeria said on Thursday that a senior army officer who was at the scene described the women opening fire on shocked troops in the village of Nobita a week ago, with Boko Haram Islamist insurgents using the women to shield their main fighting force.
He said he was told that 12 women fighters and seven soldiers died in a fierce firefight. The community leader spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue and personal security risks.

The Nigerian military first reported rescuing almost 300 women and children in the Sambisa Forest on Tuesday after deploying ground troops into the forest.
The army spokesman, Colonel Sani Usman, told Associated Press on Thursday that more than 100 additional girls and 50 more women have also been rescued.
He said in a statement that several lives were lost, including that of a soldier and a woman, during shootouts in nine separate extremist camps in the forest.
He said eight women sustained gunshot wounds and four soldiers were seriously injured. It was not clear who shot the women.
All the women and children were being evacuated to a safety zone for further processing, Usman said.
It remains unclear if some of the women had willingly joined Boko Haram, or are family members of fighters.
Also killed were several Boko Haram field commanders and foot soldiers. Combat tanks and munitions of high calibre used by Boko Haram were also recovered, the army spokesman said.
The military was flying in medical and intelligence teams to evaluate the former captives, many of whom were severely traumatised.
It remained unclear if any of the schoolgirls kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok a year ago were among those rescued.
The plight of the pupils, known as the Chibok girls, aroused international outrage and a campaign for their release using the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.
Their kidnapping brought Boko Haram, whose name means western education is forbidden in the local Hausa language, to the worlds attention. Of the 276 Chibok girls kidnapped, 219 remain missing.
Nigerian military and counter-insurgency spokesmen said they believe some of the Chibok girls still are being held in the Sambisa Forest.
Some captives have reportedly become indoctrinated into believing the groups Islamic extremist ideology , while others established strong emotional attachments to militants they had been forced to marry.
The failure of Nigerias government and military to quickly rescue the girls brought international condemnation.
The military initially appeared incapable of curbing Boko Haram as the insurgents took control of a large swath of northeast Nigeria last year and declared it an Islamic caliphate.
That changed when the military received much-needed helicopter gunships and heavy arms and a multinational force launched an offensive at the end of January.
Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said on Thursday only the Sambisa Forest remains a refuge for the militants.
Jonathan, who will step down as president on 29 May, pledged to hand over a Nigeria completely free of terrorist strongholds, at a regional meeting of customs officials on Thursday.
He lost the countrys election on 28 March, in part because of the military failures and a perceived uncaring attitude to the plight of victims of Boko Haram.
Former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari will take over as president on 29 May.

        <title>Mary Jane Veloso: Why was she spared in the Indonesian executions?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/30/indonesian-executions-why-was-mary-jane-veloso-spared</Link>

As a mother of two boys and a migrant worker subjected to domestic abuse, convicted drug trafficker Filipina Mary Jane Veloso was the only figure scheduled to be executed this week who drew widespread sympathy from the Indonesian public.
She was the also was the only one to be spared, granted an 11th-hour temporary reprieve by the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, after a woman handed herself into police in Manila claiming to have recruited her.
The question remains: why on the basis of new evidence is Veloso still alive, while Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, whose lawyers presented evidence of judicial corruption, were shot dead? Eight people  seven foreign nationals and one Indonesian  were executed by firing squad on Indonesias Nusa Kambangan prison island on Wednesday.
Analysts say the outcome is a combination of factors  politics, shoddy diplomacy and the affinity many Indonesians feel with Veloso.
The Mary Jane Veloso narrative as a foreign worker being duped hits very close to home, said Indonesian political analyst Yohanes Sulaiman. So without considering her evidence is kind of, you know, similar to the plight of Indonesian workers in Saudi Arabia.
Every year there are horror stories about the mistreatment of Indonesian migrant workers ruthlessly beaten and tortured by their employees, some of who are on death row in Saudi Arabia for killing their employers in alleged self defence.

A high-school dropout and former domestic worker in Dubai, who left after an attempted rape, Veloso has consistently claimed she is a victim of human trafficking, duped into smuggling 2.6kg of heroin into Indonesia .
In a country that is virulently against drugs and where approval ratings for capital punishment are high, the Indonesian Twitterati came out in force to support a women they saw as one of their own in the days leading up to her scheduled execution.
The hashtag #MaryJane was among the highest trending topics, with messages lambasting the president not for battling drugs but executing poor women, like migrant workers in Saudi Arabia!!
Noting that governments have proven to be sensitive to hashtags and that Widodo seems to intuitively understand his voters, Paul Rowland, a Jakarta-based political analyst said the decision would have pandered to a domestic audience.
While the choice to grant the reprieve was a combination of factors, Rowland acknowledged that the public probably would have been in favour of the president taking a few extra steps.
Widodo did not have that much to lose when the Philippine president, Benino Aquino III, requested the execution be postponed after a woman claiming to have recruited Veloso unexpectedly turned herself in to Manila police.
The Indonesian president has stressed he has granted only a temporary reprieve while Philippine authorities investigate, but Velosos lawyers have vowed to continue their fight in the supreme court on the back of new evidence.
But most tragically for Chan and Sukumaran, the new evidence in their case  that judges were negotiating bribes for more lenient sentences  undermines the integrity of the Indonesian legal system in a way the new evidence in Velosos case does not.
Muhammad Rifan, a former lawyer for the Bali Nine duo, told the Sydney Morning Herald that judges had asked for $130,000 to give a sentence of 20 years or less.
After the judges were allegedly ordered by senior government and legal figures in Jakarta to hand down the death penalty, that deal reportedly fell though.
The explosive claims, at a time when the countrys anti-corruption body has suffered blow after blow under Widodos rule, might have opened up an ugly can of worms, said Sulaiman.

The accusation of bribery threatens the idea of a fair justice system and the government has already invested too much prestige on being tough on drugs, he said.
In a rush job, the judicial commission completed its investigation into the allegations earlier this week but did so without interviewing key witnesses or making its findings public.
It is illogical, said Todung Mulya Lubis, of the Bali Nine legal counsel, if the commission were to investigate then witnesses have to be questioned. Now they dont have the witnesses.
According to one researcher from Indonesia Corruption Watch, the judicial commission is generally viewed as quite clean, even though there are some notes on some of the commissioners.
Outside court, the lack of diplomatic prowess from the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, did not do Chan and Sukumaran any favours either.
Abbotts insensitive remarks about conditional aid after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami kickstarted a viral campaign to collect coins to pay Australia back.
In contrast, days before the executions Aquino met his Indonesian counterpart on the sidelines of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, where he gracefully managed to plant a seed of doubt about Velosos innocence.
President Aquino doesnt seem to be shirtfronting the Indonesian government in the same way Tony Abbott did, Rowland, referring to Abbotts aggressive comments about the Russian president Vladimir Putin , so it got a more sympathetic reaction.

Colombias supreme court has called for an investigation of former President lvaro Uribe for what it charged was his role organising a domestic spying ring that illegally intercepted the communications of his opponents.
The courts order came as magistrates sentenced two former Uribe aides to long prison terms for their roles in spying on journalists, politicians and even supreme court justices between 2007 and 2009.
Mara del Pilar Hurtado, the former head of Colombias intelligence agency , was sentenced to 14 years in prison while the former Uribe chief of staff Bernardo Moreno was given eight years.
The court said both officials acted with the consent of Uribe, who at the time was struggling to shake off a scandal stemming from support given to his administration by rightwing paramilitary groups. Justices said they would send copies of their findings to a congressional committee responsible for investigating former presidents so it could open an investigation.
The court also asked prosecutors to open investigations of against five other Uribe aides not previously linked to the case.
Uribe, now a senator, denies any knowledge of the spying ring and said he was saddened by the conviction of honorable officials whose only crime was defending Colombia from attacks by those he called leftist terrorists.
Hurtado and Moreno join a list of a half dozen top Uribe aides who have either been convicted or are under investigation for corruption and ethical breaches. Earlier in April, the former interior and social protection ministers were sentenced to more than six years in prison for bribing lawmakers to support Uribes 2006 re-election.
All the former aides claim their innocence and say they are victims of political persecution by President Juan Manuel Santos, who succeeded Uribe in 2010.
While the judicial noose has slowly been tightening on Uribe, he is not under immediate threat of being reprimanded.
Colombias congress has been sitting on dozens of accusations against the former president for years, and with Santoss efforts to reach a peace deal with leftist rebels running into trouble, support for the hawkish Uribe has been soaring.

French president's global image at stake over peacekeeping force rape claims
Franois Hollande wanted French troops to be seen as force for good in Africa but child rape allegations against soldiers are a devastating blow, claim observers

Allegations that French peacekeeping soldiers raped children in the Central African Republic (CAR) are potentially devastating for the French army and the president Franois Hollande.
The Socialist head of state has staked his foreign policy and presidential image on military intervention in Africa, from the anti-terrorist operation in Mali and the Sahel to safeguarding civilians in CAR. As one observer put it, Hollande has always glorified his peacekeepers role in Africa .
The serious abuse allegations hit even harder because of the baggage that France carries in Africa. Since the end of colonial rule, Paris has been accused of engaging in crooked powerplay, sweetened with briefcases of petrodollars in a shady system known as Franafrique. Hollande had sought to escape that, portraying his troops as a force for good in Africa, not for reasons of French influence but strictly as part of the UN and wider international operations.

The French army bears the weight of its history in Africa, including its failure to halt the 1994 Rwandan genocide and accusations of torture during the Algerian war of independence.
The French defence ministry is an institution that is very sensitive about its image, particularly about anything to do with intervention in Africa, said Thomas Hofnung , a French journalist and Africa specialist. For years, France was accused of running the Franafrique system and there is the legacy of Rwanda and of accusations of torture in Algeria, which traumatised and damaged the armys image. It is sensitive because every time France intervenes in Africa, its accused of neocolonialism.
The French defence ministry insisted there would be zero tolerance for any perpetrators of abuse. Informed of the CAR allegations last July, the ministry immediately told prosecutors who launched a criminal investigation. But some have questioned why the French army did not make that fact public last year.
The French public has traditionally had a good image of their vast army. But the details of the allegations against about 14 soldiers have sparked revulsion. The scandal comes at a time when soldiers have never been so present on the streets of France in peacetime  up to 10,000 stand guard outside certain schools, museums, synagogues and other public buildings across the country in the wake of the January terrorist attacks in Paris. Children on their way to school in certain Paris neighbourhoods now regularly pass soldiers in combat gear, patrolling with guns.
When the abuse allegations emerged, Hollande had just increased the military budget by 3.8bn (2.8bn) and said he would permanently have 7,000 French soldiers patrolling airports, stations and sensitive sites across France.
It couldnt have happened at a worse time, said Antoine Glaser , a French writer and specialist in African affairs. He said France had been trying to drum up involvement from other EU states and swiftly wrap up its CAR operations. This makes that harder. He said it also sparked echoes of France  lancienne  the old style image of a France all powerful in Africa.

A specialist investigation unit was set up last year as part of a government crackdown on sexual harassment and abuse inside the French army. Last month, the unit said it had dealt with 27 cases of sexual assault, 24 cases of sexual harassment and three cases of violence and physical threats towards a woman, as well as 41 cases of sexist bullying including discrimination, all within the army. Female soldiers under 30 were the typical victims, the unit said, and 90% of the victims were women.
French prosecutors have previously been quick to pursue people accused of child abuse abroad. In 2008, a 44-year-old French civilian UN mechanic accused of raping young girls while working for UN peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2001 and 2004 and the Central African Republic between 1998 and 2001 was sentenced in France to nine years in prison for two charges of rape of a minor.

The issues raised by guarantees of free speech are not simple, but I can think of no principle that is more important. The writers objecting to an award to Charlie Hebdo ( I admire Charlie Hebdos courage. But it does not deserve a PEN award , theguardian.com, 28 April) are undermining the whole idea. They note that they would support controversial expression but not reward it, and go further when suggesting that certain groups must be protected from what those groups take to be derogatory comments. To apply that idea universally would gag any kind of non-conforming expression and offer support for those extremists who, such as the killers in Paris, believe they are right to murder opponents or to issue fatwas against those who dont believe as they do. It would give the right of 7.5% of the population of France to determine what can be said to the remainder of the population. The contributors to Charlie Hebdo, unlike a good many western journalists, dared to publish in full knowledge of the dangers from theocratic zealots with no concept of individual freedom. Freedom of speech is too important to be circumscribed by conditions determined by individuals or groups to be critical of their own beliefs.

Modrydd, Brecon
 Thank you Nesrine Malik ( Its still right to honour Charlie Hebdo , 29 April) for taking to task those who say it was wrong to honour Charlie Hebdo. Hebdo was ill-advised and offensive in publishing its cartoons. It was also upholding the principle of freedom of expression. If people of supposedly progressive views cannot see that, they badly need to reset their moral compass. Are we allowed to say things offensive to racists, homophobes and misogynists, and if so why should a particular faith group have the privilege of not being insulted? It must warm the cockles of every jihadists heart.
David Harris
London
 The Charlie Hebdo staff who Nesrine Malik asserts have indeed published racist and sexist cartoons are not around to defend themselves from the allegation. Having published the allegation, the Guardian should at least refer readers to what will have to do as a rebuttal: shortly before he was murdered, Stphane Charbonnier wrote an impassioned denunciation of racism alongside an eloquent critique of blasphemy, the orchestrated campaign by a group of far-right Muslims against the Danish cartoons, and the de facto support they have received from vitriolic detractors of Charlie Hebdo .
Charb cannot argue back now, but those who read Maliks allegation should at least give him the respect of reading his Lettre aux escrocs de lislamophobie qui font le jeu des racistes  a translation of which is available at goo.gl/KDeA9Y
Peter McKenna

 PEN views ridiculing a disadvantaged minoritys deeply held religious beliefs as courageous. Nesrine Malik thinks it is irrelevant if the minority in the same country chooses to ridicule the majority, it will be of no consequence. Pleasetry it.

Hugh Muir ( Hideously diverse Britain: mixed-heritage Brits and the dangers ofcasual racism , G2, 27 April) points tothe expanding numbers of mixed heritage people in the UK.
Members of People in Harmony, ( www.pih.org.uk ), an organisation that has existed since 1972 to support mixed relationships and mixed race people, are acutely aware of the ways inwhich assumptions are made about peoples ethnicity and identity.
In cases where identities are imposed that are not appropriate, feelings of poor self-worth develop which are hardto cope with.
There is very little publicity or policy recognition of these issues, so it was good to read this column.

Ten years ago, an especially strong and destructive hurricane season brought Katrina to Louisiana in August, followed two months later by Wilma slamming into the Florida coast. And then, for the next 10 years, nothing: no major hurricanes have hit the United States since.
As the US approaches another hurricane season beginning on 1 June, it will also be approaching a historic milestone: there have been no category 3 or above hurricanes in nearly a decade, a stroke of luck that scientists say is truly out of the ordinary.
This current hurricane drought is the longest ever recorded since scientists began keeping track of hurricanes in 1851. The last record of eight years happened from 186168.
New research from Nasas Goddard Institute for Space Studies, published this week in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests the historic drought is probably just a coincidence.
We concluded its basically dumb luck, said co-author of the report and senior scientist at Nasas Goddard Institute Dr Timothy Hall. If [the drought] went on and on and on wed question our assumptions, but for now it seems to be luck.
There have been plenty of major storms and hurricanes since 2005, but all major hurricanes have missed the US and instead concentrated on other regions around the Atlantic Ocean. And there have been more minor storms that were nonetheless destructive within the US: Hurricane Sandy in 2012 (category 1), Hurricane Irene in 2011 (category 1) and Hurricane Ike in 2008 (category 2).
Most of the damage from those storms came from rain and subsequent flooding (partially exacerbated by sea-level rise and storm surge).
Hall said the lack of major wind damage from hurricanes in the last decade could have serious consequences if people are lulled into a sense of complacency about extreme weather.
Halls study, carried out with Kelly Hereid from ACE Tempest RE, a reinsurance firm, found that insurance rates were falling in hurricane-prone areas, and people were flocking to the coasts  meaning there could be more damage when a major hurricane eventually makes landfall.

For a small Caribbean island barely half the size of Connecticut, Puerto Rico seems to be assuming outsized importance in the race for the White House.
A flying visit this week from the former Florida governor Jeb Bush  who appears ever closer to announcing his intention to seek the Republican presidential nomination  placed the US territory and its electorate of 2.4 million at the heart of his push to win back Hispanic voters.
Bush, who speaks Spanish fluently and who has a Mexican wife, told supporters at public appearances in San Juan and Bayamn about the partys need to reconnect with the Latino vote.
We havent campaigned in [Hispanic] communities to show respect and to listen, he said at San Juans Universidad Metropolitana on Tuesday. This is just human nature. If you show respect for people and you have a message that gives them some hope that life can be better, theyre more open to voting for you.
In comments also presumably aimed to attract the attention of the 640,000 Puerto Rican voters in Florida  who overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama at the last two presidential elections  Bush also sought to soften the Republicans traditionally hardline approach to immigration.

The conservative cause would be better to embrace this rather than push it away, he said.
We should create an immigration system that drives economic opportunity for all of us. We should move toward protecting the rule of law, protecting our border [and] making legal immigration easier than illegal immigration.
Puerto Rico has long been a popular campaign stop for White House contenders, despite having no representation in the electoral college that ultimately determines the president and vice-president following the nationwide vote.
Its importance lies in the delegates it sends to each partys nominating convention. So keen are candidates to secure them that even the usually unflappable Mitt Romney was caught dancing awkwardly at a street carnival-style rally in San Juan on his way to picking up the delegates that eventually won him the Republican 2012 nomination.
Bush is also no stranger to the high life in Puerto Rico, having spent three months with his wife there in 1979, helping his father George HW Bush win the presidential primary and, as he admitted on Tuesday, learning how to drink a lot of Puerto Rican rum.
His approach this week is somewhat more sober. During his appearances, the second at a town hall-style meeting in Bayamn, he placed himself into the decades-old debate still raging on the island over its future direction, specifically whether Puerto Rico should ever become the 51st state of the union. In a 2012 referendum, more than 61% of islanders declared themselves in support of statehood.
Puerto Rican citizens ought to have the right to determine whether they want to be a state, he said. I think statehood is the best path, personally. To get the full benefits and responsibilities of citizenship, being a state is the only way to make that happen.
These are troubled times in Puerto Rico. Mired in a $73bn public debt crisis and with finance chiefs warning last week of an imminent government shutdown, the statehood debate has taken on new significance.
The root cause of these enduring problems is our political status, said Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Ricos resident commissioner to Congress, in a letter this week to the New Yorker.

Each year Puerto Rico loses out on billions of dollars in federal spending and tax credits that Congress sends to the states. To compensate for the shortfall in federal funding, Puerto Ricos government has borrowed heavily in the bond market, leading to the excessive debt. To overcome its economic challenges, Puerto Rico must become a state.
Pierluisi has introduced two bills to Congress, one that would require a formal vote on statehood by July 2019, and another, currently at committee stage, that would amend the federal bankruptcy code to allow Puerto Rico to be treated as a state. This would provide the island with protection from creditors under Chapter Nine of the code, similar to that enjoyed by the city of Detroit during its 2013 financial crisis.
Another measure that Puerto Ricos governor, Alejandro Garca Padilla, had proposed to help ease the crisis, a new value added tax of 16%, was rejected by the islands legislature this week as well as a 13% levy on goods and services. In a statement on Thursday, Garca Padilla warned of negative consequences from the politicians rebuff and said: The islands future is at risk because of them.
For Bush, meanwhile, there are no guarantees of islanders support in the March 2016 primary, despite his stirring words this week on the issues of statehood and immigration. He will face stiff competition from the Florida senator Marco Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrant parents and one-time supporter of immigration reform, who announced his run for the Republican nomination earlier this month.

An Italian man hung up the phone on Pope Francis twice thinking he was being pranked, but later apologised to him for his error, the Vatican newspaper, lOsservatore Romano, has reported.
The pontiff, who often contacts strangers who write to him or whose problems he hears about, called Franco Rabuffi on Monday to comfort him as he was sick.
Rabuffi disconnected the call twice thinking it was a hoax. It was only when the pope rang back a third time that Rabuffi took him seriously. I was speechless but Francis came to my rescue, saying that what had happened was funny, he told the newspaper.
Rabuffi, along with his wife, appeared before the pope during the Vaticans general audience on Wednesday and apologised for his mistake.

The mayor of Turkeys capital city has been accused of hypocrisy after tweeting a string of sexist and anti-American comments against a US official  but launching hundreds of lawsuits against people who use Twitter to criticise him.
Melih Gkek directed his remarks at Marie Harf, the acting spokeswoman for the US State Department, after a Turkish pro-government newspaper criticised her for being silent on unrest in Baltimore despite repeated US government criticism of Turkey during the violent crackdown on Gezi Park protestors in the summer of 2013.
One of Gkeks tweets included pictures of Baltimore police tackling a protester, alongside an image of Harf, above the words: Where are you stupid blonde, who accused Turkish police of using disproportionate force?
Above the image, Gkek wrote: Come on blonde, answer now!
 brahim Melih Gkek (@06melihgokcek) April 29, 2015
HAD SARIIN CEVAP VERSENE... COME ON BLONDE ANSWER NOW... pic.twitter.com/gTeftDEWdg
In another tweet, the notoriously cantankerous Ankara mayor wrote: According to the blonde girl, the governments reaction during the Gezi Park protests were worrisome, but when it comes to your country, is it normal to declare a curfew.
Harf said she did not want to dignify [the tweets] with a response, but challenged Gkeks claim that the US government had been silent on the unrest in Baltimore, saying that President Barack Obama had commented on the unrest, which erupted on the death of Freddie Gray , after his arrest by police.
But activists in Turkey pointed out that while Gkek regularly lashes out at his opponents on Twitter, he is less happy to be the subject of online criticism.
In March this year Gkek has filed a criminal complaint for defamation against Hayko Bagdat, a Turkish journalist of Armenian descent, after he jokingly called the Ankara mayor Armenian in tweets posted after the local elections. One of Bagdats messages read: It is official  they gave the capital city to an Armenian. What a shame!
The petition handed in by Gkeks lawyers stated that the mayor was a citizen of the Turkish Republic who loves his country and his nation, and Bagdats comments therefore false and an insult and libel. Gkek demanded 10,000 Turkish lira for psychological damage.
Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: Its a complete double standard. Critical comment on government policies is interpreted as an insult, which completely conflicts which what free speech means.
Mayor of Ankara since 1994 and a veteran member of the ruling Justice and Development party (AK), Gkek is one of the most polarising figures in Turkish politics.
A staunch supporter of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoan, he often uses the microblogging site to attack those he deems to be in opposition to the AKP government. During the Gezi protests he quickly became known for his anti-protester tweets, but he has also regularly targeted journalists.
During the Gezi Park protests, he used Twitter to accuse a BBC reporter, Selin Girit, of being an English agent. Dozens of Turkish journalists have been publicly threatened by the Twitter-happy mayor, including the prominent investigative reporter Nedim ener and the columnist Ceyda Karan.
On Thursday the case file of the television presenter Sedef Kabas who posted a tweet criticising that prosecutors dropped a corruption inquiry involving the government was sent to a high criminal court. She faces up to five years in prison.

In Bunkot, a remote cluster of villages clinging to high ridges at 7,000ft in the Himalayan foothills, aid has finally begun to arrive. Fewer than 15 miles from the epicentre of Saturdays quake, lashed overnight by heavy rain and hit by a series of powerful aftershocks, the area is one of the worst affected in Nepal .
And yet, on Thursday night, at least a few hundred homeless villagers prepared to sleep in marginally better conditions, free from hunger for a few hours. As NGOs and the Nepali government struggle with the massive logistical difficulties of bringing in and distributing the huge quantities of material needed for the hundred thousand people thought to be homeless in the area around Bunkot, informal local initiatives are getting some help through.

Early on Thursday morning, pickup trucks carrying bedding, snacks and other vital materials arrived in Bunkot, sent by a restaurant in the Chitwan national park, about 50 miles away. The vehicles managed to get through before rain cut the mud track to the nearest metalled road leading to Gorkha Bazaar, the district centre.
There is a very important need. These people just need to survive. We cant wait for the government. We decided to do it ourselves, said Naresh Giri, manager of the KC Restaurant and Bar.

As tempers rose outside the partially ruined school where the handout was taking place, Sobita Amjin, 25, collected a roll of foam bedding and some snacks. Our house was badly damaged and collapsed completely with the aftershock. We are all living outside. We have no shelter, nothing. We are happy to get this but need much more, Amjin said.
Half a mile away, filthy, ragged men from Mahadipur village set about unloading a cargo of 58 sacks of rice from a bus which had travelled 50 miles to reach them. My brother sent it. He is a businessman. When the telephones came back on, I told him we had no food left and were very hungry, Ganga Athi Kari, 50, said.
Like many Nepalis among the 8.1 million people effected by the quake  of whom 1.4 million need food assistance, according to the United Nations  villagers in Bunkot are angry at the slow pace of aid distribution. How can so much time pass and we are suffering still? asked Bimolla Adikhari, 40.
Though the situation is improving in and around Kathmandu, huge numbers of people are still without any help. The situation is particularly bad in Gorkha district, of which Bunkot is a subdivision. There is almost no information about the 10,000 people who live in its northernmost areas, close to the border with Tibet.
Kempo Chimed Tsering, a local religious leader and former minister, said he had flown into villages close to the mountain of Manaslu, the eight highest in the world, and seen terrible scenes. There are still injured there who have not been treated. Whole villages are flattened. They need tents very badly, he told the Guardian.

Tsering said more than 70 Nepalese army and government helicopter missions had distributed food and other material that he had provided. Some NGOs are now also working in Gorkha. More than 2,000 kits including tarpaulins, kitchen utensils and blankets have been distributed by Save The Children, most by helicopter.
Lynette Lim, communications manager for the NGO in Gorkha, flew over villages near the epicentre on Tuesday. Its very clear that those places are hard to get to. Its either a helicopter or nothing. Some are between five and eight days walk away, Lim said.

Landslides have now made trekking routes and paths lethal, but helicopters are often grounded by bad weather and are too few to distribute anywhere near the quantities of aid required. Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters. There are currently about 20 Nepalese army, private and Indian army helicopters involved in rescue operations, according to Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a home ministry official.
Tensions between foreigners and Nepalis desperate to be evacuated have also surfaced. In Langtang valley, where 150 people are feared trapped, a helicopter pilot was taken hostage by locals demanding to be evacuated first, one report said.

The official death toll in Nepal has reached 5,489. It does not include the 19 people killed at Mount Everest  five foreign climbers and 14 Nepalese Sherpa guides  when the quake caused an avalanche at base camp on the worlds highest peak.
Nepals national emergency operation centre says more than 130,000 homes and 10,000 government buildings have been destroyed. Swarathok, a village in Sindhupalchowk district visited by the Guardian three days ago , still had not been visited by a government official by Thursday night. Swarathok, which had been almost completely destroyed, is a two-hour drive then an hours walk from Kathmandu.

At least two trucks of aid organised by concerned locals in Kathmandu have now reached the district and aid from established NGOs is also beginning to arrive. One team of doctors spent eight hours in the area on Thursday. However, heavy goods vehicles are in short supply, the nations only international airport is heavily congested, and there is a shortage of space to stock incoming relief supplies.
Many aid organisations have warehouses full of material in the region, in Dubai, or the Philippines, but are unable to bring it into the country. Trucks carrying food and other essentials from India are now arriving, though. Among those blocked are specialist air traffic control teams who could help ease the congestion. They are currently waiting in Abu Dhabi, one aid worker said.
Officials have defended the governments relief effort, saying they are doing what they can with limited means. In the district headquarters of Gorkha, policemen and soldiers loaded sacks of rice on to trucks and drew up lists of possible recipients through the night.

We are only sleeping six hours since Saturday. We are pleading for more helicopters and more resources, said Uddab Prasad Timilsina, the most senior administrator in Ghorka district.
An hours walk beyond where the staff of KC Restaurant and Bar were distributing their supplies was another village, perched above terraced fields and a precipitous drop to the valley floor below. All its dozen or so homes had been damaged.
Rameshwa Ragumi, 36, had walked for two days carrying kilos of rice across country from Kathmandu, a distance of about 50 miles, to be with his elderly parents and wife. We are better off than a lot of people. At least we have something to eat and a cattle shed to keep the rain off, Ragumi said.

Two people were pulled out alive from the wreckage of buildings in Kathmandu on Thursday, in rare moments of joy for rescue teams five days after the earthquake that devastated Nepal.
Watching crowds cheered as Nepalese rescuers, assisted by a US disaster team, pulled a 15-year-old boy from the debris of a seven-storey structure, where he had reportedly stayed alive by eating jars of ghee and drinking water dripping from his clothes.
Just streets away, rescuers worked into the night to free a woman from the rubble of a hotel.
The teenager, named variously in reports as Pemba Tamang and Pemba Lama, was conscious and responsive, according to the police officer who crawled into a gap to reach him.
He thanked me when I first approached him, LB Basnet was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. He told me his name, his address, and I gave him some water. I assured him we were near to him.
The dust-covered teenager, who had been trapped in a small gap behind a bike under two metres of rubble, was eventually lifted blinking into the sunlight and placed on a stretcher, with a blue brace around his neck and a drip in his arm.

Libby Weiss, from an Israeli military-run medical centre, said he was doing well and did not appear to have any major injuries. I dont have any logical explanation. It is miraculous. It is a wonderful thing to see in all this destruction, she told AFP.
He was under the rubble for 120 hours and it is certainly the longest we have heard anybody of being under the rubble and surviving.
We understand he didnt have any food and just two jars of ghee, which he had at the time he was under the rubble.
The second survivor was carried by stretcher to a waiting ambulance after Nepalese soldiers and a huge team of experts from France, Norway and Israel worked to rescue her.
She was injured but she was conscious and talking, a Nepalese army major told AFP at the scene.
She has been sent to a military hospital, he said, identifying the woman as a kitchen worker in her mid-30s called Krishna Devi Khadka.
It is as though she had been born again.

However, such stories remain rare following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, the worst in the country for 80 years, which now has a confirmed death toll of 5,489, with 11,000 injured and around 600,000 homes destroyed or damaged, according the UN.
Officials said Pemba had been talking to two other people trapped in the rubble until early Thursday, but they had gone silent. The body of a teenager was removed soon afterwards.
Photographs were published by local media on Wednesday of a four-month-old baby recovered from rubble on Sunday and the rescue of an 11-year-old girl, though it was not clear when she was rescued. Some reports suggested she was also pulled free on Sunday.

Emergency teams have mainly been pulling bodies from the rubble, a task made all the more perilous by more than 70 aftershocks, the strongest measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, according to the Indian Meteorological Department in Delhi.
Rain has left many people with the dilemma of risking a return to damaged homes which could collapse in an aftershock or sleeping in tents or other temporary shelters.

Prabhu Dutta, a 27-year-old banker, told AP he had slept amid the cracked walls of his Kathmandu home for the past two nights, but was worried by the continued aftershocks, calling them a morning wakeup notice. He said: I am worried about whether they will continue for a long time or whether it will calm down.
Large numbers have left Kathmandu on free buses provided by the government, often to check on the fate of relatives in other regions. I have to get home. It has already been so many days, Shanti Kumari, travelling with her seven-year-old daughter to eastern Nepal , told AP. I want to get at least a night of peace.

The Guardians Pete Pattisson reports from Barkobot where tensions are rising over the slow pace of aid
While rescue teams were out in Kathmandu despite the rain, helicopters could not fly to the worst-hit areas in the countryside.
There may not be any more survivors, Rameshwor Dandal, chief of the disaster management centre at Nepals home ministry, said on Thursday. The rain is adding to the problems. Nature seems to be against us.
The British government said on Thursday that it was sending three CH47 Chinook helicopters to Nepal to help.
The Department for International Development (Dfid) said it hoped that the aircraft, due to leave RAF Brize Norton in the coming days, would help organisations already on the ground to immediately get aid supplies to more isolated areas.
Justine Greening, the international development secretary, said: Conditions in Nepal are dire, but the UK is determined to do everything it can to help support Nepal and its people.
The government said that British embassy staff were also providing practical help to more than 300 British nationals in the affected area.
Anger over the slow pace of the rescue flared on Wednesday with protests outside parliament. In the interior, villagers blocked trucks carrying supplies, demanding the government do more to hasten the distribution of aid that has flooded into the country but has been slow to reach those in need.
The official death toll does not include the 19 people killed at Mount Everest  five foreign climbers and 14 Nepalese Sherpa guides  when the quake caused an avalanche at base camp on the worlds highest peak.
Related: Extent of the destruction from Nepal's earthquake
The UN has launched an appeal for $415m (270m) in assistance, while Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters to help with aid efforts.
Rescue teams have yet to reach some more distant regions to assess the devastation, and Nepals prime minister, Sushil Koirala, has warned the final death toll could reach 10,000.
As well as the dead there has been a huge impact on many of those injured. Reuters spoke to one 26-year-old man, Rishi Ram Khanal, who had just left his wife and infant son in rural western Nepal to travel via Kathmandu to Dubai to begin a cleaning job, borrowing about 700 to finance the trip.
The quake left him buried for 80 hours in the debris of a five-storey guesthouse, drinking his own urine to survive. While he survived doctors had to amputate a leg.
Khanal said it would have been better if he had died. What will I do for the rest of my life? My chance to work in Dubai is gone and I cannot even work as a farmer, he told Reuters from a hospital bed. I dont even have the money to buy a wheelchair now. How will I spend the rest of life and support my family?

        <title>Garissa attack: Kenyan minister admits tipoff on al-Shabaab assault was ignored</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/30/garissa-massacre-kenyan-minister-admits-intelligence-ignored</Link>

Kenyas interior minister has admitted that intelligence was ignored and the security response botched regarding the Islamist massacre of nearly 150 people at Garissa university in April.
There was lack of coordination on the side of the officers,, Joseph Nkaissery told a parliamentary committee on Thursday. There was intelligence that this place was going to be attacked.
The interior minister said security should have been beefed up but was not, and that once the attack began a lack of coordination undermined the response.
Militants from Somalias al-Qaida-linked al-Shabaab rebels killed 148 people during the assault on Garissa University College in north-east Kenya on 2 April. It was the groups deadliest attack to date.
The intelligence and security failings are reminiscent of the 2013 attack on Nairobis Westgate mall, when prior intelligence was also ignored and there was a similarly botched response, during which a lack of coordination led to the Kenyan army and police firing on each other.
Appearing before a parliamentary security committee, Nkaissery  who was appointed interior minister in December after his predecessor was sacked following a series of deadly al-Shabaab attacks  defended his ministry and instead blamed regional and county security officials for the failings.
Earlier in April two civil servants and seven police officers were suspended pending investigation into suspected negligence.
Nkaissery also said that because the busy university hostels were congested and had grilles on the windows it was difficult for students to escape and for soldiers and a specially trained police unit to get inside the buildings, meaning more lives were lost.

What the Brandenburg Gate's pop-up horses say about the state of Berlin's public art
As part of the 70th-anniversary commemorations marking the end of the second world war in Europe, 20 monumental horses have been installed in the heart of Berlin. But why are they only here for one week?

This weekend, the Mediterranean will come galloping into the heart of Berlin . As part of the commemorations for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe, 20 monumental horses  variously made of Italian marble, bronze, cast iron and granite, some of them six metres tall  will be installed in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
At first sight, the animals resemble the four bronze horses by sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow that have sat atop the gate since 1793, one of the citys iconic landmarks. On closer inspection, the new arrivals look decidedly more war-torn: cracks pattern the bronze like scars, ribcages are showing, flames seem to have licked up the beasts flanks.
Their creator, Mexican painter-turned-sculptor Gustavo Aceves, says that for him personally, the domesticated horse will always be a symbol of Western culture, having first arrived on the shores of the Americas with the Spanish conquistadors in 1519. But here on Pariser Platz, with the triumphant quadriga looking down from up high, Aceves equines spark all sorts of associations.
Sculpted out of Italian stone in Pietrasanta near Pisa, modelled on Leonardo da Vincis Gran Cavallo sketch , and referencing the Greek myth of the Trojan horse, the installation forces passersby to consider Germanys cultural debt to southern Europe, at a time when the Greek debt to Germany and German wartime debt to Greece are very much in the headlines. Without the horses on top of the Brandenburg Gate, this would only be a dialogue with art history, Aceves says. Now its a dialogue with live history.

Given their symbolic and literal weight  the head of the granite horse alone weighs 600 kilos  what is most remarkable is how briefly these war horses will make an appearance in the German capital. On 10 May, after just over a week, they will be packed up and trucked off to new destinations: first to Venice, then to Mexico City. Beijing, Hamburg, Paris and London are also in discussions about hosting Aceves horses in the coming years.
The trend towards temporary installations in urban public art is nothing new. Many of the permanent artworks commissioned through state-sponsored percent for art programmes, such as Americas Art in Architecture or Germanys Kunst am Bau programmes, now look trapped in the fleeting aesthetics of their era. Temporary installations such as the one on Trafalgar Squares fourth plinth, on the other hand, find it easier to command attention and are cheaper for the city to maintain and protect from vandalism. But in Berlins case, it has an absurdist twist: a pop-up show with materials usually picked to denote permanence and durability.
The project has also profited from geopolitical circumstances. With diplomatic relations between Europe and Russia in permafrost, there will be no big state ceremony at the Brandenburg Gate, and the installation will take centre stage rather than merely framing speeches by heads of state.
This latest public art stunt fits with the wider strategy of a city that is actively trying to fashion itself as Europes art capital. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall last November, authorities installed a Lichtgrenze or border of lights made up of 8,000 illuminated helium balloons, which were then released into the night sky one by one, symbolically dissolving the old division between the eastern and western halves of the city. For the 75th anniversary of Reichskristallnacht in 2013, shopfronts were fitted with images of shattered glass .
What makes Berlin different from other big European cities is that all these projects are orchestrated not directly by the city but a separate limited company, called Kulturprojekte Berlin, which mostly uses the citys money but retains autonomy in the commissioning process.
There are things happening in Berlin that you wouldnt see in other cities
Lutz Henke
In ideal circumstances, such an arrangement avoids public artworks being chosen by committee, or as a result of political trading, allowing curators to concentrate on the work itself. In Britain, artists such as Antony Gormley have repeatedly criticised the lack of a structure to shortlist and judge public artworks: Here, the standards are very low [for] the way submissions are judged, Gormley told the Independent in 2008.
In a city as full of artists as Berlin, Kulturprojekte also has its critics, who point out that the body tends to choose headline-grabbing spectacles over more quietly spoken works. But even they admit that Berlin now punches above its weight when it comes to public art.
There are fewer restrictions here, and a greater acceptance for when you break the rules than in New York, London or Paris, says Lutz Henke , a curator specialising in public and street art. There are things happening in Berlin that you wouldnt see in other cities.

Beirut's bullet-riddled Holiday Inn - a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 28

Though Lebanon has been swept by a gentrifying and disfiguring development rush , some older monuments still stand tall. Strolling downhill from the Clemenceau neighbourhood for a coffee on the seaside Corniche, youll see the towering building of the Holiday Inn: bullet-riddled and rocket-pierced.
The once-plush hotel, which opened for business just two years before the Lebanese civil war broke out in 1975, has remained in Beiruts collective memory  not for its glamour or architectural design, but as a front-line, a demarcation between east and west, and a symbol of war.
The Holiday Inn represented an affluent time for the city: the building became part of a luxury developmental bubble at a time when Beiruts banks were growing fat on deposits from the regions petrodollars. However, the civil war obliterated the hotels ambitions of becoming a social hub, with cinemas and restaurants crowned by a rooftop rotating restaurant towering over the district.
In October 1975, just months into the Lebanese civil war, the hotel became part of an epic battle dubbed  the war of the hotels . It lasted until March 1976 and mobilised around 25,000 fighters from both sides, resulting in more than 1,000 dead and 2,000 injured.

The Holiday Inn was the biggest in an area already jammed with hotels  an area that became strategically important because of its proximity to the sea: it was located between the coastal neighbourhoods of Ain el-Mresi and Mina al-Hosn, on top of a hill overlooking the city.
As the civil war began to polarise the city into east and west, the two main antagonists  the Lebanese Front (Christian rightwing militias backed by the Lebanese army) and the National Movement (Lebanese leftist parties backed by Palestines PLO)  raced to capture the district.
The Holiday Inn was then sold on the streets of Beirut: beds, silver spoons, curtains
Abu Ali
Seen by militants as a strategic military asset, the Holiday Inn became a trophy in the battle. We descended on the hotel district from three directions, recalls Abu Ali, 66, a veteran of the war on the side of the National Movement. The battle to take the Holiday Inn dragged on. That building felt like an unshakable castle. The Christian fighters who had raced us to it managed to create supply lines that kept feeding their fighters barracked in the hotel, and positioned their snipers on the upper floors and rooftop.
Heavy artillery was fired from surrounding rooftops, pounding the Holiday Inn and creating the damage that is still visible today.
Shortly after the battle, hordes of scavengers entered the building and stripped it down to its bones, Ali said. The Holiday Inn was then sold on the streets of Beirut: beds, silver spoons, curtains.
Later, after the 1982 Israeli invasion of Beirut  in the second phase of the civil war  the Holiday Inn building was once again disputed turf, this time between former allies; with the al-Mourabitoun losing control of the building to the Amal Movement .
These battles were, in a sense, an introvert war fought by the citys occupants who turned their own homes into an open battleground  a war fought from alley to alley, building to building.

Since the conflicts end, the shareholders of the bullet-riddled building have been locked in a dispute over its future. The Lebanese partners Compagnie Immobiliere Libanaise wanted to renovate the building and set up luxury lofts for rent or sale. However, the Kuwaiti group that owns half wanted to demolish it, and build a new tower block similar to those in the surrounding downtown area.
Today, entry is forbidden to the public. The buildings 24 floors are desolate: shrubs sprout from the concrete floors, the grey mouldering walls still bearing scars of countless bullet holes and political graffiti from a bygone era. Its Lebanese and Kuwaiti owners recently declared their intention to put the building up for auction.
Many years after the fighting ceased, the building has become a popular site for underground dance parties. On a Saturday night in 1998, many Lebanese mingled in the same building where 23 years earlier their parents had fought each other. I was one of the revellers: we snuck out of our parents homes and drank and danced until the early hours on a site still vividly synonymous with the 15-year civil war.
In spite of the postwar efforts to resurrect Lebanons elusive golden age, the country once more teeters on the edge of an abyss. Lurking in the background of the glitzy, redeveloped downtown district, the disfigured faade of the Holiday Inn stands as a reminder that Lebanons civil war politics are far from resolved.

        <title>Nepal earthquake: a disaster that shows quakes don't kill people, buildings do</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/30/nepal-earthquake-disaster-building-collapse-resilience-kathmandu</Link>

The kind of earthquake that hit Nepal last week is a periodic event in the country: the last was in 1934. For years, the international community knew another big quake was due in Kathmandu. The disaster is that we have not prepared sufficiently for a predictable event. In a world of increased urban densification, rapidly expanding informal settlements and development that outstrips a governments ability to enforce standards, it is poorly designed and constructed buildings, not earthquakes, which are the real catastrophe.
In many cases, the rush of urbanisation has produced some of the most dangerous built environments: multi-storey buildings, over-reliance on concrete and a loss of knowledge that protected previous generations. The pressure to meet the needs of growing populations, along with improperly implemented building regulations, can lead to lethal weakness. This was demonstrated in China in 2008 when the Sichuan earthquake destroyed over 7,000 recent but inadequately engineered schools, killing thousands of schoolchildren .
Around three-quarters of all deaths in earthquakes are due to building collapse. Low-cost and informal buildings are most likely to fail, meaning that earthquakes disproportionately affect the poorest in the community, and usually leave them even poorer. The technology and skills to practically eliminate this scale of fatality are available. Yet they are not reaching the people who need them most. Earthquakes are not just a natural crisis: they reflect a poverty crisis.
This is a development problem produced by a failure to incorporate risk and resilience into long-term planning. An earthquake shouldnt have to be the impetus to build back better after lives have already been destroyed. Building better should start from day one.
After a disaster like Nepals earthquake, the international community needs to assist in long-term, safe reconstruction. If it does not, the construction will be carried out in an ad-hoc manner, with unplanned reconstruction and inadequate skills resulting in unsafe buildings. This pattern locks poor communities into a cycle of vulnerability, leaving them unprotected against the next earthquake. Nepals reconstruction is so crucial because it is an opportunity to take the global communitys combined knowledge and do better. It is more important than ever to focus not only on providing immediate relief, but to deliver a more resilient, stronger built environment that will not produce a repeat tragedy of this scale again.
The international community is practiced at disaster response in the short term  flying in rescue teams, distributing medical supplies and setting up temporary shelters  but this only treats the symptoms of an earthquake. The underlying problem is a vulnerable built environment. As the emergency passes, this cause gets forgotten: the trauma of earthquakes makes people want to forget, but when that amnesia reaches the institutional level, then history repeats itself.

The start date to prepare for Nepals next earthquake is now. Lessons in resilience do not only come from new technology and modern building techniques, but from the past as well. Five-storey pagodas in Japan and China have stood through a thousand years of earthquakes without collapse due to their natural seismic qualities, as has the 1,500-year-old Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu, now host to a tragic number of funeral rites. A home-reconstruction programme in Pakistan, led by Article 25 , has adapted traditional building techniques to give them better seismic resilience, delivering homes that draw on old and new technology alike to keep their inhabitants as safe as possible through another earthquake.

Ways to rebuild safely and improve resilience are already known, and indeed have been demonstrated: in Concepcion, Chile, the 2010 earthquake was the sixth largest on record, but fatalities remained under 1,000, in large part due to effective implementation of building regulations. And disasters constantly provide new lessons on how to improve resilience, not just of the built environment, but of social and community structures, too. After Hurricane Katrina, residents didnt know where their evacuation points were in the city. So a New Orleans-based organisation called Evacuteer has erected 14ft metal sculptures of a person with their arm raised, engineered to withstand Category 5 hurricanes, at key collection points or evacuspots.
Knowledge is not lacking in Nepal , either. The country experiences several small to medium earthquakes a year, it has a National Society for Earthquake Technology, and it has created a set of building safety standards. It knows the importance of resilient reconstruction. But disaster funding remains reactionary, with the lions share of spending going towards short-term response. In 29 years, the Global Facility for Disaster Risk and Recovery (GFDRR) allocated only 2% of total development assistance to disaster-related activities. Of this, only 3.6% was for disaster prevention and preparedness.
Or take Haiti: it had one of the highest densities of NGOs before the 2010 earthquake, yet none of this long-term work gave the country the resilience it needed against a known threat. After the quake, millions of pounds were raised in response, but the necessary focus on safe reconstruction was not met, and five years on, many sites in Port au Prince stand empty.

Community hubs, and especially schools, are a priority for reconstruction because they give children a step back into normality and provide essential childcare services, allowing their adult families to return to work or participate in further reconstruction. An earthquake- and hurricane-proof building can function every day as a school or health centre, but also then becomes a lifesaving shelter against an incoming storm or deadly aftershocks.
International cooperation needs to focus on preventing disasters proactively, not reactively. We have the technology and skills to make the difference between thousands of deaths and no deaths, but these lessons are not reaching far enough. Physical resilience must be embedded throughout all development, permanently, not just months or years after an earthquake. Disasters are when not if events. Only comprehensive strategies of resilience will be able to prevent another Nepal.
Robin Cross is managing director of Article 25 , an architectural aid charity. In the wake of the recent earthquake, Article 25 has launched an appeal to support a school building programme in Nepal.

Tomasz Kacprzak , chairman of the city council of d, the third-biggest city in Poland, was telling me about the time he met David Lynch.
We went to his house in California, Kacprzak said. He loves d. He wants to build us a cultural centre. (Lynchs plan for a 90-acre site comprising a film studio, cinema, gallery, offices and bar in an abandoned power plant in d  the city that also inspired the cult directors film Inland Empire  is expected to open in 2016.)
Actually, Kacprzak continued, Lynchs house is not great. The interior. It is not modern.
Oh, no, I said. Retro? Nineties?
No, Kacprzak said. Eighties. Gehrys house was much nicer.
You went to Frank Gehrys house, too?
This was interesting. We were standing in the soaring atrium of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , designed by Gehry. Through the window, in the courtyard, you could make out the back of Jeff Koons huge, Edward Scissorhands-style plant sculpture, Puppy.
Yes, Kacprzak said. We asked for the Guggenheim in d.
You wanted Gehry to design a new museum?
No, Kacprzak said. The same. He swept his arm over the pine, glass and steel that curved above our heads.
You wanted him to build the exact same building?
Yes, Kacprzak said casually. The same. But we would use it for a concert hall.
Much is made of the so-called  Bilbao effect , the idea that attracting a world-class cultural institution  in Bilbaos case, a branch of New Yorks Guggenheim art museum  will put your city on the map, and in turn attract more investment, brands, tourism and cultural energy. This was the first time, however, that Id heard someone say they wanted to copy Bilbaos building exactly, swooping metal sheet for swooping metal sheet.

What did Gehry say? I asked.
He said, OK  but it will very expensive. Kacprzak shrugged. We are a small city.
So, of course, was Bilbao 18 years ago when it rose to fame almost overnight. The fourth-largest city in Spain had lost its former glory as a manufacturing centre: its factories shuttered, its port decrepit. But after Spain joined the EU in 1986, Basque Country authorities embarked on an ambitious redevelopment programme for their biggest city.
They drafted in expensive architects to design an airport (Santiago Calatrava), a metro system (Norman Foster), and a footbridge (Calatrava again), and in 1991 landed their biggest fish  the Solomon R Guggenheim Foundation, which decided to bring a new branch of the legendary Guggenheim Museum to the city, and hired star California architect Frank Gehry to build it.
The building was an instant hit. Critics agreed Gehrys deconstructed meringue of sweeping metal, which opened in 1997, was a work of  mercurial brilliance . The collection inside, featuring art by Willem De Kooning, Mark Rothko, Anselm Kiefer and Richard Serra, was world-class. The construction even came in on budget, at $89m.
Whats more, Bilbao now had a landmark. Visitor spending in the city jumped, recouping the building cost within three years. Five years after construction, Bilbao estimated that its economic impact on the local economy was worth 168m , and poured an additional 27m into Basque government tax coffers  the equivalent of adding 4,415 jobs. More than one million people annually now visit the museum, which became the centrepiece of the Bilbao Art District: a cluster composed of the maritime museum, the fine arts museum and the Sala Rekalde art centre.
In 2010, French designer Philippe Starck completed his renovation of a former wine cellar to create the Alhondiga culture and leisure centre (recently rebranded as Azkuna Zentroa). And Zaha Hadid has presented radical plans to redevelop the neglected Zorrozaurre peninsula and turn it into a high-tech residential and cultural island. A struggling city, decimated by the decline of its manufacturing base, had seemingly reinvented itself by  of all things  betting big on culture.
Other post-industrial cities noticed. When I told Kacprzaks story to Maria Fernandez Sabau, a cultural and museum consultant for cities around the world, she sighed.
Yes, many of my clients say the same thing: give us the Guggenheim, she said. Often the exact same building! But you cant just copy it.
A struggling city, decimated by the decline of its manufacturing, had seemingly reinvented itself by betting on culture
Dont tell that to Abu Dhabi. Possibly in an attempt to buttress itself against the day the oil runs out, the city is building a museum complex called Saadiyat Island, which will feature branches of not just the Guggenheim (again) but the Louvre as well. In Hong Kong, the West Kowloon Cultural District will be home to M+, a new museum of Chinese contemporary art. There are plans for new cultural hubs centred on museums in Mecca, in Tirana, in Belo Horizonte and in Perth, Australia.
Its the same in the UK: Dundee has drafted in Kengo Kuma to build a new V&amp;A Museum of Design, while Liverpool and Margate have welcomed the Tate Liverpool (designed by James Stirling) and the Turner Contemporary (David Chipperfield). Every city, it seems, wants to create the next Bilbao-Guggenheim-Gehry vortex.

Praise for this model reached its zenith last month, as mayors, cultural attachs and city representatives descended on Bilbao for the UCLG Cities and Culture Conference. Walking the streets with Kacprzak from d, I could see what the delegates liked so much. The city centre is clean. There are lots of expensive retail shops. El Fosterito, the glass-tube metro entrances designed by Foster, are slick and futuristic. And the people seem disproportionately well-off.
Presiding over it all, like a monolith of gentrification, is the Guggenheim. Yet despite this icon of culture, the city seems strangely quiet. Where are the local galleries, the music, the graffiti, the skateboarders? Spains difficulties with youth unemployment are well-documented, but I expected more twentysomethings in what is regularly billed as a cultural capital. Does the Guggenheim actually encourage creativity in the city, as advertised, or is it a Disneylandish castle on the hill with a fancy name and an expensive entrance fee for tourists and the well-heeled? Is the Bilbao effect to spread culture, or just to spread money?
The Guggenheim put our city on the map, no question. But you also cant get anything support here unless its top-down, says Manu Gmez-lvarez, an animated man of around 40 wearing earrings and a black hoodie, who is the driving force behind ZAWP , the Zorrozaurre Art Working Progress, a cultural group based on the Bilbao peninsula that Zaha Hadid proposes to completely redevelop.
ZAWP is precisely the kind of cultural organisation that gets praised in megacities like London and New York. Its a decentralised collective of young artists, theatre-makers, musicians and designers, with co-making spaces in the old industrial buildings of Zorrozaurre and a thriving entrepreneurial atmosphere in their colourful, funky headquarters  which also house a bar, a cafe, a gig space and a theatre. Gmez-lvarez is leading a movement he calls Meanwhile, which aims to use the still-derelict buildings of the peninsula as temporary sites for plays, gigs, artistic interventions or even just cafes. Every proposal, at every turn, gets the same answer back from the authorities: no.
Theres no support for grassroots culture, he says. We waited 20 years before we got any funding from the government at all. Last year, he says ZAWP finally received a grant  but they still dont get a permanent home in the new Zorrozaurre, and will almost certainly have to move again. Its hard to imagine: ZAWPs premises are huge, stretching through half a dozen buildings and decorated in amazingly elaborate detail. And yet we are nomads, says Gmez-lvarez.

I asked Igor de Quadra, who runs Karraskan Bilbao  a network of more than a dozen theatre groups, venues and creative organisations  what he thought of the Guggenheims effect. He struggled to frame his words carefully. It is fine for what it is, he said at last, but it gets a lot of attention from people who are just passing through. Events like this [UCLG forum] take up a lot of attention, but dont leave much behind for Bilbao culture. Frankly, we dont think about the Guggenheim.
The Guggenheim certainly doesnt claim to be in the business of fostering local culture, nor would you expect it to. The museum has some Basque art and occasionally runs cultural workshops, but its an international art museum, rather incongruously plonked down in northern Spain. (Extreme Basque nationalists didnt take kindly to its arrival: the week before it opened, ETA killed a police officer in a foiled attempt to bomb the museum .)
Which is the better way for cities  bottom-up cultural movements or big-ticket splashes?
There are, of course, Basque cultural organisations in the city, such as Harrobia Bilbao, a performing arts group established in a former church in the Otxarkoaga area in 2011, but their presence feels surprisingly marginal in a city that is supposed to be at the heart of Basque culture.
In English Canada, cultures nice to have  in French Canada, its crucial, says Simon Brault, head of the Arts Council of Canada, talking about a similar dynamic between French-speaking Quebec and the rest of the country. Brault helmed what you might call an anti-Bilbao effect  a completely different type of culture-led regeneration in another struggling post-industrial city, Montreal.
Brault helped found an open, non-hierarchical cultural network called Culture Montreal, which rather than speaking only to the Guggenheims and cultural superstars of the city, was open to everyday Montrealers  bar owners, teachers, musicians. An artist just in from Chile would be at the same table as the head of Cirque du Soleil, he says. The aim wasnt to secure funding for massive projects, but to put culture at the heart of the citys regeneration.
It was controversial at first. The cultural groups thought it was a distraction and that what the culture sector needed was more money, he said. But within a year, we got what cultural groups had been asking for for 20 years: a seat at the table.

Rather than championing culture only for an elite group of professionals  and asking for money just for the huge institutions  Culture Montreal was better received by city and provincial governments, says Brault. Their goals were less arrogant: to increase cultural access for Montrealers, and to include culture as part of the solution to any civic problems. They achieved this, Brault says, by making everyone feel as though culture was a daily part of everyones life, not something for a sophisticated few. There is definitely room for starchitects, but its always better to tap into local culture rather than buy it from outside. You cant do culture in a city without involving citizens, he said.
So, which is the better way for cities  bottom-up cultural movements or big-ticket splashes? Of course, there will always be top-down decisions, Brault said. The key is to look for a middle ground.
Hadids billion-pound redevelopment of Zorrozaurre will be a test for that middle ground in Bilbao. Will its 6,000 new houses, two new technology centres and park genuinely engage with local culture, or will it simply be a flashy area for rich Spaniards looking for a waterfront property? The Bilbao effect might be famous, but its here that it could be truly tested. Those cities around the globe hoping a brand-name museum will save them should be watching carefully.
The Guggenheim Bilbao was a rare occurrence, says museum consultant Maria Fernandez Sabau. There was an incredible confluence of amazing, talented people. You had a museum that was hungry to expand, available land for cheap, a government with money, an architect itching to make a statement, and a city that desperately needed a new reason to exist. You cant just buy that.

From New York to Beijing, where in the world can you still smoke in a bar?
New Orleans has become the latest city to introduce a smoking ban  which got us wondering: where are you still allowed to light up freely?

Weve reached the point where it seems quicker to count the cities that actually let people smoke in their bars than the ones where it is banned. Even the sybaritic city of New Orleans finally outlawed smoking last week. But when you look into it (as determined smokers no doubt have), there are still many bars and cafes around the world  and even in the US  in which they may freely enjoy their unhealthy habit. For example ...
New York
Surprisingly, some bars do still exist in New York where people can legally smoke indoors, thanks to the cigar bars loophole. To qualify, a bar must have been opened before the end of 2001, it must receive at least 10% of its revenue from tobacco sales and 60% from alcohol, and it must be certified compliant by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Philadelphia, too, hasnt yet banned smoking completely in bars, according to the American Nonsmokers Rights Foundation .
Las Vegas
Perhaps the only conceivable benefit of a cigarette addiction is that it can (briefly) restrict your gambling addiction, if you have to go outside to light up. The gambling haven of Nevada cant have that, of course, so as things stand smoking remains permitted in the gaming areas of casinos, as well as certain designated bars and nightclubs.
Copenhagen
Just one exception has been provided in Denmarks otherwise total ban on public smoking: bars may allow you to do it if they, or a designated room, have an area less than 40 square metres (thats about one seventh of a tennis court, for reference). Few bars qualify, so people generally smoke outside in the Danish capital, which is usually perceived as a paragon of urban virtue.
Amsterdam
Technically it is legal for residents and visitors to smoke only cannabis in an Amsterdam coffeeshop , although it is perhaps far-fetched to imagine someones joint being searched for evidence of contraband tobacco. Nevertheless some coffeeshops and other venues do supply a separate smoking room, which by law must be separate, enclosed and unstaffed.
Vienna
Thanks to a terrible law full of loopholes, small bars and cafes are exempt from Austrias smoking ban - as are larger ones, provided they establish a smoking area, which nobody polices very thoroughly. As a result, Vienna and the rest of Austria are virtually the last holdout for smoking in western Europe. Plans for a new law are underway, however, so this situation may not last long.
Prague
Eastern Europe is another matter. In the Czech Republic, currently, bar owners can ban smoking if they choose - or not if they dont. And a lot dont. But as in Austria, such permissiveness may well soon be legislated away.
Cairo
Both cigarettes and shisha pipes are deeply ingrained in Egyptian life  and so, as a result, are heart disease and lung cancer. In fact, smoking in public has been banned several times by various regimes, both nationally and by individual cities, but each time the new rules have been almost totally ignored and soon forgotten . As a result, although a ban covers most public buildings and a lot of hotel restaurants, people can generally smoke as much as they like in almost any cafe in Egypt.
Beijing
Nearly a third of the worlds smokers live in China, and the Chinese government is getting serious about tobacco control in cities. It just isnt getting serious very fast. Smoking was only banned in Chinese schools last year, which as a result can now no longer sell tobacco in their canteens or accept sponsorship from tobacco companies! Different cities have different laws, but smoking is permitted in most places , except public buildings.

Tokyo
Traditionally a smokers city, the Japanese capital has gradually tightened its restrictions to the point where they are, well, still extremely loose. Not only can people smoke in many bars and restaurants, sometimes they might even be required to , in order not to break rules that prohibit smoking on the street.
Havana
It seems almost unthinkable that public smoking might be banned in the worlds most famous tobacco city. In fact it has been banned in all of Cuba , in virtually all enclosed public spaces, since 2005, but that doesnt mean everybody realises. Finding a bar or a restaurant that will let you smoke is, by all accounts, not much of a challenge.
Phnom Penh
In Cambodia there is no smoking ban as such. Instead, cafe owners are asked to consider telling people to smoke outside . If they still do not obey, the owner must call the police to educate them, explained Hok Khiev, a director of the legal department at the Ministry of Health.
Jakarta
Smoking is so freely practised in Indonesia that people can do it almost anywhere. Cigarettes are barely taxed. Cigarette advertising is unrestricted. Even when legislation began to require unpleasant images to be printed on packets last year there was little sign of it actually happening.
Sark
Not a city, obviously, but the fourth largest Channel Island still merits a mention on this list for possessing some of the worlds weirdest smoking laws . As things stand, smoking is banned there in pubs, bars and restaurants, but not in shops, offices or places of worship. Which is one way to improve church attendances, I suppose. You cant smoke in your car, of course, because Sark also bans cars.
And more ...
The countries of the former Yugoslavia belong on a long list of others  along with Romania, Greece, Portugal, Israel and most of Latin America  which in theory have introduced a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants, but where in practice many visitors would find it difficult to tell .

Levittown isnt a single building but a development of more than 17,000 detached houses. The project  started in 1947 as Americas prototypical postwar planned community  has outlived its heartiest supporters and harshest detractors to stand today as something more complicated than a monument to the glory of the American dream, or to the blandness and conformity to which that dream led.
Like so much else in 20th-century America, Levittown began as a shrewd business move. The homebuilding firm of Levitt and Sons had specialised in upper middle class dwellings on New Yorks Long Island before the second world war, only to be curtailed by the conflicts enormous consumption of construction resources.
But then the founders son, William Levitt, came home from the navy with an idea: every young veteran returning to the United States would need a home. Couldnt the mass-production strategies hed learned putting up military housing give it to them?
And so Levitt and Sons purchased a seven square mile tract of Long Islands potato and onion fields and got to work, putting up all of Levittowns residences between 1947 and 1951.
No one who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist. He has too much to do
William Levitt
Famously building one house every 16 minutes at the constructions peak, using systems well-known in American automobile manufacturing but new to homebuilding. A variety of non-union subcontractors and unskilled workers moved from house to house, each performing one of 26 highly specialised steps in the overall assembly process  all using thoroughly standardised materials, all purchased directly from their manufacturers.
We are not builders, said straight-talking Levitt, the operations mastermind. We are manufacturers. He even went so far as to declare his company the General Motors of the housing industry, providing families the domestic component of the American dream, just as GM provided them the vehicular one. And they did so with the same aesthetic uniformity as the auto industry in its early years, initially stamping out house after house on the same architectural plan, drawn up by brother Alfred Levitt, albeit with subtle variations of colour, window treatment and roofline.

Even so, William Levitt called his product  which first sold for $7,990 with a 5% down payment (0% for veterans) and came with a built-in television set and hi-fi  the best house in the US. But certain observers had grave reservations: Eric Larrabee in Harpers magazine called the little Levitt house American suburbia reduced to its logical absurdity, and urban historian Lewis Mumford described the community they constituted as a uniform environment from which escape is impossible.
Some sections of American society found entrance to the scheme impossible. For decades, Levittowns population was 100% white  at first because of covenants that restricted any minorities from buying in, and thus supposedly sending the surrounding home values into free-fall. The community has an almost antiseptic air, said an otherwise admiring 1950 Time magazine profile of Levitt and Levittown. Brown v Board of Education and the nationwide racial integration that followed hardly touched Levittown, and even today its demographic profile still reads 94.15% white.
By 1950, when 80% of Levittowns men commuted to jobs in Manhattan, the development had set an example for countless American bedroom communities still to come. They provided settings to the novelists who got their start in the mid-20th century, some of whom would famously inveigh against their stifling social atmosphere. Richard Yates, whose novel Revolutionary Road offers a harrowing indictment of American life during Levittowns heyday, wrote of that eras general lust for conformity, a blind, desperate clinging to safety and security at any price, as exemplified politically in the Eisenhower administration and the McCarthy witch hunts.
Levitt, for his part, assured the McCarthyites that no one who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist. He has too much to do. Though he built inexpensive, fully functioning houses and built them well  the vast majority of them still stand today  Levitt left more or less everything else involved in the creation of Levittown to its new suburban homesteaders. Being American, after all, many of them set about customising their freshly built homes, whether of the standard utilitarian Cape Cod design or the newer models (Colonial, Rancher and Country Clubber) that followed.

Sure they were little boxes when we first started, says the narrator of WD Wetherells short story The Man Who Loved Levittown. But the minute we got our mitts on them we started remodelling them, adding stuff, changing them around. He drifts into a rhapsodic recollection of the 50s. The early 60s. We were all going the same direction  Thanks to Big Bill Levitt we all had a chance. You talk about dreams. Hell, we had ours. We had ours like nobody before or since ever had theirs. SEVEN THOUSAND BUCKS! ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS DOWN! We were cowboys out there. We were the pioneers.
But this proud Levitt owner, looking back on what seems like a quintessentially American exercise in individualism, also remembers that there wasnt anything we wouldnt do for each other. Babysit, drive someone somewhere, maybe help out with a mortgage payment someone couldnt meet. Not only did the first generation of Levittown life have its communitarian aspects, it had actual regulations, such as Levitts insistence that no homeowner fence off a private yard from the shared green, that now seem at least faintly socialist.
Related: Pruitt-Igoe: the troubled high-rise that came to define urban America  a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 21
Levittowns very existence, in fact, owes to a rare act of American socialism: the 1948 Housing Bill, which loosened billions of dollars in credit and gave every American the chance to get one of those five-percent-down, 30-year mortgages in the first place. City-dwellers found that they could purchase their very own modern home just as easily as they could rent a walk-up apartment, and homebuilders like Levitt found themselves in a booming business servicing a seemingly insatiable demand.
This government-sponsored encouragement of suburban residence  which, to an extent, continues to this day  did its part to reduce American downtowns in the second half of the 20th century to little more than collections of office buildings. Levittown and its descendants (three of which Levitt himself built in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico, all of which he also named Levittown) lured a generation out of the cities. Their children grew up shaped by these secure and innovative if sometimes alienating environments  and went on themselves to raise the generation that has made a return, full-circle, to the city.

        <MainBody>Johannesburg culture in five words
Gold, blood, work, dance, faster
Sound of the city
With most of the citys workforce still commuting from townships outside the city  a holdover from the days of government issue segregation  ambient sounds like these, recorded at the Bree Street taxi rank in central Joburg, epitomise the beating heart of inner city activity.
Everyones tuning into 
Ashes to Ashes is a new soap opera that I believe  I dont watch it myself  is extremely popular. A labour dispute brought South Africas previous biggest soap opera, Generations, to an untimely end last year . The national broadcaster tried to revive the show as Generations: The Legacy but competing free channel E.tv launched this new soap opera starring a handful of the countrys biggest stars.
The look on the street

South Africa is a melting pot of cultural influences that are just about strung together by some kind of innate punk non-conformist attitude. The look that theres a lot of right now is repurposed early 90s: pastel colours, patterned shirts, caps and chains. Not to mention all those people who obviously remember the fortnight-long swing revival in the mid-90s who are going for a more dapper look. At the same time theres also this strong undercurrent of the health goth look.
What weve ended up with is some weird overlap between the three: imagine a dapper-looking DJ Jazzy Jeff wearing an Amish mans hat.
Whats the big talking point in your city right now?
Xenophobia. The riots have prompted fresh debate about South African collective identity, something that we talk about a lot out here. We love to talk about how far weve come from apartheid while reflecting on how little ground we sometimes appear to have covered.
Best local artist
Bogosi Sekhukhuni is an artist whose work merges the hypnotic content of internet memes with the political thinking that is young, culturally relevant South Africas bread and butter. Sekhukhunis work connects technology, self-reflection, pop culture, collective consciousness and black identity in a way thats going to be interesting to see develop as his body of work grows. His stuff is pure current-gen artistic South Africa: as much a product of the countrys post-apartheid ideals as it is out to dismantle the false ideologies of our Rainbow Nation.
Check out the internets best attempt at capturing his Rainbowcore exhibition here .
Whos top of the playlist?
Riky Rik. Hip hop is huge here and Riky Rik (as well as his crew Boyzn Bucks ) feed that need. He just released an album I have on repeat.
Heres his recent single Boss Zonke, the video for which was directed by Adriaan Louw. Its like classic Hype Williams filtered through rain-drenched KwaZulu-Natal (Rikys home province).

Kalashnikovv Gallery is a space created pretty much expressly to showcase the works of young South African artists outside of the citys better known (and I guess occasionally more stuffy) galleries. Kalashnikovv is a modest-sized space on 153 Smit Street in (currently still trendy arts/student district) Braamfontein.
While the space itself sticks to exhibitions, the minds behind it are pushing into the city in other ways. Theyve got Kalashnikovv Radio , dedicated to exposing the South African audience to music they might otherwise overlook and theyve created a public art fund that theyre funding by auctioning off pieces by local artists.
What Johannesburg does better than anywhere else
Protests (no, really). When weve got something to dispute  wages, politics, whatever  we tend to do a pretty epic job of actually fighting in the streets over it. Sometimes this is a bad thing, but thats never stopped us. This goes for the whole country: see #RhodesMustFall on Twitter and elsewhere.

Run by a trio of photographers, I See A Different You started out with the clear mandate to create positive imagery of young black South Africans living in townships around Joburg. Given that development in these ruralised urban communities continues to stall, its a shame to think, but this account will never not be relevant, creating a significant body of work around these neighbourhoods.

Theres a piece by prolific South African street artist Faith47 called Una Salus Victis Nullam Sperare Salute  a quote from Virgil which means the only safe bet for the vanquished is to expect no safety, something which could be seen as hugely relevant to the city considering the mass gentrification were on the verge of at the moment (not to mention the xenophobic attacks).
This mural can be found on the corner of Rissik and Fox streets in the Central Business District (CBD)of the city.

        <title>Vienna's Karl Marx Hof: architecture as politics and ideology - a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 24</title>

Viennas Karl Marx Hof (roughly, Karl Marx Court) is a rare example of architecture both as political instrument and ideological symbol  a building people would fight for, and against, with guns.
Started by the municipality of Vienna in 1927 and finished three years later, it became one of the main battlefields of the brief Austrian civil war of 1934. Its bombardment, like its construction, became a symbol  this time not of municipal socialism but of Fascism, and of the first serious resistance to it.
None of this meaning, however, would have been imparted to Karl Marx Hof were it not for the fact that the building already looked like a fortress, a bulwark, a castle of solidarity, years before it actually became a besieged holdout. An incredibly long, red, mid-rise block of flats punctuated by archways just north of the city centre, it encloses schools, baths, a library and a health centre. It culminates in a grand square with sculptures, spikes, turrets and the prominent legend, in beautifully cast letters: Karl Marx Hof, built by the Vienna City Council.
Simply, this is the sort of building that you could imagine people being willing to lay down their lives for. Yet its architect, Karl Ehn, was not an active socialist. He carried on working on commissions after the Fascist coup of 1934, and even worked for the Nazis after the annexation of Austria four years later.

For all the aplomb of the design, it came from the brief, not the designers political or even architectural inclinations. Instead, it came from the intersection of the city of Viennas needs for high-density inner-city housing, and the sort of architectural ideas that were dominant in the capital of the Hapsburg Empire in the early 20th century.
Ehn was a student of Otto Wagner, a modernising imperial architect who pioneered a rationalistic, stripped-down approach that, while undoubtedly an influence on modernist architecture, stopped short of the refusal of ornament favoured by younger Viennese architects and thinkers such as Adolf Loos or Otto Neurath.
Wagners finest building, the Postal Savings Bank in Vienna, encapsulates this tension  with its steel-and-glass banking hall and steel frame, it is modernist; with its symmetry, heroic sculpture and stone cladding, it is neoclassical. Wagners students carried on this style of architecture into the 1920s and 1930s, in contrast to architects in Berlin or Frankfurt who explored wholly new conceptions of architectural space at the time.
The Wagner schools liking for monumentality and traditional city grids was serendipitous for Viennas city council. Like most European capitals after the first world war, Vienna faced an enormous housing crisis, with overcrowding, high rents and mass unemployment. Unlike almost all other capitals, though, the city government  overwhelmingly dominated by Austro-Marxists, well to the left of most Social Democrats  didnt respond with suburbanisation, but with a rebuilding of the inner city.
The city government considered the decentralising ideas of architectural radicals to be both expensive and detrimental to the interests of Viennese workers. Instead, they wanted to keep them in workplaces in high-density, in tight-knit communities, only with far higher standards than they had before.
As a result the city embarked on an enormous building programme  putting up 64,000 flats in less than 10 years, housing around a quarter of a million people  funded by heavy taxation of the wealthy and, particularly, of landlords, who were of course thoroughly dispossessed by the programme, and who later became Viennas main supporters of Austrian Fascism.

With the municipality building in the inner city, the architects of  Red Vienna  were perfectly placed to give that an appropriate face  proud, monumental, a little bit melodramatic. Each of the dozens of Hofe (courts) dotted around the Vienna inner ring road follows the historical street line, refusing to break with the traditional layouts as they meet the pedestrian.
But the difference is inside. Their grand archways lead not, as in 19th century housing, to progressively more dingy and squalid sub-apartments around gloomy courtyards, but to open, park-like spaces, full of social buildings, trees and playgrounds. The decorative details like sculptures, murals, majolica tiles, were added as a way of keeping craftsmen in work during a period of widespread unemployment.
Rather than the total rejection of the 19th century that was becoming the norm in Berlin, Rotterdam, Paris or Moscow, this was an adaptation of the pomp, centralisation and street-centred planning of the imperial city to very different political ends. Here, the pomp and centralisation were a means to celebrate not the emperor, but the proletariat.
These buildings shouted from the rooftops that the Viennese workers and their elected representatives were transforming the city in our own interests  and they did so in places where they couldnt be avoided.
Outside Vienna, the anti-semitic, nationalistic Christian Social Party dominated Austria , and considered these buildings to be literally fortresses of a hostile, alien, urban movement; their allegation that they were built for military purposes was tested when, in February 1934, a constitutional crisis led to right-wing paramilitaries and the army being sent to Karl Marx Hof, Engelshof, Bebelhof, George Washington Hof and the others to suppress the city.
The city fought back, but it was poorly armed and ill-prepared. Karl Marx Hof itself was heavily shelled. Hundreds were killed in the brief conflict.
After the Anschluss and after the war, the city of Vienna would build again, and the city still has the most extensive  and arguably the finest  social housing programme of any capital city in Europe. So, in a sense, they won in the end.

On a typical day, the romantically named Menghua Jie (Dream Flower Street) is a hive of activity. Residents hurry around on bicycles and scooters, and food vendors do brisk business selling hand-pulled noodles. This is Shanghais Old Town, the traditional core of the Chinese city dating back to 1554, when walls were first erected to ward off Japanese pirates preying in nearby waters.
In the street stands a handsome mansion, built in the 1930s by a capitalist called Lin Guisheng, who named it Ximeng Lu, meaning Hope for an Heir. An elegant mix of European and traditional Chinese designs, the building was reminiscent of early 20th century Shanghai when western influences, a result of foreign concessions that forced the city open, seeped into local culture, design and architecture. Touches of Art Deco motifs line the walls and ceilings; mosaic tiles with Buddhist swastikas cover the floors. A pair of stone lions, traditional Chinese symbols of wealth, sit under the eaves of a balcony.
But Ximeng is emblematic of a darker side of Shanghai history that is often forgotten in the wake of rapid urbanisation: during the second Sino-Japanese War in 1938 the mansion was turned into a comfort station, a military brothel where local women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army.
Ximeng is emblematic of a darker side of Shanghais history that is often forgotten in the wake of rapid urbanisation
Hundreds of thousands of women from China, Korea and other occupied territories were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army. Peipei Qiu estimates there were 400,000 victims
When the war reached Shanghai  leaving parts of the city buried in rubble and corpses  Lin fled for Hong Kong, and his mansion was abandoned to a dark legacy of sexual violence and rape .
For low-ranked soldiers using Ximeng, or one of the hundreds of other comfort stations across China , sex was conducted in one of many rooms with beds placed in rows, separated by thin curtains. One can imagine the sounds of masculine grunts, creaking beds and muffled cries echoing across the wooden stairwell as the women were raped by scores of Japanese soldiers.
Strict rules governing soldier behaviour were displayed prominently within the mansion: The entrant must register and pay to obtain an entry voucher and a condom; The entry voucher holder must enter the designated room and has an allotted time of 30 minutes.
Strict regulations were displayed in the so-called comfort stations
The women endured routine examinations to prevent the spread of venereal diseases and were given contraception. Some Japanese military personnel even received accountancy classes on how to manage comfort stations, including how to determine the actuarial durability or perishability of the women procured.
Following victory in Shanghai, an emboldened Japanese army marched to the then-capital Nanjing where it unleashed a massacre, killing up to 300,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants . An estimated 20,000 women  including infants and the elderly  were raped, with many subsequently mutilated and killed in what became known as the Rape of Nanjing. One reason for Japans rolling out of comfort stations across China was to regulate the sexual aggression of its soldiers , and Shanghai was home to an estimated 158 stations, more than any other city in China.
After the war ended in 1945 and the Communist party takeover four years later, the mansion resumed its residential purpose in the form of social housing. More than 10 families were assigned rooms in the mansion, a cross-section of political and economic classes crammed under one roof. Families labelled as capitalists were reduced to small rooms in the back, with workers and party members assigned more generous spaces. A descendent of Lin, the original owner, is believed to still live quietly in a small room on the top floor of the mansion.

Over the decades, rooms were further halved to accommodate growing families. This was the reality of communal living across Shanghai, a cheek-by-jowl arrangement that remained largely unchanged even after China opened up post-1979 . Housing reform allowed some Shanghainese residents to move out to newer and more spacious properties; they then rent their rooms to migrant families, maintaining the compressed state of affairs.
All those living in the building know of its history but uncomfortably try to ignore the aura left behind by the violated women, some of whom killed themselves after the war. Residents endured further trauma during Chairman Maos Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 70s, when neighbours turned on each other and capitalist families and political opponents were mercilessly attacked, and many died. Few of the older generation like to talk about those times.

Places like Ximeng mansion are bricks and mortar testaments to Shanghais tumultuous 20th century history. As the city demolishes vast swaths of old neighbourhoods to usher in gleaming new facades, they represent the dark side of a forgotten history that helped shape the city. Championing the preservation of old houses in Shanghai, whether on the grounds of historical or architectural significance, is bureaucratically challenging and rarely successful, especially when they occupy prime real estate. Residents of Ximeng mansion expect their home will suffer a similar fate in the coming years.
There are few calls for the preservation of former comfort stations, with the memorialisation of their victims channelled through official narratives and designated sites. Historian Su Zhiliang, who founded the Research Centre for Chinese Comfort Women at Shanghai Normal University , collects testimonials to campaign for justice and recognition of past atrocities. He has for years called for city authorities to turn Shanghais first comfort station into a museum. Like Ximeng mansion, the building is decaying and crowded with families.It is unclear if Su will be successful.
Ximeng mansion is another story. Once built out of hope, all that is left behind is a legacy of despair.

The small concrete room at the end of the narrow walkway behind the Ansar Ali supermarket is in darkness thanks to another power cut. Faded trade union posters line the walls of this, the Bangladesh National Garment Workers Federations (NGWF) office. Sat on a plastic chair in the middle of the room, light filtering in through the open door, Shahorbanu relives the story of losing a son to the Rana Plaza.
Siddique was a 24-year-old garment worker, a tall man affectionate with his mother and his little son, Parvez. When, on 24 April 2013, the eight-storey factory complex collapsed , Siddique became trapped under thousands of tonnes of rubble. He managed to take his mobile phone out of his pocket and call his mother. Shahorbanu describes his terrified voice pleading: Ma, please save me. Somehow, just please save me.
As Shahorbanu tells her story, Rafiqul Islam, vice-president of the federation for the Greater Dhaka city suburb of Savar, walks through the door. Tall with curly black hair, the sight of him brings Shahorbanu to tears. My son was just like him. I miss when he would come back home and call me Ma  Umma. It is a great suffering to bury the body of a son.
It was Siddiques 19-year-old brother Bijan who eventually found his body, five days after the collapse. Working as a rescuer digging bodies out of the rubble left Bijan traumatised. Shahorbanu describes him as unable to tolerate any loud sounds  even loud talking.

In the 90 seconds it took to collapse, the Rana Plaza garment complex became a symbol of global inequality. Considered the deadliest unintended structural failure of modern times, global trade unions called it mass industrial homicide. The Rana Plaza Coordination Committee , set up in response to the disaster, puts the final death toll at 1,134 people.
The wreckage, cleared away by day labourers with baskets of rubble on their heads, also signified a city out of control  where illegally constructed buildings buckle under the weight of people and machinery because regulation has been trumped by competition and profit.
Two years on, the only visible memorial to the devastation is two giant granite fists clutching a hammer and sickle, erected by the Workers Party of Bangladesh. Neighbourhood talk is that a new factory will soon be built on the site, as global demand for cheap clothing continues to grow.

Bangladesh is the worlds second-largest garment producer, churning out billions of pieces of clothing each year. International brands are typically attracted by cities where costs of production  including wages, employment benefits, and health and safety  are as low as possible. Prior to Rana Plaza there had already been a string of disasters in Bangladeshs garment industry, culminating in the Tazreen factory fire that killed 112 people six months earlier. Yet business continued as usual.
On the morning of the collapse, garment workers and managers argued on the forecourt outside Rana Plaza . Large cracks had appeared in the building the day before, and the workers did not want to go inside. Another devastated mother, Argina, says her 18-year-old daughter, Rubina, was told if she didnt show up for work that day then she would not be paid for the month. She had only been working there for four months before she died.
Rana Plaza is a story of city life for millions of impoverished women in the modern world. Bangladeshs garment industry is 85-90% staffed by women ; they are the machine operators, the garment quality inspectors, the ones who press shirts and snip loose threads six days a week for 12 hours a day.
Women also make up the majority of the 5,000 people  disabled survivors and families of victims  who are still owed compensation by the brands that used Rana Plaza. Moushumee worked on the seventh floor in a factory called New Wave Style; she survived the collapse but remains traumatised, tortured by nightmares and unable to set foot in another garment factory.
A strong trade union might have been able to evacuate Rana Plaza, but Bangladeshs labour laws are skewed in favour of factory owners. Violence against union organisers is frequent. In the NGWF Savar office, Rafiqul Islam rolls up his trousers to reveal shins covered in scars from being beaten with sticks by factory management thugs. He claims that if a factory wants to terminate a workers contract, they place a gun or a knife in full view of the resignation forms they want signed.
Brad Loewen, a former chief building official for the city of Winnipeg, works on the 12th floor of a Dhaka tower block. His office is new and sparse; there is a desk, a map of Bangladesh and a suit jacket on a hanger. Loewen is the chief inspector for the Bangladesh Accord on Building and Fire Safety, a legally binding agreement between brands and trade unions established after Rana Plaza to replace the voluntary arrangements that went before.

The view from Loewens office gives a sense of the sheer size of Dhaka; the city is a seemingly infinite web of pale buildings surrounded by a haze of smog. Roughly 4,000 of these buildings are garment factories, of which 1,500 are covered by the accord. Opposite is Hossain Market, a garment factory where 1,200 workers from the Tuba Group went on hunger strike in 2014.
During a catastrophic failure its columns that fail, Loewen explains. A building such as the Rana Plaza complex should have been built to withstand twice its anticipated load, but in Dhaka, with its lack of construction watchdogs, buildings commonly get under-built.
No ones watching them, Loewen says of Dhakas contractors. Theres no government regulator, theres no overall project management  Theyre just building whatever they want.
Rana Plaza had numerous illegal floors built on a hopelessly weak structure. Its construction materials were of extremely poor quality, and giant vibrating generators had been placed on several floors to keep the power on and the sewing machines running during the citys regular power cuts. More and more people, machines and fabric bales were crammed inside until the load-bearing columns cracked apart.
In the two years since the Rana Plaza tragedy, Loewens team of 70 Bangladeshi engineers has evacuated or closed 17 unsafe buildings. The team normally carries out 200 inspections a month, but political unrest and violence in Dhaka means they have achieved only 50 visits in the first few months of 2015.
One building they were able to inspect was the Mega Chois Knitwear factory. Having been found highly unsafe, it is now suspended from the Accord process for refusing to evacuate . The inspection found that the factory had 600 employees, a childcare centre on the sixth floor, and just one unprotected exit out of the building. According to Loewen: The chances of people getting out of that building in the case of a fire are extremely limited.

        <title>Pruitt-Igoe: the troubled high-rise that came to define urban America – a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 21</title>

If you propose a high-rise public housing project in America, your opponents will almost certainly use Pruitt-Igoe as a rhetorical weapon against you  and defeat you with it. The Captain WO Pruitt Homes and William L Igoe Apartments, a racially segregated, middle-class complex of 33 11-storey towers, opened to great fanfare on the north side of St Louis between 1954 and 1956. But within a decade, it would become a decrepit warehouse exclusively inhabited by poor, black residents. Within two decades, it would undergo complete demolition.
Whether you call Pruitt-Igoes short, troubled existence a failure of architecture, a failure of policy, or a failure of society, its fate remains bound up with, and reflective of, the fate of many American cities in the mid-20th century.
Even before the dust settled from the infamous, widely televised 1972 implosion of one of Pruitt-Igoes buildings (the last of which wouldnt fall until 1976), the argument that the design had doomed it gained serious traction. Architectural historian Charles Jencks cites that much-seen dynamiting as the moment  modern architecture died .
Other detractors used the occasion to hold up its architect, Minoru Yamasaki , for condemnation as a figurehead of all the supercilious, social-engineering modernists too high-minded and self-regarding to consider the needs of regular people. But on closer examination, Yamasaki comes out looking more like a victim himself.

Commissioned to design a public housing project federally financed under the Housing Act of 1949 , the Japanese-American architect at first came up with a mixed-rise cluster of buildings. Objecting to the price of his plan, the Public Housing Administration insisted on a cost-saving uniform tower height of 11 storeys. The Korean War and squabbles in Congress ensured that the construction budget only got more straitened thereafter, resulting in poor build quality and cheap fixtures that showed strain not long after the first occupants arrived.
Those inclined to read the story of Pruitt-Igoe as a morality play of 20th-century architectural hubris tend to describe Yamasakis design, laughingly, as award-winning when in fact it won no such thing. Architectural Forum did praise his original proposal as 1951s best high apartment, citing its spatial efficiency, allowance for plenty of outdoor green space and innovations such as limited-stop elevators. But in 1965, the magazine re-examined the reality of the project and declared it a failure.
Pruitt-Igoe became a byword for the kind of dysfunctional urban abyss that, during the decades of white flight after the second world war, Americans who had the means believed they were escaping by moving out of cities. From the safety of their new, suburban communities, they looked upon central cities as too dirty, too crowded, too criminal  and, in many regions of the country, too black.
Not even Pruitt-Igoes heartiest apologists would call it a success. Its 2,870 units reached a peak of 91% occupancy in 1957, a figure that would plummet below 35% by 1971, when just 600 people remained in the 17 of the complexs buildings that were not yet boarded up. Reports proliferated of property crime, gang activity, drug dealing, prostitution and murder. Heaters, toilets, garbage incinerators and electricity all malfunctioned, and at one point the faulty plumbing let loose floods of raw sewage through the hallways.
Though built for the middle class, Pruitt-Igoe became an economic and racial ghetto soon after it opened

Though built for the middle class, Pruitt-Igoe became an economic and racial ghetto soon after it opened, in large part due to bad timing. The design, drawn up when Missouri law still mandated the segregation of public facilities, originally designated the Pruitt half of the complex (named after second world war fighter pilot Wendell O Pruitt) for black residents only, and the Igoe half (after former US Congressman William L Igoe) as white only.
But then came sweeping desegregation following the US supreme courts 1954 Brown vs Board of Education verdict . In the aftermath, fearful white residents took flight, and the whole of Pruitt-Igoe became an exclusively black dwelling  with many black residents also decamping for the periphery, reducing Pruitt-Igoes tenant pool to those who simply couldnt live anywhere else.
Often, these residents arrived as migrants from the USs underdeveloped south, in search of work in the industries that, so they discovered, had already left for the suburbs themselves. Essential building maintenance, paid for by modest rental fees drawn from an ever smaller and more impoverished group of tenants, ended up deferred and ultimately denied. And so the people of Pruitt-Igoe made do as best they could in their increasingly derelict homes, feeling marooned on the end of a city seemingly on its own inexorable downward slide.
Why did St Louis take on the public-housing mandate that produced the likes of Pruitt-Igoe in the first place? In the late 1940s, when the growth of American cities looked unstoppable, officials had projected a million-strong population by 1970 that would require aggressive slum clearance and high-density urban renewal. In reality, St Louis lost a third of its residents over that period  a decline that had begun as early as the 1930s.

Even today, when our eyes have supposedly grown accustomed to all manner of developments meant to shock us with their sheer incongruity, aerial photographs of the Pruitt-Igoe complex give you pause. There it stands, like a poor mans Ville Radieuse , on 23 freshly cleared hectares of St Louiss existing urban fabric, looking utterly alien to the miles of low-rise 19th and early 20th-century brick structures surrounding it.
But these images of Pruitt-Igoe have a much less firm a place in the culture than those of Pruitt-Igoes destruction, an event that  though commentators have used it in the service of a variety of political points  on balance reinforced the American fear of the type of tall, high-density housing that is so common today in the rich cities of east Asia.
Related: Pruitt Igoe: Blowing up this St Louis housing project was easier than demolishing the myth it created
The same animus manifests, to an extent, in England as well; the year before Pruitt-Igoe came fully down, JG Ballard published High Rise , his novel of an upper-middle-class London condominium tower that devolves almost immediately into an ultraviolent bacchanal.
I never thought people were that destructive, Yamasaki said to the Architectural Review, lamenting the vandalism that beset Pruitt-Igoe in the 1960s. Its a job I wish I hadnt done.
But while Pruitt-Igoe underwent its prolonged, agonising demolition in the early 1970s, a much more iconic work of Yamasakis opened for business: the twin towers of New York Citys World Trade Center. It took a deliberate, rigorously planned act of terrorism to bring down that piece of architectural modernism, whereas Pruitt-Igoe met its end in a perfect storm of 20th-century economic, demographic and political urban misfortunes.

Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Mumbai's iconic railway station  a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 20
The old Victoria Terminus was the first truly public building in Bombay. So when it became a target of the 2008 terrorist attacks, what was violated was much more than just a railway station

Almost anyone who has lived in Mumbai has paused in the common area at the head of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus suburban train platforms  not least to relieve the pervading mugginess by getting in the way of the industrial strength blowers that pass for fans.
From here one sees trains pull in, and commuters step off even before the train has stopped. A residual momentum propels them out into the city, as if the characteristic buzz of Mumbai is generated entirely in its trains.
It would be reason enough to pick Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus) as the building most emblematic of Mumbai because more than three million of the citys residents rush through its portals every day. But this late-19th-century railway terminus happens also to be one of the finest examples of colonial architecture in the country, representing an east-meets-west style that developed here.
This is also where the first passenger train service in India started; the railway would prove indispensable to Mumbais functioning and growth. The terminus was also perhaps the first truly public building in what was then Bombay. Now, its structure is iconic to the point of cliche: when a Hindi film needs to establish a scene as happening in Mumbai, its CST that fills the screen, a stately edifice amid a swirl of traffic and people.
A language was put together ... for monumental public buildings, and it gave the city centre its identity

And so, when CST became a target of the 2008 terrorist attacks , what was violated was much more than a railway station. Fifty-eight people died here; more than 100 were injured. Few Mumbaikars had seen the insides of the five-star hotels that were also attacked, but everyone had walked on the platforms that were seen bloodied in news reports. To strike CST was to get at the heart of Mumbai.
The prominence of CST has much to do with its location  it connects the administrative and business centre of the city with its residential suburbs. The urban juncture it occupies has its roots in the 1860s as the city of Bombay began changing its character from a military post of the British to a mercantile capital.
The governor of Bombay, Sir Bartle Frere , had the fort demolished and created room for a group of public buildings. These were built from 1860 to around 1900, and they came to define the city of Bombay: the Bombay Municipal Corporation building, the Sir JJ School of Art, Bombay University, the High Court, the Western Railway offices, the General Post Office, and of course Victoria Terminus  also known as VT.
The favoured aesthetic was the gothic revival that was then fashionable in England, but architects and builders in Bombay had to work with Indian craftsmen, material, motifs and climate. The result was a style that has been called, among other things, Bombay Gothic. As Prasad Shetty, an urbanist who teaches at Mumbais School of Environment and Architecture , explains: A language was put together during this period for monumental public buildings, and it gave the city centre its identity. The pinnacle of this gothic revival in Bombay was VT.

Victoria Terminus was designed by the architect FW Stevens and built over 10 years to open in 1887. From the outside, it looks far more imposing that its three storeys for its profusion of spires, turrets, domes and gables. Close up, the building is heavily ornamented with floral and animal patterns. The grand, modern identity the British sought for their colonial cities must have been evident in this cathedral that enshrined the power of steam locomotion. Above the central dome of the station is a personification of the whole affair, a 14-foot-tall statue of Progress.
Its doubtful whether the colonial origins of the station even register with commuters today, who stream through as if the structure were invisible. Victoria Terminus was officially renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in 1996, but it is still common to hear a snappy VT return at ticket counters across the city.
Mumbai and the railways were made for each other. The city is constrained by the sea to be narrow, so distances are large and discouraging of other means of commute. This also mean fewer train lines are required to connect the city. Although the trains are packed to bursting, they remain the most reliably predictable form of commute, essential for a city that runs on commerce. Mumbai is perhaps the only Indian city where many who can afford a car and a driver still choose to travel by public transport.
The first passenger rail service in India started from here in 1853, going north to Thane through what are today densely populated suburbs. Soon, tracks were laid across the country and Victoria Terminus housed the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (now Central Railway). The original platforms are now used for suburban trains and an extension to the station, constructed in 1929, for intercity trains. Mumbai has grown as a city of migrants and for many, the citys first taste must have been this railway station.
Shetty points out that VT was the first colonial structure in Bombay that counted as a truly public space in its scale and its ability to hold people inside and outside with generosity. Its true that there were already markets, clubs, colleges and religious shrines, but none was open to all. With the construction of VT, here was a building shared between Europeans and Indians of all religions, castes and classes.
Video: CST flash mob
More than a century later, it was this public space that came under attack. Yet the trains were back in service the following morning, and the space began to be reclaimed by normalcy  and occasionally, something more ...
There cant be many songs about valour and sacrifice that also qualify as joyful, but then Hindi cinema contains improbable riches. On an evening, exactly three years and a day after the attacks, the stations public address system stopped announcing trains and burst into one such song. A flash mob of 200 Mumbai residents danced for around four minutes in the area leading to the platforms, then rushed off into the city  as if they had just got off a train, and had many things to do.

        <MainBody>Ramallah culture in five words
A misunderstood, resilient, cosmopolitan bubble
Sound of the city
The sound of people selling a variety of fruits  strawberries, loquat, green almonds and green chickpeas  is common in Ramallah. These might sound exotic, but theyre common here.
This sound is so representative of Ramallah  it is at once reminiscent of a different era, but is also a practice that manages to continue to exist amid the bustle of daily life.
Everyones tuning into 
Radio Nisaa , launched in the city in 2009, and still run from here today. Its the first female-focused radio station. Women and men alike tune in on a daily basis from all over the West Bank. The programmes cater to listeners across generations, social status and geographic location.
It provides a platform for dialogue and entertainment, while also raising awareness of womens opinions on social, cultural, entrepreneurial and political matters in Ramallah, Palestine and the region.
Best local artist
This embroidered work by young Palestinian artist Majd Abdel Hami takes the face of Muhammad Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire almost two years ago, catalysing a wave of protests in Arab countries
Majd Abdel Hamid is a young Palestinian visual artist, based in Ramallah. His works look to deconstruct symbols of national identity and challenge the imagery of victimhood and taboos.
He uses a variety of media including embroidery/cross stitching, videos, public intervention, sculptures and paintings to touch on issues ranging from depression to conflict analysis. His latest work is currently being showcased at the Al Mamal Foundation for Contemporary Art in Jerusalem.
Whos top of the playlist?
Boikutt (Muqataa) is a Ramallah-based musician who creates sounds using sampled material, field recordings and electronic devices. The results range between hip-hop, downtempo, glitch and ambient. His industrial sound is a natural reflection of the environment he lives in. The sounds of machine-guns, helicopters, bombs, sonic weapons used in Israeli incursions and the deafening noise of construction all populate his music.
He has composed and produced music for artists such as Kronos Quartet, Bukue One and Tamer Abu-Ghazaleh , to name a few. Boikutt is also co-founder and member of audio-visual group Tashweesh , with whom he is currently touring.
Whats the big talking point?
The recent staged kidnapping , set up by Niv Asraf (an young Israeli man serving in the IDF), along with his friend, as a strategy for Asraf to win back his ex-girlfriend. He pretended that a group of Palestinians had kidnapped him, causing severe strain among local Palestinians in nearby villages and nightly raids by the IDF into Beit Anun, a Palestinian town where his friend reportedly claimed Asraf has been taken by the kidnappers. Many people felt the prank was unwarranted and inappropriate, causing Palestinians in Ramallah and all over the West Bank to fear that events similar to those of last summer might be re-lived.
Best current venue

Radio is an arts space with its own bar/restaurant inside a converted historic stone house. Not far from the centre of town, its located in Masyoon district. It has a lovely outdoor garden, perfect for warm summer nights. One night there might be a live jazz band, on the weekend you might find DJs spinning deep house and mid-week you might just find an art exhibition opening.
They will soon be launching a 24-hour radio station where you will be able to stream playlists of the venues choice or tune into live music nights that take place.
What Ramallah does better than anywhere else
Ramallah is the epicentre of Palestinian nightlife: cafes, pubs, lounges, countless house parties, dive bars, hipster joints and fine dining are all within easy reach. On a weekend youll find traditional coffee shops packed with people smoking shisha. We Palestinians are very lively, love to sing and to celebrate festive occasions.
But, nightlife in a city under occupation is a complicated story. Its not something to celebrate but, in my opinion, nightlife in the city is so intense and vibrant in part because of the difficult, entrapping situation we live in  with atrocities always in the background. Residents of Ramallah are restricted and cannot travel to Jerusalem or other cities nearby easily  it has therefore become a refuge, or oasis of sorts. In that way its a very paradoxical place; similar to a mini Beirut. Its known as a bubble  its a place to escape Palestinian reality. There are definitely major issues with this.
Best cultural Instagram account
Ahmad Daghlas is a fashion photographer who often captures images of daily life in Ramallah on his Instagram. He posts beautiful images of cafes, nature, dance festivals and Palestinian cuisine. This photograph is of an Easter parade that took place in the city.
Moment from history
When Mohammad Asaf won Arab Idol (a spin off of American Idol) in 2013, the final episode was streamed live in the centre of the city. There were thousands of people climbing on top of one another to catch a glimpse of the young winner on screen. His fans were screaming with joy, hanging out of cars, letting off fireworks and celebrating his win.
Asaf might be from Gaza, but for a Palestinian to win Arab Idol was a huge moment for people in our city because it gave everyone a feeling of hope, happiness and buoyancy. A victory so unattainable to most in the Middle East was achieved by a fellow Palestinian.
Comedy gold
Everyone loves Maysoon Zayid. She is a Palestinian-American whose family is originally from a village outside of Ramallah and she happens to have cerebral palsy. Shes hilarious. She frequently comes to Palestine to perform her routine in Arabic and English. She uses comedy and acting as a form of activism to raise awareness about the political situation here, along with discussing the difficulties of growing up Palestinian with her disability. She also does a lot of charity work and spends the summers running an arts programme to help disabled Palestinian children in refugee camps.
Best street art

This piece can be found on a section of the separation wall just outside of Ramallah. The artist, Majd Abdel Hamid, has spray-painted letters of words from the Palestinian Declaration of Independence . Each individual letter of the declaration was sprayed on the wall in Arabic from start to finish.
From me
A native of Ramallah, Christina Ganim worked as assistant producer on the documentary Speed Sisters and is co-founder of Kenz Woman , an online lingerie boutique coming soon to the Middle East.

        <title>Kharkiv's Derzhprom: Europe’s first skyscraper complex  – a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 19</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/20/kharkiv-derzhprom-building-europe-first-skyscraper-history-cities-50-buildings</Link>

Derzhprom, the House of State Industry, is a large governmental building at the centre of Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest city. It is also arguably the most interesting  and one of the least known  buildings of the heroic age of modern architecture in the interwar years.
One reason why it isnt as famous as it could be is that Kharkiv is not particularly well-known outside of Ukraine; another because the architects who designed it were not among the theory-spinning ideologues and stars of the modern movement. Had it been built in Berlin or Paris, however, youd definitely know all about it.
Occupying the centre of a vast circular plaza are three clusters of concrete-and-glass towers, whose height ranges from five to 10 storeys. Theyre symmetrical, but you can only tell if you stand right in the middle of the square. On their own these would be impressive enough  an instant skyline of mini-skyscrapers built up all at once  but what really makes Derzhprom is the series of interconnecting skybridges between each cluster, shooting across and up as high as eight storeys.
Here are the motifs of western architecture in the 1960s: an angular, ultra-metropolitan architecture of vaulting bridges and clustered high-rises, invented several decades early in eastern Ukraine . Here is brutalism, three decades before the term was coined.
Having withstood numerous swings from Ukrainisation to Russification and back, Derzhprom stands both dynamic and still
Sometimes the building turns up in architectural histories, but always as if someone has chanced upon it. Usually it is miscredited in terms of its age, its architects and its function  sometimes as an office block, sometimes a factory. The reality is more dramatic.
To understand the buildings crazed ambition, its monumental scale and its determined avoidance of any historic reference or cliche, you need to know that Kharkiv was the capital of Soviet Ukraine from 1919 to 1934. An industrial, Russophone city, this was where the Ukrainian Bolsheviks placed their capital after an uprising at Kievs Arsenal plant failed in early 1918, suppressed by the vaguely social democratic Ukrainian Peoples Republic that then ruled the city as the Russian Empire collapsed.

The plan for the building was put forward at a public competition in 1925, by local architect Viktor Trotsenko. Photograph: R Jakimenko/RIA Novosti
The Derzhprom was intended as the central building, the Houses of Parliament as it were, of an entire country  a function which became obsolete in less than a decade after it was built.
Many Ukrainian Bolsheviks considered any concession to local nationalism to be bourgeois, but Lenin disagreed, forcing them into a coalition with the Borotbists, a left-wing Ukrainian nationalist party. After victory in the post-revolutionary civil war and joining the new USSR in 1922, the new Ukrainian Soviet Republic took federation seriously.
Its laws and policies were often more radical even than those of the Russian Soviet Republic, while a determined effort was made to Ukrainise the Russophone cities  in government, education, the press and the arts (something pursued especially avidly by the national communist commissar of education, Mykola Skrypnyk).
Away from Moscow! was the slogan propounded by avant-garde groups such as New Generation . Kharkiv was intended to be a real rather than a ceremonial capital, but unlike Kiev, the rival Ukrainian Peoples Republics capital and the historic capital of Kievan Rus, it lacked big, declarative public buildings. This problem was to be solved at one stroke.
At a public competition in 1925, a plan put forward by the local architect Viktor Trotsenko was accepted. The governmental centre would take the form of a circus penetrated by an enormous wedge of empty space  now called Freedom Square, the second-largest square in Europe at the time it was built. The team of Sergei Serafimov, Samuel Kravets and Mark Felger  obscure young academic architects from Odessa and Vilnius  proposed to fill this with towers in a minimal, unpretentious modern idiom, modelled more on the style of the glassy  daylight factories  of Detroit and the interconnected skyscrapers of Chicago , than on Le Corbusier or the Bauhaus.
By 1926 it was under way, and was finished in 1928 when the Ukrainian Soviet Republics central committee, commissariats, planning commissions, various industrial enterprises, a library and even a hotel were aptly clustered together in its towers. It became the first complex of skyscrapers in Europe , and perhaps unsurprisingly, had many visitors.
While numbers of tourists of the revolution stopped to be awed by these towers with their rush of glass surfaces  full-height, 10-storey glazed stairwells and long skyways lined with windows  the avant-garde of Soviet architects, the likes of El Lissitzky or Ivan Leonidov, didnt think it went nearly far enough. Ironically, their unbuilt and unbuildable buildings are more famous.

However, this is one of the very few built structures to give an impression of what a constructivist city might have been like: a delirious crashing together of Americanism and communism.
But for the purpose it was built, as the headquarters of Ukrainian communism, its days were numbered almost as soon as it opened. As early as 1929, the national communists began to be repressed; by 1932, famine was raging in the countryside around, and refugees flocked to Kharkiv. Mykola Skrypnyk, the commissar who had tried hardest to reconcile Ukrainian cultural nationalism and Bolshevik communism, shot himself in his office in one of the towers in 1933.
The following year, the Ukrainian Republic moved to Kiev, and the building became the House of State Industry  shortened to Derzhprom in Ukrainian, and Gosprom in Russian.
The building survived several attempts by its Nazi occupiers to blow it up in 1942-3  as well as the re-cladding of its modernist neighbours in heavy neoclassical style in the 1950s; the placing of a radio transmitter on top of one of the towers in the same decade; an inept partial renovation 50 years later (a white paint job that stopped at the front facade); and the destruction of the Lenin statue in front of it last year.
Having withstood numerous swings of local politics from Ukrainisation to Russification and back, it stands both dynamic and still. No building in the former Soviet Union expresses so vividly the undercurrents of utopian socialism and Americanised modernism that ran through the Communist revolutions early years.

In 1935, the Italian air force launched chemical attacks on Ethiopian villages in the second act of a 40-year campaign to establish their Africa Orientale Italiana (Italian East Africa). The nightmarish vision of modern flying machines delivering death from the skies was a futurists dream  the perfect marriage of modernity and war, inseparable bedfellows and defining experiences of the 20th century. For Africa , encounters with modernity were particularly brutal but, amid the destruction they caused, there were remarkable examples of construction.
One of the most surprising legacies of this campaign was Asmara, the jewel in Italys former imperial crown and today the capital of Eritrea , Ethiopias northern neighbour. The Italians arrived in Asmara in 1889, but Mussolinis invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 transformed the sleepy colonial town into Africas most modern metropolis. Overnight, the skeletal form of a modern and brilliant urban plan, conceived in the 1910s by a particularly enlightened Italian architect-engineer Odoardo Cavagnari, was lavishly clothed in modernist architecture.
Sitting on its mountain perch 2,500 metres above the Red Sea, Asmara is an unlikely setting for a modernist urban idyll. Unlike other North African colonial cities appended to older urban settlements  Casablanca, Rabat, Mogadishu, Benghazi, and Tripoli  the Italians planned Eritreas modern settlements largely from scratch. Modern urban planning was liberally applied in Eritrea  for example, in Agordat, Assab, Dekemhare, Keren, and Mendefera  but the simultaneous experience of Italys conquest of Ethiopia and modernisms global pre-war climax is what makes Asmara so special.

From 1935 until the allied defeat of Italy in 1941 (the allies first significant victory of the second world war), hundreds of buildings were designed by Italian architects and constructed by Eritreans in a variety of styles from modernisms broad palette, including novecento, rationalism and futurism. Far from home, the imagination of Italian architects in Eritrea could run a little wild. The result was a startling collection of sumptuous cinemas, fantastical factories, stylish shops, beautiful bars and restaurants, plush hotels and abundant residences. Even government buildings exuded style. While Asmaras renowned architectural character was derived largely from the geometric simplicity and aesthetic purity of rationalism (a specifically Italian brand of modernism), the citys most remarkable structure, the Fiat Tagliero service station, is an unashamed tribute to futurism, an Italian artistic movement that had comparatively little architectural exposure.
Futurisms founding father, the Italian poet and theorist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, rejected the past and idolised speed, technology and war. Embodying these qualities in a colonial context, Fiat Tagliero was a monument to the aeroplane and a concrete reminder of the often-bitter universal experiences of the 20th century that shaped so many cities around the world. With its breathtaking 30-metre cantilevered wings, cockpit body and sleek wrap-around windows, Fiat Tagliero suits its surreal surroundings high above the clouds. Completed in 1938, the building was designed by Giuseppe Pettazzi months after Italian aeroplanes dispensed thousands of sulphur mustard shells and the asphyxiate diphenylchloroarsine (nicknamed mask-breaker by German troops in the first world war for its agonising effectiveness) killing tens of thousands of innocent Ethiopian civilians. These modern machines were even fitted with special vaporisers to enhance the chemicals dispersal. Protests to the League of Nations by Ethiopias Emperor Haile Selassie fell on deaf ears.
Futurisms technologically inspired nihilism excited Italys fascists as much as Mussolinis conquests in Africa excited the futurists. Marinettis Manifesto of Futurism in 1909 was an ode to war. In 1912, he reported from Libya during an earlier chapter in Italys empire building, writing: War is beautiful because it initiates the dreamt-of metallisation of the human body. In 1914 he was briefly imprisoned with fellow pro-war activist Benito Mussolini, whom he joined as a fascist electoral candidate for Milan in 1919. In 1935 he returned to Africa to witness Italys conquest of Ethiopia and to fuel his grisly artistic fascination.

Fiat Tagliero was built on a major intersection where any of Asmaras 50,000 cars could stock up on petrol and supplies before departing the metropolis for the airport or Eritreas southern towns and Ethiopia beyond. Its location was strategic in the wider context of Italys new Roman Empire in Africa . Modern transportation helped define Italian colonialism and Eritrea was the hub linking other colonies of Somalia, Libya and Ethiopia. Airports in Asmara and Italys Seconda Roma, the modernist town of Dekemhare a few miles south of Asmara, plugged Eritrea into a fledgling international network of air travel. A breathtaking steam railway and marvel of Italian engineering recently restored by Eritreans wound its way tortuously from Eritreas Red Sea port of Massawa over the highlands and down towards Sudan. Eritrea even boasted the worlds longest cable car route, which delivered supplies directly from the coast.
Facing south on a busy junction with its wings aloft, poised for flight, Fiat Taglieros volant structure exemplified Eritreas colonial experience. The buildings audacious design stunned the sceptical municipal authorities. Unconvinced by the architects calculations, they insisted that the wings should be supported by columns. Technical drawings submitted to the municipality showing each wing propped up by 15 poles attest to the architects deception. However, at the buildings unveiling, Pettazzi is said to have put a gun to the contractors head and ordered him to remove the supports. Under duress, the builder complied and, to the astonishment of the crowd, the massive wings stayed up.

Still standing and recently refurbished, Fiat Tagliero has long since jettisoned its original associations and assumed a more progressive role as the symbol of the Asmara Heritage Project, which is applying to Unesco for world heritage status. Fascist-era buildings are not the most obvious candidate for representing outstanding universal value , but while Eritreas harsh encounter with modernity and war has caused untold misery, it has also bestowed on this small African nation a unique form of urbanism that post-independence Eritrea has made its own. It would be hard to find a capital city in Africa, or perhaps even in the world, that is so revered by its own people and visitors alike. In a country where aeroplanes were once synonymous with colonial suppression, Fiat Tagliero symbolises the quiet determination of Eritreans to protect their rich cultural heritage, forged over centuries by their countrys strategic position at the nexus of Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
Today, as global problems cause tens of thousands of Eritreans to risk their lives reaching Europe, the international community is desperate for solutions. Asmaras Unesco bid is being supported by an enlightened international coalition that includes the British and Norwegian governments, who recognise the capacity of architecture, irrespective of its past, to effect positive change in the future. Fiat Tagliero is a fitting symbol of hope for a remarkable city.

        <title>Real street food: Tuy palov from Tashkent</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/16/tuy-palov-tashkent-uzbekistan-real-street-food</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
What is the dish?
Palov (plov or pilaf) is a very popular rice dish throughout Uzbekistan; there are more than 120 different recipes, but you can only get tuy palov in Tashkent, where I live. Although the ingredients wherever you go are pretty similar  oil, meat, onion, carrots and rice  in our variety, you add chickpeas and raisins. Id say this is the most famous and desirable food in Uzbekistan , a real signature dish. Thats why tuy palov is not just eaten by people from the markets and restaurants, its the centrepiece of weddings, parties and holidays.
Whats the history?
It is often considered to be one of the oldest recipes in Uzbek cuisine, which has Persian roots. Alexander the Great was served a kind of palov upon his capture of the Sogdian capital of Marakanda, which is now known as Samarkand. Alexanders army brought it back to Macedonia and spread it throughout Eastern Europe. Its also believed that the proper preparation of palov was first documented by the 10th-century scholar Abu Ali Ibn Sina, who, in his books on medical sciences, dedicated a whole section on preparing various meals, including several types of palov.
What does it taste like?
Tuy palov has a rich taste and its complementing flavours make it extremely moreish. As Tashkents version has raisins and chickpeas, there is also a hint of sweetness that again perfectly complements the savoury meat and vegetables. Sometimes a whole head of garlic is added, too. The meats juices run through the rice and carrots, the onion is cooked down until it becomes invisible, but it gives a special aroma to the rice that makes it incredibly flavourful.
Where can you get it?
At the Central Asian Plov (palov) Center, a food market where you can try all kinds of palov, not just tuy palov. When you order, it is served on one big plate for everyone to share. You can also get it in any family restaurant as it is a highly demanded dish in the city, but youll also find it on the table of every house on a Thursday.
How is it served?
Usually on a flat big plate so its easy to share. Tuy palov is always served with a special salad on side, which is made of fresh juicy and ripe tomatoes and crispy onions.
Anything extra?
Tuy palov is so loved that it has become an essential dish for weddings, where it is always prepared by men. In Uzbek wedding celebrations, there are huge numbers of guests  around 500 to 1000 people. For a big occasion like that, several hundred kilos of tuy palov are cooked and served early in the morning of the wedding day.
Why should someone try it?
Eating palov is a nice reason to meet your friends, but moreover it is very nutritious and filling  perfect for busy lunchtimes. You wont get hungry up until evening.
Whats the bill?
Not much; 1-2 per portion at most.
Can you make it at home?
Definitely! It is not so hard to cook if you follow the recipe and the ingredients are found easily in any shop.
What does this dish say about your Tashkent?
People are so in love with this dish and so proud of Tashkents version that they can eat it 24/7, and thats is the reason why our version, and versions from other regions, are a fantastic symbol of Uzbek cuisine. We have a saying in this country; If something kills you, it should be palov.

Walk around Beijings remaining old neighbourhoods  known for their maze of narrow alleyways, or hutongs  and you will pass by centuries worth of history. Ancient courtyard homes sit next to factory chimneys from the time the communists brought manufacturing to the city centre. In many places, the hutong neighbourhoods are completely gone, demolished to make space for the citys explosive modern growth.
The former Beijing stock exchange on Qianmen West Riverbank Street (Qianmen Xi Heyan Jie) behind Tiananmen Square is a building that has endured the citys whirlwind change. Its not a well-known building but it survives to tell an important part of Beijings development over the past century.
Tucked away among courtyard homes, the old exchange is located to the west of Qianmen, the gate that used to guard access to the inner city. The Qianmen neighbourhood has historically been Beijings centre of commerce. Geographically isolated and ruled by an increasingly conservative Qing dynasty, change had come slowly to Beijing. While skyscrapers were going up in New York and Chicago, goods still arrived in Beijing on camel-back.

At the beginning of the last century this changed. In 1906, a hole was torn through the ancient city wall and a railway station opened next to the Qianmen gate. This was the beginning of the end of the city wall and the start of a century of rapid changes. The 1911 revolution ushered in the Chinas warlord period with different factions fighting for control of the country. In Beijing, the city began its transformation from an imperial city that had seen few changes over several centuries to a modern metropolis. On West Riverbank Street by the citys moat, a growing number of banks and hotels began to appear to serve the influx of merchants. Roads were paved, and western engineering and architecture began to leave their traces on the citys streets and buildings.
While skyscrapers were going up in New York and Chicago, goods still arrived in Beijing on camel-back
It was in this turbulent environment that the Beijing stock exchange was established in 1918. It was the first stock exchange owned and operated by Chinese people. Foreigners had brought public trading to Shanghai decades earlier but a domestic securities market had never fully developed. Indicative of the growing foreign influence and capitalism, the building was a break from traditional Chinese architecture with a facade and an interior marked by both Chinese and western styles. Inside, a light-filled, two-storey gallery is surrounded by wooden pilasters, and on the second floor, an intricately designed iron fence lines the balcony.
The exchange operated for several decades before trading stopped in the 1940s. It reopened briefly after the Communist party took over in 1949, and then closed for good soon after. Like elsewhere in the city, the communist government took a practical approach to the use of the building. After housing navy cadets for a few years, the building was taken over by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and used as housing for its researchers and students.
Today, western-style capitalism and freewheeling development are back. In 1990, China got its own stock exchange again  this time in Shanghai. Meanwhile in Beijing, the first foreign fast-food chain opened in the late 1980s around the corner from the old exchange. And down the street, by the Qianmen gate, developers have now transformed the old commercial neighbourhood into a pedestrian mall, complete with faux 1930s-era shops and restaurants. In other parts of Beijing, space-age architecture dots the skyline and the citys expansion continues at a steady pace  one mega-block and high-rise compound at a time.

Qianmen West Riverbank Street has not received much attention from developers and the government. A city agency has recently renovated some of the building facades on the street  including the old exchange. The agency also put up a sign explaining the significance of the exchange in Chinese and English. The new sign stands in sharp contrast to the inside of the building. While a sense of its grandeur remains, the interior is rundown and makeshift housing structures fill the floor of the gallery. The Chinese Academy of Sciences nominally still owns the building. The tenants are no longer scholars but the two walls of active electric meters suggest that they reside there legally.
The fate of the old stock exchange lies in the hands of several layers of stakeholders, from the Chinese Academy of Science and the current tenants to the city agency and other parts of the government. So far, this relationship has mostly preserved the status quo. In this way, the ghost of the exchange provides a telling illustration of how Beijing struggles with its past with no single entity taking charge of the preservation efforts. This impasse does, however, mark a change from the time the city dealt with its old neighbourhoods by tearing them down  something the disappearance of the city wall and more than two-thirds of the citys hutongs can attest to. Today, redevelopments like the Qianmen neighbourhood, even if heavy-handed, suggest an eagerness to preserve some version of the past.
The river moat and the bankers may be long gone, but the exchange remains to tell a story of Beijing and Chinas transformation and future challenges. Given the buildings central location and the citys relentless growth, its a story that is still being written.

Coffee catastrophe beckons as climate change threatens arabica plant
Study warns that rising temperatures pose serious threat to global coffee market, potentially affecting livelihoods of small farmers and pushing up prices

Cultivation of the arabica coffee plant , staple of daily caffeine fixes and economic lifeline for millions of small farmers, is under threat from climate change as rising temperatures and new rainfall patterns limit the areas where it can be grown, researchers have warned.
Arabica, which has long been prized for its delicate and aromatic flavour, accounts for 70% of the global coffee market share. But it is particularly sensitive to temperature increases, which reduce its growth, flowering and fruiting and make it more susceptible to coffee pests.
With global temperatures forecast to increase by 2C-2.5C over the next few decades, a report predicts that some of the major coffee producing countries will suffer serious losses, reducing supplies and driving up prices.

It predicts that Brazil , Vietnam , Indonesia and Colombia  which between them produce 65% of the global market share of arabica  will find themselves experiencing severe losses unless steps are taken to change the genetics of the crops as well as the manner and areas in which it is grown.
Dr Peter Lderach, a CCAFS climate change specialist and co-author of the report, said that although some countries would be able to mitigate the massive impact of climate change by simply moving their coffee to higher, cooler areas, it was not an option for everyone.
If you look at the countries that will lose out most, theyre countries like El Salvador , Nicaragua and Honduras , which have steep hills and volcanoes, he said. As you move up, theres less and less area. But if you look at some South American or east African countries, you have plateaus and a lot of areas at higher altitudes, so they will lose much less.
Without new strategies, says the study, Brazil alone can expect its current arabica production to drop by 25% by 2050.
In Brazil, they produce coffee on the plains and dont have any mountains so they cant move up, said Lderach.
What they would have to do is look for adaptation strategies. This study shows that we urgently need to start breeding new varieties and adapting growing practices, like putting in shade to decrease temperatures. But the problem in Brazil is its very mechanised and if you put trees there, they wont be able to bring the machines in.
However, he said, even those countries with higher altitudes were likely to find themselves struggling to make up for lost land because the needs of coffee cultivation would have to be weighed up against the preservation of forests, nature reserves and national parks.
Although Indonesia, which is expected to see its arabica cultivation areas cut by up to 37%, could move production to higher areas, they tend to be home to indigenous communities and biodiverse environments.
If you dont have good, rigorous laws in place, people are just going to start going up and chopping down the forest, which would then jeopardise all the downstream benefits that people receive, such as water and carbon sequestration, said Lderach.
Countries that depend very heavily on coffee would miss all that income for development
Dr Peter Lderach
Coffee, the second-most traded commodity after oil, is grown by an estimated 25 million farmers in more than 60 tropical countries, making it a key source of revenue for many developing nations. Lderach said that failure to find new and better ways to grow arabica would have serious consequences for both humans and the environment.
If you look at Burundi or Uganda or Nicaragua, they depend very heavily on coffee, so theyd miss all that income for the development of their countries, he said.
Environmentally, because its an agro-forestry system, it brings a lot of benefits like biodiversity and soil and water conservation, and erosion control.
Although developing hardier coffee strains, planting more shade and encouraging farmers to grow other crops would help compensate for the losses wrought by climate change, said Lderach, there were no quick or easy solutions.
Breeding new varieties takes years: coffee systems are not like arable crops, where this year you do beans and the next year you do cassava, he said.
It takes three to five years before you can even harvest coffee for the first time. Its a long lead time, which is why were pointing out that its very crucial to start developing strategies now.
Lderach said the challenges ahead were so great that they demanded the combined efforts of farmers, scientists, governments and businesses.
Climate change is going to have a massive impact, so we need to emphasise that the sector  and everyone  has to work together, or everybody will lose out, he said.
There is, however another possibility: with Brazil and Central America forecast to suffer most keenly, arabica production could be shifted not upwards but further eastwards, to Africa, Asia and the Pacific.
But while such a move could revolutionise the coffee industry, it is far from risk-free.
Dr Tim Schilling, executive director of World Coffee Research , which is funded by the global coffee industry, has his doubts.
Theres competition for land among other cash crops in Indonesia and the Pacific, and it is unknown whether Africa could build the necessary capacity in terms of politics, business climate, supporting institutions and infrastructure, he said.
Schilling believes technology may yet be the best bet for coffee growers, suppliers and drinkers.
For me, it all says brace yourselves for higher prices. The only glimmer on the horizon is the ability to change the coffee plant so that it produces decent coffee and yields under a climate-constrained environment.

President Barack Obama has nominated Gayle Smith , a White House adviser, to run the US international development agency (USAid). If the move is confirmed by the Senate, Smith, a former journalist and long-time Africa expert, will be in charge of the Obama administrations development agenda for the final years of his presidency.
Smith, the senior director for development and democracy at the White Houses national security council, has had a diverse career working on humanitarian efforts in and out of government, including a stint at USAid. She would replace the former USAid administrator Rajiv Shah, who announced his resignation last year .
Obama, in announcing Smiths nomination, said Smith had earned his full confidence after working with him for nearly a decade, including six years in a top role at the White House.
Gayles energy and passion have been instrumental in guiding Americas international development policy, responding to a record number of humanitarian crises worldwide, and ensuring that development remains at the forefront of the national security agenda at a time when USAid is more indispensable than ever, the president said in a statement.
Smith, who worked for nearly two decades in Africa for news organisations including the Associated Press and the BBC, joins a small cohort of former journalists who have risen to senior ranks of foreign policy and national security in the Obama administration. UN ambassador Samantha Power, a vocal supporter of humanitarian action overseas, is a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and author, while Richard Stengel, the former managing editor of Time Magazine, holds a top role at the state department.
Obamas decision to nominate Smith comes as the US seeks to ramp up its engagement and development activities in Africa, particularly as China invests billions to expand its influence on the continent.
Earlier in his second term, Obama unveiled a Power Africa initiative involving USAid. The scheme aimed to dramatically expanding access to electricity, although its effectiveness has been questioned.
USAid and the White House have also worked to drive the global response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa, where the epidemic appears to be receding at long last.
No stranger to Africa issues, Smith was the national security councils Africa chief in the Clinton administration, a period during which she also served as an adviser at USAid. Yet the aid agencys scope is far wider and, if confirmed, Smith will also be largely responsible for the US response to situations like the earthquake in Nepal and refugee crises in the Middle East.
Whats inspired me most about Gayle over the years is her activist spirit, her dogged commitment to ensuring that, when change is necessary, we find a way to make it happen, said the secretary of state John Kerry.
Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity (Change), welcomed the nomination.
In light of the Nepal earthquake, it is critical to have a seasoned leader at the agency to respond to this and other humanitarian crises, she said. We congratulate Ms Smith on this well-deserved nomination. She is uniquely qualified to lead the agency primarily responsible for delivering US foreign aid to respond to humanitarian and other crises and to eradicate extreme poverty.
We hope that under her leadership there will be greater investment and coordination across agencies to respond to the health and human rights of women and girls globally.
USAid, which works closely with the state department, describes itself as the lead US government agency fighting poverty and promoting democracy around the world. Yet the agency has come under scrutiny over its procurement practices as well as its risky undercover work in hostile countries.

        <MainBody>Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese
In 1954, a young Indian nun working at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa dies while giving birth to identical twins. Their father, a well-respected British surgeon, disappears, abandoning the boys. Fortunately for the twins, the two doctors who deliver them become their loving, adoptive parents.
This big, bittersweet, beautifully written novel, set mostly around the hospital, follows the familys fortunes over five decades. As the boys come of age, Ethiopias turbulent politics  executions, rebellions, coups  play out sometimes on the periphery of their personal story and sometimes at its very centre.
The elder twin, Marion, narrates the tale, at the heart of which is an act of betrayal that breaks the strong bond between him and his brother Shiva.
When political events take a dangerous turn, forcing Marion to flee to New York, he finds himself becoming entangled with his past and forced to come to terms with it.
Verghese, an acute observer, vividly evokes life at the hospital and in the bustling capital. He delivers a page-turning, emotionally absorbing tale  despite a surfeit of medical detail (the books title is a phrase from the Hippocratic oath).
The Ethiopian-born author is a doctor who lives, writes and teaches medicine in the US. This, his first novel, has sold more than a million copies.
Beneath the Lions Gaze by Maaza Mengiste
Mengistes novel of the early years of Ethiopias revolution begins in 1974 as student demonstrations and famine lead to the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by the military. She creates an intimate portrait of an extended family, and it is through their eyes that we see the revolution unfolding  and descending into chaos and brutality.
Hailu, a respected surgeon in Addis Ababa, and his elder son Yonas, a university professor, prefer to keep their distance from Ethiopias violent and dangerous politics. But the younger son, Dawit, is determined to be politically active. Initially, he is a student protestor against the emperor and supports the Marxist junta. Later, when the military begins to crush dissent and sow terror, he becomes a brave and dogged opponent of the regime. Dawit recalls his mother telling him that hope can never come from doing nothing.
When the military forces Hailu to treat a young woman who has been horrifically tortured, a decision he makes causes him and his family to be swept up in the political storm.
This compassionate, tightly woven tale immediately draws the reader into its unfurling domestic and political drama. Its an impressive literary debut.
Mengistes family left Ethiopia when she was a child; she now lives in the US.
Notes From the Hyenas Belly by Nega Mezlekia
Mezlekias powerful and poignant memoir recounts his coming of age in the turbulent decades straddling the ousting of Haile Selassie.
Born in Jijiga, a city where Amhara Christians and ethnic Somali Muslims live in a multicultural mixing bowl, he has fond recollections of family life and early schooldays. However, the best of times in childhood is followed by the worst of times in adolescence as Ethiopia endures famine, civil war, repression and war with neighbouring Somalia.
As his political awareness grows, Mezlekia joins student protests calling for land reform. But the struggle is to be long and treacherous. His first spell in prison, where torture is routine, is at 14  followed by many more.
In 1977-78, the Marxist military rulers unleash their Red Terror, leaving 100,000 young people dead in the carnage. With the revolution eating Ethiopias children at an alarming rate, Mezlekia, at 18, joins an armed rebel group. Ethnic tensions within the group eventually force him to leave, and he slips back into civilian life.
Despite the harsh realities, Mezlekia tells his story  and the story of his country  with wry humour, interspersing facts with folktales. Its a gripping insiders insight into contemporary Ethiopia.
Both his father and his beloved Mam meet violent deaths. Miraculously Mezlekia survives, leaving Ethiopia for Europe and then Canada, where he lives today.

A letter demanding an immediate end to hostilities in Yemen was delivered to 10 embassies in The Hague on Wednesday.
Delegates from the Womens Power to Stop War conference , held in the city this week, delivered letters to the embassies of Britain, the US, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Russia, China, Germany, Egypt and France, and to representatives of the European commission in the Netherlands, outlining seven demands.
The letter called for an immediate end to fighting, and to the transfer of arms to Yemen. It called for safe access for humanitarian aid agencies to deliver vital goods and services, and safe passage for the thousands of people who have been displaced by the fighting.
The letter also demanded that those who have violated international law be held accountable, and called for governments to negotiate a lasting peace, based on the outcomes of the 10-month consultation  the national dialogue  that sought to avert conflict in the country in 2013.
There was also a call for international governments, and the newly appointed UN envoy to Yemen, to engage with Yemeni women and civil society activists.

We are showing solidarity. We have got together a statement to deliver to 11 countries that were party to the national dialogue in Yemen, before the whole thing got out of control, said Sameena Nazir, the president of WILPF Pakistan and vice-president of WILPF s executive committee.
Twenty-one women were selected to deliver letters to each of the embassies, a nod to events after the congress of women held in The Hague in 1915, which led to the creation of WILPF. Delegates from that meeting visited the embassies of countries engaged in the first world war to demand an end to the fighting.
In honour of our 100th anniversary, the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom convened in The Hague to continue to discuss and debate the causes of war and how to reach peace. We heard from our sisters in Yemen and the conference has requested that the following statement be brought to your attention for urgent action, read the letter.
The world is failing in Yemen. The world cannot be complicit. Yemen has been betrayed by the international community. The peaceful transfer of power has been undermined by external interests. Violence and war has been unleashed and fuelled from the outside. The human cost is incalculable.

Following recent air strikes by Arab states, the humanitarian situation in Yemen has been described by the International Committee of the Red Cross as catastrophic . The UN said more than 1,000 people had been killed since the bombing campaign began at the end of March. The Arab coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, wants to flush out Iranian-backed Houthi fighters and restore the presidency of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has fled the country.
Saudi Arabia has announced an end to its bombing campaign , but Reuters news agency reported that aid flights had been blocked by continued bombing.
The final day of the WILPF conference, which brought together more than 900 peace advocates from around the world, including four Nobel peace laureates , ended with a recommitment to challenge multinational systems that encourage war, and to campaign for complete disarmament.
Radhika Coomaraswamy, who is leading a UN global study on women, peace and security to mark the 15th anniversary of resolution 1325 , which calls for womens full participation in peace processes, told delegates the UN had gone away from its core vision, that it should be a place for turning swords into ploughshares.
The main focus on the UN should be to find non-violent ways to protect, she said.

        <title>Burundi: thousands flee to Rwanda as protests grip capital before June poll</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/30/burundi-election-violence-thousands-flee-rwanda-president-nkurunziza</Link>

Thousands of people have crossed from Burundi into neighbouring Rwanda over the past week, fleeing intimidation by youth militia who are reportedly targeting rural areas as protests grip the capital, Bujumbura, over the presidents decision to stand for a third term in Junes presidential elections.
According to reports, the authorities have cut mobile access to social media services such as WhatsApp and Facebook. Private radio stations have been shut down and youth militia are marking the homes of those opposed to the president. With protests in the capital ongoing, many fear more violence in a country that endured vicious ethnic violence during its 12-year civil war.
The protests have also raised fears that future violence could cause ripples in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where armed groups still prey on vulnerable communities in the resource-rich east bordering Burundi .
On Saturday, President Pierre Nkurunziza was nominated to stand again by his ruling CNDD-FDD party. Furious at what they perceived as a breach of the constitution and of the peace accord that ended the civil war, protesters took to the streets of Bujumbura and clashed with police. The protests have continued this week.
Demonstrators burned tyres, built roadblocks and threw rocks at security forces, who responded with tear gas, water cannon and live bullets, according to Human Rights Watch . Burundis Red Cross said at least six people had been killed in Bujumbura.
The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, sent his special envoy for the Great Lakes region, Said Djinnit, to Burundi, while the US assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, Tom Malinowski, travelled to the country on Wednesday to urge all actors to reject violence to safeguard the gains Burundi and its people have achieved since 2005.
Britain has urged its citizens to avoid all but the most essential travel to the country, with some areas designated no-go zones, including Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, north of Bujumbura.
Britains Foreign Office called for Burundis government to allow private radio stations to resume broadcasts, and to let citizens protest peacefully.

Nkurunzizas supporters argue that his first term, which started in 2005, does not count because he was appointed by parliament rather than elected. His opponents say another term would be in breach of the constitution and the peace deal to end the 1993-2005 civil war, in which 300,000 people were killed.
Nkurunziza is not alone among African leaders in seeking to extend his term of office by changing or ignoring constitutional limits. When Blaise Compaor, the former president of Burkina Faso, tried to end term limits and extend his 27-year rule in 2014, he was forced to resign after massive street protests.
In Burundi, violence  and intimidation by the pro-government youth militia, the feared Imbonerakure youth wing of the CNDD-FDD party  has driven thousands of people from their homes. Up to 5,000 people crossed into Rwanda over the weekend, although the number crossing daily has dropped slightly since then. On Tuesday, 1,281 people crossed.
More than 22,000 people, mainly women and children, have fled into Rwanda since the beginning of April, according to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Nearly 4,000 people have crossed from Burundi into the DRC.
Martina Pomeroy, a spokeswoman for the UNHCR in Rwanda, said most of those fleeing came from the northern province of Kirundo, adding that there had been obstacles to people crossing in recent days, with reports that some were having to pay bribes on the Burundi side.
Mostly what we hear is that people were feeling threatened. We havent encountered people who were victims of violence themselves, but they were threatened by youth militia, who support the current regime  people said they used different intimidation tactics, like they would mark your house and say, We are coming for you tonight, Pomeroy said.

People would go and sleep in the bush and then come to Rwanda on foot. There are also some reports of people saying that people they knew had disappeared, she said, adding that those fleeing said they were targeted because of their perceived opposition to the government and president.
The UNHCRs two main reception centres near the border have been completely overwhelmed, Pomeroy said, prompting the agency to move up to 1,500 Burundians a day to a new refugee camp in Mahama, in south-east Rwanda.
Stephan Klingebiel, head of department at the German Development Institute , said the political crisis was exacerbating frustrations caused by extreme poverty and a perception that a small elite was benefiting from an expected peace dividend in a country where democracy is but a fragile facade.
Klingebiel, who is carrying out research in Rwanda, said he had heard the youth militia were very active in rural areas.
Burundi was never a very peaceful and stable place but over the last couple of months it really has accumulated, and everyone was expecting that if Nkurunziza ran for a third term, things would get worse. There is a high risk that we are at the brink of a severe and difficult situation.
He noted that there was also an ethnic dimension to the tensions, with ethnicity still seen as a factor in economic and political success.
During the civil war, Nkurunziza was among the mainly Hutu rebels fighting the army, which was then dominated by the Tutsi minority.
Burundi is one of the worlds poorest countries and most of its population of nearly 10 million people are subsistence farmers. It is heavily dependent on aid, with just under half its planned budget for 2015 due to be funded by international donors, according to a plan approved by parliament.

        <title>Students Speak: Volunteer holidays can be a powerful tool for development</title>

Volunteering abroad on short-term aid projects has become a rite of passage for many young people, but does it do any good? We asked students to share their views on the often criticised voluntourism trend, and the reaction was overwhelmingly favourable. Here are some of the responses.
Through the right channels, volunteering can work for all involved
There are swathes of voluntourism traps out to deceive people and I was lucky that, after passing on various volunteering packages, I remembered a chance recommendation about a government programme, ICS.
Based on my assessment, they assigned me to a disabilities centre in Ghana for three months. There, I was thrown into challenges Id never faced before: presenting to schoolchildren and teachers; producing our own foreign language documentary; teaching ICT, through language and communication barriers, to the deaf.
My three British colleagues and their local counterparts were even more remarkable. They built a school from scratch  not a brick shell, but a curriculum, lesson plans, examinations, certification.
These operations are sustainable, too we trained our local counterpart volunteers and handed over to the next cohort of British volunteers.
Were there problems? Of course. The programme operates on subsidies; volunteers get out as much as they put in, and some dont put in; and not all projects allow so much freedom. But with a healthy dose of cynicism, I feel we had an impact. Its important to realise it is not selfish to think about what these programmes have done for us, the volunteers.
Through my work, I picked up the satisfaction of teaching, which I still carry on at home. Through my involvement with the community I realised theres such a vast, unexplored world outside my doorstep. Through my brilliant colleagues and our adventures, I came out of my shell and am ready to take on that world.

Dont tar all projects with the same brush
Related: 15 ways to make your mark as a volunteer
Volunteering can be an exceptionally effective form of foreign aid. Having skilled and passionate people working alongside foreign counterparts not only delivers immediate, tangible results in the project delivery, but also builds the most powerful tool for development: human capacity. Over a decade of involvement with volunteer programmes in south-east Asia and the Pacific, Ive seen numerous examples of positive change stemming from such projects.
My particular focus has been with Australian Business Volunteers (ABV), an organisation that places skilled professionals on short-term assignments (from one to four months). We work with local counterparts to deliver a targeted, measurable project that directly addresses an identified need. While the projects are beneficial in themselves, it is the capacity building of the local counterparts that delivers the greatest long term benefit. By teaching them to fish we empower them to be a force for positive change long after we go home.
In the countries where we operate there are precious few other avenues for this level of professional development. ABV, like some other Australian volunteer organisations, operates in a professional environment with professional people and delivers overwhelmingly positive outcomes. If there are specific projects or organisations operating that are delivering negative outcomes, they need to be addressed. But they dont in any way detract from the value of other projects or the volunteer programme as a whole.

Volunteers have much to offer
Volunteering overseas provides an opportunity for passionate individuals to utilise their skill sets in order to contribute to sustainable development around the world.
Yes, there are instances when volunteer positions are abused by fun-seeking individuals who are more intrigued with the idea of experiencing exotic locations and foreign cultures. However, these foolish examples should not detract from the advantages of providing firsthand assistance to vulnerable populations in whatever capacity possible.
Volunteers have the potential to offer much-needed services with an array of expertise that may be lacking in the developing world. Therefore, more rigorous screening and acceptance of volunteer applicants could potentially lead to more qualified individuals, as the volunteers dutifully provide essential services, instead of using the position as an excuse to vacation or possibly take work away from unemployed locals. Furthermore, capacity building between the volunteers and targeted community may lead to increased cooperation involving governmental and NGO entities.
Patrick Rulong, University of Waterloo, Canada
Volunteering is a form of grassroots development
Volunteering can be a force for good but it depends on the approach. Its important that volunteers adapt and are more of a helping hand rather than trying to reshape cultural values and norms.
The community I volunteered in, Nuevo Gualcho in El Salvador, now has a tourist route that is run by the community which British and national volunteers worked together to create. Volunteering should acknowledge the skills that communities have and give them the knowledge and the opportunity to utilise those skills. The cultural exchange gives volunteers the opportunity to learn and work with people they otherwise would not have met. However, volunteering abroad has become commercialised and has reached a staged where many people do it to tick off their bucket list or add to their CV.
The humanitarian spirit can be easily lost in the mix of self-centered characters. However, the greatest impact that volunteers make is the relationships they build with locals. The impressions they leave are unforgettable and, speaking from personal experience, we truly do make friends for life. When a volunteers heart is in their work, the impact they can make is priceless. There are different ways to bring about change and volunteering is not always the solution. Volunteers need to be careful and research what their role will be while volunteering, as many companies are out for their money and sustainable development can be used as a tool to attract them.

Volunteers beware
Ive travelled a lot and have never volunteered. I dont think Ill ever volunteer. For me it has never seemed worthwhile, when weighing up my options. I dont think you need to volunteer to have a good time or feel like youre doing your bit to stop human misery.
Does volunteering really help the people youre supposed to be helping? I dont know. But what I do know is that volunteering is big business, and those who choose to volunteer shouldnt be condemned for the sins of the industry.
Ive met volunteers who were not allowed to leave the area they were helping out in. Ive met a volunteer who caught the programme coordinator pilfering funds from an orphanage in Kenya. Ive met plenty of volunteers who seem worn out, dissatisfied and ready to go home.
Volunteering is shamefully expensive and can be exploitative. $2,000 for two weeks in India doesnt add up. $2,000 in India is big, big money. Then again its probably better than $2000 for two weeks in Europe on Contiki [tour holidays].
Declan Quali, University of Wollongong, Australia
What harm have we caused?
I have read many articles and heard many people claim that travelling abroad to volunteer in industries such as health care, education or building services does not bring about any benefits to those we are trying to help. I wish people who believe this would justify themselves. I cannot think of any harm being brought to a community by individuals from the western world building wells for a community so that they are provided with clean drinking water to prevent the spread of cholera, or helping to improve a childs English, which will benefit their future education and job prospects.
It isnt until you volunteer to do this work yourself that you realise what a massive impact you are making on peoples lives. I discovered this last summer when I travelled to the poorest region of India for five weeks to build 10 new homes for orphaned families. The families, the builders and the community in general could not have been more welcoming, friendly and grateful for the work we were doing for them. As a result, each family had a new, cement-built home with running water and electricity instead of a wooden hut held together with sticks and rope. Now I ask you, what harm have we caused?

Kenya softens its position on proposed closure of Dadaab refugee camp
Chair of Refugee Affairs Commission says Kenya is committed to process of returning refugees but will not force them over the countrys borders

Kenya appears to have softened its stance on the imminent closure of a camp hosting more than a third of a million Somali refugees, weeks after the deputy president, reacting to the massacre at Garissa University , announced it would happen within three months.
While we are committed to the return of the refugees, you will not see us holding them by the head and tail and throwing them across the border, said Ali Bunow Korane, who chairs Kenyas Refugee Affairs Commission.
Korane was addressing a forum at which officials from the UN, aid agencies and civil society discussed the implications of closing Dadaab refugee complex, where more than 330,000 Somalis live.
He acknowledged that, while it was Kenyas policy to encourage refugees to go back to Somalia, the country, does not provide a conducive environment for mass return. This is also the position of the UNHCR, the UNs agency for refugees, and most aid agencies working in Somalia .
Korane said Kenya was working to mobilise international support to improve security and build up social infrastructure such as houses, schools and hospitals, in order to make potential areas of return more viable.
On 11 April, William Ruto, Kenyas deputy president, announced that the Kenyan government had asked the UNHCR to relocate the refugees [in Dadaab] within three months, [failing] which we shall relocate them ourselves.
Ruto spoke shortly after 148 people, mostly students, were murdered in a university in the northern town of Garissa, in an attack for which al-Shabab claimed responsibility. Although al-Shabab is primarily a Somali jihadist insurgency, it has recruited many Kenyans  including, by many accounts, some of those who carried out the university killings.
But Korane said of the attackers: They stayed in the [Dadaab] refugee camp, they assembled the arms there.
Kenya has very serious security challenges that have a direct bearing on refugees, he added.
In 2013, Kenya, Somalia and the UNHCR signed a tripartite agreement in which all parties committed themselves to the principle of voluntary return. Kenya remains engaged with the tripartite process and, according to the UNHCR, on 29 April took part in a technical committee meeting convened to discuss the agreements implementation.
The only way forward is to continue working for the implementation of the tripartite agreement, the UNHCRs senior regional protection officer, Eva Camps, said at the gathering.
Camps noted that a pilot project launched in December to assist refugees returning voluntarily from Dadaab to three locations in Somalia had not delivered satisfactory results. Of a target of 10,000 returns by June, so far just 2,048 have gone back under the project.
Several thousand others have, however, left Dadaab for Somalia without involvement from the UNHCR.

        <title>Nepal earthquake: learn lessons or more will die in future disasters, warns expert</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-disaster-response-risk-management</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
Thousands more Nepalese people will die in future earthquakes and the country will slide further back into poverty if the government and the international community do not learn the lessons of Saturdays disaster , a risk-management expert has warned.
More than 5,000 people are now known to have died in the magnitude 7.8 quake, although the Nepalese government warned on Tuesday that the death toll could reach 10,000 .
Katie Peters, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) , said that although significant progress had been made in retrofitting schools and hospitals and training people how to respond to earthquakes, more needs to be done to mitigate the effects of future natural disasters.
Peters, who works with Nepalese government on disaster risk, said that failure to invest in building back better, improving infrastructure and making sure everyone was as prepared as possible for quakes would prove costly. There will continue to be a rise in both loss of life and economic loss from disasters, she said. Thats the reality  and it will cost more for the international community.

While she commended the swift humanitarian response to the crisis, Peters said the rush to rebuild should not come at the expense of proper planning. Theres always a tension between wanting to rebuild as soon as possible  which is human nature  and taking the time to make sure that theres consideration of the whole range of disasters that Nepal faces and making sure that we dont carry risk into our reconstruction efforts, she said.
If were rebuilding schools and hospitals, we need to make sure its done in a way that can withstand an earthquake of the same magnitude again. [A quake] can massively increase the rates of poverty  and Nepal is among the 11 countries globally that are most at risk of disaster-induced poverty.
Peters said focusing on risk reduction would be in everyones interests: not only would it help safeguard the futures of hundreds of thousands of Nepalese, it would also save the donor community tens of millions of pounds. The statistics show that five times more funding goes on response than it does on preparing for a disaster and trying to reduce the impact of a disaster, and thats something that the international community can do, she said.
Every dollar spent on preparedness saves eight dollars in response  the evidence is so clear. Theres so much more attention that goes on to responding to a disaster, but at the same time, as donors, we need to make sure that we are continuing to support both communities and governments before the next disaster strikes so theres not just an influx when there is a disaster; we need to help people beforehand.

Although the earthquake had long been predicted, Peters said she hoped it would serve as a wake-up call on the importance of investing in preparation. Thats the lesson that countries learn time and time again: there will often be piecemeal efforts to try to invest in how you manage the effects of a disaster, but its not until one happens that people actually start pushing it up the priority list, she said.
Peters said local communities had to be central to disaster risk management as they were the ones who had found themselves digging people out of the rubble 24 hours before the humanitarian agencies arrived.
She also said that the international community had learned much from the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti . Following the quake, which killed between 90,000 and 316,000 people and displaced more than 1.5 million , donors were criticised for channelling aid funding through big agencies and NGOs rather than local Haitian organisations .
The international community has learned from that already, and you can see from the response in Nepal that people are actively trying to make sure that they are working in support of local and national response efforts  and thats whats going to make it sustainable, she said.
If you help to build local and national capacity to respond, the big dream is that in the long run, there wont be a need for international support.

Pakistans burqa-clad cartoon superhero makes foray into India
The award-winning cartoon series aims to address serious issues that girls and women face in the two south Asian countries
Pakistans award-winning animated TV series Burka Avenger is set to be aired in India

Burka Avenger , the mysterious burqa-clad superhero operating out of the fictional Pakistani town of Halwapur, is jumping borders into the Indian heartland to tackle womens empowerment.
The cartoon series created by Pakistani singer Haroon Rashid  known simply as Haroon  is being shown on ZeeQ, a channel owned by the Indian entertainment company Zee Network. The show, produced by Unicorn Black, launched in India this month and is being aired in Hindi and English as well as two regional languages.
For the release in India the show has been adapted somewhat. It has been dubbed in Hindi and other regional languages, said Haroon.
Burka Avenger is the story of Jiya, a twentysomething schoolteacher who dons a full body covering, similar to those worn by some Muslim women. The burqa, which is seen by some as a symbol of subjugation, is used by Jiya as a magical cape to hide her identity and fight the wrongs around her, including the subjugation of women and the denial of the right to education for girls.
Haroon claims the idea of Burka Avenger was in reaction to girls schools being shut down by extremists in Pakistan . The character is a keen proponent of education for girls.
Burka Avenger slugs it out with a number of villains with her weapons of choice  books and pens. The character also tackles health issues, including fighting the opposition to vaccination drives .
I did not want her to use guns and bombs to fight back. So she uses books and pens, which has a message that the pen is mightier than the sword and education is the answer  not more violence, Haroon said.
Burka Avenger was launched in Pakistan in July 2013 and has won several prizes including an Emmy Kids award. It was also named one of the most influential fictional characters by Time magazine in 2013.
Haroon is hoping the show will help boost awareness about womens empowerment and the importance of education for girls. We address serious issues, but the edge is taken off through stories that are full of adventure and comedy, Haroon said. The core social messages come across, yet the stories are not preachy.
Even though there are contrasting social dynamics in India and Pakistan, the status of women in both countries has a familiar ring. India has a skewed sex ratio , with 940 females to every 1,000 males. And its getting worse, with the ratio for girls to boys 914:1,000.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest
Womens groups have welcomed the move to air Burka Avenger in India
Indias prime minister, Narendra Modi, recently asked political leaders in the northern Indian state of Haryana to ensure female foeticide is brought to an end there . Haryana has the most skewed ratio in the country, with only 877 females for every 1,000 males.
India has made great strides in ensuring gender parity in schools. However, there is a high rate of crime against women and girls. The government has launched a number of campaigns, including Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (save daughters, educate daughters) to stop foeticide and improve education for girls.
Using cartoons to shape their mind and make them aware about the social issues of our society is a positive step in creating gender sensitivity and social awareness in our country, said Haroon.
The creators and presenters of the series are hoping the themes resonate in India as well. We are always on the lookout for shows with themes that are relevant to Indian children and we are very fortunate that we have this show, said the deputy business head of ZeeQ, Aparna Bhosle.
Womens groups in India have welcomed the move to air Burka Avenger. A lot of problems that women in India face stem from the cultural upbringing which conditions the mind of children, said Noorjehan Safia Niaz, founder of the Ashana Trust, which supports womens initiatives for justice and development.
Despite the tension over Kashmir and terrorism, there have been increasing cultural exchanges between India and Pakistan. Early last year, Zee Network launched an entertainment channel showcasing programmes from Pakistan.

The Sudanese government is continuing the crackdown on political opposition and student protests that began in the buildup to the presidential election won by Omar al-Bashir this month, according to a human rights group.
Dozens of opposition party members, political activists and students have been beaten and detained, mainly by Sudans security services, in a wave of repression that began the day before voting started, advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said . The ballot, in which Bashir extended his 26-year rule over the country, has been widely condemned by rights groups and western governments .
On Monday, Bashir was declared the winner of Sudans election, which was held from 13 to 15 April. He gained 94.5% of the vote. But an African Union electoral observer mission, led by the former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, said voter turnout was generally low throughout the polling period , mostly because opposition leaders had called for the ballot to be boycotted .

The government has levied criminal charges against opposition figures who urged Sudanese voters to stay away from the poll under the Sudanese Criminal Act of 1991, which carries the death penalty, according to the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS).
Sudanese security services arrested and detained opposition figures with the aim of restricting the ability of independent groups and activists to voice dissenting political views from those of the ruling party, the ACJPS said.
Mastor Ahmed Mohammed, a member of the Sudanese Congress Party, one of the groups that called for the election to be boycotted, was arrested on Tuesday, HRW said.
Sudanese opposition activist Sandra Faroug Kadouda was dragged from her car by security services on 12 April as she made her way to a meeting with other opposition members. Her car was found 30 minutes later abandoned  with the keys still in the ignition, ACJPS said. Kadouda was released from prison on 15 April, but the government censored a newspaper article about her detention in the al-Sudani newspaper.
On 14 April, police raided Al Fashir University, using tear gas to disperse students who had gathered to rally against the election. About 29 people were arrested, according to the ACJPS.
On 19 April, government security services beat and detained a student leader at Khartoum University, according to HRW. They beat him with batons for several hours and interrogated him about his links to opposition political parties, HRW said.
Bashir, who has been in power since 1989, faces criminal charges at the international criminal court for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and alleged genocide.
The international community denounced violence carried out by the Sudanese government during the election period, saying it marred the credibility of the poll. The outcome of these elections cannot be considered a credible expression of the will of the Sudanese people, said a joint statement by Norway, the US and the UK .
Days before the polls took place, the EUs foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, said : The upcoming elections cannot produce a credible result with legitimacy throughout the country.
By saying the elections werent free and fair, [western governments] are actually saying the government is no longer legitimate by implication, which is very strong stuff in their terms, said Gillian Lusk, associate editor of Africa Confidential .
The most credible estimate available is thatsuggests that about 35% of eligible voters cast ballots, but people in Sudan believe the real number could be half that. Most of the people who voted in the poll are thought to be government employees.
Daniel Bekele, HRWs Africa director, said: Instead of allowing people to express their views peacefully, the government is snatching up political activists and beating, torturing, and jailing them, without the slightest pretence of respect for basic rights.
He added: The best way for the ruling party to celebrate the elections is to end the crackdown on political dissent.

There is no mistaking Anne Scotts opinion of nuclear weapons. Standing outside a conference hall in The Hague on a chilly Tuesday lunchtime, the secretary of the Scottish branch of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) sported a bright blue T-shirt with the words NHS Not Trident defiantly emblazoned on the front.
Scott, from Edinburgh, had taken a handful of red poker chips from a table and placed them on a tarpaulin, marked health, as a symbolic gesture of where she would like government spending on the military to be diverted.
Nuclear weapons [in Scotland] are taking out money from health, education, welfare and human rights, she said, defending the Scottish National Party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, for her stance on diverting current UK spending on nuclear weapons towards public services.
Khedijah Mohammed-Nur, from the Network of Eritrean Women , placed some of her chips on the health pile and some on a sheet marked education.
It matters to me that we have a healthy society and we have education. If we have educated societies, spending on human rights will be less of a problem. Human rights abuses wont happen if society is educated, said Mohammed-Nur, who left her native Eritrea for London in 1993.
The symbolic act came halfway through WILPFs three-day Womens Power to Stop War conference , held to mark the organisations 100th anniversary this week. More than 900 delegates from 80 countries are being encouraged to share ideas and strategise about how to work locally for peace.

Military spending  how much money a state spends on everything to do with the armed forces, including weapons, salaries and administration  has been one of the hot topics of the conference.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , total global military expenditure in 2014 stood at $1.8tn (1.17tn), about 2.3% of global GDP. Although the figure represents a 0.4% fall in real terms spending since 2013, the third year-on-year decrease, the figure still outstrips the total spent during the cold war.
US military spending fell by 6.5% between 2013 and 2014  contributing to an overall drop of 20% in the US since 2010  but current spending remains 45% higher than before the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Globally, North America still spends more on the military than any other country, with 35% of the global spend.
Speaking to the Guardian, Nobel laureate Jody Williams said the amount governments spend on their militaries violated article 26 of the UN charter , which says the security council must act to divert money and resource away from weapons.
She also pointed to the 1961 speech in which the outgoing US president Dwight Eisenhower warned Americans to beware the influence of the military-industrial complex  the cosy link fostered between defence departments and arms producers.
This was not [said] by tree-hugging, peacenik, granola-eating people, but by our victorious general who said, We dont need a standing army that we needed for world war two, we dont need to continue the relationship with industry and military. We need it to go to the needs of people, she said.
Williams, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1997 for her work to ban landmines, is now working to outlaw killer robots  fully autonomous weapons that are piloted remotely. In 2013 she helped launched the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots , with the aim of getting them banned before they turn up on the battlefield.
Are we so morally depraved that we are willing to cede the power of life and death to a machine? What do human beings think? That its OK to let machines pick targets and kill targets? said Williams. She added that drones, while not much better, at least offered the advantage of a human being picking the target and pushing the button to pulverise that person.
Colin Archer, secretary general of the International Peace Bureau , told delegates that military spending figures painted an appalling picture, an appalling imbalance in the use of humanities resources.
It's not just about money, it's about misuse of brain power  millions of experts' lives are devoted to weapons of war
Colin Archer, International Peace Bureau
Its not just about the money, its about the misuse of brain power. The amount of scientists and technical [experts] involved in the military  we are talking about millions of people whose lives are devoted to weapons of war. We need these brains for human development, said Archer.
Were all conscious of the enormous human and environmental needs in society. The business of moving money [away from military spending] is a simple idea outside, but we all know that its political extremely complex and requires pressure.
Mara Muoz Maraver, human rights programme director at WILPF, said governments are too concerned with national security, instead of human security. National security relies on the military, while human security focuses on protecting people and promoting peaceful solutions. Every time theres a threat, we have a military response, she said.
Among the ideas delegates have put forward to achieve global disarmament are the creation of government peace ministries to work alongside defence departments, the abolition of the UN security council  or failing that, its complete overhaul  and, more extreme, for those involved in the sale and purchase of arms to be hauled before the international criminal court.
But given the complexities of the issue  persuading governments to stop funding their militaries and companies to stop making weapons  is change an impossible ask?
Nothing is impossible. If I believed [it was impossible] I wouldnt still be an activist, said Williams, whose campaign to ban killer robots began at her kitchen table.
We have done things, we have banned landmines, weve banned cluster munitions  Anything can happen if we get up off our collective butt and work together. With an overarching goal then, however individuals contribute to that goal, we can change the world.

Malawi: The scale of devastation from January's floods is still unfolding in pictures
In January, torrential rain brought unprecedented floods to Malawi in southern Africa. They displaced nearly a quarter of a million people, devastated 64,000 hectares of land and killed hundreds, highlighting the vulnerability of a country in which 85% of the population are farmers, most living below the poverty line

How close has the world come to ensuring every child receives a primary education? In the latest instalment in our series looking back at the millennium development goals, we examine the second goal: universal primary education. Theres an explainer on what global leaders agreed to in 2000, a list of 15 achievements of the past 15 years, and case studies of education delivery in Uganda and Mali .
As the migrant crisis escalated and more lives were lost at sea, we spoke to Eritreans who explained why they felt compelled to flee their country. Researcher Dan Connell also shared his views on the crushing repression that drives Eritreans to risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean, and Syrian-Palestinian refugee Ali Sandeed spoke of his earlier plans to pay a smuggler to take him to Europe.
And as the Nepal earthquake disaster continues to unfold, here is a list of some of the appeals that have opened to assist survivors.

Opinion
Two years after the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, which killed more than 1,000 garment workers, Labour Behind the Label s Sam Maher asked why worker conditions hadnt changed . Kishore Singh, UN special rapporteur on the right to education, argued against the privatisation of education , claiming it worsens inequality. Plus, Anti-Slavery International director Aidan McQuade wrote on the important distinctions between smuggling and trafficking , and why politicians must know this in order to address the migrant crisis.

Though I dont disagree with any of the points made by the author, we have to be careful we dont throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Ive been working in Bangladesh for the last three years and have had the opportunity to visit both RMG factories and also the rural villages from which the workers originate. While it is no doubt true that working conditions in the factories are often unacceptable and need to be reformed, there is certainly nothing idyllic about life in poor, rural communities in Bangladesh and it is doubtful that the women would be better off if they stayed back in the village. Economic growth and industrialisation is not the problem; it is actually a major part of the solution (the other part being to ensure that a policy and regulatory framework exists that ensures that the economic growth is equitable). It is not beyond a country like Bangladesh to achieve this, though it will take time and - regrettably - more pain along the way.

If books instead of bombs had been thrown at the Taliban, and if schools had been built in response to the terrorist attacks on New York in 2001, we would not now be contending with Isis, Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi told a conference on Monday.
Ebadi, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2003 for her work in promoting human rights in Iran, criticised the west for how it dealt with terrorist groups in the Middle East, and called on governments to cut their arms budgets.
Speaking in The Hague at the 100th anniversary of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), Ebadi said: If books had been thrown at the Taliban instead of bombs, and had schools been built in Afghanistan  4,000 could have been built in memory of the 4,000 people who died in 9/11  at this time we would not have Isis.
Lets not forget the roots of Isis rest in the Taliban. Lets not repeat the experience. We have to remember that Isis is not simply a terrorist group, but an ideology, and ideologies cannot be fought with bombs. This ideology can only be fought with the correct interpretation of religion.

Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to be awarded the Nobel peace prize, called on UN member states to reduce their military budgets by 10% and spend the money saved on education and social welfare.
To cheers, applause and standing ovations, the three-day conference, entitled Womens Power to Stop War, opened with a tribute to the women who travelled to The Hague in 1915 seeking an end to the first world war, and whose actions led to the creation of WILPF.

Four Nobel laureates addressed the audience of more than 900 delegates from 80 countries. A fifth Nobel laureate, Tawakkol Karman, the Yemeni rights activist who received the prize in 2011, was unable to travel.
We dont need another cold war, or to demonise other countries or dehumanise leaders, said Mairead Maguire, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1976 for her work addressing sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. We have no right to dehumanise other people and then take them out. How far have we sunk when we can sit down and plan how to take out another human being because we dont agree with their politics?
Madeleine Rees, secretary general of WILFP since 2010, told the audience the global system was not equipped to bring peace. We have a UN system, we have a charter, a declaration of human rights and we have treaties and conventions. Weve had four world conferences on women, we have the women, peace and security agenda and world courts to adjudicate on all the above. So we should be pleased. But its not working. Were still not able to bring the peace we have been demanding.

Rees, who previously worked for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bosnia, said a multilateral system is needed but the current one is failing: Our default position is intervention, when we know the cost and consequences of that intervention. She said the trillions of dollars spent annually on arms could have paid for the millennium development goals several times over, and warned that the increasing concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few will continue the cycle of violence.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , total global military expenditure stood at $1.8tn in 2014. One year of the worlds military spending would finance more than 650 years of the UNs regular budget and more than 6,300 years of the budget allocated to UN Women.
We have to reclaim peace, said Rees. Its easier to not pay attention, and get on with our lives and be distracted. But we can band together. Each in our own way, we can all do something, and if we pay attention to what others are doing, then we have a movement. There are more of us wanting to end war than those who want it to continue.
At a later session, delegates heard that engaging men and boys in debates around violence was crucial to end conflict.

Anthony Keedi, programme manager at Abaad: Resource Center for Gender Equality , which works in the Middle East and north Africa, said men were conditioned to think that conflict is natural, but violence is a choice. Men are taught not to empathise, not to cry or show vulnerability as these are weaknesses. They are taught to be stoic, he said. Being taught not to empathise makes it easier to point and kill, to act violently.
Part of Abaads work is to offer free psychosocial support to men and boys to reduce violence.

On Tuesday, WILPF will publish its manifesto, which will recommit the organisation to campaign for total worldwide disarmament and demilitarisation, to support an international system that guarantees international law and to work towards a new international order free from neo-colonialism, political tyranny, economic exploitation and financial speculation, in which income, resources and opportunities are justly distributed between and within countries.
Violence is not inevitable. It is a choice, says the manifesto. We choose non-violence, as means and as end. We will liberate the strength of women and, in partnership with like-minded men, bring to birth a just and harmonious world.

        <title>Child trafficking in India: 'It was only after a few years I realised I had been sold'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/28/child-trafficking-india-domestic-labour-chhattisgarh</Link>
        <Description/>

Anti-slavery activists say thousands of children are going missing from some of Indias remote tribal areas as human traffickers respond to a surge in demand for domestic child labour in booming urban districts.
Between 2011 and 2013, more than 10,500 children were registered as missing from the central state of Chhattisgarh, one of Indias poorest states. The majority are believed to have been trafficked out of the state and into domestic work or other forms of child labour in cities.
Trafficking for sex and other purposes has always existed in India, but trafficking children for domestic slavery is a relatively new development, says HS Phoolka, a senior advocate at Indias supreme court and a human rights lawyer and activist. This is due to rising demand for domestic maids due to rising income in urban areas and widescale poverty  in rural areas. This trafficking shows the rise of massive inequality in India .
The missing children in Chhattisgarh represent a small percentage of the estimated 135,000 children believed to be trafficked in India every year. Yet the rate at which they are going missing from remote villages in the south of the state is causing alarm.
I worked from 6am until midnight. I had to cook, clean, take care of the children and massage the legs of my employers
Last year, the supreme court expressed serious concern over the number of missing children in Chhattisgarh. The state responded with legislation, Indias first attempt to regulate the growing number of employment placement agencies , which are often conduits for children being trafficked into domestic servitude and other forms of exploitation.
Activists say more needs to be done to tackle the problem. The state has become a big source area for children because of a lack of law enforcement, civil unrest, large-scale poverty, illiteracy and the remoteness of the villages, says Bhuwan Ribhu, an activist working with the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the childhood movement). These are places where the protection of the state does not reach. Trafficking in this region has become deeply engrained.
In the village of Kunuri, Deepti Minch, 19, describes her experience of being trafficked into domestic servitude in northern Indias Punjab state. A village agent had visited her family and promised her mother 5,000 rupees ($79) a month if she sent Deepti to work in Delhi. Once she reached the capital she was sold off to a family.
It was only after a few years I realised I had been sold, she recalls. I was extremely hurt and was in tears. My life was tough. I worked from six in the morning until midnight. I had to cook meals, clean the house, take care of the children and massage the legs of my employers before going to bed. If I didnt do my job well, they used to scold me.
Deepti eventually managed to run away and make her way back to her family  yet thousands of other children remain unaccounted for.
One of them is Salmaet, who went missing from Sihardhar village in Chhattisgarhs Jashpur district six years ago, when she was 11. I thought she had gone to a neighbouring village, but when she didnt return I got worried and started asking around, says her father, Thibu Ram. I still have no idea where she is. I hope shes safe.
Salmaets disappearance is part of a disturbing trend of children going missing in the area. Fear and distrust of the police and officials mean children are rarely reported missing for months, or even years, after they disappear. Although Salmaet went missing in 2008, her family didnt go to the police until this year. They say the police have done nothing to look for her.
Rishi Kant, one of Indias leading anti-trafficking activists, says trafficking is still considered a peripheral issue among law enforcement agencies, especially in rural areas such as Chhattisgarh. The response of states across India to this problem is very poor, he says. In states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, law enforcement is too busy fighting the armed Maoist insurgency or civil unrest. Human trafficking is not a priority.
Most [police] don't see trafficking as a crime. They just see it as poor children migrating for a better livelihood
Aradhana Singh, head of anti-human trafficking unit, Jharkhand state
In neighbouring Jharkhand state, Aradhana Singh, head of the anti-human trafficking unit in Khundi district, says the police lack both the funds and the will to tackle the problem.
We simply dont have resources, she says. Our phones dont work; power cuts are so frequent that we cannot use a computer or a fax machine. There is not even office space to offer counselling services. Most [police] dont see trafficking as a crime. They just see it as poor children migrating for a better livelihood and dont take these issues seriously. They think Im dealing with a petty issue.
The impunity enjoyed by those running trafficking rings in these tribal areas is increasing the power and influence of local criminal gangs.
The situation has become so grave that in these areas it is the traffickers who wield the power, says Prasanta Dash, head of Unicef in Chhattisgarh. Even if cases are filed against them, they are able to pressure the families to change their statements or threaten them. Because they earn a lot of money, they are well off and act as muscle men. Trafficking in this region is very deep.

        <title>Less pay, more work, no pension: the 21st-century woman's lot laid bare</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/apr/27/un-women-report-less-pay-more-work-no-pension-the-21st-century-womans-lot-laid-bare</Link>

Women earn on average 24% less than men, work more hours and have less chance of receiving a pension in later life, according to UN Womens flagship report, which calls for an overhaul of global economic policies to improve womens lives.
The 2015 progress report, Transforming economies, realising rights , published on Monday, said current economic policies and discriminatory laws and attitudes are failing women in rich and poor countries.
Despite significant progress in overcoming the barriers to equal opportunities, which includes new legislation to support womens right to work, change has not penetrated deep enough in some countries.
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of UN Women, said it was staggering that where we are doing the right thing is more the exception than the rule.
The report, published as the UN debates the next set of sustainable development goals , found that only half of women over the age of 15 are in the labour force, compared with three-quarters of men considered to be of working age. In poorer countries, 75% of women are employed in informal sector jobs, such as domestic workers, positions not covered by international employment laws and which leave them open to abuse and exploitation.
Some 77 countries still restrict the type of work women can undertake, with bans on night-time work  as was the case until recently in Bolivia  or construction jobs.
At least 80 countries, including France, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico and South Africa, do not have legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. Over their lifetimes, women in France and Sweden can expect to earn 31% less than men, in Germany 49% less and in Turkey 75% less.
Women on average do almost two-and-a-half times more unpaid care and household work as men
On top of the wage gap in paid work, women on average do almost two-and-a-half times more unpaid care and household work as men. Combining paid and unpaid work, researchers calculated that women in almost all countries work longer hours each day than men.
The report, which drew on existing international data, national figures and policies, as well as on-the-ground interviews, said that while the economic crisis in 2008 had affected the lives of women and men, the resulting cuts in public spending had disproportionately affected women. Austerity measures had shifted the burden of coping and caring into the household and on to the shoulders of women and girls.
Although the gender pay gap had narrowed slightly since the crash, this had not translated into a more equal employment landscape. In some countries, the reduced wage gap was due to mens wages falling more than womens, which can hardly be considered progress. Instead of catching up with men, there is a levelling down for all, it said.
The report, the first UN Women progress report since 2011, also found that sexual harassment in the workplace is still a reality for thousands of women. At least 34 countries do not have legislation banning sexual harassment at work and those that do arent doing enough to fully implement them. In the EU, 75% of women who hold managerial or more senior professional positions say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment in the workplace, the report found.
Almost all countries now offer paid maternity leave, although only 63 complied with the International Labour Organisations recommendations of a minimum of 14 weeks of leave paid at a rate of at least two-thirds of earnings by governments and employers.
Later in life, women are more likely to live in poverty as they are less likely to contribute to a pension than men. Given the nature of womens work, they dont always have spare money to contribute towards a pension scheme if one is available.
The report called on governments to tighten laws to protect women in the workplace. Well-designed and funded social services  such as affordable health and childcare, and improved access to water and sanitation  are needed to improve poverty levels and free up womens time.
A shift in attitude is required to challenge the traditional role of women as the chief carers of children, argued the report. Social protection measures, such as cash-transfer schemes that have proved successful in parts of Asia and Latin America in alleviating poverty, are also needed.
Mlambo-Ngcuka said that it was not just about finding new money, but also about using existing funds to better support women through paying a minimum wage or investing in affordable, decent childcare. More women in decision-making roles are also required, she said.
Our public resources are not flowing in the directions where they are most needed, for example, to provide safe water and sanitation, quality healthcare and decent child and elderly care services. Where there are no public services, the deficit is borne by women and girls.
Barbara Lotti, a programme officer at the womens fund Mama Cash , said: The report stresses consistently that social norms are responsible for womens socio-economic disadvantage in the labour market. Even in countries where formal equality in the form of laws exists, the type of work women perform is undervalued as compared to the jobs that men do, resulting in a gender pay gap.
It is a big gain to understand the stereotyping of women and the stigma they experience as a crucial factor in womens access to decent employment. Now more than ever is the time to equip women workers in formal and informal sectors with resources to do their norm-transforming work and thus get at the root causes of the inequality they face.

Lucy Lamble presents this edition of the Global development podcast, looking at how the lack of water and sanitation is affecting health centres in Mali. Just 20% of the country's health facilities provide clean water.
She visits Diatoula, 15km south-east of Bamako, a community of 1,000 people which has one health centre, and hears from Nurse Vinima Baya about how they cope with the lack of water within the facility, with patients and their families gathering buckets of water from the village well.
At Kalabancoro town on the outskirts of Bamako, Lucy visits a clinic opened in 2013, which has done much to improve healthcare for local residents  but where staff still have to buy safe drinking water or ask patients to bring it in.
We hear from experts including Mamadou Diarafa Diallo, WaterAid's country representative in Mali, and Maggie Montgomery, from WHO's Water, Sanitation and Health unit, on the problems the country faces in improving access to safe water.

Climate scientist Dr Sugata Hazra, from Jadavpur University in Kolkata, said the rate of sea-level rise in India and Bangladesh was higher than the global average. The Sundarbans is one of the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change globally. The changes we are observing include delay in the arrival of monsoon rainfall, increasing intensity and number of cyclone storms and surges, and accelerated rise of relative sea level, Hazra said.

        <title>Centenary stand: female activists head for The Hague to set a new peace agenda</title>

One hundred years ago this month, more than 1,100 women from 12 countries travelled across Europe to the Netherlands to protest against the war that was raging across their borders.
Presided over by Jane Addams , a member of the US suffrage alliance, the Congress of Women opened in the Hague on 28 April 1915 to debate ways to end the first world war and prevent further conflict.
The congress sowed the seeds for the creation of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) , which this week marks its centenary with a return to the city.
The three-day conference will celebrate the work of female peacemakers globally and has the bold aim of formulating a new peace agenda for the next 100 years.

Activists from across the world are expected to attend, as well as five Nobel laureates. These include Leymah Gbowee , who was involved in the mass mobilisation of women in Liberia to demand an end to civil war, and Jody Williams , who launched an international campaign to ban landmines.
It was significant that women from so many countries came together [in 1915] with a highly political aim, said Edith Ballantyne, who was secretary general of the organisation for 23 years and its international president for six.
While women had been organising in the International Suffrage Alliance , the peace women recognised that the vote alone was not enough, that women had to take a stand.
Ballantyne, who as a teenager fled the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, said she had mixed feelings about the anniversary.
After such a long association, I am pleased to have made it to this 100th anniversary meeting. [But] 100 years later, we have not stopped war, and in fact we face many wars, she says. So its both a great and sad day.
But the organisation, which has branches in more than 30 countries, has enjoyed some big successes over the years.
Two WILPF presidents have received the Nobel peace prize. Addams, who became the organisations first president, was awarded the prize in 1931 , followed in 1946 by Emily Balch , who attended the 1915 congress and led the organisation from 1935.

WILPF was heavily involved in the push for an international arms trade treaty , ensuring it referenced the link between the proliferation of weapons and gender-based violence.
WILPF was also central in drafting the UN security council resolution 1325 , unanimously adopted in 2000, which was a milestone in recognising womens experience of war. The resolution calls for the full participation of women in conflict resolution, peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction, and their inclusion in peacekeeping missions.
However, the resolution has yet to bring the change campaigners want. Women still have to fight for a seat at the peace negotiating table. When it comes to the crucial moment, the door is closed, says Madeleine Rees , WILPFs current secretary general.
Rees says the Hague conference will feed into a current UN review of womens role in peace and security to tie in with the 15th anniversary of the resolution later this year.
Radhika Coomaraswamy, the lead author of the review, will be speaking at the conference, and the design of the plenary sessions should provide some solid insight, says Rees.
The three plenaries will explore the power dynamics in society and how they can be challenged, the increase in global militarisation and the structural root causes of war, and what activists can do to bring change at local, national and international level.

For Rees, engaging activists is one of the main aims of the conference.
Weve got to stop disengaging, stop engaging in football or consumerism or anything that makes us avoid paying attention to what is happening, says Rees. It starts with an individual decision  I will participate in making a difference  to commit to think global and act local; we need that. Were not going to make demands of governments or the UN [at the conference] so much, instead were [looking at] the work we need to do ourselves. The thing for us is going back to local engagement.
Local engagement could involve challenging local politicians on their stance on nuclear weapons, or campaigning against the arms trade, violence against women or trafficking, says Rees. The use of killer robots  fully autonomous weapons rather than drones, which are piloted remotely  offers another focus for questioning. WILPF is now campaigning against this frightening recent development.
Cynthia Enloe , a professor of political science at Clark University and specialist in demilitarisation, adds that local people need to watch for signs that trouble is brewing.
Men are often encouraged to be the nations protectors  and maintain their role as household protectors, and that role of protector really can be manipulated by people wanting to encourage the annexation of neighbouring territories or to build up the military, she says.
One thing to look out for is governments or warmongers, who try to encourage men to merge these two roles.
Enloe, a WILPF member for more than 20 years, believes resolution 1325 has provided a useful tool for peace activists to hold governments to account. When we have got something that is holding people accountable, that is definitely progress, she says, adding: Fifteen years in the history of gender politics is not very long.
Ballantyne hopes the anniversary conference will result in a powerful call to work together to achieve an end to militarisation, ultimately realising the vision of Addams and the women who travelled to the Hague in 1915.
Peace work is ongoing. There are invisible successes because you cant measure what you have prevented. Im certain that many situations would have been worse had the peace movement and WILPF not been working.

'When people come with severe malaria, it is like a race against time'
Malaria kills more than 1,500 people in Ethiopia every year. Now a new drug is improving survival rates  and is easy to administer at local village health posts

In her 12-square-metre outpost in Ethiopias Oromia region, Nure Kieltaji represents the frontline in the fight against malaria. She works as a community health worker, one of two people offering basic primary healthcare to more than 1,000 people in her village Dembel Dildila.
Nure spends a lot of her time on malaria prevention, travelling between homes to educate people on the use of insecticide-treated nets and point out potential breeding sites for mosquitoes  mostly pots of stagnant water and discarded plastic bags.
Malaria cases go down here each year, she says proudly, pointing to a series of charts on the wall behind her. If they have fever, even for one hour, they should visit me.
Nures biggest concern is severe malaria, which kills more than 1,500 people in Ethiopia each year. Uncomplicated cases of malaria are a burden but not fatal, while patients with severe malaria can present to clinics unconscious, with signs of damage to the brain, lungs or kidneys. Children are most vulnerable because their bodies are yet to build an immune response to the malaria parasite.
When people come with severe malaria it is like a race against time, Nure explains. The nearest clinic capable of treating severe malaria is relatively close to the village  about a 30-minute walk  but with an unconscious patient and no vehicles, the distance seems far greater.
Ive heard of patients coming but its too late for them to get to the clinic, especially when they are young children and the parents might not know how serious it is, Nure says.

For more than a century the standard treatment for severe malaria has been quinine, a drug given to patients by drip. But quinine can be difficult to administer  it relies on precise calculations of the patients body weight and a slow delivery over four hours, with repetitions every eight. For this reason fatal overdoses can occur, particularly in rural areas where there may be a lack of training or health professionals are overstretched.
In 2010 the World Health Organisation issued guidelines for an alternative to quinine, an injectable drug experts say is more efficient and safer to use. A Mdecins Sans Frontires trial found treatment with the new drug, injectable artesunate, reduced the risk of death by 39% in adults and 24% in children. MSF also found artesunate had fewer side effects than quinine and was easier for health workers to administer. The drug also helps hospitals clear beds faster; a child treated with artesunate could be back home after two or three days, compared with a week or more when treated with quinine.
Despite its advantages, the roll-out of artesunate in many malaria-endemic countries has been frustratingly slow. In Ethiopia, the government introduced the drug in its national guidelines in 2013. But a lack of training on using artesunate, combined with higher prices and supply shortages, has meant many clinics continue to stock quinine.
Damtew Yadeta, malaria and tropical disease expert at Oromia Regional Health Bureau, said health workers in the region had begun using artesunate but a scale-up was required. One of the biggest challenges is the information gap at different facilities  we have about 1,300 health centres in the region and almost all are expected to give case management services for malaria, but due to budget shortages we cannot provide training for everyone. So due to lack of information, health professionals are not requesting artesunate, even though it is the preferred drug.
For malaria patients already receiving the new drug, the difference in treatment options is clear.

At Tulu Bulu hospital, a public clinic on leafy grounds 60km south of Addis Ababa, 26-year-old Chala Duba is back for a check-up after contracting malaria. He says he came to the hospital after suffering from severe weakness and back pain.
They gave me the injectable drug and I got relief from the severe pain. After 24 hours I was able to take food again, Chala says.
At Nures village health post, the new drug is also making life easier. While injectable artesunate can only be administered in health clinics and hospitals, health workers like Nure can deliver a different form of the drug rectally. This treatment serves as an interim measure for children who are further away from medical clinics, buying them about 24 hours to get injectable treatment.
Now, if someone comes in with severe malaria, like vomiting and fever and convulsing, I can test them here, give them rectal artesunate and refer them on, Nure says. It gives them time, and time is very important.
Lelio Marmora, executive director of Unitaid , which is working to increase the uptake of artesunate in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda, says a key focus is to address drug supply problems. He says Unitaid has identified two new manufacturers and is investing to help bring their products on to the market, increasing the drugs availability and driving prices down.
There have been challenges around adequate and predictable supply at the health facilities which have been impeding use. Injectable artesunate is supplied mostly at centralised health facilities such as regional hospitals. However, most malaria cases are seen in rural peripheral health facilities, Marmora says.
Ultimately, wed like to see all of the global annual 8m severe malaria cases treated with the best possible medicine we have available. Today, this is injectable artesunate for treatment at facilities and rectal artesunate to buy time before patients reach facilities.

More than 550 civilians, including at least 115 children, have been killed in the street fighting and air strikes that have claimed more than 1,000 lives in Yemen since 26 March, according to the UN.
The UN childrens agency, Unicef , said at least 64 children had been killed by air strikes, 26 by unexploded ordnance and mines, 19 by gunshots, three by shelling and three by unverified causes related to the conflict. The violence has maimed a further 172 children, and injured a total of 1,185 civilians.
There are hundreds of thousands of children in Yemen who continue to live in the most dangerous circumstances, many waking up scared in the middle of the night to the sounds of bombing and gunfire, said Julien Harneis, Unicef representative to Yemen .
The number of child casualties shows clearly how devastating this conflict continues to be for the countrys children. Without a speedy end to the violence, children will be unable to lead normal lives.
In a statement released on Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) said that while the fighting between Houthi rebels and other armed groups had often been indiscriminate, Saudi-led coalition air strikes against Houthi rebels were still killing dozens of civilians despite the official end of the bombing campaign .
OHCHR said air strikes on military and civilian positions in Sanaa, Ibb, Hajjah, and Taiz, which occurred on 22 April  a day after Saudi Arabia said it was halting the strikes  killed 58 civilians, including seven children.
Forty civilians were killed and 70 wounded that morning after warplanes twice hit a bridge in Ibb governorate . Civilians rushing to help the injured were reportedly hit by a second wave of strikes.
A day earlier, said OHCHR, at least 20 civilians were killed and 120 injured in an air strike on a building in the Faj Attan area of Sanaa City. The raid also damaged a number of UN offices in the Yemeni capital, including those of OHCHR.
Last Sunday, Oxfam claimed an airstrike had hit one of its warehouses in northern Yemen, describing the incident as an absolute outrage . Another NGO, International Medical Corps, said a coalition airstrike on Monday injured six staff members working in their office in Sanaa and damaged humanitarian supply warehouses containing medical and other relief supplies.
Saudi Arabia and its allies launched the air war at the end of March in an attempt to restore the authority of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was forced to flee abroad last month as Iranian-backed Houthi fighters swept across the country.
Fighting between Houthis and local armed groups in Yemens southern governorates claimed at least 14 civilian lives on 21 April, with the same number injured. OHCHR said it had also received separate reports of snipers killing a child in the southern city of Dhale and four civilians emerging from a mosque in the port city of Aden.
The agency said weeks of bombings and street battles have also left hospitals damaged and without water, morgues inundated with bodies, and ambulances unable to reach casualties because of a lack of fuel. The UN estimates at least 64 public buildings have been partially or completely destroyed as a result of the conflict.
We urge all sides to the conflict to ensure that international human rights law and international humanitarian law are respected, and to ensure that all measures are taken to ensure civilians are protected, said a spokesman. All sides must ensure that the humanitarian aid  which is desperately needed  can reach the people of Yemen.
Mohamed Elmontassir Hussein, the International Rescue Committee s country director for Yemen, said the humanitarian situation was becoming catastrophic.
Hospitals are not working properly because there is no water and no electricity and not enough medical supplies, he said. The bombing is continuing and the fighting on the streets is still ongoing and there is no differentiation between civilians and armed people on the streets.
Hussein said proper humanitarian access had to be provided as soon as possible and called for a complete end to the air strikes.
We are not reaching everyone, he said. Its insecure and although our national staff on the ground are trying their best to support hospitals, its time-consuming to arrange, as is delivering drugs to some of the hospitals. The airport has to reopen and there has to be some kind of return to regular life.
Cdric Schweizer, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Yemen delegation, echoed Husseins calls .
There are three priorities, he said. First, medical aid and other assistance must be allowed in. Second, people must be able to leave their homes to have access to shops and basic services (such as they are). Third, the ICRC and other humanitarian organisations must be allowed to carry out their work.
On Friday, the UNs World Food Programme (WFP) warned that 12 million people in the country did not know where their next meal was coming from  a 13% rise since the conflict escalated at the end of last month.
The agency said it was trying to deliver food to more than 100,000 people sheltered around Aden.
But we are struggling to reach people because of deteriorating security, a WFP statement said, adding that dire fuel shortages were also hampering the response.
The food agency said it hoped to provide emergency food aid to 2.5 million people from May to July.

UN human rights chief denounces Sun over Katie Hopkins 'cockroach' column
High commissioner launches scathing attack on tabloid columnist, comparing Hopkins migrant remarks with hate language used before Rwandan genocide

The UNs human rights chief has attacked the Sun newspaper for publishing an article by columnist Katie Hopkins, branding her use of the word cockroaches to describe migrants as reminiscent of anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda.
In a scathing and extraordinary intervention, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein , points out that the word cockroaches was used by both the Nazis and those behind the genocide in Rwanda, and urges the UK government, media and regulators to respect national and international laws on curbing incitement to hatred.
The Nazi media described people their masters wanted to eliminate as rats and cockroaches, said Zeid.

This type of language is clearly inflammatory and unacceptable, especially in a national newspaper. The Suns editors took an editorial decision to publish this article, and  if it is found in breach of the law  should be held responsible along with the author.
But such language, he added, was typical of decades of sustained and unrestrained anti-foreigner abuse, misinformation and distortion when it came to the reporting of migrant and refugee issues in the British media.
On 17 April, Hopkins  a columnist for the Sun, Britains biggest-selling newspaper  wrote that she was resolutely unmoved by the plight of those risking their lives by crossing the Mediterranean.
Hopkins, a former contestant on the BBC1 show The Apprentice, and perennial courter of controversy, wrote: No, I dont care. Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad. I still dont care.
Hopkins added: Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches. They might look a bit Bob Geldofs Ethiopia circa 1984, but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb. They are survivors.
The column appeared hours before a fishing vessel packed with migrants capsized off the coast of Libya, with the loss of 800 lives .
A spokesperson for the UK industry regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, said: We can confirm that there have been more than 300 complaints about the article. IPSO is investigating whether the piece breaches the Editors Code and will publish its findings in due course. While this process continues, it would not be right to provide a detailed response on the investigation or the broader issues it raises.

Zeid said Hopkins column was far from an isolated incident, accusing the British tabloid press of consistently attacking and vilifying migrants.
This vicious verbal assault on migrants and asylum seekers in the UK tabloid press has continued unchallenged under the law for far too long, he said.
I am an unswerving advocate of freedom of expression, which is guaranteed under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), but it is not absolute. Article 20 of the same covenant says: Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.
The commissioner also accused the Daily Express of seeking to whip up anti-foreigner prejudice.
To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem, back in 2003 the Daily Express ran 22 negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single 31-day period, he said.

Asylum seekers and migrants have, day after day, for years on end, been linked to rape, murder, diseases such as HIV and TB, theft, and almost every conceivable crime and misdemeanour imaginable in front-page articles and two-page spreads, in cartoons, editorials, even on the sports pages of almost all the UKs national tabloid newspapers.
But many of the stories, said Zeid, had been grossly distorted or subsequently revealed to be outright fabrications.
Although he conceded that a similar process of demonisation was taking place elsewhere in Europe, he said it was usually led by extremist political parties or demagogues rather than extremist media.
Zeid said that all European countries needed to crack down on racism and xenophobia, which, under the guise of freedom of expression, are being allowed to feed a vicious cycle of vilification, intolerance and politicisation of migrants, as well as of marginalised European minorities such as the Roma.
He also highlighted the fact that both the ICCPR and elements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  both of which have been ratified by the UK and other European countries  had sprung from a desire to avoid a repetition of the Holocaust.
History has shown us time and again the dangers of demonising foreigners and minorities, and it is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries, simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers, he said.
Related: Crushing repression of Eritrea's citizens is driving them into migrant boats
While there was a valid public debate to be had on migration and refugee issues, he said, the discussions had to be based on facts rather than fiction or blatant xenophobia.
Zeid added that twisted and prejudiced reporting was sapping compassion for those fleeing conflict, human rights abuses and economic deprivation, as well as those now drowning in the Mediterranean.
He said the nasty underbelly of racism now characterising the migration debate in more and more European countries was even skewing the EU response to the crisis.
Thursdays emergency meeting of European leaders , he added, had focused on deterrence and on preventing movement at all costs, [which] risks making the crisis even worse, and could sadly result in further massive loss of life.
Zeid is the second senior UN official to criticise Hopkins. On Wednesday, Franois Crpeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, said people such as the columnist were helping to win votes by migrant-bashing .
Crpeau said politicians needed to show proper leadership: We need people who are able to say to that Sun journalist, Youre wrong and you should know that.
Hopkins used her column in the newspaper on Friday to address her previous remarks, describing the outcry the piece provoked as a cautionary tale.
She wrote: I am reminded of the power of the pen. One should be brave enough to speak out - but aware of the dangers which lurk in the depths of our vocabulary.
No one wants to see images of children drowned at sea, no matter what their journey or their destination. The next time you are thinking of clicking on a petition, dont be angry about words.
Accept our opinions differ. Channel your outrage at the regimes causing people to flee. And be part of the solution.
A Sun spokesman said neither Hopkins nor the paper would be commenting further.

About a year ago, I planned to pay a smuggler to get on a boat to Europe.
A lot of people in Europe think that we refugees dont know that we can die at sea, that we have not seen the horrific pictures of refugees dead bodies, that we dont know that tens of thousands of people have been buried on Europes shores.
Related: Migrant crisis: smuggling or trafficking? Politicians don't seem to know |
But I do watch the news every day, and I had seen how more than 500 people had died a few kilometres from the Italian island Lampedusa in October 2013. I knew the statistics, I knew the risks. I had even lost friends of mine, who are some of the refugees without a face and without a name, as the media refers to them. But, in the same way as many Syrian refugees who, together with Eritreans, made up about half of the refugees crossing over to Europe by boat in 2014, I thought this was my only chance.
I am a Syrian refugee from the Palestinian al-Yarmouk camp in Damascus. When I was small, my grandmother used to tell us how she felt when she was forced to flee to Syria from her home in Palestine in 1948, and how she hoped that her children and grandchildren would never have to experience what it feels like to be a refugee. But we did. I was born a Palestinian refugee, and almost three years ago I became a refugee once more, when my family and I had to flee the Syrian war to Lebanon.
Our home, the Palestinian camp, had been under the hardest siege one can possibly imagine. I am still in touch with family and friends who could not leave Yarmouk camp. In a cruel absurdity, they sometimes have internet, but they dont have food. Many of them have starved to death or died because they do not have access to medication or treatment.
Many of the refugees left in Yarmouk have starved to death or died because they do not have access to medication
My friends and family have always known me as a very optimistic person. I love life, I love people. I had worked in Cyprus, and even when I could not return home to my beloved Syria because the war had already started, giving up was the last thing I had in mind. In Lebanon , I started supporting my fellow Syrians and Palestinian-Syrians. They needed me, and their smiles and appreciation kept me going. I woke up every morning to volunteer with DPNA (Development for People and Nature Association), a partner organisation of CARE.
But about a year ago, I could not bear the situation any more. I felt the refugees suffering  that of the Syrians, the Palestinians, the Syrian-Palestinians. I felt their misery, their destroyed hopes and dreams. And I also thought about my own life, my future. I had lost hope. Before the war in Syria started, I had my whole life ahead of me. But then, at 27, my life as it was suddenly took a break. I could not work legally in my profession as an engineer any more. I had studied, I had money, a good job. Suddenly, I stood there with nothing at all. Being a refugee also means losing your future, your dreams.

I did not get on the boat to go to Europe. After long discussions with my family and friends, I am still in Lebanon, and I am still supporting my fellow refugees.
I am leading a project to train other volunteers now. Refugees are in need of humanitarian support. The refugees I work with have been engineers like me; they were doctors, teachers, farmers and workers. We had normal lives, and, as much as we refugees appreciate Europe for what it is, its not heaven on earth for us.

Like me, most refugees dream about going back home, going back to Syria. But if peace is not restored and neighbouring countries continue to struggle with the burden of hosting 4 million Syrian refugees , Europe for some seems to be the only option to live a life in dignity. We humans are all quite similar: we love our friends, our families, our home. We do not give this up easily. But bombs and bullets keep us away from the place we love most.
I follow the news, I follow the discussions. I hear politicians talk about the necessity for the EU to resume its rescue missions; about issuing asylum to Syrians and other refugees before they have to travel on unsafe waters.
I am truly touched that so many people around the world cry out about our suffering, that people around the world care. They understand that I have not chosen to be born as a Palestinian Syrian, as you have not chosen to be born as a European. I do not wish my situation on anyone.
But I would hope that we could make this time in history a time of change. Europeans have gone through similar pain, just a few generations ago. Europeans too have been refugees ; they were the reason why grand international law projects like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1951 refugee convention were drafted in the first place. I really hope that people in Europe can remind themselves of the bond of humanity that connects us all and that remains the strongest medicine against desperation and powerlessness.
But more than anything I hope that European and other leaders around the world resume their efforts to push for peace talks. In the end, most refugees hope that they can cease to be called refugees, that their countries will restore peace and that they can return to the places they love most: their homes.

New York University (NYU) has pledged to compensate thousands of migrant workers who built its new campus in Abu Dhabi after an investigation found that roughly a third were excluded from safeguards intended to stop them from being abused and exploited.
About 10,000 people were not covered by the universitys labour guidelines, which were meant to protect them from exploitative conditions including forced labour, poor wages, illegal recruitment fees and associated debts, squalid living conditions, and abuse and harassment, according to a report by the international investigations firm Nardello &amp; Co .
The report found that the system monitoring compliance with the guidelines was flawed, with local contractors  including Mubadala, a real estate company owned by the Abu Dhabi government  exploiting a loophole to exempt some subcontractors from the labour guidelines, which increased their profits. It concluded that this practice  created a significant gap in coverage that disenfranchised thousands of workers from the protections contemplated by the labo[u]r guidelines.

The investigation was commissioned by NYU and its partner Tamkeen, following reports by the media and human rights groups suggesting that many migrant workers building the new campus on Saadiyat Island lived in squalid conditions, were charged supposedly outlawed recruitment fees, received wages far lower than they were promised, and had their passports confiscated by their employers. These findings were cited in a complaint by the International Trade Union Confederation to the International Labour Organisation, which is conducting an investigation into allegations of forced labour in the United Arab Emirates.
The Nardello investigators determined that NYU and Tamkeen were genuinely committed to fair working conditions and that their guidelines and monitoring arrangements had improved the lives of many workers. However, their report also corroborated many of the allegations levelled by the media and NGOs and found that the implementation of the [employment] standards was flawed.
In a joint statement, NYU and Tamkeen welcomed the finding that 65%-70% of the 30,000 migrant workers involved in constructing and operating the campus on Saadiyat Island, which opened last year , had been protected by the guidelines. But they also accepted that the system was flawed, adding that they would provide compensation to the excluded workers in line with what they should have received under our labor standards.
That error, for which we take full responsibility, was inconsistent with the projects publicly stated commitment to ensure that all of those working on the construction of the NYUAD Saadiyat campus would be covered by our standards and compliance-monitoring program, the statement said.
It added that a third party would be appointed to reimburse the affected workers, who also include some not paid their full wages despite being covered by the guidelines. An NYU spokesman did not elaborate on the amount of compensation that would be provided.
Originally only a narrow group of workers were exempted from compliance with the labour standards, such as outside vendors delivering goods to the main campus project. But the contractors widened this group to exclude subcontractors whose work was valued at less than $1m (665,000), those who worked onsite for less than 31 days, and those with gaps of 30 days between visits to the site.
Decreasing the number of covered workers would have had the net effect of lowering  costs and increasing profits
Nardello &amp; Co report
As contracts included additional payments for compliance-related costs, this provided a financial incentive for contractors to subcontract work into smaller amounts, exempting them from the guidelines and eliminating the associated extra costs, the investigators found.
It is evident that decreasing the number of covered workers would have had the net effect of lowering compliance-related costs and increasing profits for the company, said the report.
The investigators found that the projects main contractors, Mubadala and Al Futtaim Carillion, a UAE affiliate of the British construction firm Carillion plc, which was responsible for implementing the guidelines, exploited the flaws in the system, thereby increasing their profits.
The report noted that correspondence among Mubadala, AF Carillion and EC Harris, the cost consultant on the project, referred to NYU and the Executive Affairs Authority of Abu Dhabi having been fully aware of the exemption strategy. However, it also said NYU, and NYUs monitor of the labour guidelines, Mott McDonald, appeared not to have been aware of the practice of granting exemptions, adding that accounts vary as to what each party knew. Some NYU staff interviewed by Nardello said they were aware of a time threshold but not a financial one.
Nicholas McGeehan, Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: Not only was there a policy to exclude workers from the labour guidelines, but firms were able to increase their own profits on account of that policy using money designated to help them comply with those guidelines. Nardello have said in interviews that it was beyond the scope of their mandate to investigate this issue in full, which is a great shame.
In a statement, John Sexton, president of NYU, said that neither the university nor Tamkeen were aware of the exemption policy or how widely it was being applied. But he added: The bottom line is that we both nonetheless must take responsibility for the lapses that occurred and must try to address them.
UAE law is completely inconsistent with labour practices in the US and elsewhere in the west
Nardello &amp; Co report
The report found that only 20 of the 25,000 who qualified for reimbursement of the recruitment fees they paid to secure work in the UAE, typically $1,000 to $3,000, received any financial compensation. It also noted that 30% of workers reported they were forced to hand over their passports to their employers to gain employment on the campus, in breach of the labour guidelines.
The Coalition for Fair Labor at NYU , a campaign group of staff and students, welcomed the report. It said the findings showed that Mott MacDonald had failed to do an adequate job, and that the process, as a whole, was poorly designed.
A footnote in the report said: UAE law is completely inconsistent with labor practices in the US and elsewhere in the west, adding that it was difficult to reconcile NYUs labour guidelines with UAE law, specifically its ban on unionisation and criminalisation of strike action.
Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said: The acceptance of these laws by NYU simply means that workers will face serious exploitation with no effective means of redress. They continue to employ support, cleaning, catering and maintenance staff who are forced to pay illegal fees to get jobs, pay them poverty wages and deny freedom of association.

The UK government is driving inequality in the worlds poorest countries by dogmatically funding private sector health and education projects instead of using aid money to boost public systems, a report has said.
Rather than addressing the needs of the worlds poorest people, the Department for International Developments (DfID) close relationship with the private sector is filling the pockets of big corporations, according to Profiting from poverty, again , a study published on Friday by the campaigning group Global Justice Now (GJN).
Nick Dearden, director of GJN, said: Aid should be used to support human needs by building up public services in countries that dont have the same levels of economic privilege as the UK. So its shocking that DfID is dogmatically promoting private health and education when its been shown that this approach actually entrenches inequality and endangers access.
The report also questioned DfIDs appointment of Sir Michael Barber, a senior executive at Pearson , the worlds largest maker of textbooks and academic materials, as its chief advisor for education in Pakistan, saying it presented a conflict of interest. DfID oversees an ambitious 350m health and education programme in Pakistan and has partnered with Pearson on a project in Tanzania and Zimbabwe .
It seems highly inappropriate that executives from a company like Pearson can be acting in an official capacity at DfID, while their company provides commercial services that would directly benefit from the type of decisions being taken by DfID, Dearden said.
A DfID spokesman said: We have firm policies in place to prevent any conflict of interest in our work.
Pearson, which operates in more than 70 countries, launched its affordable learning programme in 2012. The initiative is a for-profit venture fund that uses capital investment to help millions of children in the world access a quality education in a cost effective, profitable and scalable manner, according to the company.
A spokeswoman for Pearson said: As the Global Justice Now report makes clear, there is an explicit agreement with DfID to ensure that Michael Barbers role does not advantage Pearson. Pearsons affordable learning fund has no investments in Pakistan .
In a letter to the UK cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood , Dearden said: It remains the case that Pearson does benefit from DfID contracts in the more general area on which Sir Michael works, namely promoting an increasing role for private education providers across the world.
On Friday, a group of US, British and South African NGOs and teachers groups issued an open letter to John Fallon, Pearsons CEO . The letter read: By supporting the expansion of low-fee private schooling and other competitive practices, Pearson is essentially ensuring that a large number of the worlds most vulnerable children have no hope of receiving a free, quality education.
The open letter was released on Friday to coincide with the companys annual general meeting. It was signed by the American Federation of Teachers , the UKs National Union of Teachers , the South African Democratic Teachers Union , the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , Action Aid UK and the National Education Association .
The UK has invested more heavily in private sector projects than other rich countries, drawing criticism from the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai). DfID often seems to behave more like a hedge fund [than an aid agency], investing capital alongside banking partners like JP Morgan, GJN said.
DfID is working with companies including Coca-Cola, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Adam Smith International and is promoting the role of private sector partners in its biggest health and education projects, according to GJN.
The GJN report said DfIDs efforts to promote low-cost private schools in poor countries are misplaced and dangerous.
The Girls Education Challenge , a 355m DfID programme designed to get more girls in school, is managed by PwC and includes a partnership with Coca-Cola in Nigeria.
In Kenya, DfID has partnered with Adam Smith International in a 25m project that seeks to get 5,000 Kenyans enrolled in low-cost private schools.
DfID has also channelled millions of pounds into the harnessing non-state actors for better health for the poor (Hanshep) scheme, which promotes private sector investment in the health sectors of poor countries.
Kishore Singh, the UNs special rapporteur on the right to education, is among those who have expressed reservations about private education. I see [the growth of private education] not as progress, but as an indictment of governments that have failed to meet their obligation to provide universal, free and high-quality education for all, said Singh.
A DfID spokesman said: The UK strives to get the best possible outcomes for poor people and takes a pragmatic stance on how services should be delivered. In some circumstances (parts of India, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, for example), this includes developing partnerships with low-fee private schools.
DfID works with the private sector in situations where the public sector is not sufficiently present (the slums of Nairobi for example) or where state provision is so weak that the private sector has stepped in to fill the gap. Recognising that fees are still a major barrier to access for the poor, DfIDs support includes voucher schemes that subsidise access to low-fee private schools for the poorest.

One of the US governments flagship programmes for development in the strategic south of Afghanistan risks running aground.
According to current plans, when the Department of Defense withdraws funding for diesel in Kandahar city later this year, it will also pull the plug on thousands of factories and homes, potentially aiding the Taliban , which until 2001 had its stronghold in Kandahar.
The USs Kandahar Bridging Solution is set to end in September. A key part of the project is the Shorandam Industrial Park, a new $7.8m (5.2m) venture built on the side of the highway between the airport and the city. The park includes a power plant and an electrical distribution system. It also has business facilities to stimulate growth and create jobs for local entrepreneurs, although many remain empty.
The US has no convincing plan to secure remaining electricity when it cuts funding, a US congressional watchdog warns in a new report .
We are unconvinced that there are plans in place to ensure there is a reliable and sustainable power source for this strategically important city, says the Special Inspector for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar).
USAid built the Shorandam Industrial Park in 2004. After assuming control of the park in 2010, the Afghan government allowed the US military to build a power plant on the site to temporarily supply Kandahar with some of its electricity. Sigar says that during a recent visit to Afghanistan, the US government did not provide the necessary insight into planning and quality assurance of the industrial park.
USAid officials were unable to provide the requested contract documents and could not explain their inability to locate the documents, Sigar says. As a result, we could not test whether the parks internal electrical distribution and water systems were operable and safe, or whether those crucial systems, as well as roads, flood channels and other construction, met contract requirements.
Kandahar, which used to be an underdeveloped bastion of the Taliban, is now a busy city of half a million people, with daily domestic and international commercial flights. The city is largely secure by Afghan standards, with blast walls and an extensive police force fortifying the streets.
Yet, security in the province is tenuous. Rasoul Baghi, director of the southern provinces for the state power firm Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat ( Dabs ), said the Taliban controls more than a third of the output at the Kajaki plant, a facility in neighbouring Helmand province that helps power Kandahar.
An estimated 30% of Afghans have access to electricity, but the insurgents are able to secure a steady power supply to areas under their control, taxing residents in the process.
For the past few weeks, electricity from the Kajaki plant has been cut off from the grid because of fighting spilling over from Sangin district in Helmand, damaging the transmission line.
A recent two-month military operation named Zulfiqar failed in its objective to clear Sangin of insurgents, but made it possible for Dabs to reconnect the Kajaki plant to the power grid three days ago, said Baghi.
Before then, the provincial capital Lashkar Gah had been without power for 60 days, according to the deputy governor of Helmand, Jan Mohammad Rasolyan.
The Taliban has maintained a steady level of fighting over the winter; in spring, they normally scale up attacks further. On Wednesday, the insurgents named this years fighting season Azm, meaning resolution or determination.
The spring offensive will begin on 24 April, the insurgents said, foreshadowing what many fear will be the Afghan wars deadliest year on record. There has been a particular increase in violence in the countrys south, where the national security forces are strained in the absence of international troops.
Another purpose of investment in Shorandam Industrial Park was to create employment. Stimulating the economy would ideally encourage farmers away from growing opium and give birth to a business class with commercial ties and loyalty to the national government.
Original plans for the plant included accommodation for 48 businesses. During their visit last year, however, Sigars inspectors only found one active Afghan business on site : an ice cream packing facility. When the inspectors returned this year, after the majority of US troops had left, there were still only four active businesses.

Shorandam and Kajaki aside, Kanadahar is powered by a third main plant, Bagh-e Pul, which the US also helps power with diesel subsidies.
In early 2014, the Americans supplied 1.8 million litres of diesel to Shorandam and Bagh-e Pul plants, said Baghi, which was enough for the generators to run on almost full capacity.
For the past year, the Defense Department has gradually decreased its supplies of fuel for the power plant, leaving it almost defunct. Fuel has shrunk to 300,000 litres, divided between the two plants.
In a written statement, Ben Edwards, a USAid spokesman, described Shorandam Industrial Park as fully operational.
Existing and future business tenants have access to electricity, water, roads and clear title to land in both parks. Equipment and infrastructure provided by USAid is already being utilised by business tenants. The Afghan government is taking active steps to ensure that the parks contribute to the economic development of the country, Edwards said.
Baghi said the current situation leaves the electricity vulnerable when there is fighting, as was the case in the recent clashes in Sangin. He adds that the only way for the cash-strapped Afghan government to supply the required diesel is to move resources from other big city plants in the country.
We dont have any alternative to supply fuel for the plants, Baghi said. The key to solve this is with the US government.
This article has been corrected to clarity that it is the US Department of Defense who is withdrawing funding for diesel in Kandahar city in September, rather than USAid.

Sabalibougou district school is set back from the main road, a block away from the right bank of the river Niger in Bamako. Next door is the daily sheep market. The broad open area between the school and the road, which appears at first the perfect area for a boisterous game of football, is in fact land recently cleared of informal housing. The local authority has plans to develop here.
The immaculate schoolyard hosts 4,500 pupils from years one to nine, all on one site. The set-up is typical for state schools in urban areas. In Mali , as in France, public school students wear what they like or have; the students who pass by in uniform are heading to private schools.
Related: What is the millennium development goal on education all about?
It costs 1,500 central African francs ($2.50; 1.67) a year to study at Sabalibougou, but there are still parents who cannot muster the fee. Private schools in the city can charge anything from $1,200 to $8,000 a year.
Students stay in their block from grades one to six, the first cycle, before moving up a section for grades seven to nine. Beyond that, some leave the school system while others head for the upper school, or lyce.

The milieu is distinctive, but the challenges facing the school, its students and its staff  lack of funding, overstretched facilities, large classes, a dearth of teacher training, children failing to progress to secondary education in sufficient numbers  reflect a pattern discernible across many developing regions.
The school monitors absences carefully. There are many reasons that prevent students coming to school here, but money is part of the story.
Adama Issa Diarra is the director of school F, one of the eight sections within the compound.
Sometimes we notice that some students dont come to school, mainly due to the fact that many families are still poor. Sometimes some students dont even eat before coming here and parents feel ill at ease. When it comes to paying school fees  because we have to collect the fees  we tell parents, If you dont pay, well be obliged to ask your kids to remain at home. Some parents, because they dont have money, just decide that their kids wont come until they get some money.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest
School director Adama Issa Diarra says non-attendance is often down to tight household finances
The school gives parents the option to pay step by step. Even then, some are not able to meet the deadline. But money is not the only factor that prevents all local children from enrolling, says Diarra.
Unfortunately, there are still some families who dont accept sending the kids to these kind[s] of public schools. Some want to send their kids to Islamic schools, which are very different from our system. Some just dont want to send their kids to school because they help them in the farms, or they use their kids for other things to get money..
In a packed ninth-grade classroom, some of the schools oldest students squeeze on to benches. Exercise books are open, and the teacher has written the aim of the lesson on the blackboard: today it is rcitation. The first two students, both girls, rather shyly deliver their accounts to the class of nearly 100. But then the forms star steps forward to make his case with gusto.

A ninth grade student delivers a sparkling presentation
About 70-80% of the children who start school in Sabalibougou complete the basic level. From there, only half go on to secondary school. Diarra says this is down to the challenge of passing the last class. Many kids have to take the classes many times and finally, at a given time  when theyve taken it two or three times  youre obliged to send them out. So unfortunately its [only] about 50% who succeed.

Space is at a premium in ninth grade classrooms
Looking around the school, there is little sign of a gender gap for those successfully completing basic education. Secondary level graduation is a different matter, however.
Unfortunately, many girls dont succeed in finishing their secondary school, says Diarra. We have two main issues. The first is that they get married early, or too early. The second one is unwanted pregnancies; when these occur, most of the girls have to stop school.
Its break time now. As students pour out into the courtyard, two children share their plans for the future.
Fanta Bamba, 14, says she likes school very much and particularly enjoys learning English. I would like to continue my studies. Im very lucky because my family allows me, as a girl, to continue. So I will make the most of this opportunity to finish my studies.
Fanta has yet to decide what she wants to do when she leaves school. Its not very clear in my mind, but I would like to get a very good job where I can have enough money and have a good life and also help my parents.
Her friend, Bourama Fomba, 13, would like to go on to lyce after finishing. He has given careful consideration to what comes next. When I finish my studies, I would like to find a good job in an office, or even to become a minister  why not?
But such aspirations are a challenge to nurture when there are 80 pupils in Bouramas class, and 82 in Fantas.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest
Fanta Bamba, 14, right, says her favourite subject is English. Bourama Fomba, 13, is a Manchester City fan and keen football player
Diarra ponders the biggest difficulties facing the countrys teachers. We have a few key challenges: we have a large number of students per class, [and] sometimes when teachers have too many students in their class the quality of the teaching will decrease.
He would like to see more opportunities for teacher training, especially continuing professional development. Teachers also lack resources to deliver some lessons, says Diarra: Sometimes teachers dont have enough  or appropriate  materials  its very, very difficult.
As director, Diarra supports other staff.
We try to assist the teachers in the class, sometimes we even give them model, simple classes as we teach and make them observe and learn from that observation.
But with large classes and relatively limited resources, motivation is a key issue, says Diarra.
This is the problem, the system is not really improving because sometimes there is a lack of training for teachers and sometimes the training is not very adapted to the situation and there is a lack of teaching materials, so its very difficult for teachers even to apply what theyve been learning.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest
Ninth grade students at Sabalibougou district school
Unsurprisingly, only a minority of school F pupils will make it to university. Those who do will study alongside students who have come up through the private school system.
Its very sad to say, says Diarra, but poor families tend to send their kids to public schools and, of course, rich families prefer to send their children to private schools, where maybe its better organised and with more possibilities, more materials and so on.
Bourama, though, remains upbeat. If I have a chance to talk to people in the world, I would like them to understand that here in Mali its not very easy but students are serious [hard-working]. We are really doing our best to move forward, because we are aware what an opportunity  for both boys and girls  going to school represents.

Ugandas success in universal primary education falling apart
Despite the $302m spent annually on primary education, almost 70% of children are likely to drop out, with hidden costs proving too high for poorer parents

A gentle drizzle beats an insistent rhythm on the rusty, corrugated iron classroom roof at Katwe primary school in a suburb of Kampala, Ugandas capital.
It is a chilly morning and children in the primary one class are learning the alphabet. A, B, C, they repeat after their teacher. But many of these children will not finish their seven years of primary education.
Related: What is the millennium development goal on education all about?
Irene Namusuubo Guloba, the headteacher, says: Around 250 of our pupils did not come back this year. We cannot tell exactly where they went. This exodus of pupils is not unusual here  some transfer to other schools, but others drop out completely, Guloba says.
Katwe primary is one of the government schools implementing the Universal Primary Education (UPE) scheme.
When the initiative started in 1997, as part of a national policy to provide free primary education for underprivileged children, it was a dream come true for most poor parents in the east African state. Wealthier parents take their children to private schools.
In record time, numbers in UPE schools soared. Enrolment increased from 3.1 million pupils in 1996 to 8.4 million in 2013.
The numbers are evenly spread between boys and girls. And the country has been commended for achieving more than 90% of MDG2 , which aimed to ensure that all children  boys and girls alike  complete primary school.
But this success seems to be falling apart amid a very high number of dropouts and poor-quality schooling for some of those who complete primary school.
The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) has estimated that 68% of children in Uganda who enrol in primary school are likely to drop out before finishing the prescribed seven years.
Chad has the highest dropout rate in sub-Saharan Africa, at 72%. In east Africa , Kenya has the highest completion rateof 84%.
At a cabinet ministers retreat last month, Ugandas President Yoweri Museveni expressed his rage over the rate at which pupils were leaving school, even when the country spent 900bn Ugandan shillings ($302m; $201m) annually on the scheme. He said: We should get an answer, and if you think it [UPE] needs to be restructured, we do that.
The scheme faces a myriad of issues: gender challenges, child labour, early marriages, less motivated teachers, and lack of awareness among parents. However, the biggest challenge is poverty.
Dr Nicholas Itaaga, a UPE expert and a lecturer at Makerere Universitys School of Education, says poorer parents still struggle to meet requirements for school. UPE was a good development for any government to implement. Our problem in Uganda [is that] it was not adequately planned. We are losing out.
The major setback for UPE is that it is not entirely free, contrary to the general perception that parents are not supposed to pay for anything.
For poorer parents, especially in rural Uganda, the cost of pens, exercise books and clothing is beyond their reach
In practice they still have to buy scholastic materials including pens, exercise books, clothing and even bricks for classroom construction. They also have to provide or buy lunch for their children. For poorer parents, especially in rural Uganda, who live on about $1 a day, the cost is beyond reach.
Charles Mugerwa is the father of an 11-year-old boy in Kasenyi village, Kalangala district, in central Uganda. On a school day, his son is at home. Asked why, Mugerwa said: He has no uniform.
The poorer regions  northern and eastern Uganda  experience higher dropout rates. Western and central regions are regarded as better off.
Government figures indicate poverty levels have declined in Uganda, from 24.5% in 2009-10 to 19.7% in 20012-13.
Do not expect a pupil who comes to school and there is no hope for a lunch[time] meal to stay in school, Guloba says.
Some schools now ask parents to pay between $2 and $5 a pupil for every three-month term so that they can prepare lunch for them. But some parents still cannot afford to pay, and their children end up dropping out.

I have been to the deep rural areas and a simple thing such as an exercise book or sanitary pads for the girls is a very big issue, Itaaga says.
An estimated 30% of girls leave school when they start their periods, often because of a lack of sanitary pads .
At Katwe, the school steps in for parents and buys pads for the pupils. I actually have big girls here. The school provides some money to buy sanitary pads. The senior woman talks to them and they are comfortable, Guloba says. We are able to keep them in class.
But not all girls have that chance so they end up dropping out, deterred by inadequate facilities, particularly the lack of privacy when boys and girls share latrines.
Fagil Mandy, former chairman of Ugandas National Examinations Board, feels that the critical role schools can play is insufficiently acknowledged and evaluated. The school as an institution has not been focused on by any major authority. It is a life-nurturing place, and should be overseen and monitored all the time, Mandy says.
Government statistics show that for every 71 pupils there is one latrine. NGOs and bodies including the World Bank have funded the construction of classrooms and toilets for some schools, but much more help is needed to provide adequate facilities for the huge numbers of pupils involved.

The education minister, Jessica Alupo, says the high dropout rate is a great concern for the government: We want to know why all parents send a child to school when they are in primary one and the numbers decrease as they ascend to upper classes. We want to engage them [parents] much more than before.
Margaret Rwabushaija, chair of Ugandas National Teachers Union, says the government must increase funding to schools. Since 1997, she says, it has not revised the amount of money it pays to educate a child annually, which stands at 7,560 shillings. How do you expect headteachers to run schools without money? she asks.
Another major issue has been quality of teaching. A 2012 study found that three out of 10 pupils in primary three could read and comprehend a primary two-level story. At primary seven, the final class in the primary cycle, two out of 10 pupils could not read a primary two-level story. This has created a huge knowledge gap between children of the haves, studying in private schools, and the have-nots, in government schools.
Betty Bitainensha, deputy head teacher at government-aided Kitante primary school in Kampala, says public schools often have the best-trained teachers, but they are less motivated to work. Teachers are among the lowest paid public servants in Uganda. The government has pledged to increase teachers salaries in the 2015-16 financial year.
Alupo says she is optimistic about the future, but only if they can focus on the key obstacles: Are teachers at school at all times? Are they are motivated to teach? Is the environment conducive for the learners? And finally is there a special programme to talk to parents about their role and obligation?

What is the millennium development goal on education all about?
The education goal was designed to ensure that every child in the world gets a primary school education. How has it fared since its launch?

What is millennium development goal two?
The second of the eight development goals launched at the turn of the century called for every child in the world, boys and girls alike, to receive a full course of primary school education by 2015. Progress towards this lone target has been measured by looking at how many children enrol in primary education, how many complete the process , and how many 15- to 24-year-olds are able to read and write .
Related: Millennium development goal 2: 15 achievements on education
Will the goal be met?
The headline figures might suggest a success story in the making, but the short answer is no. In 2012, the most recent year for which worldwide data is available, 58 million children aged between six and 11 were out of school. The problem was nowhere more acute than in sub-Saharan Africa, where roughly 30 million children were affected . So while more children are registering for primary school than ever before  in 2012 the global figure stood at 90%, up from 83% at the turn of the century  the ideal of universal enrolment remains elusive. Progress since the turn of the century was made mostly before 2007 , with only an additional 2 million children making it to the classroom since then. Moreover, about a quarter of children worldwide  half of them living in conflict-affected areas  drop out of primary school before their studies are complete, a statistic that has remained unchanged since the millennium development goals were introduced. And while there has been a slight increase in literacy among 15- to 24-year-olds, which went from 87% in 2000 to 89% in 2012, again there is a sting in the tail, with 126 million young people worldwide still unable to read and write. It does not help that donor funding for education has been in decline since 2010 .
How have girls fared?
Again, its a mixed story. The education goal called for girls and boys alike to receive a primary school education, but it failed to acknowledge that the challenges they face are far from alike. In some poor countries, sons are still seen as the breadwinners of the future, and their education prioritised over daughters. This means they are more vulnerable to early or forced marriage and early pregnancy, and are often left to shoulder a disproportionate share of the domestic workload. On the plus side, perhaps partly because of the emphasis on education in the gender equality goal , boys and girls are now enrolling for primary school in equal numbers. That, though, means very little if they subsequently fall by the wayside, and the reality is that for every 100 boys out of primary school there are 117 girls .

What still needs to be addressed?
Increasing primary school enrolment without making provision for improved access to secondary and higher education was a fundamentally flawed strategy. Governments and donors supported the education goal by building and equipping new primary schools, in the process creating a burgeoning generation of young learners. But not enough provision was made for what would happen further down the line. The consequences of this approach are perhaps nowhere more apparent than in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than half of children old enough to be in secondary school are no longer in education, even though the region has recorded the most significant increase in primary school enrolment since the turn of the century. In some cases, buildings and books were emphasised over the more basic aim of improving literacy. Moreover, inadequate resources made it difficult to reduce class sizes, increase the number of qualified teachers, promote better teacher training or enhance academic curricula. Building more schools while neglecting to populate them with enough skilled teachers who were paid on time was not a recipe for success.
How did MDG2 fit with existing global education initiatives?
In April 2000, at the World Education Forum in Dakar, 164 countries pledged to meet a set of six targets by 2015. The agenda called for expanded and improved early childhood care and education, and stipulated that school attendance for children should be compulsory, free of charge and of good quality. It also promoted lifelong learning, adult literacy, the provision of learning opportunities for old and young, gender equality and an all-round improvement in education quality. But the Education for All initiative was overshadowed by the millennium development goals and their emphasis on universal primary education. As the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation said in a recent report : The focus on universal primary enrolment meant less attention to other crucial areas, such as education quality, early childhood care and education, and adult literacy.
What steps will the sustainable development goals take to address the original education targets shortcomings?
The new education goal promises to be far more comprehensive than its predecessor. Goal four proposes that , by 2030, all girls and boys [should] complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education, a formula that  in succinctly covering many existing problem areas  suggests lessons have been learned. There is a clear anxiety to touch all the relevant bases, with targets devoted to preparing children adequately for primary school, university and professional life. Schools must be sensitive to the needs of both sexes, with provision made for disabled children and a greater emphasis on safety and quality. Percentage targets for literacy, numeracy, life skills and  crucially  teacher training will be set when the sustainable development agenda is formally adopted in September .

2. The greatest regional improvement was in sub-Saharan Africa, where the primary school enrolment rate increased by 18% between 2000 and 2012.
3. Tanzania has achieved near-universal primary education by abolishing school fees , and tackling the issues that had kept children out of school. The countrys holistic approach has included implementing a gender sensitive curriculum, introducing a specific education plan for the countrys nomadic population and providing water facilities to communities where girls previously had to stay at home and spend hours collecting water. Schools for disabled children have also been introduced, along with initiatives to help reduce early pregnancies, which often take girls out of school.
Northern Africa had almost achieved universal primary education by 2012, with enrolment rates at 99%
4. Northern Africa*, which had enrolment rates of 80% in 1990, had almost achieved universal primary education by 2012, with enrolment rates at 99%. Eastern Asia, south-east Asia, the Caucasus and central Asia*, and Latin America and the Caribbean have also all achieved close to universal primary education.
5. Sierra Leone has reversed some of the damage done by the countrys long civil war, in which more than 10,000 children were conscripted into the army . Since the end of the conflict in 2002, the number of children who have never been to school has halved. The country has also uncovered many  ghost-teachers , teachers who have died or left the school but continue to exist on paper, allowing schools to embezzle salaries worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. It now faces the challenge of re-establishing schools closed due to the Ebola outbreak.
6. By 2012, all developing regions had achieved, or were close to achieving, gender parity in primary education enrolment.
7. In Afghanistan, 3.75 million girls were enrolled in school in 2014, compared with just 191,000 in 2002. Overall, school enrolment in Afghanistan has increased from 1 million to 8.2 million, and more than 165,000 new teachers have been trained.
8. The adult literacy rate increased globally from 76% in 1990 to 84% in 2010. The global youth literacy rate grew from 83% to 89% over the same period.
9. By 2012, the number of out-of-school children worldwide had fallen to 58 million, from 100 million in 2000.
10. In Bangladesh, second chance schools provided primary education to more than 790,000 out-of-school children between 2004 and 2012. More than half the students, who came from the 90 countrys poorest sub-districts , were girls.
11. In India, the percentage of primary school-age children out of education had fallen to just 1% by 2011, from 14% in 2000, and 22% in 1990.
12. According to the World Bank, the global primary school completion rate increased from 81% in 2000, to 92% in 2012 .
Globally 92% of children completed primary school in 2012, compared with 81% in 2000
13. In the Caucasus and central Asia, eastern Asia and northern Africa, nine out of 10 pupils who started primary school completed the last grade.
14. The decrease in dropout rates has been reflected in more children continuing to lower-secondary education: the lower secondary enrolment rate had increased from 71% in 1999 to 85% in 2012 . In Afghanistan, China, Ecuador, Mali and Morocco, lower secondary enrolment has increased by at least 25 percentage points.
15. Quality of education has also improved in many countries. By 2015, the number of teachers per pupil had increased in about 83% of countries with data, though significant challenges remain.

Across the world, 58 million children still dont have access to schools, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Millions more fail to graduate, or fail to learn what they need toparticipate in society meaningfully.
Capitalising on the inability of governments to cope with rising demands on public learning, private education providers are mushrooming. I see this not as progress, but as an indictment of governments that have failed to meet their obligation to provide universal, free and high-quality education for all.
Education is not a privilege of the rich and well-to-do; it is the inalienable right of every child. The state must discharge its responsibility as guarantor and regulator of education as a fundamental human entitlement and as a public cause. The provision of basic education, free of cost, is not only a core obligation of states but also a moral imperative.
Privatisation cripples the notion of education as a universal human right and  by aggravating marginalisation and exclusion  runs counter to the fundamental principles of human rights law. It creates social inequity.
Education is not a privilege of the rich and well-to-do; it is the inalienable right of every child
The admission policy in private schools is based on the ability to pay, and on the socio-economic background of parents. As a result, private schools lack the diversified system of learning and cultural plurality that is so necessary today. They promote market economy values rather than the humanist mission of education.
Disturbingly, some in the international community are pushing for greater privatisation in education. The World Bank, a longstanding supporter of the approach, has recently been joined by other international bodies. At the end of 2014, the African Development Bank, the UN Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union commission, and the UN Development Programme released a report promoting increased private sector involvement in education. The study concluded that Africa must build a vibrant private sector that supports the development of a dynamic primary education system. This call has been echoed by some government officials in Africa and elsewhere.
In the 1980s and 90s, when developing countries first made significant cuts to their public health and education spending under structural adjustment , international financial institutions, along with the largest donors, promoted user fees and increased private sector service delivery. The World Banks current policy of encouraging and supporting profit-seeking multinationals that provide education is a matter of serious concern, given the devastating impact this strategy has on the right to education.
As a recent Oxfam briefing paper has suggested, governments should not allow low-fee private schools, and should restore education as an essential public service. As private education becomes big business, learning must be protected from the forces of privatisation.
According to a study on private education by the UKs Department for International Development (DfID), a potentially very large number of low-fee private schools, which target poorer families in developing countries, are unregistered. These schools save costs by hiring ill-trained teachers and running large classes in substandard school buildings. Such edu-businesses, as they have come to be known, are an unsatisfactory replacement for the good public education governments should be providing.
Huge commercial publicity often tempts parents to opt for private schools in the expectation that their children will receive a better education. They believe that private schools are more efficient, and that competition improves outcomes.
However, such beliefs are rarely supported by evidence. The DfID study, for instance, suggests private schools do no better than state ones.

The cost of privatising education lies not just with school fees but also with the damage done to the public good. Fees, however small, hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest. Sometimes, this means the oldest son receives an education while daughters stay at home. Inequalities in society grow when the poorest are excluded.
In the worst cases, corruption undermines the system. Headteachers may require special payments to accept students, and teachers may charge for private tutelage. We must constantly remind states of their obligation under human rights law to establish conditions and standards for private education providers, and of the need to maintain a transparent and effective system to monitor these standards, with sanctions for abusive practices.
Parents, community, teachersand students must be encouraged to speak out against the commercialisation of education, acting as vigilant observers and reporters of abusive practices. Governments must empower human rights institutions, watchdogs and other mechanisms to investigate alleged violations of the right to education.
Im not saying traditional public schools are the only solution. Community schools, locally organised and run with state support, can meaningfully complement government efforts to provide education and are an alternative to privatisation.

Governments must face the education challenge head on. Investment in education must be prioritised, using at least 4% of GDP, and reform priorities should be established with assistance from civil society and international donors, development banks and the UN.
Leaving these challenges to the private sector may seem easier. But when we ask what kind of world we want, we do not say one for those who have, and another for those who dont. Lets not create education systems that promote inequality  there is enough of that already. The international development agenda must aim to eliminate private schools, not champion them.

        <title>Rana Plaza: Two years after the tragedy, why has so little changed?</title>

The scale of the disaster at the Rana Plaza garment factory two years ago in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka created an expectation that there would be industry-wide change, but this has not materialised.
In reality, little has changed since the tragedy occurred in April 2013. Brands and factory owners are making huge profits, the Bangladesh government is ensuring employment, albeit of poor quality, is provided to its most marginalised people, and consumers can buy extremely cheap clothes.
It also means that in Europe the brands can keep prices low at a time of wage deflation and austerity.
Related: How long must Rana Plaza workers wait for justice? | Sam Maher
The only group that suffers is the workforce, made up largely of young women whose voices are barely heard. They are patronised and stereotyped as hapless and weak, and are expected to be thankful for work that is characterised by some NGOs as empowering, rather than exploitative.
So the real question is, why do so many expect change? Why are we asked to emphasise the good when the bad is the overwhelming experience of the workers we meet?
There is an unquestioned belief in Europe that the process of industrialisation is inherently good and that, over time, change will happen organically. This is based on a false reading of history that excludes the context in which change really took place in the industrialised west.
Industrialised societies didnt simply evolve into social democracies where citizens had the right to expect things from their government and their employers. Safe working conditions, the elimination of child labour, the five-day week, the provision of education, healthcare and social security did not simply evolve as a result of industrialisation. They were fought for bravely over generations by workers.
The assumptions underlying the belief that Bangladesh is just at an earlier stage of development (leaving aside the strongly colonial and racist undertones of the suggestion that Bangladesh is not as civilised as Europe) are wrong. Bangladesh is not a reminder of our past but a vision of our future.
When our governments promote neoliberal, free market capitalism as the only game in town, they are aiming for a reorganisation of society exactly like that being delivered in Bangladesh. This envisages an almost non-existent state whose role is largely limited to providing the security forces required to subdue a dissatisfied population. It also anticipates a total lack of any barriers to the rapid accumulation of profit  no taxes, no trade unions, no red tape of regulation. For the rich in Bangladesh  and the garment industry has created a host of rich families  it is possible to buy top quality services, including education and healthcare, and if you cant find it at home you can join the rest of the global elite and simply shop abroad.
Workers are faced with the myth of free choice: if you dont like your job you can always starve. Or try your luck as an informal worker, migrate as a domestic worker (often working in slave-like conditions), or beg on the streets. If you are no longer healthy enough to cope with the long hours, malnutrition and stress resulting from your working conditions, or if you get injured, pregnant or want to have a family life, you are on your own.
We need to demand more than minor adjustments to a global system that is driving us all towards greater precarity
Any safety net that does exist is provided by a big society of NGOs whose reach and influence is huge. But they are only accountable to their funders, never to the people they serve. And they provide a strong ideological framework where the poor have to prove they are genuinely worthy.
So, when asked to see what has changed since Rana Plaza, we need to demand more than minor adjustments to a global system that is driving us all towards greater precarity and an increasingly reduced voice in society.
We need to recognise that change isnt just about one sector in one country. If we want to see real change, we need to start demanding it  not just in Bangladesh but at home, by organising and fighting for a different vision of society where all the citizens of every country have the right to live in dignity.

Rise of progressive policies signals Democrats' embrace of Bernie Sanders' ideals
As Hillary Clinton begins to focus on income inequality and policing reforms, the cautiously optimistic political left wonders: Do we go big?

Nothing highlights Washingtons sceptical view of the political left like the arrival of Bernie Sanders into the presidential race.
The independent senator from Vermont is typically dismissed as a  self-described socialist  by those who doubt Americas appetite for policies seen as mainstream in much of the world but long-regarded as almost unmentionable in the land of the free.
But while even his biggest fans dont necessarily expect to see the 73-year-old maverick waltzing into the Oval Office anytime soon, his decision to challenge Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic nomination coincides with rising optimism that their focus on income inequality and campaign finance reform is catching the national mood.
Related: Hillary Clinton: America must confront 'hard truths about race and justice'
There is a reason why its called economic populism: its because its popular, says Charles Chamberlain of Democracy of America, whose 1 million activists support both Sanders and the more reluctant Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren , whom they are also encouraging to run.
Its a real stretch to say [Sanders] is out of the mainstream; he is very much ahead of the curve when it comes to a lot of politicians in Washington, argues Chamberlain. It is Washington DC that is out of touch with where the average American is really at.
For this reason, many progressive activists rankle at the description of their members and favoured candidates as leftwing.
I dont call ourselves left and part of the reason is the centre of the country agrees with us, claims Adam Green, co-founder of Progressive Change Campaign Committee.
He argues that the surprise decision of Clinton to champion many of the same themes as Warren and Sanders shows such views are now mainstream among Democrats , and the only question is how forcefully Clinton will follow through with policy.
Related: Elizabeth Warren on Hillary Clinton's embrace of her populist message: 'Eh'
The shift in direction of the Democratic party is now coming to a close with the victory of the Warren wing, claims Green. It is now about a scale  do we go big or settle for smaller changes?
It is certainly true that Clintons apparent conversion from avowed centrist to critic of the economic elites has caught many by surprise.
Back in December people on her campaign staff were saying she was going to run against gridlock, for bipartisan solutions  and thats certainly not whats happened. Since she has launched, its all about the middle-class and making the economy work for everyone and a system thats rigged, says Chamberlain. We believe that the issue of income equality is going to be the dominant fight of the 2016 election  and we are seeing that.
It also coincided with a shift among leading Senate Democrats, such as Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer, who many had long regarded as irredeemably part of the Washington establishment.
A few weeks ago only seven senators were openly fighting for enhancing the social security safety net, and many favoured instead the conservative entitlement reforms sought by Republicans and briefly endorsed last year by the White House too. Now 42 out of the 44 Senate Democrats are preparing to vote to expand social security .
Similarly, Senator Schumer, of New York, is supporting legislation seeking to eliminate student debt at public universities  a key aim of progressive activists that may yet be adopted by Clinton .
But more radical activists on the left caution that there is a limit to how far mainstream Democrats will join Sanders in espousing truly transformational policies, such as a constitutional amendment to strip corporations of political power sought by groups such as Move to Amend .
The politicians who are taking their money and therefore their marching orders from the Super Pacs and the billionaire class and Wall Street are not going to champion the kind of change that Move to Amend is demanding, says its spokesman, the former Green party presidential candidate David Cobb.

Bernie Sanders announces his 2016 presidential run.
We are moving the needle in that we are forcing some of the most dominant political players to say the things that they have not been saying, but I have no illusions that they are going to champion the systemic transformational change that a real democracy movement would require.
Optimism on the left is also tempered by memories of even greater exuberance before Barack Obama was elected.
Thats what you saw in 2008, acknowledges Chamberlain. People wanted bold change, and in some ways we got it and in other ways people were disappointed.
For groups hoping to mobilise the much-vaunted but often elusive grassroots, lasting change requires more than just one person or a party hierarchy to change its rhetoric.
This mistake that is often made is the idea of the great person theory  or to look at party apparatus, instead the question is: is there a mass movement in this country that is cohering? says Cobb.
Take the growing resistance to the schools-to-prison pipeline, take the justifiable anger at rising inequality  and you begin to see the recipe for that movement, he adds. What we are beginning to see between [the anti-police violence movement] Black Lives Matter, between the [immigration] Dream defenders, Move to Amend  you see all these early stages of a movement that is beginning to speak the same basic language.
The bigger hope for activists like Cobb is that such a movement may also transcend left-right boundaries and appeal to disillusioned Republicans too. But for now, many would settle for a world where Bernie Sanders was not the only Washington politician prepared to self-identify as leftwing.

Saudi Arabias real-life game of thrones has taken a dramatic turn with the surprise designation of Mohammed bin Nayef, its formidable interior minister and counter-terrorism chief, as the crown prince and heir to the kingdom.
Despite hopes of a new beginning following King Salmans accession in January, this latest shakeup, announced on Wednesday, is as much about retrenchment as reform as Riyadhs royals confront potentially existential challenges .
The promotion of the kings son, Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, 35, to the position of deputy crown prince  or second-in-line to the throne  looks in part like a reward for his recent work as defence minister overseeing the Saudi-led coalitions controversial military campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Both Mohammed and Bin Nayef, the kings nephew, are grandsons of the kingdoms founder monarch, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.
The replacement of the veteran foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, 75, by a younger non-royal, Adel al-Jubeir, who is currently the Saudi ambassador to the US and a long-time Washington insider, strengthens the sense of generational change. By dismissing his half-brother and Abdulazizs youngest son, Prince Muqrin, 69, as crown prince, Salman has performed the equivalent, in British terms, of defenestrating Prince Charles and installing Prince William as the Prince of Wales.
At the age of 79, King Salman may not expect his reign to be lengthy  which is one reason for imposing his will and establishing a clear, undisputed succession early on. The changes mark the first time that power has passed beyond the control the numerous sons of Abdulaziz, who died in 1953. However, as when he launched a less extensive reshuffle in January , Salmans royal decree stressed continuity on the basis of service to faith, the nation and the people. This was a sop to Saudi Arabias powerful religious establishment, the self-appointed guardians of the status quo and the Sunni Muslim tradition.
55-year-old Bin Nayefs elevation is likely to be welcomed in conservative and establishment circles at home and abroad. Well regarded internationally as a pragmatic, professional politician, he is seen by the US administration and other western governments as a reliable ally. Bin Nayef will continue as the interior minister in charge of Saudi Arabias 200,000-strong security forces. Not coincidentally, Salman announced on Wednesday a one-month salary bonus for all military and police personnel .
Yet bin Nayef, who survived a 2009 assassination attempt by al-Qaida, is no reformer. His primary focus is security  internal and external  and most recently the challenges posed by the rise of Islamic State and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. While he will now become deputy prime minister by virtue of being the crown prince, there is little in his record to suggest new thinking on the human and civil rights failings, including womens rights and capital punishment, that continue to besmirch the countrys reputation.
Less noticed among Wednesdays announcements was the sacking of Nora al-Fayez, Saudi Arabias first female minister and the most senior woman in government, whose attempt to shift the boundaries of womens education attracted the hostility of religious conservatives.
Prince Mohammed, who continues as the defence minister, is more of an unknown quantity. Saudi Arabias unusual display of energy and leadership in assembling a military coalition to fight in Yemen may reflect his influence. On the other hand, the bombing campaign has yet to achieve its objectives and has been widely criticised for inflaming regional tensions and causing many avoidable civilian deaths .
The civil war in Yemen is but one of the worrying challenges facing Riyadhs princes. It reflects a wider rivalry with Iran that has drawn in Gulf neighbours such as Bahrain and is being played out in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Rightly or wrongly, Iranian leaders feel they have gained the upper hand in recent months.
Irans president, Hassan Rouhani, this month described the Saudi leadership as mentally and emotionally unbalanced and deplored its actions in Yemen. He said : Unfortunately we are witnessing the intervention of some irresponsible countries in other countries, that is not only illegal according to international law but it is not compatible with Islamic law ... Destroying the infrastructure of an impoverished country and killing children, women and men makes no sense.
Bin Nayef and the monarchy face a range of other problems, extending from tense relations with the Obama administration over Syria and its attempted rapprochement with Tehran, to plunging oil revenues and the thwarted aspirations of younger Saudis, in a country where 60% of the population is 21 or younger. Blocking private Saudi financial and other support for Sunni extremists such as Isis is another unfinished task for Bin Nayef.
Even more troubling for Riyadhs real-life answer to Lord Tywin Lannister is the apparent return of terrorism to Saudi soil after Bin Nayef rooted out al-Qaida a decade or so ago. The royal decree coincided with the news that 93 jihadists linked to Isis have been arrested this year and that there have been several insurrectionary plots across the kingdom.

France's poisoned legacy in the Central African Republic
Latest mission to the former colony in 2013 was to protect people displaced by sectarian conflict  now French troops are accused of engaging in child abuse

It was named Operation Sangaris , after a butterfly with a tiny lifespan native to central Africa. France hoped that its peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic (CAR) would be similarly short-lived.
The situation in the Central African Republic has become alarming, and even terrifying, the French president, Franois Hollande, said in December 2013, ordering the deployment of 1,200 troops to reinforce the 400 already stationed there. This operation will be short.
Now the French troops sent to protect the tens of thousands displaced by the cycle of violence stand accused of exploiting the lawlessness engulfing CAR to engage in brutality themselves.
Some say France, with its long imperial history in Africa, is still motivated by guilt after its failure to halt the 1994 Rwandan genocide. More recently, it has launched successful armed interventions in former colonies including Ivory Coast and Mali. Its continued political, economic and military presence meant it was better placed than any other major power to intervene in the CAR, one of the most failed and forgotten states on the continent.
The poisoned legacy of French colonialism in the CAR has been half a century that saw five coups, a self-declared emperor whose lavish coronation was inspired by Napoleon, and barely functional infrastructure and institutions. Its natural wealth of gold, diamonds, timber and uranium has attracted warlords such as the cult-leader-like Joseph Kony.

The latest debacle was triggered in March 2013 when president Franois Boziz, mired in corruption, fled by helicopter after being ousted by an unwieldy coalition of rebels, bandits and guns for hire known as the Slka. One of its leaders, Michel Djotodia, declared himself president , becoming the first Muslim to rule the majority-Christian nation of 4.6 million people.
Mdecins sans Frontires described it as a crisis on top of a crisis, which only deepened a few months later when Djotodia tried to disband and disarm the Slka. The rebels span further out of control, killing, looting and burning villages. Predominantly Muslim, they were joined by mercenaries from neighbouring Chad and the dreaded Janjaweed from Sudans Darfur region.
In retaliation, some Christians took up arms in vigilante militias known as anti-balaka  meaning anti-machete  and launched counterattacks against the Slka and perceived Muslim collaborators. They perpetrated atrocities of their own, giving the Slka a pretext for yet more aggression. The cycle of violence swept up thousands of child soldiers.
For all its troubles, the CAR had not previously suffered sectarian conflict and the world was slow to respond as the death toll ran into thousands. Warning that the CAR stood on the verge of genocide , France ordered the deployment of 1,200 additional soldiers, following a call for help from the interim government and a UN security council resolution. They joined 3,500 soldiers from a central African support mission.
At the start of 2014, a quarter of the countrys entire population was internally displaced. International pressure forced Djotodia to step down, and soon the Slka were retreating north, where they continued to target Christians. But as the anti-balaka made inroads elsewhere, villages emptied of their Muslim populations, with homes looted and mosques torched. In the capital, Bangui, the Muslim population dropped from up to 145,000 to just 900 .

Amnesty International called it ethnic cleansing and warned of a Muslim exodus of historic proportions. Many Muslims were left feeling resentful towards French peacekeepers and the new president, Catherine Samba-Panza , a Christian who studied in France and has two of her three children living there.
By September, the number of French soldiers had risen to 2,000  still insufficient to cover remote villages often inaccessible by road in a territory bigger than France itself. They remained answerable to the French defence minister and distinct from the central African contingent, which evolved into an African Union (AU) force and then an expanded UN peacekeeping mission .
Human Rights Watch issued a warning that said : Horrendous killings in southwestern Central African Republic indicate that the French and AU peacekeeping deployment is not protecting remote villages from deadly attacks.
The number of French soldiers has dipped slightly and elections are due later this year, but violence between the Slka and the anti-balaka continues. Even though it no longer makes the headlines, the Central African Republic is still deep in the quagmire, with little sign of progress or even hope, The Daily Maverick website noted earlier this month .
David Smith, a director of Okapi Consulting and CAR analyst, said: French forces have come and gone in the CAR over 50 years. There have been very few periods in that geographical space when they have not been there.
Asked if they had made a positive difference this time, Smith replied: Absolutely, because no one was in charge in the CAR when they deployed. If the French forces had not secured the airport and the route to the border with Cameroon then the situation would not have been stabilised, food supplies and medicine would not have reached Bangui and a lot more people would have died. The African force at the time was not able to do it.
Is it enough? No. The country is one and half times the size of France and there are areas with no roads. There are deaths going unreported and vast parts of the country where no one knows whats going on. Whats really needed in the CAR is a functioning national army but I dont think the international community has the appetite, time or resources to stay long enough to make it work.

        <title>Bali Nine: our Mercy Campaign prepared for everything except the worst possible day</title>

I suppose we all knew this was going to happen, but we had hoped and dreamed that it wouldnt. The dread  to quote Paul Keatings former speechwriter  was in the marrow, and many times before those of us in the Mercy Campaign to save Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran had thought the deaths were only 72 hours away.
There was the first notice  Myuran got his on 7 January. We supporters texted each other in disbelief.
Wasnt this new guy Joko Widodo, this cool new president, meant to do away with the death penalty? Wasnt he meant to be for human rights?
The tension and the nervousness mounted all through January. The executions started, a snap first batch one Sunday night , with Widodo vowing that more were to come. In early January Tony Abbott said although he disagreed with capital punishment, our relationship with Indonesia must be preserved.
But we took some small measure of comfort in the small things  that one of Widodos favourite metal bands, grindcore veterans Napalm Death, were opposed to executions, that Dutch diplomats were being withdrawn and Jakarta must be starting to hurt.
My Mercy Campaign co-founder Matt and I were hanging off Widodos words and trying to decode their meaning, trying to become experts on Indonesia on the run. There was one thing that seemed to matter more than anything: he said Andrew and Myuran would be executed together  and yet in those days at the start of January Andrew hadnt received his notice.
We clung to that like a talisman. Andrew hadnt received his notice and that meant the guys would be safe, that they were protected, that Joko had an out and could still save face. Myuran may have the hangmans noose around his neck, but all was good as long as Andrew was OK.
The magical thinking kept us going as we met  in Hobart, Sydney, Melbourne  hatching ideas on the back of restaurant menus, but telling ourselves they were only contingency plans, that the worst wouldnt happen, that the night I was preparing for wouldnt come to pass.
It was 22 January and I was in Melbourne. An ABC reporter called. Did I know Andrews clemency application had been formally refused? I left my office in Collins Street and found a bar frequented by businessmen. I thought I would cry  but I didnt. Instead I just sat very still, for an hour or more, feeling very scared.
The magical thinking ended then  but the hope didnt.
A sentence of death concentrates the mind wonderfully, Samuel Johnson said.
Things moved fast from there, mostly through the courts. There were appeals, vigils and speeches in parliament. We also saw a political shift. Abbott wasnt hedging about Indonesia now. He was using the language of mercy and forgiveness. Politicians started talking about their own personal lives and how they had been affected by drugs. There were tears in parliament.
Time took on a new, warped dimension as the case lurched around in a nauseating way.
Appeals were lodged then rejected. More appeals were lodged. The term last ditch became beautifully elastic.
Throughout February and part of March, planning became impossible in this environment. We could set aside five days to make a video in Bahasa, then suddenly the timeline would change. Things that usually take people months now took a day or hours.
You ask people to do impossible things in short times  but it happens. The artist Ben Quilty staged a concert in support of the pair with three days notice. The Sydney producer Nick Bolton put on a play about the case with less than a week for rehearsal. Matt and I held press conferences and collected signatures: 250,000 people signed our petition. The server broke from the weight of traffic but people we didnt know before stepped in and helped.
Things happened. All these things happened. But there was one thing we didnt want to do. We didnt want to organise the final vigil. We didnt want to move with the speed and the horror and the urgency of the notice period. We would talk about it  what we might do if the worst happened  then stopped and talked about other things. It was superstition and also something else: a dread so large because the thing it attached itself to was too dark and unimaginable.
But yesterday I went to a vigil in Sydney, one I organised. The council provided the tarpaulin for the candles, the local police gave their permission and someone from a union has lent us a PA system. Everyone I spoke to about these small acts of organisation has been careful and kind, and some crossed the breach and wanted to talk about the executions in a way that suggested less interest, more anguish.
They tried to make it imaginable  the Indonesian industrial death complex  they made it all too real with their fighter planes and tanks and ghoulish selfies, and their construction of coffins and crucifixes and their rules and odd insistence that the condemned be psychologically fit for execution.
They did all this. Yet it is still barely imaginable.

        <title>Bali Nine executions fallout: Australia juggles domestic fury and national interest</title>

Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop have used strong diplomatic retaliation, withdrawing Australias ambassador to Indonesia, but rhetorical restraint to express their anger at the cruel and unnecessary executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.
The unsuccessful political and diplomatic effort to appeal to new Indonesian president Joko Widodo has been intense, increasingly desperate, often creative but always couched in careful language of respect for Indonesias sovereignty as hope remained that the president might grant clemency.
On Tuesday Abbott and Bishop began to show their dismay at the ghastly episode and what Australian officials see as Indonesias dismissive attitude to their pleas, and the insensitive and heavy-handed treatment of the condemned men and their families. But they refused to personalise their anger with public comments about how Widodo had handled the matter.

They are now trying to balance the outpouring of domestic anger and the necessary strong diplomatic response with the long-term national interest of Australias relationship with Indonesia .
Asked about the treatment by the Indonesian government of the men and, by extension, Australia, the prime minister said: This is a very bad time. Its a very bad time. Obviously for the Chan and Sukumaran families and its a difficult time for this relationship.
I dont want to personalise it but obviously I do regret that while my representations have been listened to patiently and courteously, they have not been heeded.
Abbott said he understood the anger felt by many Australians over the death sentence, but underscored the importance of Australias relationship with Indonesia.
I would say to people yes, you are absolutely entitled to be angry, but weve got to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse.
Australia has never before withdrawn an ambassador in response to the death sentence being carried out on a citizen. Abbott did not say how long the ambassador, Paul Grigson, would remain in Australia. He said ministerial visits to Indonesia would remain suspended for an unspecified period.
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek , said in a statement that as a close friend and neighbour of Indonesia, Australia is deeply hurt that our pleas for mercy were ignored.
It was completely unacceptable for Indonesia to proceed as it did when critical legal processes were yet to run their course, raising serious questions about Indonesias commitment to the rule of law, they said.
Most Indonesia observers believe the government did all it could to try to save the mens lives.
With a few exceptions, the government has handled it well, said Gregory Fealy, associate professor in Indonesian politics at the Bell School of Asia-Pacific Affairs at the Australian National University. It has made an enormous effort, in fact it is hard to think of any other diplomatic effort to parallel this effort.
Anyone with an office who might be able to make the case has been used so you cant fault the government for the extent of its campaign.
Fealy said a range of people with cultural, business and defence connections with the Indonesian political elite had been enlisted to advocate on top of all the normal diplomatic efforts from cabinet ministers, including the prime minister.
Andrew MacIntyre, deputy vice chancellor of RMIT university said no stone has been left unturned ... they used official channels and unofficial ones ... personal informal relationships with senior people in the administration, business relationships, religious connections.
The one exception was Abbotts remark when he urged Indonesia to reciprocate for Australian aid by sparing the lives of Chan and Sukumaran.
At the time, Indonesia said it would not respond to threats and rebuked the prime minister, saying such threats were not part of diplomatic language.
Fealy said the incident was a glaring example of the backlash that can occur as a result of a few frustrated remarks.
One or two frustrating remarks can produce an entirely counterproductive response. But it was just one element. Given the cumulative public disapproval on this subject, it is tempting for politicians to give voice to that. It is a delicate position for politicians who want to reflect the public mind. But I dont think anything has been left unturned, he said.
The stonily dismissive response from Indonesia  including Widodos refusal to take phone calls from Abbott since early March and senior officials not responding, or responding slowly, to calls or letters  was a sign of the very big shift in the bilateral relationship since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, said professor Tim Lindsey, the director of the centre of Indonesian Law, Islam and Society at the University of Melbourne.
The fact that Indonesia for a long time refused to even acknowledge that there was a double standard in their insistence that Australia was infringing their sovereignty by appealing for clemency, while at the same time appealing for clemency for its own citizens facing the death penalty in other countries, that has been really quite damaging from Australias point of view, he said.
There were ups and downs during the SBY years but this is a very big shift, and it is a shift that has had a big impact in Australia.
The Department of Foreign Affairs registered a formal complaint about the excessive security surrounding the transfer of the men to Nusa Kambangan and the happy snaps of senior commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo with the men as they flew to the execution island  but that diplomatic language did not begin to express the extent of Canberras fury, which built as the undignified treatment continued in the days leading up the executions.
But despite all the restraint, and all the pleas, nothing would sway Widodo  who is plummeting in the polls, desperate to be seen by his own domestic audience as strong in the face of foreign pressure and himself under pressure from party chairman Megawati Soekarnoputri.
Now the task for the government is to manage the public and political reaction. Attention will return to the role of the Australian federal police (AFP) in alerting Indonesian police before the arrests of the Bali Nine in 2005.
Bishop said the government was satisfied with steps that had been taken after a formal review of the AFPs actions.
Grassroots movements to boycott Indonesian tourist spots and products are growing.
A former senior diplomat to Indonesia, John McCarthy, said the Abbott government had no choice but to react with uncompromising displeasure. Writing before the announcement that Australia was withdrawing its ambassador, he predicted the executions would affect Australians perceptions of Widodo for the rest of his tenure, but warned against such a step.
Indonesia dismissed our representations and we have no choice but to react with uncompromising displeasure. We should withhold bilateral visits by ministers while the foreshadowed executions continue or for the rest of the year, McCarthy wrote for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute .
We cannot have high-level business as usual.
We should not compromise our own interests to the extent of jeopardising the web of civilian and military exchanges that are at the heart of the relationship, or cut our aid program  intended to improve the lives of ordinary Indonesians. We should keep our ambassador in Jakarta. Communication matters.
Fealy said criticism of Indonesia should stick to legalities and flaws in the judicial process.
We could see a really strongly critical statement from Abbott government, which points to serious flaws in judicial process and the failure of the Indonesian government and the president to properly consider the clemency cases, Fealy said.
He warned a decision to withdraw the ambassador could harm Australias longer term goals.
Related: Bali Nine: decade of turmoil for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran nears a gruesome end
Bilateral issues could be impacted as a result so the government would need to weigh up what the consequences would be for Australia. We have already seen the impact of Tony Abbott attempting to use aid and that backfired. If your objective is to take the death penalty off the books, arousing Indonesian hostility is not the way to go.
Chan and Sukumaran were arrested on 17 April 2005 by Indonesian police with seven others attempting to smuggle heroin out of Bali. Four months later, the AFP confirmed they had tipped off the Indonesians after the father of one of the drug couriers, Scott Rush, shared his fears of his sons involvement . Early in 2006, Chan and Sukumaran  as the convicted ringleaders  were sentenced to death. The remaining seven were sentenced to life imprisonment.

        <title>Indonesia murdered eight people. The time for being polite is over</title>

Everyone was so polite. Not because they are naturally well-mannered, but because of a pragmatic judgment that to be respectful to Indonesia as a sovereign nation, respectful towards its judicial system, respectful to its political leaders, was the best way  the only way  to save two Australians from being taken out in the middle of the night and shot dead.
Now that has happened and we can stop being polite. During the 72-hour notice period given to the condemned men, Peter Morrissey, one of the lawyers for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, said the whole approach has been to try to be polite, try to engage. If we try arm-twisting [the Indonesian government] we lose. Pressure will result in death.
The Australian government performed the same dance. Apart from a cringeworthy moment from Tony Abbott when he asked Indonesia to reciprocate for Australias generosity after the 2004 tsunami by sparing the men, public pronouncements have been restrained. Not deferential, exactly, but careful to avoid criticism for fear it would be counterproductive.
There was never a guarantee that pleas for mercy would work, of course, and they didnt. Just after midnight, Sukumaran, 34, and Chan, 31, were gunned down by firing squad on the prison island of Nusa Kambangan. Six other people were also shot in this batch, as its known, including five more foreign citizens.
Related: Who are the eight people executed by Indonesia?
There was the 50-year-old Nigerian man convicted of possessing just 50g of heroin. And the 42-year-old Brazilian man diagnosed as suffering schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These were couriers, not kingpins. Dirt-poor Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Velosa, who has always insisted she was duped into carrying drugs, was spared at the last minute because the alleged recruiter gave herself up. If she hadnt, an innocent woman might have been put to death.
The lives of our citizens are no more worthy than others, but when its close to home you see the full horror of it. Watch the pro bono lawyers frenzied attempts to pursue every legal option. Imagine the terror of human beings told the exact time of their death and asked if they wish to stand or sit, be blindfolded or look their executioners in the eye. Witness families go through such agony you know you should look away.
How can anyone respond to this? About 250,000 people signed a petition to president Joko Widodo asking him to spare Chan and Sukumarans lives. It wasnt much, but it was something. There were some who insisted that the pair had got what they deserved, but thousands attended rallies in support of the men, just 21 and 24 when they helped organise an attempt to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. On Tuesday night, candlelight vigils were held across the country.
Some have lashed out, urging Australians to boycott Bali to protest the killing. It might be an emotional response, even a bit naff given our reputation of yobbo behaviour in Bali . But its also a sign of impotence, of a sense that nothing could be done to stop the pointless death of two men who by every account  including that of the former head of the prison where they were held  were completely reformed.
Sukumaran furiously painted his haunting self-portraits until the last. Chan married his girlfriend the day before he died , and asked to attend church. In jail, he had studied theology and become a pastor. Sukumaran had almost finished a fine arts degree.
Now we can say what these deaths were  the torture and murder of human beings by a neighbouring state. We do not need to spare feelings for fear of being seen as arrogant westerners or hold back because Australia is so far from perfect  witness our treatment of asylum seekers, witness the outrage of phone tapping the former Indonesian presidents wife.
Nothing excuses what Indonesia has done. This was about domestic politics and president Widodos determination to be tough in the face of foreign pressure.
There was a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia for four years. In 2013 it was lifted because of a drugs emergency. Widodo announced late last year he would reject the clemency bids of all 64 drug dealers on death row before he had even seen them.
If we told the truth, we would say that Indonesian attorney general HM Prasetyo has seemed to relish his role. It was repulsive for him to announce that the date of the execution would be put back so it wouldnt clash with an Asian African conference because it doesnt look good when we have guests to shoot them [the prisoners], as if would look just fine some other time.
Prasetyo scoffed at legal appeals and predicted they would fail before they were heard. He saw nothing morally questionable in his argument that even if Chan and Sukumaran won their constitutional court case challenging the presidents clemency deliberations  a case set down for 12 May  it wouldnt have mattered because it wouldnt be retrospective. I hear theyre going to challenge to the constitutional court. Go ahead! he mocked. Several of those executed had legal appeals still under way, which Prasetyo dismissed as buying time.
At the last minute, there were corruption allegations so serious that to execute someone without investigating them is a moral crime, if not a legal one. Indonesia is trying to clean up its judicial system, but corruption persists, and an attempted bribe in a death penalty case is not unthinkable.
In February, Muhammad Rifan, the former lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, made a complaint to Indonesias judicial commission which oversees investigations into judicial corruption. He told Fairfax Media that nothing happened after his complaint  the commission had not even interviewed him.
This week, he revealed the details of his allegations . He said he had several meetings with the judges during the trial, and that they had asked for more than A$130,000 to bring down a sentence of less than 20 years. Such meetings are illegal but normal in Indonesia, said Rifan.
He says the deal collapsed after the judges told him that senior legal and government members  the attorney generals office and the supreme court  had ordered them to impose the death penalty. A lawyer for another condemned man, Nigerian Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise, has also claimed a judge offered a prison sentence rather than death if a bribe was paid.
There is no more serious allegation than this, yet Indonesias response was astonishingly complacent. Why has the investigation into these allegations been so slow? What happens if it is found that the claims are true and the men were already dead? It didnt worry Prasetyo. Why in the last seconds has this just been conveyed? he asked.
So now, what do we do? There will be angry words and unspeakable grief. Yet something about the aftermath of death penalty cases is as predictable as their lead-up. Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop has said there would be consequences for these deaths, and no one criticises her tireless attempts to save these mens lives.
Australias ambassador was recalled instantly on Wednesday morning, and there has been talk of cancelling meetings and postponing military cooperation. Brazil and the Netherlands also recalled their ambassadors after the first batch of foreign drug offenders were executed in January, but they returned after a few weeks.
The government is dismayed that its respectful pleas for clemency, or at least that legal appeals be exhausted before the executions were carried out, were rebuffed with such contempt.
Indonesia may not have realised the executions would cause such international condemnation and scrutiny of their legal system. The mood in Australia is mostly horror and the governments response is likely to be strong. It is too late for those killed, but perhaps this will be a turning point in Indonesia, too.
Yet pragmatists know how things work. Australias relationship with Indonesia  its economic and strategic relationship  is too important to be damaged by this. Lets remember that a good relationship with Indonesia is very important to this country and whatever might happen in the next few days the relationship with Indonesia must endure, Abbott said recently. After a few days, we are likely to be urged to keep this into perspective.
Philip Flood, former ambassador to Indonesia, said the suggestion that people boycott Bali was a silly idea, all that will do is penalise those Australians looking forward to an attractive holiday in Bali.
The truth is, he said, we have very, very few options, other than, you know the strongest possible protests.
Yet the only power ordinary people have is consumer power, their choice about where to spend their money. Yes, the United States, China, Saudi Arabia and others have the death penalty too, despite no evidence that it deters crime. Yet this case, the details of it, the cruelty of it, has been crushing to watch.
Lex Lasry, a Victorian supreme court judge, represented Australian Van Tuong Nguyen before he was executed for drug trafficking in Singapore in 2005. He has campaigned against the death penalty since and visited Chan and Sukumaran in jail. Lasry tweeted last month: I will never again go to Bali or anywhere in Indonesia. I am without adequate words for the hideous event that is about to occur.
For what its worth, as pointless as it may be, I wont go back to Indonesia either until it abolishes the death penalty. Maybe its a silly idea, and real politic will take over soon enough. But as Lasry says, this was state-sanctioned murder. For this, Indonesia and its leaders deserve no respect and theres no polite way to say it.

In the buildup to the Paris climate conference towards the end of this year, Canada has promised to announce post-2020 emissions targets by early June. Meanwhile the countrys provinces and territories  with the exception of Alberta  have formed a common front to exert pressure on the federal government.
Three-quarters of all Canadians live in provinces where carbon emissions will be taxed
At a meeting in Quebec City in April, Quebecs premier Philippe Couillard said that, with the Paris conference, 2015 would be a pivotal year, but to make it a success capitals all over the world, and federal states and regions, must start work now. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change , acknowledged their role, announcing at the Quebec gathering that the Paris conference would hold a special one-day meeting for subnational bodies. It was, she said, important to encourage a range of efforts and approaches by governments to end use of fossil fuels.
Ontario stole the show the day before the Quebec meeting when the driving force behind the Canadian economy signed up to a carbon trading market set up by California as part of the Western Climate Initiative . Quebec joined the scheme last year. Now that Ontario has joined the cap-and-trade scheme, three-quarters of all Canadians live in provinces where carbon emissions will be taxed.
The aim of the Quebec summit was above all to display a joint determination to move forward on making the Canadian economy more carbon sober and increase cooperation on combating climate change.
In this respect the gathering was a success, but only partly so. The absence of Alberta premier Jim Prentice cast a shadow on this show of provincial unity. Alberta is hostile to the carbon market and was Canadas largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 (ahead of Ontario, according to federal government figures ).
Furthermore, the provinces do not all agree on climate strategy. To the east of Alberta, Saskatchewan is also standing up for its oil industry. Premier Brad Wall pointed out at the Quebec meeting that Canada accounts for under 2% of global emissions. Moreover his province is working to reduce them, having invested $1.3bn in a carbon capture system, on the Boulder Dam coal-fired power plant, which traps 90% of the associated emissions.
Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne countered: Yes, we are a small country in terms of our population and absolute emissions, but we are heavy emitters per capita.
However the first ministers attending the summit did agree on one point: they were all critical of the federal government. At the closing press conference, Couillard said: We call upon the federal government right now to start working with us, first technically, then with the ministers, in order to work together in establishing our targets for Paris and the way were going to present our situation, our plans in the future.
Relations between the two echelons of government are clearly tense, each blaming the other for delays setting targets for after 2020.
The priority of the federal government is economic growth, which depends on capitalising on Canada's oil reserves
Singled out on account of its poor performance on emissions abatement, after it withdrew from the Kyoto protocol in 2011, Canada will be hard put to achieve the modest target it subsequently set: a 17% reduction by 2020 on 2005 emissions.
Highlighting the carbon-pricing schemes that four provinces (British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Alberta) were introducing, Couillard nevertheless asserted that the provinces taking part were all determined to move forward. He also cited the carbon taxes and countless green initiatives, all of which were constructive.
In April federal environment minister Leona Aglukkaq urged provincial governments to report on measures to cut emissions after 2020, so that targets could be set at a national level. But Couillard said this would not work: Theres no way it can be done in isolation. One order of government cannot ask the other to do the job. It has to be done together.
The position of the prime minister, Stephen Harper, and the federal government is well known. The overall priority is economic growth, which depends on capitalising on Canadas substantial oil reserves, including tar sands . Couillard condemned this stance at the summit, claiming that combating climate change could kickstart the economy, whereas doing nothing would ultimately prove very costly.
Figueres endorsed this view, citing a recent study by the International Energy Agency , which shows that over the past five years the global economy has expanded by 3%, whereas greenhouse gas emissions have steadied.
 This article was amended on 29 April 2015. An earlier version mistakenly stated that new emissions targets being lined up for Paris climate conference will be for the period up to 2020. The new emissions targets will be set for beyond 2020.

US government says drilling causes earthquakes  what took them so long?
US Geological Survey backpedals on previous research on wastewater fracking-induced earthquakes that have shaken eight states in last seven years

As the US Geological Survey confirmed on Thursday , in the last seven years, geologically staid parts of the US have seen earthquakes like they havent seen for millions of years. And they were triggered by drilling for oil and gas.
Related: Oil and gas drilling triggers man-made earthquakes in eight states, USGS finds
The drilling  or rather, the process of injecting water deep underground  has been triggering earthquakes in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas.
The most obvious question is: what took you so long, USGS? Over those seven years, other scientists have speculated about whether this rise in earthquakes has anything to do with the injection wells used by the fracking industry to dispose of the water used in the process.
For the most part, the report does not pin the blame on fracking itself  pumping large volumes of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations in order to free oil or gas  but rather on the associated process of injecting wastewater deep underground using injection wells.
The rise of fracking after 2005s Energy Policy Act slightly preceded and coincided with the rise in earthquakes.
Oklahoma averaged a handful of earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater from 1975 to 2008.
Then, in 2009, it had 20 .
In 2011, the number of earthquakes in the state rose to over 60, and Oklahoma was hit by its largest earthquake in recorded history  magnitude 5.7. Immediately after the quake Katie Keranan , an assistant professor of geophysics at the University of Oklahoma, partnered with scientists from the USGS and Columbia Universitys Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory to install two dozen seismometers in Prague.
Prague, Oklahoma
Within a year, Keranan had data that indicated that the pressure from injecting water deep beneath the earth had snapped three fault planes, one after the other .
Not long after, in 2012, an injection well was linked to quakes in Youngstown , Ohio. The states governor issued an executive order requiring operators to conduct seismic studies before the state would issue well permits.
In that same year, David J Hayes, deputy secretary of the US Department of the Interior, wrote a public letter stating that USGS research showed that there were no conclusive examples that wastewater injection triggered major earthquakes, even when it happened near a known fault.
The USGS report published on Thursday does provide such examples.
Not every well triggers an earthquake. In fact, a relatively small number of wells seem to have caused the majority of earthquakes, according to a report led by Keranan, which found that out of the thousands of disposal wells in the central US, just four them induced 20% of the seismicity from 2008 to 2013 in the central US.
In September of 2013, the Society of Petroleum Engineers held an unprecedented meeting on injection-induced seismicity, though they did not invite the press or the public. The number of earthquakes in Oklahoma reached 103 in 2013.
In November of last year, the USGS and the Oklahoma Geological Survey co-hosted a workshop that included about 150 participants from academia, industry and government  the result of that meeting is the report that was released this week. That year, 2014, the number of earthquakes in Oklahoma reached 585 in one year.
Compared to earlier statements, the USGS report is a sharp turnaround from its previous stance. But its still a relatively mild document  one that advises more research, rather than specific actions. The work of clarifying connections between injection wells and earthquakes has been left to people such as Keranan, who left Oklahoma shortly after the Oklahoma Geological Survey published a rejection of a study she had placed in geology, which linked the quakes to nearby disposal wells.

Are UK failures in Libya to blame for Mediterranean migrant crisis?
The collapse of the post-Gaddafi Libyan state is a key reason for the current crisis, but the UK is not the only guilty party

It is hard to argue with Ed Milibands statement that the international community failed to plan adequately for the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011: the collapse of the Libyan state is a key reason for the current migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.
The Labour leader was not challenging the justification for the Nato-led intervention, authorised by the UN on humanitarian grounds and pushed by David Cameron and the then French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Essentially Miliband is saying that more should have been done after Gaddafis fall.
Related: Cameron hits back after Labour suggests he is responsible for migrant deaths
British and other western diplomats involved in Libya insist they tried to help but were often rebuffed by the rebel national transitional council and the governments that followed it. Capacity-building for the central bank and the prime ministers office had little success. But most damaging was the failure to build a national army and police force to absorb and replace the plethora of revolutionary brigades in control on the ground.
Officials do admit to an overoptimistic reading of Libya as a small, wealthy and homogenous country and to underestimating how far its political culture had been hollowed out by 42 years of Gaddafis whacky but repressive dictatorship. Tribal and regional loyalties still counted hugely. Yes, there was misjudgment on our side about how capable the new Libyan authorities were to maintain security and build a functioning state, said one.
Yet the rebels were adamant that they wanted to manage their revolution without foreign troops on the ground  and the west was anxious to keep its intervention as light as possible, sticking to training, development assistance and election preparations. Each sides reluctance reinforced the prospects for failure. And Barack Obama famously led from behind , leaving the Europeans to deal with the crisis in their own backyard.
When the Brits, EU or the Americans put in advisers they found no one to engage with, the official said. There was no counterpart in the Libyan police or ministry of interior who could implement or act on advice. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have insisted the Libyans focus on security right at the start and not just rely on euphoria and goodwill straight after the revolution. The Libyans had a plan and were confident and we were supportive. After Iraq there was no appetite for running another country.
Elaborate plans went nowhere. Stung by criticism that Nato had walked away from Libya, Cameron used the G8 summit at Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, in 2013 to announce that the UK, US, Italy and Turkey were to train a 15,000-strong Libyan force. The UK role ended when Libyans being trained in Cambridgeshire were sent home after facing criminal charges and convictions for sex offences .
Last summers takeover of Tripoli by an Islamist led-coalition  presaging the chaotic collapse of the state and the emergence of rival but equally ineffective governments  was between militias that hadnt disbanded and the army that hadnt been created, said one senior diplomat. Others suggest the failure of the west  and Britain  was in not pushing the Libyans harder to accept and implement what they were being offered.
The balanced judgment then, is that the UK is partly to blame but that it is far from alone, and the Libyans failed dismally too.
Camerons heart was in the right place but he didnt want to be seen to be meddling because Tony Blair was always accused of George Bush-style meddling, said Jason Pack, president of Libya-Analysis.com . He was like Obama. He wanted to be seen as a humanitarian intervener and not a strategic intervener, or a forced nation builder. But he has taken a back seat even though Libya is a legacy issue.

China has rejected a North Korean attempt to join its new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), according to a recent report , a decision which could have a significant effect on Pyongyang.
Masahiro Kawai, a professor of public policy at the University of Tokyo told Emerging Markets that North Korea had failed to disclose sufficient information relating to industry, public finances, and its tax base.
But the North Koreans were not willing to provide that information, Kawai said. Later, a Chinese ministry of foreign affairs spokesman claimed not to have any knowledge of such a rejection .
Though much still lies in the way of mutual collaboration, joining the bank would probably be North Koreas best chance to sort out its infrastructure problems  from transportation to electricity.
As a multilateral development bank, the AIIB demands high levels of fiscal transparency  a requirement which would force Pyongyang to share information about its economy with the outside world. But the regime has not released economic data since the 1960s, for fear it could be used by its enemies.
North Korea has not released economic data since the 1960s, for fear it could be used by its enemies
At Choson Exchange, an organisation that runs training programmes for North Korean business people, it has become apparent that Kim Jong-uns narrative leans heavily towards economic improvement.
The regime has introduced several new policies, from allowing more state-owned enterprises to be run autonomously to a slew of new Special Economic Zones , that suggest this focus is not just rhetorical.
These reforms have raised expectations among North Koreans, as have the numbers of companies and people tasked with attracting foreign investment and trading partners.
However, the countrys weak infrastructure remains a key impediment to attracting investment.
Electricity supply is probably the biggest bottleneck. Sanctions can be complied with or avoided, transaction costs can be planned for, but if you cant run a mine or a factory for lack of electricity, you cant invest.
Shortages are expected to be exacerbated by a drought severely limiting the countrys hydroelectric output .
North Korean officials tend to think of private investment as a solution to these problems, but often offer little information on how the investor might recoup their money: asking for capital to build roads with no tolls, for example, feels like a donation rather than an investment.
If you cant run a mine or a factory for lack of electricity, you cant invest
For a cash-strapped developing economy such as North Koreas, the best hope for its many infrastructure problems would be a regional development bank to support regional integration and long term growth.
The two major banks that could help are not feasible  unless the issue of North Koreas nuclear weapons programme is resolved. Washingtons preponderant role in the World Bank and Tokyos strong influence in the Asian Development Bank make their respective cooperation with North Korea difficult to envisage.
The Chinese-controlled bank is a more likely prospect, and its conceivable that the bar Pyongyang would have to reach in slowing its nuclear activities would be much lower: a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities, rather than a dismantling of its weapons cache, perhaps. In other words, the investment bank is likely to work with Pyongyang long before the other two.
If the bank continues to signal that the DPRK is welcome to participate as long as it abides by the banks standards, North Korean policymakers will be better equipped to argue for a more open approach to the economy. After all, some in Pyongyang understand that not being able to provide outsiders with basic statistics on the countrys economy is detrimental to its economic plans for the future.
The new bank will thus come to feature heavily in the list of factors Pyongyang must weigh up as it crafts economic and foreign policy.

Could Australia's 'stop the boats' policy solve Europe's migrant crisis?
Australias tough stance on asylum-seeker vessels is touted as the solution to the deaths of hundreds of migrants crossing the Mediterranean. But does it work?

When the bodies of asylum seekers en route to Australia washed up on the shores of Christmas Island in 2010 everyone was in agreement that something needed to be done.
Five years later Australia has implemented one of the harshest border policies in the world. It is characterised by three core points: turning or towing back boats of asylum seekers at sea; forcing asylum seekers to live in detention centres across the Pacific in Nauru and Papua New Guinea; and guaranteeing they will never be resettled in Australia.
Related: Europes worsening migrant crisis  the Guardian briefing
Prime minister Tony Abbott is now making a clarion call to Europe, where crisis meetings have taken place following the deaths of over 800 migrants in the Mediterranean this week. The only way to stop deaths at sea, he told reporters this week, is in fact, to stop the boats.
The public debate around immigration in Australia is by no means the same as it is in Europe . But it provides a useful roadmap for how outrage at deaths at sea, and fears of irregular migration, can turn the question from why are people fleeing? to how can we stop the boats?.
The road to asylum in Australia: No resettlement, no boats
Australias immigration debate began at a similar point to the current crisis facing Europe. Five years ago, boats were coming, mostly from Indonesia  a transit country to where asylum seekers travelled from as far away as Iraq or Afghanistan in an attempt to enter Australia  and more were coming than had ever come before.
Harrowing deaths at sea were also growing more frequent, as they are now growing in the Mediterranean, although the numbers of arrivals to Australia have never reached the levels attempting to come to Europe. Immigration detention centres inside Australia were full, and riots and serious self-harm incidents had taken place.
The previous Labor government was panicked. It was taking heavy hits from Australias conservative party, the Liberals, over what was seen as a failure to secure Australias borders. Then prime minister Julia Gillard formed an expert panel in 2012 to address how Australia should respond.
The panel recommended the creation of a vast regional framework to manage asylum seeker and migration flows in a comprehensive review of Australias policy.
It suggested the creation of an incentivised scheme in which asylum seekers would have a clear and structured path to get to Australia from regional hubs such as Malaysia, and suggested an increase in Australias overall humanitarian intake and more lenient family visa access.
But in order to achieve the desired outcome the panel saw that deterrents needed to be in place to manage the flow of asylum-seeker vessels. It recommended the reopening of the Manus Island and Nauru detention centres. It also endorsed  in some circumstances when strict conditions were met  the practice of turning back asylum-seeker boats.
Although the panel may have been well intentioned, it was mostly the deterrent parts of the report that were implemented. The government reopened Manus Island and Nauru, which were fraught with problems. The idea of a truly regional solution, with a real process for asylum seekers to enter Australia without making the hazardous journey, fell largely to pieces with an ill-fated deal with Malaysia to turn the country into a regional settlement hub.
When Abbotts government took power in September 2013 it pushed the tactics of deterrence even further  in fact, this was a central platform on which it sought to be elected. No asylum seeker who arrived by boat could ever be resettled in Australia. They would be taken straight to Manus Island and Nauru, where a series of reports have found serious health and safety issues. It turned back asylum-seeker boats at sea to Indonesia, and even purchased orange lifeboats to ferry back asylum seekers when their own boats were too damaged.
In this 2014 video, the Australian government said it was implementing the toughest border protection measures ever to combat maritime people smuggling.
The CEO of the Refugee Council of Australia, Paul Power, has described it as a policy that is actually all about forcing people back in the direction that theyve come.
He added: The Australian policy at no point has taken account of the need for protection of people who are attempting to come to Australia by boat. Thats never been a serious part of the discussion from politicians in Australia.
But the policy did largely stem the flow of asylum-seeker vessels to Australia. Since the government came to power, only 16 boats have made the journey to Australia. Only one has been successful. No deaths have been reported.
However, information about asylum-seeker vessel movements is considered a matter of national security.
Could Europe stop the boats?
Australias approach to immigration has now drawn inevitable comparisons with the current problems faced in the Mediterranean. Nigel Farage, the leader of Britains right-wing Ukip party, has warned of waves of millions of people coming from north Africa to Europe.
But there are many differences that make comparisons exceedingly difficult. Australias migration stream of vessels were also mostly from Indonesia, which is generally seen as a transit country via which asylum seekers from Iran, Afghanistan, Syria and other countries travel en route to Australia.
The flow across the Mediterranean from Africa  and in particular Libya, which has become a hub for people-smuggling ventures  are in some circumstances from asylum seekers directly fleeing persecution.
Paul Barrett, a former secretary of Australias defence department, said turning back asylum-seeker vessels to Libya was far different from turning them back to Indonesia.
One immediate difference is that when we turn back boats to Indonesia, objectionable as that policy is, we know the Indonesians arent going to shoot them when they come back, he said.
If theyve fled Iraq or Afghanistan theyve got no rights in Indonesia, so they need to move on to a country where they can retain the benefit of the Refugee convention.
When we turn back boats to Indonesia, objectionable as that is, we know the Indonesians arent going to shoot them.
Paul Barrett
Whereas if you turn around boats that are fleeing from Libya and send them straight back to Libya youre injecting them straight back into the danger where theyve fled.
But above all, the notion that Australia has in fact stopped the boats is seen as illusory by many working in Australias refugee sector. This is because, according to Power, it hasnt stopped the boats; it has merely displaced the flow to other nations.
What Australia has done is just displace the issue away from the shores of Australia, by promoting an attitude of deterrence and harsh responses. They have almost without doubt made the situation worse for people who have tried to find safety in Europe, he said.
If you look at the countries of origin of people who are on the seas in the Mediterranean, they do include people from Afghanistan and Iraq who are the groups of people we saw attempting to reach safety in Australia.
Regional solutions to a global issue
Mary Anne Kenny, associate professor of law at Murdoch University, said any solution to the kind of migration flows currently occurring needed to involve the whole region.
If were looking at regional ways at dealing with a problem then you could look at trying to set up some sort of way to deal with the issues in north and west Africa in a regional way.
She says that across Europe  as in Australia  it has become more and more difficult to migrate or seek asylum from countries like Syria through regular means, which forces people to look to irregular migration, such as arriving by boat.
Youve got to look at the root cause of why people are moving, and then offer them safe ways of passage through some form of regional processing.
A core question, though, is how can we provide people with the ability to apply for visas lawfully, and being able to do that lawfully without people having to wait in places for 10 years.
The comparisons to Australias immigration policies will no doubt continue as the numbers of boats  and the death toll  rises in Europe. But the question, as Power sees it, should not be one about stopping the boats, as it was made in Australia. Its a broader conversation about why people will risk the dangerous journey in the first place.
The answers lie in understanding why people are moving on, and trying to come up with better responses to meet the overwhelming needs they face, he said.

By supporting Saudi Arabias operation against the Houthi, a Yemeni Shiite rebel group backed by Iran, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani risks dragging his troubled country into a Sunni-Shiite proxy war. If Afghanistan fails to strike a balance between its relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran, it runs the risk of polarizing its people and getting caught in the crosshairs of a regional power struggle. But if Kabul plays its cards right, Afghanistans historically ambivalent role in opposing spheres of influence could also be used to maintain balance of power in the region.
While Afghanistans relations with the Saudis have been better than ever under Ghanis leadership, the Afghan leaders 19-20 April trip to Tehran indicated that Kabul is also seeking to balance its relations with its western neighbour. During this weeks trip, Ghani and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, announced increased cooperation in trade, technology and culture. The two leaders also agreed to share intelligence on terrorism and drug trafficking.
As a former chessboard in the 19th-century Great Game between the British and Russian empires, the struggle to strike a balance between rival powers is not new for Afghanistan. The country was also caught between the United States and Russia during the Cold War, and more recently between Pakistan and India. To an extent, it has also borne the effects of Iran-US rivalry.
But as it struggles to emerge from its own decades of war, the Riyadh-Tehran matchup could prove devastating for Afghanistan. Even if the current proxy war in Yemen remains within that countrys borders, the same sectarian tensions could erupt in Afghanistan , where both Saudi Arabia and Iran wield significant influence over opposing groups of tribal and religious leaders.
Kabul-Riyadh ties
Saudi Arabia has a positive image in the minds of many Afghans, who see the country as the holy land that houses the two major Muslim sacred sites in Mecca and Medina. The Saudis also helped Afghan mujahideen in the fight against Soviet troops. Saudi Arabia was also one of the three nations to formally recognize the Taliban regime before it was toppled in 2001.
The influence that Riyadh wields over active anti-government groups including the Taliban, Hezbi Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the Haqqani network - as well as other former mujahideen factions that are now part of the Kabul government - makes the kingdom instrumental to any peace deal that could be struck with insurgent groups.
President Ghani has placed a great deal of hope in his administrations relations with Saudi Arabia. Ghani has travelled to the Muslim holy land twice since becoming president last September and publicly asked the Saudi monarch to use his influence with Pakistan to kick-start peace talks between Kabul, Islamabad and the insurgent groups.
Kabuls tacit approval of Operation Decisive Storm on 1 April, which came less than a week after warplanes from Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies began striking against the Houthis in Yemen, should not come as a surprise. In return for backing Saudi Arabias military intervention in Yemen , Ghani hopes to see reciprocal support by the kingdom in ongoing peace efforts with the Taliban.
Irans influence
Like Saudi Arabia, Iran has used the decades of turmoil in Afghanistan to make inroads among local political and military leaders. The country wields considerable influence among Shiites , which make up around 20% of the Afghan population. Landlocked Afghanistan also shares a 900 kilometre-long border with Iran, key for trade and access to trans-boundary water sources. Most importantly, Tehran could use its influence over the 3 million Afghan refugees living in Iran to put pressure on Kabul, or even destabilize the country by expelling the migrants.
Despite the presence of tens of thousands of US and other NATO troops in Afghanistan, Kabul-Tehran relations have been at a historic high in the past 13 years. The office for former President Hamid Karzai was notorious for regularly receiving bags of cash or ghost money from both the CIA and Tehran. At one point during Karzais tenure, Kabul was even seen as a potential arbiter between Washington and Tehran.
Part of Irans tolerance of Afghanistans dual-track diplomacy stems from Tehrans recognition of regional realities. An unstable Afghanistan could be used by Irans enemies to create insecurity both along its borders and inside its territories. For Tehran, drug trafficking and the Islamic States expansion into central Asia are issues that can only be addressed through cross-border collaboration with Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia could also use elements inside Afghanistan to take the war to Iran , the same way the Houthi rebels have warned to carry out attacks inside the kingdom.
Washingtons wild card
Many commentators warned that Riyadh might pressure Kabul to send a small contingent of troops once the expected ground offensive by the Arab coalition begins, a scenario that could thrust Afghanistan into a new kind of armed conflict within the country and in the region.
Any kind of surge in violence within Afghanistan, supported by regional countries, could jeopardize the situation for thousands of US forces stationed in the country. The US, which provides intelligence and logistics support in the current Saudi-led coalitions airstrikes in Yemen, has enough clout over Riyadh to dissuade it from involving Afghanistan in any military alliances.
As the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran escalates and pressures Muslim countries to take sides, it is imperative that Afghanistan maintains its reinvigorated relations with Saudi Arabia and, at the same time, preserves its strategic ties with Iran. Walking that tightrope will prove challenging for the new Kabul leadership, but it may be the only peaceful way to prevent Afghanistans over-engagement in this new Great Game.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modis state visit to France  his first to a European country  has put the seal on normalised relations between the two countries. Before his election in May 2014 the French diplomatic service had shunned Modi because of his alleged part in clashes between Hindus and Muslims that claimed about 2,000 lives in 2002 , when he was chief minister of Gujarat state.
Modi arrived in France earlier this month, before travelling to Germany, joining Chancellor Angela Merkel for the opening of the Hanover trade fair. His programme in Paris started with a military parade at Les Invalides . Frances change of tack has partly been dictated by the priorities of trade diplomacy, in particular the sale of 36 Rafale fighters and the supply of six EPR nuclear reactors built by Areva.
Modi must remember that, when India carried out a series of underground nuclear tests in 1998, France vetoed sanctions by the UN security council and endorsed Indias application to join the select Nuclear Suppliers Group, which monitors exports of such goods and services to prevent proliferation.
Maritime cooperation in the Indian ocean could open new vistas for the partnership between the two countries
After Les Invalides, President Franois Hollande took his guest for a cruise along the Seine to establish closer ties. Though this was obviously a good opportunity to show off their newfound friendship to the media, the two leaders had plenty of other topics to discuss.
As the Indian premier pointed out in a message posted in March on Facebook, France is Indias most important partner in space. There are huge opportunities for collaboration in the manufacturing and infrastructure with France, including in the railways sector, he added.
Modi went to Toulouse, in south-western France, to visit the headquarters of the French Space Agency (Cnes) and to celebrate cooperation between the two nations, which has already yielded the Megha-Tropiques satellite for studying the water cycle and energy exchange in the tropical atmosphere.
He went on to neighbouring Airbus , which has several plants in India. There his concern was to promote the Make in India programme, designed to attract foreign investment in industry. Maritime cooperation in the Indian ocean could open new vistas for the partnership between the two countries, says Rakesh Sood, Indias former ambassador to France.
With India keen to reassert itself in an ocean threatened by Chinese expansion, it could benefit from closer cooperation with France, which operates naval bases at Djibouti and on Runion, using data collected by their radar stations. Modi ended his stay in France at Neuve Chapelle, west of Lille, with a tribute to the 9,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives during the first world war.
In just over 48 hours the Indian premier touched on the past, present and future of his countrys relations with France. It is just a pity that this trip should come so late, but for Modi the priority was to establish closer links with neighbours in south-east Asia, where the overall climate seems particularly unstable, and Asia-Pacific, the global economys new centre of gravity. So he has visited Australia, Japan, Singapore and the US. In the meantime he has updated Indias Look East Policy, originally hatched in the late 1990s, rebranding it as Act East , to emphasise the importance of the region. India is determined to bring its growth into line with that of Asia as a whole, but to do so it needs European technology and investments.
Despite initial plans for an India-EU summit, Modis European tour did not include Brussels. Delhi explained that time was short, but it seems that the authorities in the Indian capital were irritated by the EUs lack of enthusiasm. This was yet another missed opportunity for two giants which tend to ignore one another, despite having so much to share. The EU is Indias leading trading partner, yet talks on a bilateral free trade and investment agreement are still in deadlock.

Lack of EU contact with Tripoli a barrier to tackling migrant deaths
Since Libyan capitals takeover by Islamist-dominated coalition last summer, western states have had no communication with those on the ground

The result is that neither the EU nor individual European governments  Italy, the UK or any other  are allowed to cooperate or liaise with the bodies that are notionally dealing with the influx of migrants transiting Libya on their way to Europe , or with the people traffickers held responsible for so many deaths.
The EU, US and others recognise only the Libyan government, which is based in the eastern cities of Tobruk and al-Bayda. But most people-smuggling and coastguard patrols take place in the west of the country, towards the Tunisian border in areas controlled by the Islamist-dominated Libya Dawn coalition.
We have nothing to do with the government in Tripoli, and the government in al-Bayda can do nothing about this issue, one senior western diplomat told the Guardian. Even if you said there was a phone number of someone I could ring in Tripoli to sort things out we wouldnt do it because we dont recognise them. We certainly wouldnt offer help. No one is dealing with the government in Tripoli, even behind the scenes.
Nearly all foreign embassies withdrew their staff from Tripoli last summer when the capital was taken over by the Libya Dawn coalition . Most are now based temporarily in Tunis or Malta. The recognised government, part of the so-called Dignity camp, insists that the takeover of Tripoli was an illegal coup detat.

In the past, EU bodies worked with local authorities in Misrata, Zawiya and Zuwara and other areas on or near the coast, but now have no presence on the ground. Between 2011 and 2014 42.7m (30.8m) was committed for assistance to people in need of international protection/stranded migrants, countering illegal/irregular migration and migration management.
The Libyan authorities decided in April 2014 to establish a migration committee, which could serve as the interlocutor for dialogue with the international community, but all possibilities for that disappeared with the outbreak of violence the following June.
As there is no control over Libyas borders, nor a functioning police force, it should be assumed that migration flows will only increase, a report by the European Union external action service predicted last October.
The EU and US both support UN-led efforts to broker a ceasefire and create a broad national unity government. But consensus and compromise have been in short supply in a country where tribes and local interests matter hugely and national institutions are weak or non-existent  the legacy of 42 years of personalised dictatorship under Muammar Gaddafi. Talks in Morocco are very close to a final agreement, the UN envoy, Bernardino Leon said on Sunday.
The same barriers to cooperation over migrants and people-trafficking exist over the issue of terrorism in a country that is ruled by armed militias and where the jihadis of Islamic State are now playing an increasingly high-profile role.
Weve got to sort out the politics, the diplomat said. We are not going to be able to tackle drugs or migration or weapons smuggling until there is a Libyan government that we can at least work with.
It is taking a long time. Everyone is frustrated and success is not guaranteed. When [a new government] comes to power it wont be able to turn the migrants tap off. But you could at least start joint projects like working with the coastguard.

        <title>Mediterranean refugee crisis: EU reduced to impotent handwringing</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-no-european-migration-policy</Link>

A wonder of modern engineering, Europes longest road and rail bridge connects Scandinavia to mainland European transport networks by linking the Swedish city of Malm with the Danish capital, Copenhagen, across the resund Strait.
The five-mile bridge has brought Sweden and Denmark closer together. But when it comes to dealing with newcomers, the two neighbours could not be further apart.
While the Danes practise the most restrictive immigration policies in the EU, the Swedes have the most open, liberal asylum and refugee regime in the union. It is difficult for foreign-born spouses of Danes to get residence rights in Denmark. But Sweden last year fielded more than 80,000 asylum applications, more than twice as many as Britain in a country six times smaller than the UK in population terms.
When it comes to immigration, Swedish and Danish policies are chalk and cheese. It highlights how, in the middle of a Mediterranean migration crisis that is seeing hundreds of thousands surrender their life savings to trafficking networks and risk their lives to reach Europes shores , there is no such thing as an EU or European immigration policy.
As the tragedies in the waters between Libya and Italy multiply weekly, newspapers, pundits, MPs, NGOs and charities are clamouring to know what Europe is doing. The desperation and the suffering, so evident on television and online, are fuelling fresh Brussels-bashing as unelected, self-satisfied eurocrats are said to be feckless, impotent and cynical in their lack of response.

In fact, the institutions of Brussels have minimal authority over immigration in Europe. It is Britain not Brussels that decides how many uprooted Syrians it will take in. It is Berlin and the German regional authorities that rule on whether asylum be granted or deportations ordered. This is why the interior ministers from 28 governments meeting on Monday in Luxembourg could agree or disagree on what to do about Lampedusa and why the European commission or parliament could only issue rather sad and empty words. In a demonstration of handwringing impotence, the commission in Brussels hit a new low on Sunday when it said it was chagrined at the fishing trawler capsizing on Saturday night, which may have left more than 900 dead.
European immigration policy is a mess, a patchwork of 28 hugely varying national systems constrained by national politics, shaped by culture and history. The big British and French ethnic minorities stem from the hangovers of empire. German multiculturalism derives from the foreign labour force, mainly Turkish, brought in to power the economic miracle of the 1960s. The newer EU countries of eastern Europe were, until a generation ago, closed societies behind the iron curtain with no experience of mass migration except the flight of their native populations from Russian occupation. They have continued to export their own people to western Europe since the first joined the EU in 2004.
Estonia had 155 asylum applications last year, according to EU figures. Germany had more than 200,000, almost a third of the asylum claims lodged in the EU (626,000 and nearly 200,000 up on the year before).
Between them, seven countries  or one-quarter of the EU  fielded more than three-quarters of asylum applications. Most fail. But although 425,000 claims were denied in 2013, less than 40% of those failures resulted in deportation.
There have been innumerable proposals over the past decade from Brussels for more common and coordinated policies, ranging from blue card schemes modelled on the US green card to making it easier for migrants to enter the EU legally.
Related: Europes worsening migrant crisis  the Guardian briefing
But an EU-wide scheme is a no-go area for all national governments except those who might benefit from it, since it would entail a system of quotas and distributing refugees and asylum-seekers more equitably between EU countries.
Incumbent governments of the mainstream centre-left or -right are scared of this because immigration is one of the most toxic and incendiary topics in the national politics of so many countries.
The UK prime minister, David Cameron, is wary of Ukip on the issue and is fighting the rest of the EU over freedom of movement within Europe. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has an eye on the large recent anti-immigrant street protests against the Islamification of the west in her country.
When the former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, sought to blunt the appeal of the anti-immigrant National Front of Marine Le Pen, he did so by sounding tough on immigration. The current socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, tried the same trick when he was interior minister.
On Sunday, in Finlands general election, the anti-immigrant populists called the (True) Finns party reached second place and a claim on coalition government. The Danish hard line over the past 15 years has been due to the influence on coalition politics of the nationalist, anti-immigrant Danish Peoples party. Similar dynamics are at play in Austria, The Netherlands, Greece, Italy and Hungary.
In Brussels, too, the fear factor applies. When the Lampedusa tragedy left more than 300 dead off the Italian coast in October 2013, European immigration policy was put on to the agenda for an EU summit. Herman Van Rompuy, organising and chairing the summit, then had it removed until June last year. Why? Because national leaders were worried it would boost the fortunes of anti-immigrant parties in the European parliament elections in May last year.
Next Thursday in Milan, leaders of the European Peoples party, the Christian democratic caucus that is the biggest in the European parliament, is to grapple with the issue.
Their  inconclusive  draft policy paper, obtained by the Guardian, talks of introducing quotas for distributing migrants across the 28 countries according to a countrys size and its wealth or depending on whether a certain threshold of refugee influx in a country has been exceeded.
An intra-EU relocation scheme has to be elaborated, the document says.
Next month, the European commission will unveil a European migration agenda blueprint tabling similar proposals.
Governments are likely to balk at such notions, as they always have. But the situation in the Mediterranean is spiralling out of control. A summer of Europes shame headlines looms. The politicians may be losing control as events dictate political outcomes.

        <title>South Africa's xenophobic attacks: are migrants really stealing jobs?</title>

With every outbreak of xenophobic violence in South Africa , the refrain is the same: The kwerekwere are stealing our jobs.
Shops are torched. Streets are barricaded. Tyres are set alight. People are stabbed, shot and burned to death. Mobs hound Somalis, Mozambicans, Zimbabweans, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis from their homes and businesses.

The claim that foreigners are taking jobs from South Africans is an argument that is always made, says Professor Loren Landau, director of the African Centre for Migration and Society (ACMS) at Wits University: As if it justifies killing.
In the recent spate of violence, foreigners have, yet again, been forced to flee for safety. At least five people have died, shops have been looted and destroyed and the rainbow nation is facing a backlash from across the continent.
But how many migrants actually work in South Africa? And how do they contribute to the economy? Africa Check look at the numbers behind the anti-foreigner rhetoric.

Government rhetoric fuelling tension
Statements by government ministers and ruling figures have done little to calm tensions.
This month the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini was accused of hate speech following remarks he made against foreigners that they must pack up and leave the country.

In the weeks preceding a spate of violence in February, Nomvula Mokonyane, the Minister of Water and Sanitation, commented on Facebook that in Kagiso, Gauteng province [a]lmost every second outlet (spaza) or even former general dealer shops are run by people of Somali or Pakistan origin (sic) I am not xenophobic fellow comrades and friends but this is a recipe for disaster.
Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu has also said that [f]oreigners need to understand that they are here as a courtesy and our priority is to the people of this country first and foremost They cannot barricade themselves in and not share their practices with local business owners.
A disconnect between perception and reality
The idea that people are here stealing jobs and that they dont have a right to be here needs to be corrected, says Dr Zaheera Jinnah, an anthropologist and researcher at the ACMS.
Myths and misconceptions travel quickly. But new datapresents a far more nuanced picture of what it means to be a migrant from Africa or Asia and trying to make a living in South Africa.
The Migrating for Work Research Consortium (MiWORC), an organisation that examines migration and its impact on the South African labour market, released two studies last year .
They found that 82% of the working population aged between 15 and 64 were non-migrants, 14% were domestic migrants who had moved between provinces in the past five years and just 4% could be classed as international migrants.
With an official working population of 33,017,579 people, this means that around 1.2 million of them were international migrants.
A racial breakdown of the statistics reveals that 79% of international migrants were African, 17% were white and around three percent were Indian or Asian.
Jinnah said that there were misconceptions about the size of the international migrant community in South Africa: There is a disconnect between perception and reality largely because there hasnt been data available until now.
A lot of what has been said and reproduced is based on hearsay and anecdotal evidence or myths. he adds.
The research consortium also found that Gauteng province, which contains Johannesburg, had the highest proportion of foreign-born workers, with around 8% of the working population having been born in another country.
Limpopo and Mpumalanga had the next highest proportion of international migrants at 4%, followed by North West (3%), the Western Cape (3%), Free State (2%), Northern Cape (1%), Eastern Cape (1%) and KwaZulu-Natal (1%).

Low unemployment rates
According to the MiWORC data , international migrants in South Africa have much lower unemployment rates than others. This is unusual. In most other countries, international migrants tend to have higher unemployment rates than locals.
South Africas unemployment data shows that 26.16% of non-migrants are unemployed and 32.51% of domestic migrants are unemployed.
By comparison, only 14.68% of international migrants are unemployed.
But while international migrants are less likely to be unemployed, most find themselves in positions of unstable,  precarious employment , unable to access benefits or formal work contracts.
International migrants in South Africa are more likely to take jobs that locals are not willing to do, or find work in the informal sector.
According to the MiWORC research, 32.65% of international migrants are employed in the informal sector in South Africa compared to 16.57% of non-migrants and 17.97% of domestic migrants.
The studies suggest this is because the informal sector offers the lowest entry cost into the labour market. The majority of international migrants also come from African countries which have large informal sectors.
Migrants play positive role in South Africas economy
According to the research , international migrants are far more likely to run their own businesses. Eleven percent are employers and 21% are classed as self-employed.
By comparison, only 5% of non-migrants and domestic migrants were employers, and only 9% of non-migrants and 7% of domestic migrants were self-employed.
Late last year, the Gauteng City-Region Observatory  a collaborative project between Wits University, the University of Johannesburg and the provincial government  conducted a limited survey of the informal sector in Johannesburg.
Dr Sally Peberdy, a senior researcher at the Observatory  says that the belief that international migrants dominate the informal sector is false. We found that less than two out of 10 people who owned a business in the informal sector [in Johannesburg] were cross-border migrants.
Peberdy argues that international migrants play a positive role in South Africa. The evidence shows that they contribute to South Africa and South Africans by providing jobs, paying rent, paying VAT and providing affordable and convenient goods.
The Observatorys study found that 31% of the 618 international migrant traders interviewed rented properties from South Africans. Collectively they also employed 1,223 people, of which 503 were South Africans.

Ukraine to rewrite Soviet history with controversial 'decommunisation' laws

In Kiev, a Soviet memorial to the second world war stands at one end of Shevchenko boulevard, which is named after the poet who formulated Ukrainian language and literature as distinct from Russias.
The boulevard passes monuments to Mykhailo Hrushevsky, a founder of the short-lived Ukrainian Peoples Republic in 1917, and Mykola Shchors, who fought for the Bolsheviks against that republic. It ends with an empty plinth where a statue of Lenin stood until toppled by protesters in late 2013.
Round the corner, where men in camouflage collect donations for Ukraines anti-terrorist operation in the east, a bookshop  part of a Russian chain  displays a book about Stepan Bandera, the Ukrainian nationalist leader who is a hero for some but also, in deeply entrenched Soviet and Russian rhetoric, the ultimate fascist and Nazi collaborator.
While the country struggles for its future, a war is also being waged to reclaim its past
Here in a nutshell is Ukraines confused and contradictory commemoration of history. While the country struggles for its future in the ongoing war to reclaim breakaway eastern regions, a war is also being waged to reclaim its past.

The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, is expected to sign a package of laws on  decommunisation , recently passed by parliament, which will lay down an official version of Ukrainian 20th century history. The laws ban Nazi and Communist symbols and the public denial of the criminal nature of the Communist totalitarian regime 19171991; they open former KGB archives; replace the Soviet term great patriotic war with the European second world war, and provide public recognition to anyone who fought for Ukrainian independence in the 20th century.
Proponents say the legislation, based on other post-Soviet countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, is long overdue to free Ukraine of a painful past and create a new national identity based on events repressed or rewritten by the Soviet regime.
Others are concerned that the laws will replace one officially sanctioned history with another
The Communist totalitarian regime set out deliberately to destroy national identity, said Volodymyr Vyatrovych, the 37-year-old historian and head of Ukraines National Memory institute, who introduced the laws in parliament. Many peoples ideas here are still formed by Communist propaganda, and many events from the past are viewed exclusively through the prism of Communist propaganda.
But others are concerned that the laws will further divide the country by replacing one officially sanctioned version of history with another. Of course we need history to form a contemporary national identity, said Vasyl Rasevych, senior researcher at the Institute of Ukrainian Studies in Lviv and editor of the internet journal zaxid.net , in a recent interview. But unfortunately Ukrainian history is so antagonistic and confrontational, it cant perform a consolidating function. It doesnt unite, it divides.

One of the four bills in the package, On the Legal Status and Honouring of Fighters for Ukraines Independence in the Twentieth Century , covers a long list of individuals and organisations from human rights activists to guerrillas accused of ethnic cleansing. It would allow veterans of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), followers of Bandera, to receive state benefits, and rules that denial or disrespect of their role in fighting for Ukrainian independence is an unlawful desecration of their memory.
But even a cursory knowledge of Bandera and the two militias will reveal how contentious their role in history has been - not just for Ukraine and Russia but for Europe . This is especially true for Poland, Ukraines current ally against Russia.
Imprisoned for fighting Polish authorities in west Ukraine in the 1930s, Bandera briefly joined sides with the German army to fight the Soviets, only to fall out with both half the OUN and with the Nazis who returned him to prison for most of the war.
In 19434, fighters from both militias were implicated in the slaughter of an estimated 70,000100,000 ethnic Poles in Volhyn and Galicia; there were also atrocities against the Jewish population. After the war, the militias continued a partisan struggle until the 1950s; Bandera emigrated to Germany to be courted by French and British secret services until he was assassinated in 1959 by a KGB agent.
UPA was a very broad popular movement, they were real freedom fighters. But there were also dark sides to their story
Myroslava Petsa
Post-war Soviet history propagated the image of Bandera and the UPA as exclusively fascist collaborators and xenophobes. The term Banderite to described his followers gained a recent new and malign life when Russian media used it to demonise Maidan protesters in Kiev, telling people in Crimea and east Ukraine that gangs of Banderites were coming to carry out ethnic cleansing of Russians.

Historians and activists such as Vyatrovych believe now is the time to replace that negative view for a positive one. I think now people will start to understand that the UPA is a part of Ukrainian history, Vyatrovych said. Ukraine needs to remember those who fought and died for their independence, especially now we have a new generation who are fighting and dying for independence.
Myroslava Petsa is part of that new generation. Her grandmother helped UPA fighters as a teenager while her grandfather was fighting in the Red Army to liberate Europe from the Nazis. After the second world war they both worked in a collective farm seven days a week, practically as slaves of the Communist and collectivisation system, said Petsa, a Kiev-based journalist.
UPA was a very broad popular movement, they were real freedom fighters. But there were also dark sides to their story. What makes me wary of the newly adopted bill is that history isnt black or white. It takes courage to recognise the dark pages from the past. Own it, say sorry, and then move forward.
The opening of the archives should allow people to do just that, said Vyatrovych, whose National Memory Institute will now be in charge of the archives. Not one of these laws aims to regulate or limit academic discussion; on the contrary, opening the KGB archive will stimulate discussion.
Vyatrovych defended the provision that outlaws public denial or disrespect of aspects of the fight for Ukrainian independence. Publicly calling those who fought collaborators, he said, is a way of breaking Ukrainian society.
But Rasevych in Lviv believes that much archival evidence has already been destroyed by partisan researchers on one or the other side of the historical debate, and that the laws will curtail any critical view of recent history in Ukraine. All we have now are propaganda constructs, he said. The ideological struggle is ongoing.
