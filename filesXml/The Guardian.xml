        <title>India heatwave death toll rises as awareness campaigns launch</title>

        <MainBody>Rani said temperatures were two to five degrees higher than the seasonal average.
The death toll in neighbouring Telangana, where temperatures hit 48C (118F) over the weekend, stood at 340.
Dr T Padmaja, the medical and health officer in Andhra Pradeshs Guntur district, one of the worst affected areas, said leave had been cancelled for doctors.
Local authorities across India have launched intensive awareness campaigns , asking people to stay indoors between 1pm and 4pm and advising them to wear broad-brimmed hats and light-coloured cotton clothes, use umbrellas and drink lots of fluid.

Among the most vulnerable are older people and poorer people, many of whom live in slums or farm huts with no access to air conditioners or sometimes even trees which could cast shade.
Many victims were day labourers, who need to work to eat. If I dont work due to the heat, how will my family survive? said Mahalakshmi, who earns a 200 rupees (2) a day as a construction labourer in the southern city of Nizamabad, Telangana state.
The homeless were also badly hit. Near one shelter in Delhi, dozens of men tried to keep cool in the shade of nearby trees. Others begged from the drivers of vehicles waiting at nearby traffic lights. If they give me anything I spend it on water at the moment not food, said Deepak Ram Lal, 42.

The capitals air conditioned metro and shopping malls have become much-sought-after havens from the heat, while power cuts in residential areas were frequent as the grid struggled to cope with the demand from millions of air conditioners.
Residents of Gurgaon  a high-rise satellite city, home to many of the Delhis workers  experienced power cuts of up to 10 hours a day. Nothing is working  even after taking half a dozen baths a day, you cant beat the heat, shop owner Manish Singh said. Its worse than previous years; we hardly get any electricity and the air conditioners become useless.
The heat has melted roads near the capital and caused problems with maintaining animal welfare at farms and the countrys zoos. Brahma Prakash Yadav, director of the Indian meteorological department, said though maximum temperatures would remain high until the weekend, rain would bring some relief early next week (PDF) .

The highest temperature ever recorded in the capital was 47.2C, in May 1944. The record in India is thought to be 50.6C, recorded in 1956 in the northern town of Alwar.
The death toll is worse than the severe heatwave in 2010 , which started much earlier, registering the highest temperatures for decades and lasting for months. But experts say compiling casualty statistics for heatwaves is extremely difficult owing to difficulties in attributing cause of death and registering fatalities in remote areas.
May and June are Indias hottest months, with temperatures regularly pushing above 40C. But meteorologists say the number of days when temperatures approach 45C has increased in the past 15 years.
The monsoon, predicted to hit southern Indias coastline on 31 May, will bring relief from the high temperatures, but it will not reach the parched north of the country for several weeks.

Defiant Sepp Blatter vows to fix Fifa as pressure mounts to resign
President speaks in Zurich in first public appearance since scandal broke, while North and Central American football federation dismisses executives
Sepp Blatter addresses the Fifa congress in Zurich: I cannot monitor everyone all the time

Fifa president Sepp Blatter has defiantly vowed to repair the rock-bottom reputation of world footballs governing body, refusing to quit over the worst corruption scandal in its 111-year history.
His stand came as an emotional Uefa president Michel Platini refused to rule out European teams boycotting the World Cup , Fifas cash cow, if the 79-year-old prevailed in Fridays election and as dismayed sponsors further ramped up the pressure.
Despite stiff competition from a succession of crises during his 17-year tenure as president, Blatter admitted that the charges of rampant, systemic and deep-rooted corruption presaged by dawn raids in Zurich and revealed by US authorities on Wednesday were shocking and unprecedented in their scale.
As Swiss prosecutors began questioning 10 Fifa executive committee members over their role in the controversial vote for the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Blatter vowed to ride out the storm in a familiar fashion ahead of Fridays presidential election.

Actions of individuals bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all. We cant allow the reputation of football and Fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer. It has to stop here and now, he said in his opening address to Fifas congress in Zurich.
Appearing in public for the first time since the scandal broke when seven senior Fifa officials were arrested at the Baur au Lac hotel in Zurich, and seven more charged in the US, Blatter appealed to the 209 member associations that will decide his immediate fate.
I know many people hold me ultimately responsible for the actions and reputations of the global football community, whether its a decision for the hosting of a World Cup or a corruption scandal, said Blatter.
I cannot monitor everyone all of the time. If people want to do wrong, they will try to hide it. But it must fall to me to be ultimately responsible for the wellbeing of our organisation and find a way forward to fix things.
While Blatters supporters within the Fifa family rallied round  the Confederation of African Football vowing to back him in Fridays election and Vladimir Putin criticising what he saw as a US plot  those who hope to force him out stepped up the pressure.
Platini, the Uefa president who helped him to victory in 1998 and was once a close ally, delivered a personal plea to Blatter to stand aside for the good of the game when they met for crisis talks.

Blatter cancelled a scheduled appearance at a Fifa medical conference to hold an emergency meeting with representatives of all six continental confederations at the organisations headquarters.
I said, Im asking you to leave, Fifas image is terrible, said Platini. He said that he couldnt leave all of a sudden.
Platini added that the majority of his 53 members would back Blatters Jordanian rival, Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein. Im saying this with sadness and tears in my eyes, but there have been too many scandals. Fifa doesnt deserve to be treated this way.
Platini said it was possible that Uefa could withdraw its co-operation from Fifa if Blatter won or even boycott the World Cup altogether. Enough is enough. Too much is too much. In terms of our image its not good at all. I am the first one to be disgusted by this, he said.

David Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive who sits on the Uefa board, said he would refuse the Fifa vice-presidency he is due to assume on Friday if Blatter won.
Seismic events happened yesterday and if he [Blatter] cant see the enormity of what has happened and resign, then to be on that body would be futile, said Gill. I dont think that is right for me, and more importantly, I dont think thats right for Uefa and football.
Blatters rival, Prince Ali, who has promised reform despite the devalued currency of the word at Fifa, is quietly confident that the crisis has strengthened his hand before Fridays vote. Perhaps optimistically, he told Uefa delegates that he was confident of securing at least 60 votes outside Europe, and Platini said he could deliver at least 45 votes from Europe.
Blatter requires a two-thirds majority of the 209 voters to triumph in the opening round, with a simple majority required if it goes to a second round. A handful of European nations, including Spain and 2018 World Cup hosts Russia, will remain loyal to Blatter.
Putin said the US investigation into Fifa corruption, which uncovered $150m (98m) worth of bribes as well as claims of bribery in the awarding of the 2010 World Cup and the 2011 presidential election, was designed to undermine Blatter and destabilise Russia.
I have no doubt that this is yet another evident attempt to derail Mr Blatters re-election as Fifa president. We are aware of the pressure that he was subjected to in relation to Russia holding the 2018 World Cup, he said.

Vladimir Putin backs Sepp Blatter to remain as Fifa president.
If he secures victory on Friday despite the storm raging around Fifa, attention is likely to swiftly turn to how much Blatter knew about some of the 47 charges named in the US indictment, stretching from 1991 to the present day.
US authorities have said Wednesdays bombshell was just the beginning of their investigation and warned they would follow the money where ever it may lead.
The Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) announced on Thursday that it had dismissed its president, Jeffrey Webb, one of the executives charged. Another member of its executive committee, Eduardo Li, was also sacked, while its general secretary, Enrique Sanz, was placed on leave of absence.
In a statement on its website, Concacafs new president, Alfredo Hawit, said: While we are profoundly disappointed by the allegations made by authorities that again, Concacaf has been the victim of fraud, we remain committed to Concacafs goal to develop, promote and manage the game of soccer.

We have now taken the appropriate steps to maintain our operations and continue to deliver on our commitments to all of our constituents, including our fans, members, as well as commercial and broadcast partners.
We also continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by governmental authorities, which have not placed any restrictions on our ongoing activities.
Jack Warner, the former Concacaf president, and former Fifa vice president, left a jail in Trinidad by ambulance on Thursday, a day after he was charged in the US corruption case. Judicial officer Abraham Ali said Warner had complained of exhaustion and was not able to face questions from reporters gathered outside the jail.
A judge in Buenos Aires has ordered the arrest of three Argentinian businessmen in connection with the Fifa corruption scandal, following a US extradition request.
Judge Marcelo Martinez de Giorgi told local radio he had issued arrest orders for Alejandro Burzaco, the president of Argentinian sports marketing firm Torneos y Competencias, as well as Mariano and Hugo Jinkis, the owners of Argentina-based sports media business Full Play. The judge said Interpol was working on his request.
The three men are accused of bribing officials at the Conmebol and Concacaf confederations for TV and marketing rights of continental tournaments.
Blatter joined Fifa in 1975 and became president in 1998. The cases include a $10m payment from a Fifa account to former vice-president Jack Warner, linked to the 2010 South Africa World Cup.
Fifas sponsors, typically tepid in their criticism to date despite a long history of scandal, also sought to ramp up the pressure in the face of the public outcry. Credit card company Visa made the strongest intervention yet by one of Fifas top partners, calling on it to take swift and immediate steps to address the issues and threatening to quit if it did not.
This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices in order to restore the reputation of the games for fans everywhere, it said in a statement. Should Fifa fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.
Other sponsors including Coca-Cola also took a notably more strident tone. Collectively, commercial partners contribute $400m a year to Fifas revenues.
All seven of those arrested on Wednesday are challenging their extraditions to the US and remain in custody in Zurich.
On Thursday night the England manager Roy Hodgson said he was disappointed and saddened by the situation.
He said: It is very saddening, very saddening to hear these things have taken place and one hopes desperately that measures will be taken to make certain it doesnt happen again.

Two separate car bombs that exploded in the car parks of two hotels have killed 10 people in Baghdad, according to Iraqi authorities.
Police officials say a car bomb exploded in the car park of the Babylon hotel late on Thursday night, killing six people and wounding 14 others.
A short time later, a second car bomb blast inside the car park of the Meridian hotel, formerly the Sheraton, killed four people and wounded 13 others.
Both hotels are luxury establishments popular with westerners. A further 30 people were wounded in the blasts.
Medical officials later confirmed the causality figures from both attacks. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
No one has claimed responsibility for the explosions, but Iraq is now seeing almost daily attacks, many of which have been attributed to Islamic State .

Vladimir Putin has declared that all military deaths will be classified as state secrets not just in times of war but also in peace  a move that activists worry might further discourage the reporting of Russian soldiers deaths in Ukraine.
The Russian president has amended a decree to extend the list of state secrets to include information on casualties during special operations when war has not been declared, among other changes. Previously, the list had only forbidden (pdf) revealing personnel losses in wartime. He has repeatedly denied any involvement of Russian troops in a pro-Russian rebellion in Ukraine.
Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that the changes were not connected to the conflict in Ukraine . Revealing state secrets is punishable by up to seven years in prison.
Rights advocate Valentina Melnikova, secretary of the Union of Soldiers Mothers Committees, said the decree simply legalised the common practice of withholding information on all military losses, which had been done since Soviet times.
I dont know what [the new decree] is connected with, but the bolsheviks and Russian authorities never revealed any casualty numbers, except after South Ossetia, she said, referring to the 2008 conflict during which Russian troops established control of the Georgian breakaway region. It was always considered a state secret. Now Putin has just made this official.
Sergei Krivenko, a member of the presidential human rights council, said the decree raises many questions and could serve to intimidate activists, journalists or relatives who report the deaths of Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine.
If we lived in a state governed by the rule of law, this decree would only affect officials. Those who have this information dont have the right to publish it, thats what this decree is about, he said. But in the situation were in now  almost any citizen can be punished for revealing information, so long as the authorities decide that this information hurts the countrys interests.
Earlier this month, one of two Russian men who were captured by Ukrainian forces during a clash with pro-Russian rebels said on camera that he was a member of the Russian special forces. Coverage of Russian soldiers presence in Ukraine is virtually taboo on state-controlled television, which portrays Russians fighting there as volunteers.
At least 276 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, according to a list of names compiled by Open Russia , an organisation started by Kremlin critic and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Reuters witnessed Russian troops and hundreds of pieces of weaponry near the border with Ukraine this week, providing evidence of a large-scale military buildup.
Also this month, colleagues of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov , who was murdered near the Kremlin in February, presented a report with evidence of Russian military operations in eastern Ukraine.
Relatives of dead servicemen and returned soldiers have been reluctant to speak out about the conflict. Activist Ilya Yashin told the Guardian that while working on the Nemtsov report he had met relatives of 17 soldiers from Ivanovo who were killed in Ukraine, but they had signed a pledge of secrecy and were afraid to go on record.
This week, US congressman Mac Thornberry said the Russian armed forces were trying to hide their casualties by deploying mobile crematoria to eastern Ukraine. Putins spokesman called the statement untrustworthy, and the US State Department reportedly declined to confirm the report .

A prominent Angolan journalist has been given a six-month suspended jail term for defaming army generals in a book that revealed killings and torture in the countrys diamond fields.
Rafael Marques de Morais described the sentence as a blow to freedom of expression in the southern African country: Its sending a message that we can lock you up, including Rafael. We can send him to jail any time we want.

The anti-corruption activist accused the generals of lying to him when they appeared to drop the charges in an out-of-court settlement last week. He believes they were merely trying to avoid the embarrassment of being cross-examined and forced to sit through witness testimony.
The case centred on Marquess 2011 book, Blood Diamonds: Corruption and Torture in Angola, which detailed more than 100 killings and hundreds of cases of torture allegedly perpetrated by security guards and soldiers in the diamond fields of the Lundas region. It argued that seven generals who co-own a private security company involved in many of the abuses were criminally responsible, prompting them to sue.
In court in the capital, Luanda, on Thursday, judge Adriano Cerveira said: [I have] decided, on behalf of the people, to give Rafael Marques de Morais, accused of the crime of slander ... a single sentence of [a suspended] six months in prison.
The court also ordered Marques to withdraw the book from the market, including on the internet, and not to republish or translate it. It is unclear how this could be applied to international publishers in Portugal and elsewhere which do not fall under Angolas jurisdiction.
When the trial began in March, Marques had faced 24 charges that could have resulted in a nine-year prison sentence and a fine of $1.2m (800,000). But he then held a private meeting with the generals , which included one of president Jose Eduardo dos Santoss closest allies, and believed he had struck a deal.
Marques, 43, agreed to tell the court that he never made any direct contact with the generals prior to writing the book and accepted that they did not have direct knowledge of the human rights abuses. He never intended to offend the generals but was simply reporting on the suffering of the Lundas people, whose evidence has not been challenged, he added.
But there was a fresh twist this week when, in spite of the agreement, prosecutors suddenly called for a suspended one-month sentence for Marques. The judge went further and imposed a six-month sentence suspended for two years.
Marques believes this will be used as a threat left hanging over all his activism and investigative journalism. He said: Within two years I can go to prison any time. With this twist, they might say you have not complied with this or that. The judge said you have an agreement with the generals and, if you infringe this agreement, the sentence can be imposed.
This is not going to end here. Its a victory for treachery and ill-faith and it just proves the generals were aware of the abuses in the region. If they were unaware, they would not have resorted to such laws to clear their names in such a crude and manipulative manner.
I think the judge was a pawn in this. The generals told me they had already talked to the judge and the attorney general of the republic to make the charges go away. Obviously they lied because they were fully aware of what was happening.
Asked about the generals motives, Marques said: They managed to avoid a court appearance. It was humiliating for them to be sitting there. With this manoeuvring they managed to extricate themselves from a court appearance and prevent my witnesses giving them all the evidence. I was convicted without any body of evidence.
Marques, who has run his investigative website Maka Angola for seven years, has been jailed before for branding Dos Santos a dictator. He spent 43 days locked up without charge in 1999, going for days at a time without food or water in solitary confinement.
Watchdogs condemned Thursdays sentencing of Marques. Jeffrey Smith, the Africa programme officer at the Robert F Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights , said: The way in which the Angolan judicial system manipulated this case, from the very outset, shows the brazen extent to which the Dos Santos government will go to criminalise freedom of expression.
This is obviously part of a larger attempt to stifle human rights reporting in Angola, and they are using Rafael Marques to set an example. In doing so, Angola is violating the African charter on human and peoples rights, as well as numerous other international human rights conventions which the country is legally bound to follow.

Sweden offers a generous 16-month parental leave which can be taken by either mothers or fathers, with two months of that set aside for dads.
A third month is something weve really looked forward to. We know that this is a key issue towards attaining greater [gender] equality, social security minister Annika Strandhll told Radio Sweden.
The country introduced a first month reserved specifically for fathers under a use it or lose it system in 1995, and a second month in 2002.
Under the fresh government proposal, mothers and fathers would each be required to take three months leave, or lose them. The remaining 10 months would be divided however the parents wished.
But the reserved months have over the years become known as daddy months because they are aimed at encouraging fathers to share more of the parental leave.
Parents receive 80% of their salary while on leave, capped at a salary ceiling of around 4,000 (2,900) per month.
Despite great strides in gender equality, Swedish men still earn more than women in general, and as a result men take more of an economic hit by staying home with their children.
Forcing parents to use it or lose it, meaning mothers cannot get the months reserved for fathers, the policy therefore encourages dads to stay home.
Women currently claim about 75% of parental leave, compared with 99.5% when it was introduced in 1974.
Parental leave can be used at any time before the childs eighth birthday.
About 80% of children in Sweden have two working parents, but only 40% of women work full-time compared with 75% of men, according to 2013 statistics.
Official figures from Eurostat show that 77% of women in Sweden had a job in 2014  the highest level in the European Union.
Children are guaranteed a place in childcare from the age of 12 months for a very modest sum, making it possible for women to return to work.
The minority Social Democratic government plans to present its bill to parliament in the autumn, and it is expected to pass with the support of the Left and Liberal parties.

A Russian opposition leader is in intensive care in a Moscow hospital, and a lack of clarity about the cause of his sudden illness has raised suggestions of foul play. Vladimir Kara-Murza was a close associate of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov , who was assassinated in February, and works with a civic organisation founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oil tycoon and opponent of the Kremlin.
First City hospital said 33-year-old Kara-Murza remained in a grave condition on Thursday, two days after he was admitted. The Interfax news agency, citing the hospitals chief doctor, said he appeared to be suffering from pancreatitis and double pneumonia.
His father, a prominent journalist also named Vladimir, told Interfax that doctors had not ruled out foul play, but that there was no evidence that his son had been deliberately poisoned.
The US ambassador to Russia , John Tefft, said on Twitter: We are concerned about Vladimir Kara-Murza and urge that he receive the best medical care now.

Thousands of Bangladeshi and ethnic Rohingya migrants are being held in huge cargo ships by human traffickers in the Andaman Sea, according to testimony collected from survivors.
First-hand accounts indicate that trafficking syndicates trading in vulnerable migrants have responded to a recent crackdown by authorities in Thailand and Malaysia by holding their victims in large vessels close to international waters, where they are ransomed for their freedom in return for money from relatives.

The practice, which has been accompanied by violence and other abuses, mirrors the fate of victims held in camps recently discovered by officials in southern Thailand and Malaysia, where dozens of mass graves have yet to be unearthed according to survivors who spoke to the Arakan Project . There is one crucial difference, however: the bodies of the dead were dumped overboard into the ocean, with no hope of being recovered.
The traffickers will not abandon their business, so they have now started putting camps in the sea, said Chris Lewa, founder of the Arakan Project. Since the end of February, we now have thousands and thousands of people stuck at sea, and I think we already have more death than even at the camps in Thailand .
A survivor from one ship who agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity described an ordeal of violence and sexual abuse accompanied by demands for ransom payment. She described a ship containing six storeys in total: three above deck, three below. The men and women were separated.
As a result of this arrangement, the women on the ship were targeted by sexually predatory crew members, she claimed. A girl around 12 years old who was very beautiful was taken to a room by a group of men and was not released from the ship, she recalled.
Other women onboard were subjected to similar treatment, she said, adding: If the women did not go, they were beaten.
Recalling other aspects of her ordeal onboard the vessel, the woman said: Food rations were not enough  when I asked for more, they beat me. She was accompanied by her three children during her time on the ship.
In other testimony collected by the Arakan Project, a 19-year-old Rohingya man from Burmas northern Rakhine state described his journey on one of the boats last year. After nine days at sea on a Burmese cattle ship, his vessel joined with a bigger boat not far from the Thai shore. He estimated there were more than 1,000 people onboard, roughly one-third of whom were women.
I spent 14 days on this ship. Three days after we were transferred, three smugglers arrived from Malaysia and boarded our ship. They carried mobile phones. They first asked who had phone numbers and, one by one, we started calling our relatives. Those [who did not provide] phone numbers were beaten, he recalled.
The smugglers ordered passengers to beat them with engine chains wrapped in plastic and plastic pipes with something heavy inside. Even those with phone numbers were beaten, he said.
The abuses continued until families sent money, after which survivors were taken to shore by small fishing boats.
Before I left, I witnessed three men who had become paralysed and one dead body was thrown overboard, he added.
A survivor from northern Thailand who spoke to the Guardian by phone described similar treatment. I stayed on the boats for three months from February this year until April. I remember people were beaten every day, sometimes two or three times a day. Those who could not pay were beaten.
I think there were more than one-and-a-half thousand people on that boat, he estimated.
Abdul Kalam, an adviser to Thai police, told Channel 4 News that refugees were being taken offshore for months. He said that a tanker ship has been deployed as a camp. It has been out for two months and is moving all the time. The ship has got 2,000 people on it. The traffickers are relocating their camps because so much money is involved.
The testimony of survivors has been reinforced by the accounts of Rohingya helped to shore by fishermen in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, after being stranded at sea. Visitors to the tightly-controlled camps containing the refugees heard multiple accounts of the use of large camp boats at sea.
I have just spent a week in Aceh working in three camps with my local humanitarian team, and we have conducted interviews with dozens of Rohingya and Bangladeshi survivors. Many of them spoke of being held in offshore camps on big ships in international waters, said Lilianne Fan , a research associate with the Humanitarian Policy Group.
Htike Htike, co-founder of the Bangkok-based Equal Harmony Together project, who also went to Aceh, offered a similar account.  I conducted 30 interviews in Aceh. During that time many people spoke of the use of camp boats where they were forced to call their family to ask for money, she said.
A 15-year-old survivor recalled seeing 34 people die from sickness during a 40-day stay onboard one of the huge camp vessels. Crew members threw the dead bodies overboard, he said.
He even saw the dead from other ships. About the 20th day of waiting in the Andaman Sea, another two cargo boats arrived. They were smaller than our boat and they anchored near our boat  I saw people who had died in those two boats: eight bodies were thrown overboard from one boat and the following day another 13 bodies were thrown from the other boat. I do not know how they had died.

Two former Guantnamo Bay detainees are planning to tie the knot with women from their adopted home of Uruguay .
Imam Samir Selim told the Associated Press that he would officiate at the ceremony for both men 6 June at the Egyptian Islamic Center in Montevideo.
This is great. Its beautiful, Selim said during a phone interview. These men want to make their lives here in Uruguay. They want to work and live like other men, and that means getting married.
Selim said Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi of Tunisia and Omar Abdelhadi Faraj of Syria are marrying Uruguayan women who have converted to Islam . He said the men met the women at the center, but declined to provide more details.
Calls to El Ouerghi and Faraj were not answered.
Mauricio Pigola, a lawyer who represents the men in Uruguay, said the two had requested marriage licenses. He said that as refugees, their permanent residence status permits them to marry like any other Uruguayan.
The men are part of a group of six former detainees  four Syrians, one Tunisian and one Palestinian  who were resettled in Uruguay in December , invited by then President Jose Mujica as a humanitarian gesture. All were detained in Afghanistan in 2002 for alleged ties to al-Qaida.
By their own admission, they have struggled to adapt in this small, poor South American nation of 3.3 million people. They have frequently complained that the Uruguayan government hasnt helped them enough financially.
Four of them, including the husbands-to-be, recently ended a nearly month-long protest in front of the US embassy to demand that America compensate them for nearly 13 years in Guantnamo.
Problems aside, since their arrival, several of the men have spoken about their hopes of starting families. In February, El Ouerghi, 50, told the AP that he had been married to a Pakistani woman when he was detained by American forces in Afghanistan in 2002. During his time in Guantnamo, she divorced him, he said.
Faraj, 34, also expressed a desire to wed and have children, saying the demands for more financial help were in large part to make having a family possible.

Photographer jailed for multi-billion euro Bettencourt exploitation

A French celebrity photographer has been found guilty and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for exploiting the mental frailty of Liliane Bettencourt , the ageing LOral shampoo heiress, who showered him with gifts including Picasso paintings, life insurance funds and millions of euros in cash.
Franois-Marie Banier, who had befriended Bettencourt, 25 years his senior, arguing that he was the only person who made her laugh, was given a three-year sentence  six months of which was suspended  and ordered to pay a fine of 250,000 and pay back over 15m to the Bettencourt family.
But judges cleared Eric Woerth , a former minister in Nicolas Sarkozys government and campaign treasurer for his 2007 presidential campaign. He was acquitted of charges of exploiting Bettencourts frailty by taking an envelope of cash from the weak and elderly billionaire who suffers from dementia.
Woerth was also cleared of charges of influence-peddling. He had been accused of using his position of influence to secure favours from Bettencourts financial manager  urging him to employ his wife in exchange for receiving the Legion of Honour, Frances highest decoration. The court acquitted him of all charges.
The Bettencourt saga began in more than seven years ago as a family feud between mother and daughter in one of the richest families in France , but it sparked a political scandal as well a raft of judicial investigations including on tax evasion and illegal party funding.
In 2007, Bettencourts daughter began legal action claiming that Banier, a Paris socialite and photographer, befriended her ageing mother and taken advantage of her frail state of mind to persuade her to give him more than 1bn in artworks, insurance policies and cash. The long-running case gripped France and sent shockwaves through the political class, tarnishing Sarkozy, who was placed under formal investigation for illegal campaign financing and taking advantage of Bettencourt after being voted out as president in 2015. Those charges against Sarkozy were dropped in October 2013 due to lack of evidence.
Banier, now 67, who first met Bettencourt, 92, when he photographed her for a magazine, presented himself in court as a rich and well-connected celebrity photographer, a charming eccentric who did not need the money.
Bettencourt, who is estimated to be worth 33bn (24bn) by Forbes magazine, was alleged to have found a new best friend in the outrageous and eccentric Banier. She showered him with so many gifts that even his own lawyer admitted in court that he had been drowning in gold and briefly made him her sole heir.
The court had heard how Bettencourt had been suffering from increasing dementia and, by 2011, was unable to tell what year it was.
From 2006 to 2010, Banier received gifts from Bettencourt worth 414m, including life insurance policies, paintings by Picasso, Matisse and Mondrian, manuscripts and cash. In court, Banier conceded that just hearing the figures sparked an enormous vertigo. But he said Bettencourt chose to bestow the gifts, it gave her immense pleasure to do it and she had been of sound mind. He said she got angry if he tried to turn down gifts. Most of the value of the gifts was paid back before the court case.
Patrice de Mestre, Bettencourts wealth manager, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for exploiting her frailty, as was her former lawyer. Martin dOrgeval, Baniers partner, was found guilty on the same charges and received a suspended sentence.
Banier and de Mestre will appeal against the verdicts.

Lehman Brothers' former CEO blames bad regulations for bank's collapse
Dick Fuld defended the banks culture, pointing the finger instead at government failings and hedge funds aggressively short-selling its stock

Dick Fuld, the chief executive who led Lehman Brothers to the largest corporate collapse in modern times, has defended the failed investment banks culture, insisting that it was a victim of wider market excesses and regulatory failings in his first public speech since the banking crash of 2008.
It was all about team, he told a conference in New York. My people were in it together  and our clients knew it. There was no ... Its my account, no Im a star, so pay me.
Fuld, who was paid $485m (317m) in salary, bonuses and options between 2000 and 2007, also attempted to respond to criticisms that Lehman had not been good at assessing risks. Regardless of what you heard of Lehman Brothers risk management, I had 27,000 risk managers, because they all owned a piece of the firm, he said, explaining that staff had owned more than 30% of the banks stock.
In the final months before the demise of Lehman, Fuld said the bank had been furiously attacked by hedge funds that were short-selling the firms stock  effectively betting that it would decline in value. I will hurt the shorts, and that is my goal, he raged, five months before the bank came crashing down.
The banks failure sent shockwaves around the global economy and, in its wake, Fuld was summoned to appear before Congress for what turned out to be a bruising encounter.

Referring to Fulds pay, the chairman of the House oversight committee, Henry Waxman, said: You made all this money taking risks with other peoples money.
Fuld told the Congress members: Not that anyone on this committee cares about this, but I wake up every single night wondering, What could I have done differently? This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
In early 2008, short-sellers believed the bank was vulnerable, in large part due to its exposure to complex credit products it had built, known as collateralised debt obligations, or CDOs. Critics have suggested such products were an important contributor to the debt bubble.
At the conference on Thursday, however, Fuld threw a different light on the causes of Lehman Brothers downfall. The crash, he said, started with the government. The government pushed for non-qualified home ownership. The government clearly ... wanted everybody to fulfil their view of the American dream. To this point he added the aggravating factors of low interest rates and easy access to credit for homeowners. Credit bubble indicators were also plain to see, he suggested, in ballooning growth in GDP and in the private equity and hedge fund sectors.
Among the highest-profile short-sellers to target Lehman in 2008 was the New York hedge fund Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn. At a hedge fund conference in May 2008 , Einhorn had accused Fuld and his board of accounting ingenuity.
How did this happen? The answer is that the investment banks outmanoeuvred the watchdogs ... As a result, with no one watching, the managements of the investment banks did exactly what they were incentivised to do: maximise employee compensation. Investment banks pay out 50% of revenues as compensation. More leverage means more revenues, which means more compensation.
Einhorn is thought to have made substantial sums from bets on the downfall of Lehman.

An emergency international summit called to tackle the migrant boat crisis in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, convening in Bangkok on Friday, may prove long on talk and short on answers if countries shy away from coordinated joint action to address the root causes in Burma and Bangladesh , diplomats and aid groups say.
The summits Thai hosts  who have invited 17 countries including Malaysia , Indonesia, other Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) members and Australia  say they want immediate, collective steps to deal with the recent surge in Rohingya Muslim refugees fleeing Burma and economic migrants leaving Bangladesh.

It is an urgent call for the region to comprehensively work together to address the unprecedented increase of irregular migration across the Bay of Bengal in recent years, said Panote Preechyanud, of the Thai foreign ministry. But with little sign of agreement on what to do or who should do it, such calls look destined to go unanswered.

About 3,500 migrants have fled by sea in the past month, mostly coming ashore in Malaysia and Indonesia or being rescued at sea, often after initially being turned away. Unknown numbers have died, and the UN estimates that up to 2,600 are currently at sea on seven boats, the abandoned victims of people-smuggling gangs.
After fierce international criticism, Malaysia reversed its policy of sending boats back to sea and now says it will accept migrants for up to 12 months. But it is unclear what will happen to them after that. Despite its economys reliance on foreign workers, Malaysia complains that it is home to 120,000 illegal migrants from Burma and is already doing its bit.
Indonesia has adopted a similar stance toward the Rohingyas, but is insisting that all Bangladeshi migrants be repatriated. Thailand , whose crackdown on people-smuggling gangs precipitated the crisis last month, is now saying it will provide temporary humanitarian help but that it is hosting 100,000 refugees from Burma and does not want any more.

So great is its denial of the problem, the Burmese government agreed to attend the summit only if the word Rohingya was not mentioned in the invitation. Predominantly Buddhist Burma maintains that the much repressed and discriminated against 1.3 million-strong Muslim minority concentrated in Rakhine state are not Burmese at all , but rather Bangladeshi immigrants.
Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader, has declined to speak up for the Rohingya, an omission that brought criticism this week from the Dalai Lama , the Buddhist leader and a fellow Nobel peace prize winner.
Its very sad. In the Burmese case I hope Aung San Suu Kyi, as a Nobel laureate, can do something, he told the Australian newspaper. I met her two times  I mentioned this problem and she told me she found some difficulties, that things were not simple but very complicated. But in spite of that I feel she can do something.
Criticism of Burmas actions provoked counter-protests in Rangoon this week. Banners carried through the streets by nationalists, including Buddhist monks , featured slogans calling the migrants terrorists and beasts.

In Bangladesh, the official reaction has been similarly unsympathetic. Its prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, said migrants who risked their lives fleeing Bangladesh were mentally sick and tainted the countrys image abroad , and she vowed to punish them. Meanwhile, plans were announced to forcibly relocate Rohingya camps .
About one-third of Bangladeshs 166 million people are under the age of 15. Youth unemployment is around 13%. The economy depends to a significant extent on remittances from more than seven million overseas workers.
The US, which will be represented at the summit, has said it will consider admitting more Rohingyas. But others are unyielding. Asked whether Australia would help with resettlement, the prime minister Tony Abbott replied: Nope, nope, nope  We are not going to do anything that will encourage people to get on boats.
Asean countries have another reason for eschewing joint action to pressure Burma: the groups long-established principle of non-interference in each others internal affairs. In an unusual step, Malaysia, Aseans current chair, sent a delegation to Rangoon last week to discuss the issue.
But diplomats say unless and until Asean acts tough, Burmas regime will continue to try to ignore the problem. It is an Asean issue and has to be resolved by Asean, a western diplomat said.

        <title>Bangladeshi blogger named on hitlist warned: 'You will be next'</title>

Ananya Azad is no stranger to assassination attempts. The prominent Bangladeshi bloggers father, Humayun Azad, wrote a scathing critique of Islamist fundamentalism in 2003 entitled Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad (Blessed Be the Sacred Land, the title of Pakistans national anthem). A year after it was published, Humayan was seriously injured in a street attack by assailants wielding machetes.
Now, it is his sons turn to fear the outside world. Ananya followed in his fathers footsteps to become a writer critical of intolerance and religious fundamentalism, a career that has landed him on a hitlist containing the names of 84 atheist bloggers.
The list was submitted to Bangladeshs interior ministry in 2013 by a group of radical Islamists asking for the writers to be punished for making derogatory statements about Islam and the prophet Muhammad. At the time, few bloggers believed they were seriously in danger. But on 12 May, science writer Ananta Bijoy Das became the third person named on that list to be murdered in the street this year.
People have told me to refrain from writing, said 25-year-old Ananya, who quit his job as a newspaper columnist after Washiqur Rahman became the second blogger on the list to be killed, hacked to death in Dhaka in March.
Last week, following the attack on Das, Ananya received a threatening Facebook message: You would be the next person. So be careful.
Ananya no longer writes blogs and tries to stay indoors as much as possible, but he continues to articulate his views on social media to a closed community of like-minded readers.
Anyone who has a critical view about religion is exposed, he said, but added that he was determined not to be silenced. I probably have reduced my frequency of writing but my nature of writing has not changed.
Some have cast doubts over the contents of the list, saying it should not be taken seriously. We still do not know a source for the list, online activist Imran H Sarker told the Guardian, saying he believed it contained multiple names and pseudonyms for individual bloggers.
However, those bloggers featured on it say threats against them have increased since the first blogger victim  Avijit Roy, an American citizen of Bangladeshi origin  was murdered in a machete attack in Dhaka on 26 February.
Whether the list is credible or not, when people from the list are dying, the threats cannot be taken lightly, said Shubhajit Bhowmik, a politics and social affairs writer who is also named on the document. The threats are so frequent and so many that we no longer can count them.

Though Bangladesh is an officially secular country, more than 90% of its 160 million-strong population are Muslim. Hefazat-e-Islam, a hardline Islamist group, publicly sought the execution of atheists who organised mass protests against the rise of political Islam in March 2013, soon after the list was presented. The group staged a huge counter-protest against the bloggers in May 2013 that left nearly 50 people dead.
Roy founded Mukto Mona , which describes itself as a portal that aims to promote science, rationalism, secularism, freethinking, human rights, religious tolerance, and harmony. Das also wrote for the blog, which Roys colleagues continue to publish.
Roy was murdered on his way home from a book fair in Dhaka in an attack that left his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, badly injured.
We were supposed to be going back home to have dinner with the family, she told the BBC at the time. I think I was holding his hand and we were just talking. I do not remember anything from that point until I was in some sort of vehicle and someone was carrying me. I remember I was soaked in blood.
Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent claimed responsibility for Roys killing, and an Islamist was arrested for his murder. Two madrasa students were arrested for Rahmans killing. No one has been charged over Dass murder, but his brother has filed a criminal case saying he was killed by an extremist fanatic group.
This week police called for the government to ban the Ansarullah Bangla Team, an Islamist militant group they believe may be behind the three attacks. Members of the group have already been charged with the 2013 murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider.

However, Ananya and others on the list believe extremists continue to take advantage of a culture of impunity. And it is not only violence on the streets that the bloggers fear: anyone found guilty of publishing material that authorities deem to be false or defamatory faces a jail term of up to 14 years.
In 2013, atheist blogger Asif Mohiuddin was stabbed in the street by religious extremists. A month later, he was arrested and held in prison for making derogatory remarks about religion and his blog was banned.
Sushanta Das Gupta, who founded amarblog.com , is another on the list. The London-based Bangladeshi activist and writer used to visit his homeland five or six times every year but has not been for 18 months for fear of attacks. However, he is also concerned about being targeted while abroad.
I could imagine there will be more attacks, not only in Bangladesh , he said. I have already informed London Met police  They provided me [with] a panic alarm which could be used in case I am in any danger.
Though some of the bloggers on the list continue to publish in defiance of the threats against them, many now use pseudonyms. However, as Shubhajit pointed out, that offers little protection.
Washiqur had no photo of himself on Facebook, he said. We had no idea about him until he was killed. Still, he became a prey to the fundamentalists  this shows that they know how to find us.
The Guardian contacted the junior interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan, the secretary of the interior ministry, Mozammel Haque Khan, the chief of police, Shahidul Haque, and the chief of the detective branch, Monirul Islam. None responded to requests for comment.

A man who went missing after tangling with a brown bear at Warsaws zoo, leaving traces of blood, was found on Thursday in a hospital.
The 32-year-old, being treated for an arm wound, refused to tell police why he entered the enclosure on Sunday and approached the bear. Maria Krakowiak, head of the predatory animals section at the zoo, said the mans stunt was very dangerous and could have ended much worse.
Blood was found on Sunday outside the enclosure. A witness then posted photos online showing the man inside, barefoot and in shorts. In one photo he had his right palm in the bears mouth. From other photos it appears the bear, a female named Sabina, tried to bite his arm and that the man hit the bear. It is not clear which happened first.
However, the tabloid Fakt, citing witnesses, reported on Wednesday that it was the man who first attacked Sabina, hitting the 200kg (440lb) bear with his fists. He survived only thanks to a miracle, Fakt wrote.
Krakowiak said the zoo is hoping that city authorities will now install cameras to monitor the bear enclosure. A popular fixture in Warsaw for decades, the enclosure is on a busy street, a few hundred metres from the zoo proper.
Spokeswoman Paulina Onyszko said police informed the man that he could face a fine of up to 1,000 zlotys (170) if found guilty of provoking the animal into aggression.
The case was being sent to court, Onyszko said.

After about a century of research, scientists in Switzerland have finally solved the mystery of the holes in Swiss cheese.
Despite what you may have been told as a child, the holes are not caused by mice nibbling away inside cheese wheels.
Experts from Agroscope, a state centre for agricultural research, said the phenomenon  which marks famous Swiss cheeses such as emmental and appenzell  was caused by tiny bits of hay present in the milk and not bacteria as previously thought.
They found that the mystery holes became smaller or disappeared when milk used for cheesemaking was extracted using modern methods.
Its the disappearance of the traditional bucket used during milking that caused the difference, said Agroscope spokesman Regis Nyffeler, adding that bits of hay fell into the milk and then eventually caused the holes.
Agroscope said the mystery had been studied since at least 1917 when American William Clark published a detailed research and came to the conclusion that it was caused by carbon dioxide released by bacteria present in the milk.
Agroscope scientists noted that Swiss cheeses had fewer holes over the past 10 to 15 years as open buckets were replaced by sealed milking machines that completely did away with the presence of tiny hay particles in the milk.

Journalists are negotiating with Burmese officials to regain access to the parliament chamber after pictures of sleeping MPs were published online.
One image appeared to show an army representative leaning over to press a voting button for an absent MP
Reporters in the capital, Naypyitaw, were told on Tuesday they would have to watch proceedings on TV from the corridor. The pictures of sleeping MPs was the main reason cited by Kyaw Soe, director general of the Union Parliament, which handles administrative duties.
Other pictures have circulated showing legislators using iPads while in session. Another appeared to show an army representative leaning over to press a voting button for an absent MP.
In a minor victory, the journalists were told they could occupy the upper floor of the chamber, but they were continuing to negotiate Thursday evening.
Related: Burmese journalists protest against reporter's jail term
While the new location could be sufficient for text reporters, it would give video journalists and photographers only a distant view of the MPs. Officials offered to provide handout images instead, but independent media outlets consider that unacceptable.
The restriction is totally unacceptable. Press freedom is not guaranteed in the country but only in the hands of those in power. They can revoke press freedom any time they like, Zaw Thet Htway, a former political prisoner and editor of Tomorrow, a weekly journal.
Burma started moving from a half-century of military rule to democracy in 2011 but many of its political reforms, such as media freedom, have stalled. About 10 journalists have been jailed and nearly a dozen are facing trials.
The constitution also allots a quarter of the seats in parliament to the military, a number that gives it the ability to veto over constitutional amendments.

Fury over Paraguayan authorities refusal to allow an abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim is expected to bring unprecedented numbers of pro-choice protesters to the streets of the countrys capital, Asuncin, this week.
The case has prompted outcry around the world and prompted a national debate about the prevalence of child abuse and underage pregnancies .
But that debate has focused more on adult violence than on child health. And while many have called for tougher penalties for adults who abuse minors, few expect any change in the Catholic countrys strict abortion laws.

Despite a plea from the girls mother, Paraguayan authorities have ruled that the 10-year-old who is now 25 weeks into the pregnancy must give birth, unless she develops complications that put her life in danger. A medical panel is monitoring her condition.
Pedro Pablo Guanes, a gynaecologist based in Asuncin, said the authorities are likely to release a tentative date for the birth soon. One option is for a cesarian section to be carried out in the next few weeks to avoid the biggest risk, which is that the girls body may not yet be developed enough to accommodate a fetus in its final stage.
On average, two girls under the age of 16 give birth each day in this country of 6.8 million, according to local media reports which have reflected fears that the rape of minors has become normalised.
Congressmen have proposed raising the maximum sentence for the rape of a minor to 30 years in prison, up from 10 years. But attempts to raise awareness over the issue of sexual abuse have been modest: the government has urged people to wear green ribbons on the National Day Against Child and Adolescent Sexual Abuse on 31 May.
A day earlier, hundreds of demonstrators are expected to attend a march from the Plaza Uruguaya to El Panten in the capital with banners declaring My body, my territory, not for use or abuse. Similar small rallies have been staged every year, but organisers expected double the usual number of marchers this year because of the commotion caused by the 10-year-olds pregnancy.

Her case is emblematic and motivates many people, said Rosana Ros of the Grupo Luna Nueva, which is one of the participating organisations in the protest. We are marching against the inaction of the state in the face of this problem.

Petitions have been sent to the Ministry of Children demanding the government stop treating this problem as normal and asking for the establishment of a medical board to evaluate the options for the girls well-being. The global online campaigning organisation Avaaz presented a petition to the Paraguayan congress with half a million signatures calling for the decriminalization of abortion for women under 15 years of age.
This coincided with a public hearing in Asuncin on whether to reform the nations abortion laws. Feminist and pro-choice groups argued that decriminalisation was long overdue because more than 50,000 illegal abortions are carried out each year for those who can afford them, while the poor have no choice but to bear the health and economic risks associated with an unwanted pregnancy.

The situation in Paraguay reflects that across Latin America, where abortion is illegal or severely restricted in most countries. Nicaragua, Chile and El Salvador ban abortion completely, even if the pregnancy threatens the life of both the mother and the foetus.
The World Health Organization has said botched abortions are a leading cause of maternal death worldwide, and in 2008 accounted for 12% of all maternal deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean.
But the strong influence of the Catholic church in the region makes reform unlikely. Earlier this week, Perus congress rejected a bill to decriminalise abortion in the case of rape . In Paraguay, a recent survey suggested that 87% of the population is opposed to abortion.
Many local doctors say it is unnecessary. The hospital Clinicas recently reported almost 400 pregnancies of girls under 16 years old that went to term without complications. The gynaecologist in charge of the 10-year olds case said in a press release that he was surprised at the latest fuss because last year a nine-year-old girl gave birth.
This shows how the situation here has become normal, at least to those who work with these cases, said Cecilia Caniza, a psychiatrist based in Asuncin. Everyone needs to understand that this is not normal. Just because there are lots of cases does not make the situation OK.
International research suggests the potential hazards for very young mothers are considerable: even though a 10-year-old may be able to conceive, her pelvis is not fully developed, raising the likelihood of complications during birth.
One big study in Bangladesh showed a five-fold increase in risk of death among 10- to 14-year-olds compared to women aged 20 to 24, said Dr Mickey Chopra, Unicefs global chief of health.
Even if the mother doesnt die, the physical complications of pregnancy can be quite severe, running from prolapses to being physically disabled, said Chopra.
Young girls who become pregnant also experience higher rates of pre-eclampsia  dangerously high blood pressure  which can be life-threatening for mother and baby.
And even when rape is not an issue, adolescents can have difficulty adapting to motherhood when they are still growing up themselves, said Daghni Rajasingam, a consultant obstetrician and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK.
According to Unicef, the teen and adolescent birth rate in Paraguay is 63 per 1000 girls aged 15 to 19. In the UK, which has one of the highest rates in Europe, the rate is 25 per 1000 and in the US, which has the highest rates in the OECD, it is 39.
Religion is not the only factor. Some Catholic countries do not have high teenage pregnancy rates  in Italy it is seven per 1000 and in Ireland it is 16. Access to abortion is obviously important, but it is also about social norms, Chopra said.

Syria not a launching pad for attacks on west says al-Nusra chief in TV interview

Al-Qaidas Syria affiliate would not use Syria as a launching pad for attacks on the west, its chief said in a wide-ranging televised interview on Wednesday.
Without showing his face, Abu Mohamed al-Jolani said his group, al-Nusra Front, would protect Syrian minorities that renounced the regime.
The interview was Jolanis second with Qatari-owned al-Jazeera TV since a similar appearance in 2013. The interviewer, Ahmad Mansur, said it was broadcast from liberated lands in Syria.
All that could be seen of Jolani was a black shawl, a check shirt and gesturing hands.
The instructions that we have are not to use al-Sham as a base to launch attacks on the west or Europe, so as not to muddy the current war, Jolani said.
Our mission in Syria is the downfall of the regime, its symbols, and its allies, like Hezbollah. Hezbollah is the powerful Shia movement fighting alongside the Bashar al-Assad regime.
But if the United States kept attacking them, he said, all options are open. Anyone has the right to self-defence.
Jolani also denied the existence of the Khorasan group, which the US had said was an offshoot of al-Qaida that was plotting attacks against the US.
Nevertheless, he lambasted the US for its air raids against al-Nusra in Syria and accused it of coordinating with the Assad regime on the use of air space.
America is propping up the regime, he asserted, leaning forward in an ornate gold-encrusted chair.
Al-Nusra and its extremist rival Islamic State have been designated as terrorist organisations by the US since the end of 2012.
Since September, a US-led international coalition has been raiding jihadist positions in Syria, although most strikes have targeted IS.
In recent months, al-Nusra has led a rebel coalition in a series of key victories in Syrias north-west Idlib province, including the capital and a large military base.
The gains have opened the road for a potential jihadist advance on Latakia and Tartus, coastal provinces that are home to Syrian minorities including Christians and Alawites, the offshoot of Shia Islam to which the Assad clan belongs.
Extremist groups in Syria, including al-Nusra and IS, have been accused of targeting these minority communities. But al-Nusras chief seemed to try to play down those fears, saying his group only fights those who fight us.
If the Alawites leave their religion and leave Bashar al-Assad, we will protect them, he said.
He said Christians living under the rule of al-Nusra were living in peace and that in a future state ruled by Islamic law, the financially capable would pay jizya, or tax reserved for non-Muslims.
Jolani promised to defeat the Lebanese movement Hezbollah, which has significantly bolstered the Assad regime in the mountainous border region between Syria and Lebanon.
Hezbollah knew the ugliness of the Syrian regime, Jolani warned. It knew its fate was directly linked to Bashars fate.
Qalamun will be an important gateway for Damascus when the battle for the capital begins. As soon as Bashar is defeated, it will be the end for Hezbollah.
As he did in his interview in 2013, the Nusra chief said the end of the Assad regime was near.
I assure you, the fall of Bashar is not far away, he said. I do not want to project much optimism, but there are very positive signs.
He rejected a political end to the conflict, saying that any political agreement reached in the halls of Washington ... would cost the blood of the Syrian people.
He also firmly denied receiving any state funding, saying that Nusra was financed by its own businesses activities and contributions from individual donors.
Wednesdays interview was the first in a two-part series, to be continued next week.

A self-service pub offering local beer has become a hit in a tiny Czech village where touring cyclists mingle with locals to help themselves to the countrys favourite tipple.
Ordinary pubs have no chance to survive in a village like this, says local home brewer Martin Povysil, who installed the beer machine  resembling a coffee or bank machine, but with a tap  on the outside wall of the community centre in Uhrinovice.
Normal pubs open in the evenings and at weekends but they are mostly closed during the day, leaving your tourist or cyclist dry, Povysil said, sitting at one of three wooden picnic tables set up at the open-air pub.
All beer lovers need to do is grab a cup from the storage rack, insert a coin and run their ID through a scanner to prove they are over the drinking age of 18 to help themselves to a cool, crisp pint.

He believes his beer tap is one of a kind.
This beer machine is unique, he says. Ive seen something like this in Japan and the USA on the internet, but this version is completely different.
In 2013 Povysil, a 50-year-old bespectacled, pony-tailed former salesman for a medium-sized Czech brewery, started to make his own beer in his summer house in Uhrinovice, a village of 75 people.
He launched the beer machine the same year.
Cyclists passing through the village in central Czech Republic  a country where people drank a world-leading 144 litres of beer a head in 2013  can also pour lemonade for the same price as beer, set at 20 Czech koruna (73 euro cents, 80 US cents) a pint.
The machine made by a technician from a nearby city cost almost 50,000 koruna, says Povysil, who sells a 30-litre keg on a rainy week but three 50-litre kegs a week during summer.
I have never counted the return on investment, said Povysil, who now makes his living from the microbrewery. Its haphazard, depending on the weather and peoples tastes.
The locals love it. They enjoy the beer, and the machine makes us a community.

A wealthy New York socialite was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Thursday after being convicted of killing her young autistic son at a luxury Manhattan hotel in 2010.
Gigi Jordan, 54, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter in November after admitting that she administered an overdose of prescription pills to eight-year-old Jude Mirra at the posh Peninsula hotel on Fifth avenue, using a crusher and syringe.
Jordans attorneys argued throughout the two-month trial that she had killed the boy in an act of mercy to prevent his biological father from sexually abusing him, a scenario that prosecutors said was based on fiction.
Judge Charles Solomon of the state supreme court in Manhattan handed down a sentence that was close to the maximum of 25 years in prison under New York guidelines, saying he was mystified by the mothers lack of remorse.
Its very difficult for me to understand the defendant, Solomon said. I certainly would think that I would hear something from the defendant, expressing remorse about what she did  something.
In a 30-minute statement read to the court, Jordan appealed for leniency and again said she had been acting in her sons best interests.
I love Jude more than anything in this world, the former pharmaceuticals executive and self-made millionaire said in a 30-minute statement. I believe that he lived and died in unbelievable agony.
At her trial last year, the jury accepted the defenses claim that Jordan had acted under extreme emotional distress, finding her guilty of manslaughter rather than the top murder charge sought by prosecutors.
Even though Mirra was unable to express himself well, Jordans attorneys argued, he had told his mother that he was being sexually abused by his father, Emil Tzekov.
Tzekov, a yoga instructor who became Jordans second ex-husband, has denied the accusations.
Jordan said she feared she would be unable to protect her boy because her first husband, Philadelphia businessman Raymond Mirra Jr, planned to have her killed or institutionalised, and Tzekov would gain custody of her son.
Prosecutors argued that Jordan carefully planned the death of her son after traveling the country to find a cure for his autism. They said that Jordan killed her son because she could not accept that he was disabled and she could not fix his medical condition.
Outside court, Jordans attorney Norman Siegel expressed disappointment with the sentence and said Jordan would appeal.

        <title>Yemen: anti-aircraft fire cause of most civilian casualties in Sana'a, report says</title>

Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have caused the majority of civilian casualties in the nations capital Sanaa by firing anti-aircraft munitions that explode after landing in populated areas, a leading human rights watchdog has said in a report published two months into a Saudi-led air war.
Amnesty International said anti-aircraft weapons were the leading cause of casualties in the capital in a report released on Thursday, which also blamed the Saudi-led coalition for contributing to the number of civilian casualties by bombing weapons depots near residential areas.

The reports findings, gleaned from a week-long visit to Sanaa and interviews with hospital staff, challenge the conventional wisdom that the air strikes are the direct cause of the high civilian toll of the conflict. But Amnesty urged both sides to take precautions to avoid civilian casualties and respect international humanitarian law.
The World Health Organisation said that almost 2,000 people have been killed and nearly 8,000 wounded since 19 March. Wednesday was the deadliest day in the campaign, with 80 people killed.
Sanaas residents are caught in a deadly crossfire between the Saudi Arabian-led coalition airstrikes and anti-aircraft fire from the Houthi armed group, said Lama Fakih, senior crisis adviser at Amnesty. Both sides have failed to take the necessary precautions to protect civilian lives in violation of the laws of war. Instead they have carried out attacks that have had devastating consequences for the civilian population. For the civilians affected, it doesnt matter which side is responsible. They pay the same price.
The Houthi rebels, members of the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam who hail from the northern province of Saada, took control of the capital in a surprise offensive last year and placed the president, Abed Rabbu Mansour Hadi, under house arrest. Hadi later escaped to his stronghold in Aden and fled to Saudi Arabia as the Houthis and their allies bore down on the southern port city. A coalition of mostly Arab Sunni states, led by Saudi Arabia, launched air strikes in response to the advance of the Houthis.
The coalition sees the Houthis as proxies of Iran, and are unnerved by the Islamic Republics influence in Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut and Sanaa.
So far both sides have displayed a chilling indifference to the deadly impact of their actions on civilians
Lama Fakih, Amnesty
Doctors in the Yemeni capital told Amnesty that most of the wounded treated in their medical facilities arrived with injuries caused by anti-aircraft weapons, including fragmentation wounds. Saudi air strikes on weapons depots also caused secondary explosions that killed or maimed civilians, Amnesty said. Many military bases in the capital are located close to civilian homes, a deliberate strategy by former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted in Arab Spring-style protests and has now allied with the Houthis.
So far, both sides have displayed a chilling indifference to the deadly impact of their actions on civilians, Fakih said. All parties to the conflict can and should take all feasible steps to minimise the risk to civilians.
Air strikes resumed last week in Yemen after a five-day ceasefire, further worsening humanitarian conditions in the Arab worlds poorest country.
Poverty relief charity Oxfam said on Monday that 16 million Yemenis, or two-thirds of the population, are now without access to a clean water supply and sanitation. Unicef said that as many as 135 children have been killed and 260 injured since the conflict escalated in March.

        <title>Fifa: doubletalk, schmaltz and a deep-fried Swiss dictator</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/29/sepp-blatter-crumbling-empire</Link>

As they made the short journey from luxury coach to congress hall, Fifas delegates were asked the same question over and over again by a German television crew stationed just beyond the velvet rope. Hello, and how much money did you receive for your vote? Yes, how much money? For your vote? Do you have an exact figure? OK! Thanks!
A little baffled, occasionally pausing to offer some mumbled platitudes, the delegates kept coming, like bad guys from central casting in shades and thrillingly terrible suits. Yes, its Fifa family: dysfunctional, beleaguered, living on handouts, and here for the most hysterically received Fifa congress in the ever-more baroque and subterranean 65-year modern history of footballs governing body.
Football is the game of hope! Fifas in-house PA would announce that night as the opening ceremony wafted across Zurichs cavernous Hallenstadion, a fug of schmaltz, double-talk and oddly overblown musical performances. It must be said football didnt particularly feel like the game of hope, good fellowship and all the rest of it as the German TV crew joined the rest of the gathered global media in clattering around the corner to catch sight of President Joseph S Blatter getting out of his Fifa-issue Mercedes.
Blatter is usually pretty good at this. He gives good red carpet: courtly, grinning, a ludicrous old human butterball of a sporting despot who, each year, resembles more and more the World Cup trophy itself, all toasted perma-tan and gleaming gold pate. This time though he looked pale, surprised perhaps by the ferocity of the reception. Blatter has ridden out choppy waters before. He is a master of obfuscation and soft dictatorship. But, with Michel Platini jumping ship earlier in the day, the FBI in the mix and only an unusual alliance of African football and Vladimir Putin offering any public support, this is a rare storm in the 17-year history of Blatters extraordinarily bold, extraordinarily successful, cult of presidential personality.
Not that youd know it in downtown Zurich. Across from the Baur au Lac hotel, last known residence of the Fifa Six, the only notable change from the everyday is the powerful stench of horse manure from the nearby zoo (oddly enough this isnt actually a metaphor). In true Swiss fashion, the arrest on corruption charges of six Fifa officials on Wednesday morning  surely the first time, even here, a hotel concierge has been heard informing one of his VIP guests, Sir, were going to need you to come to your door and open it for us or were going to have to kick it in  has left little mark on the city.
Nobody cares, says Atter Quereshi, a taxi driver. Switzerland is a very business-oriented country and in business you have to lubricate deals. It is a private company. They can do whatever they like. People here they dont even care what the Swiss president does. They dont give a shit. People see celebrities, they dont even look at them. Tina Turner can go shopping and no one will bother her. Good news, then, for Tina Turner. And perhaps some comfort for Blatter who, inside the Hallenstadion, was preparing for what had suddenly become a slightly desperate presidential hustings speech. Fridays vote looks, if not quite neck and neck, then at least like an actual vote. No wonder Blatter looked a little beleaguered.
The last time Fifa held its congress in Switzerland , Grace Jones could be seen cavorting about the stage in a conical purple hat, draping herself across assorted glazed and baffled octogenarian glad-handers, and demanding to know if her audience was ready to party? This time there is no Grace, there is no party, but there is, unexpectedly, an actual election to be fought, possibly even an unexpected moment of crisis.
The first real note of shifting sands had come with the morning announcement that Blatter would be convening a meeting of Fifas emergency committee, only slightly hindered by the fact that two of the invited were unable to attend because they had been arrested on charges relating to racketeering and fraud. Still, neer mend, eh?
Before long, the emergency became clear. This was a biggie. Without warning Michel Platini, the head of Uefa, who has at no point challenged Blatter, or offered anything but public support, had turned. Across town in the UEFA hotel, Platini was singing like a FIFA wonk with a suitcase full of borrowed gold. The news arrived in disbelieving gobbets, like the first day of some distant RAF offensive. People have had enough, announced Platini, who had coincidentally only that very morning after years of scandal and innuendo decided he too had had enough. Platini a fellow overlord, had looked into Blatters eyes face to face, man to man and told him to do a bunk. Et tu, Michel. Et tu.
And so at the Hallenstadion, Blatter would face the wider world looking for a flicker of weakness, and a sense of something stirring within. As the parpings of Fifas official anthem died away and the flag-waving Uefa-Kinder were packed away into the wings, the moment finally arrived. And suddenly there he was, behind his plinth, world footballs own improbable 78-year-old deep-fried Humpty-Dumpty dictator. Except, this was a slightly different Blatter. Still impossibly wise and regal, gorgeously inauthentic, but this was Sad Blatter, Disappointed Blatter, Wounded Integrity Blatter. Dear Friends, he began.We are all united tonight on the opening of the 65th Fifa conference  Ah. But are we?
It is hard, even after all these years, to get a handle on Blatter. There is a theory that, while he may be the dictatorial leader of a furiously corrupt sporting fiefdom, he is himself not that way inclined. Blatter isnt in it for the money (of which he has vast amounts nonetheless). Hes in it for the kicks, the power, the oddly sensual cultish devotion. Hence his ability to stay clean by proxy, the lack of trail to his door. The FBI case will test this to the full. But here anyway, Blatter did manage to appear disappointed, humbled, saddened by the revelation  who knew!  of apparently vast corruption within the organisation he has moulded to his own image over the last 30 years.
Dear friends  the events of yesterday  a long shadow over football, Blatter went on, stressing several times that it was a tiny minority on the take. And this is certainly an interesting point of view. Not least when you consider the top table at last years Fifa congress, from which two of his own lieutenants were absent from the Hallenstadion, in police custody while Julio Don Julio Grondona, the most intimately connected with the dirty TV and marketing deals and a right-hand man in the Argentinian military junta of the late 1970s, has since died.
If this really is a minority, its hiding within plain sight of the president. What happens now will be fascinating. The suspicion that Blatter has this in hand, that a little purge now and then is no bad thing, has receded. This is a proper fight. Although quite what football might end up with remains to be seen.

The Azeri government has come under intense criticism after a controversial series of bans, arrests and a devastating fire have marred its projects to clean up the city ahead of the European Games in June.
Nine people have been arrested and an investigation launched into the widespread use of flammable plastic cladding in renovation projects on central streets designed to present a veneer of prosperity to visitors, opposition leaders said .
The shocking blaze which killed 16 people, including five children, led to the resignation of Rasim Adjalov, the head supervisor of the inaugural Games.
These events have left many residents questioning their governments dedication to prioritising its image and silencing dissent over their own welfare, as journalists are jailed and critics are silenced in the lead up to the sporting event.

New rules
Beyond its disastrous attempts to spruce up the citys buildings, Azerbaijan has also introduced a host of image-control measures.
One new rule is preventing local people from taking photos in Bakus historical Old Town. Whilst photography is not officially banned, police and security guards have been taking action to prevent locals from taking photos.
The de facto ban has left some Baku residents in despair: I was born and have grown up in this city and I am not allowed to take a picture of its most beautiful part, said 29-year-old resident Anar Gurbanov.
The unwritten rule does not seem to apply to tourists: Tourists are allowed to take photos, but citizens have to get permission from the management of the Old Town, said a security guard working in the area.
According to city regulations posted online , permission to take photographs is not needed for individuals and does not apply to the amateur (including tourists) shooting monuments in the area.

Total image control
Some critics say that the government, obsessed with how Azerbaijan is perceived by the outside world, is seeking total control over the population.
With 6,000 athletes from 50 countries participating the games offer an opportunity to raise Azerbaijans profile
The European Games are a pet project for Aliyev , who hopes the spectacle of 6,000 athletes participating from 50 countries will help to raise Azerbaijans international profile.
But controversial clean-up programmes ahead of major international events like Aliyevs are not limited to Azerbaijan. In 2010 China was accused of covering up a major health scandal during the Beijing Olympics , while in the lead up to Russias controversial Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 it was reported the city was mass killing its stray dogs , while the detention and arrest of protestors and activists intensified .
Hoping to avert traffic jams during the games, the citys traffic police have also urged that no weddings or funerals be held in the city during the month of June.

A foreign guest, treated well, will talk about the hospitality
Other games-related measures are set to disrupt the lives of Bakus residents. Starting this month some public bus routes will be cancelled until July, while others have been changed to avoid the city centre, transportation ministry spokesperson Naming Hasanov said.
A number of streets also will be closed, a decision that will inconvenience an estimated 120,000 people.
Baku residents may grumble about the changes but the emphasis on pleasing foreign visitors is the governments priority.
A foreign guest, treated well, will talk about the hospitality ... once they leave the country, said blogger Arzu Geybullayeva, a government critic. You do not have to do the same for the locals because there is nowhere they can go. And no one they can complain to.

        <title>Abderrahmane Sissako: the vanguard of African cinema</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/28/abderrahmane-sissako-africa-filmmaker-career-highlights</Link>

Of the (scandalously) few African filmmakers who have found international acclaim, Mauritanian director Abderrahmane Sissako is the best known today.
Since rising to prominence in 2002, his films  addressing globalisation, identity politics and now, most controversially, Islamic radicalism  have offered serious narratives about the realities facing Africa , told through searingly beautiful images.
His films have been Cannes hits and his most recent, Timbuktu became a much-lauded contender for best foreign film at this years Oscars .

Lessons from the Soviet Union
Born in 1961 in Mauritania , Sissako lived most of his life in Mali before travelling to Moscow to study at the Federal State Film Institute, between 1983 and 1989.
A filmmaking education he shares with the father of African cinema: Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene , Moscow offered support and training to west Africas students where its former colonial ruler France was reluctant.
For the students of the newly independent west African countries Russia extended a hand of Soviet friendship through cultural exchange, education and training. They were hoping to coax countries onto the course of communism as they negotiated new political landscapes.
The two short films that Sissako made reflecting on his time abroad are remarkable because they address, head on, the new political currents of the time.
In October (1993) and the documentary Rostov-Luanda (1998) Sissako explores the relationships African countries forged with the world beyond those with its former colonisers.
October, shot in 1993, is a dark and near-silent black-and-white film that tells the story of Idrissa, an African student, and Irina, his Russian girlfriend, and the difficulties of forming a relationship across the racial and cultural divides of the 1980s, between Mali and Moscow.
The film also shows Sissakos reverence for the great Russian filmmakers. In one scene October makes a direct reference to Andrei Tarkovskys epic Andrei Rublev (1966): Irina pricks her finger on a rose Idrissa gives her, and a single colour shot jumps out, the red of the blood a shock in the otherwise sombre film.
Africa takes on the World Bank
After Waiting for Happiness launched him onto the world stage in 2002  he won the Foreign Cineaste of the Year and the Fipresci film critics  prize at Cannes  Sissako turned his lens back to Mali and to his own family courtyard in the countrys capital.
Bamako , released in 2007  the year that Sembene died, was met with critical acclaim and Sissako was declared at the vanguard of African cinema, building on Sembenes political, realist brand of filmmaking and taking it to new audiences.
Set in an outdoor courtroom in a mud-walled compound, the Malian people are plaintiffs who accuse the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of harming their economy.
Part-improvised, part-scripted, its an attempt to give Africans their day in court  an act of symbolic justice against the forces of globalisation and neocolonialism that have ravaged the continent.
Its obviously an improbable scenario: to put on trial these two institutions that nobody can hold accountable. But thats the point. In this little courtyard we make the impossible possible, Sissako said of the film.
Daring to humanise jihadists
Related: Cannes 2014: Timbuktu review  searing fundamentalist drama
If you look at the different stories, there are different blocks, you can move them around, put them in different places. And for me, thats what cinema is.
If theres a style or approach that links Sissakos films, its his fragmentary storytelling, which allows him to broach difficult, dense and complex subjects without attempting to draw grand conclusions.
Timbuktu , released in the UK on Friday, follows this approach, interweaving the stories of residents of the ancient Malian city  in recent years wracked by violence and Islamic fundamentalism  he builds a portrait of daily life full of empathy and humanity.
Released in a climate of fear and sensational headlines following the Charlie Hebdo shootings , Isiss ongoing murderous rampage and Boko Harams brutality in northern Nigeria, Sissakos piecemeal narrative offers a different perspective on the lives of people reported in the news.
It was called the film that dares to humanise jihadists.
Sissako told the New York Times : To portray a jihadist as simply a bad guy, who does not in any way resemble me, whos completely different, thats not completely true. The jihadist is, he says, is a fragile being. And fragility is an element that can make anybody tip over into horror.
This fragility spills over into his storytelling, leaving the subject of religion and violent fundamentalism open to interpretation, and crucially, to discussion.

With Zimbabwes economy on its knees and daily life a struggle for much of the population, there is one luxury that many can still afford  laughter.
We laugh at ourselves. We laugh at funerals. We laugh even when things are not going well for us and we should be moaning and groaning, says award-winning dramatist and poet Chirikure Chirikure .
In difficult times, with unemployment rampant and poverty widespread, a new generation of comedians has emerged to entertain the masses and make light of the worsening situation.
Related: Mugabe falls: comedy memes of Zimbabwe's president go viral
Simuka Comedy  made up of Victor Mpofu, better known by his stage name Doc Vikela or simply The Doctor, Michael Kudakwashe, Samm Monro and Comic King  attract full houses to their regular shows at The Book Caf, a popular arts venue in the capital, Harare.
The young comics poke fun at anyone from the president, Robert Mugabe , and his wife, Grace, to corrupt traffic police officers, former white farmers and local celebrities.
Donning a doctors white coat and stethoscope, Mpofu dishes out doses of humour to audiences sick of hard times after 15 years of economic decline blamed on the policies of Mugabes government.
The doctor has his audience in tears of laughter as he imitates the 91-year-old president.
Zimbabweans, for all our literacy  with a 99.9995% literacy rate  we are the only country that will fail to answer a simple question: who is your former president?
For many, Mugabe, who has been in power since independence in 1980, is the only leader they have known.
Explaining the growing popularity of their shows, Mpofu said hard times have made people look for comic relief.
Things are tight and people need something to take the stress off their lives. People would rather spend their little cash laughing and drinking, he said.
Comedy fan and regular audience member Enright Tsambo agreed, noting that the drinking part of a night out was seriously limited by a lack of cash.
There is so much pain, and people find solace in looking at themselves and laughing at themselves
Obrien Mudyiwenyama
We cant afford to drink as much so some of us just buy one beer and spend an evening laughing at a comedy show, he said. It takes the stress away.
In a country where insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to a year in prison , the comedians have found a way of tackling serious issues without making direct statements, so they get away with jokes that could get ordinary citizens arrested.

Threats
Away from the comedy venues, Zimbabweans share jokes across social media such as Facebook and WhatsApp and through street theatre shows  landing some performers in trouble.
We have had several cases where people have been prosecuted for freely expressing themselves and in most cases they will just be sharing or cracking a joke, said Kumbirai Mafunda, spokesman for Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights.
He gives the example of a woman facing charges of insulting Mugabe after she sent a picture on WhatsApp purportedly showing the president in the nude; and another man who was arrested for joking that Mugabe was so old he would have a hard-time blowing up his birthday balloons during national celebrations earlier this year .

Flying in the face of such threats of arrest, another comedian Samm Monro  better known by his stage name Comrade Fatso  pokes fun at the internal feuding which has seen factions in Mugabes ruling Zanu-PF party waging bitter fights amongst themselves in the race to succeed him.
Zanu-PF is the biggest opposition to Zanu-PF and now what is (opposition leader) Morgan Tsvangirai supposed to do? Monro queried in one of his sold-out acts at the recent Harare International Arts Festival .
The University of Zimbabwe also came in for ribbing as the record holder for the fastest conferment of a doctorate, after Mugabes wife Grace was awarded a PhD three months after registering .
Monro is also among newscasters on the satirical Zambezi News, which parodies the state broadcaster , renowned for its pro-government spin.
Zambezi News bulletins, shown online on YouTube and on stage, feature characters such as the Minister of Impending Projects and the Minister of Mines, who owns a mine called Mine Mine  because its mine.
One of the countrys top production companies has also backed a new play, All Systems Out of Order, portraying the collapse of amenities such as public toilets as a symbol of the state of the country.
There is so much pain, and people find solace in looking at themselves and laughing at themselves, said theatre producer and actor Obrien Mudyiwenyama.

Rouhani clashes with Iranian clergy over women arrested for 'bad hijab'
With summer approaching, president has provoked a row with senior clerics after criticising police for enforcing a strict interpretation of dress codes

President Hassan Rouhani, who came to office in 2013 partly on the votes of young, middle-class women, knows that in the summer, hundreds or even thousands will be arrested by the morality police for bad hijab, a slack interpretation of the official dress code requiring women to cover their hair and figure even as temperatures push 40 degrees .
In his remark last year that you cant send people to heaven by the whip, the president expressed a belief that citizens should not be forced into good behaviour, and in two recent speeches he skirted the issue of hijab, provoking a critical response from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, and from senior members of the clergy.
In late April, the president told an assembly of Iranian police officers the duty of the police was solely to enforce the law. The polices job is not to enforce Islam , and furthermore, none among them can claim that their actions are sanctioned by God or the prophet [Mohammad].
Although Rouhani stopped short of mentioning the harassment of women with bad hijab , he made a break from the period of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when then police commander Morteza Ahmadi Moghaddam stressed that the philosophy at the heart of the Islamic republic was the presence of religion in society and so the police must act to ensure that this goal is met.
Rouhanis offered a different vision: Many religious issues are merely matters of individual faith, he said. Police come into the picture only when an actual lawclearly and explicitly applies. For example, during mid-day prayers, could the police enter a bank and tell the employees that they must halt all business to pray?

Rouhanis comments made a splash the next day on the front pages of many reformist papers, including Shargh, Etemad, Mardom Salari and Arman. But it wasnt long before he received a response.
Khamenei appeared just a day later before an assembly of police commanders, making it clear that enforcing Islam was the polices first priority: All work can be done in the name of God, but in your work it is most easy to see how Gods will can be done. That is because your duty is to serve the society of the Islamic republic.
A member of the editorial board at Etemad told Tehran Bureau the leader had several motives in replying to Rouhani. Firstly, he wanted to demonstrate his dominance over domestic affairs. Secondly, he wanted to show that in his view, Islam supersedes the law. And finally, he wanted to offer a kind of rebuke to Rouhani for getting out of line.
One analyst saw a connection with Aprils interim nuclear agreement with world powers at Lausanne. This disappointed many of Khameneis most ardent supporters, and they imagined that his leniency toward the west might translate to leniency in the domestic arena, which would allow Rouhani to take up reform with little resistance, she said. Khameneis immediate response is part of his efforts to assuage his anxious supporters and remind them that flexibility toward the western powers doesnt necessarily mean moderation in domestic policies .

But Khameneis intervention also opened the door for others to enter the fray. Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi, a senior Shia cleric, told another group of police commanders that Rouhanis remarks not only weakened the morale of the police but gave the green light for corrupt elements to introduce all manner of filth into society without any repercussion or response from the police.
Ayatollah Nouri Hamedani pointed out that Irans constitution came straight from Islamic criteria and that the idea the police should not enforce Islam precluded the concept of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil in society, a notion found in the Quran. Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi , chairman of the Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that chooses the supreme leader, threatened the president with serious consequences: The executive branch cannot deny Islam; it must uphold it. If it denies Islam, Islam will deny it in turn.
Mohsen Kadivar, visiting professor in Islamic philosophy at Duke university, North Carolina, and an influential reformist thinker of the 1990s and 2000s, said that Rouhani had expressed basic principles that were fundamental to all modern states.
Managing the nation on the basis of law is the cornerstone of the contemporary nation-state system, so to negate that in any way is to invite chaos, he said. The announcement by the supreme leader and a few other marjas [leading clerics] that the police and everyone else should uphold Islam is a denial of the fundamentals of law, an agent of disorder, and a rejection of the rule of law.
Kadivar said the arguments of those criticising Rouhani were incompatible with the multiple interpretation of sacred texts in all religions. For example, different jurists and muftis will put forth various, sometimes conflicting fatwas. On which fatwa should the police or any other agents of the state rely when enforcing Islam?
Related: Iran's morality police: patrolling the streets by stealth
Neither did the problems end there. If judges and police forego the law and act on fatwas, we will find ourselves back to the days of 100 years ago, when Iranians went to the streets to demand a constitution. According to the constitution of the Islamic republic, the law is decided upon solely by the parliament. The Guardian Council [a constitutional watchdog], whose members are [partly] selected by the supreme leader, is tasked with making sure laws passed in parliament conform to the decrees of Islam. Therefore, laws in the Islamic republic are passed under the supervision of appointees of the supreme leader, so there is no conflict with the supposed need to uphold Islam.
Despite all criticism he faced, Rouhani returned to the issue of bad hijab and law enforcement in a speech on 4 May before a group of teachers, in which he said that Colt- and handcuff-toting agents of the regime should not be expected to act as religious scholars.

In the Tandis luxury shopping centre, north Tehran, a young woman named Maryam told Tehran Bureau that Rouhanis campaign was important to her. Sir, madam, what right do you have to say whether my hijab is proper or improper?? Can you show me the hijab-o-meter they issued you when you took this job? Where in the Islamic texts does it say that in 21st century Tajrish [quarter of north Tehran] theres a girl with bad hijab whose offences to Islam must be stopped?
Related: Iranian fashion: between the veils
Rouhani must do the right thing and stand by his word. He has to stick up for our rights and not allow these brutes with guns and badges to insult us and have their way with us. Most of them havent even finished tenth grade? Where do they come off insulting and arresting someone with a masters degree in front of everyone?
At this months recent Tehran International Book Fair, vans of morality police flanked the entrance to the book fair as had been promised by police spokesman Montazer Almahdi at a press conference. Essentially the morality patrols are for protecting the dignity of men and women and act as a kind of hijab for the society of the Islamic Republic, he insisted.
Mahtab, a woman at the fair in conservative attire, said the situation was ridiculous.
Im a religious person myself - I prefer to wear the hijab - but who said you have to force everyone else to wear it? Some people dont want to wear it. What does it have to do with you? Why dont they respect the law? Who said its their duty to force everyone into heaven?
The conflict over whether or not people should be dragged into heaven is set to continue.
Rouhani is testing the limits of his power to forbid the police from visiting violence upon our people, a member of the banned reformist party Participation Front told Tehran Bureau. Restricting morality patrols is the beginning of Rouhanis project for gradually extracting Islamic ideology from the practice of law. Just what he is willing to sacrifice for this project remains to be seen.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov is starring in two films  one a Hollywood thriller featuring the camouflage-clad hero firing a machine gun into the sky and the other a sombre documentary accusing him of human rights abuses.
The upcoming feature, which Kadyrov announced on his personal Instagram page today, is to be called Whoever Doesnt Understand Will Get It.
Its a hard-hitting piece in which, after lengthy negotiations, I have agreed to play the role of the main hero.  The director is the author of famous Hollywood films, Kadyrov wrote on Instagram. The trailer announces that the movie will be shown in cinemas across Russia .
A series of scandals in recent months have propelled Kadyrov to the forefront of Russian politics. The Chechen strongman appears to answer only to Vladimir Putin, to whom he frequently and publicly expresses his adoration.
He is being portrayed less flatteringly in a short documentary financed by former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky , which alleges widespread human rights violations in Chechnya and accuses Kadyrov of having a personal army of up to 80,000 fighters and skimming off huge quantities of federal funds.
The film, which Khodorkovsky said was the reason behind police raids on the offices of his Open Russia Foundation last month, catalogued abuses in Chechnya and featured interviews with prominent Russian journalists, NGO workers and political analysts.
Open Russias documentary
This is a person that has made Chechnya into his own feudal domain, Khodorkovsky said in the film, entitled Family.
The 26-minute documentary also catalogues beatings and murders reportedly linked to Chechen security forces and alleges that every Chechen is forced to make a contribution to a personal fund from which Kadyrov buys expensive presents and pays foreign celebrity visitors.
The movie shows old television interviews where Putin describes Kadyrov as a son and Kadyrov, with tears in his eyes, pledges his allegiance to the Russian president.

Facing death threats and streams of abusive messages, some Russians are becoming increasingly targeted by rising levels of online vitriol.
Trolling and internet abuse is a global problem, but each of these stories reveals how for some people working in Russia the digital sphere has become increasingly pernicious, with some saying it has become particularly bad since the annexation of Crimea .
Russian magazine Afisha asked four prominent figures  a lawyer, a former US ambassador to Russia , an activist and a journalist  about how they deal with regular aggression and harassment online.
Karina Orlova, radio host, Echo of Moscow :
The threats started last January after I recorded a show with journalist Maxim Shevchenko about the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo . We discussed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrovs reaction to a tweet by opposition activist Mikhail Khodorkovsky, where he had called on journalists to reprint the Mohammed cartoons, to show terrorists that western society doesnt fear them.
Kadyrov had called Khodorkovsky his personal enemy, and had threatened him.
I asked Shevchenko how Kadyrov could threaten a public figure with violence, and he said that Kadyrov is one of the finest men around. But I didnt leave it at that, and I pressed him further.
The very next day, I got my first threat on Facebook . It was waiting in the folder marked Other. I opened the message, read it, and deleted it.
Then I started getting messages regularly  and not just Ill get you, bitch, but detailed, thought-out threats.
For two months I didnt dwell on it: I thought it was the cost of working at Echo of Moscow  its the liberal media, and theres such an atmosphere of hatred in Russia these days.
Then opposition activist Boris Nemtsov was murdered, and I got another three death threats in early March. Suddenly, I realised that my life could be in real danger.
Before Nemtsovs murder, I treated the threats like white noise.
I spent a month in the United States where people would ask what is was like in Russia and Id say Oh well, theyre accusing us of being a fifth column, traitors to the nation, and I get threats in the mail. People were astonished.
The police opened a case into the threats against me on 26 March, after I spent a week talking to investigators. In all that time, the authorities never even asked me for my Facebook password.
I left a week later and I have no plans to return anytime soon.
We were dead men walking
Oleg Khabibrakhmanov, lawyer, Committee Against Torture
When you work in Chechnya and the republics chief of police says openly: Guys, I can no longer guarantee your safety, this, it seems to me, is an outright threat.
Our joint mobile team started operating there in 2009, after the death of journalist Natalia Estemirova  we took on the cases she had been investigating.
But our colleagues in Chechnya immediately made it clear that we were dead men walking. They didnt want to speak to us publicly. It was a nervous time, to put it mildly.
Of course, we tried to minimise the risks but no amount of iron doors, armoured vehicles or bulletproof vests will help if they really want to get to you.
In December last year, everything came apart.
We had written a letter to the attorney general asking him to look into the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov for illegal activity.
Persecution followed: the arson of our office, and attacks in the media  even the local human rights activists whod called us their colleagues suddenly spoke out sharply against us.
The most insulting thing is when the locals dont support us.When our office was burned down in Grozny, our neighbours only berated us with demands that we pay them to back for the damage.
Or, people write to me on Facebook to say things like: withdraw your troops from independent Chechnya, and well deal with Ramzan ourselves!
How do I find the strength? I dont know. Im certain that what I am doing is truly important: refusing to let Russia slip into totalitarianism and waging a war against the violation of human rights.
So I can say that despite the abuse, I honestly do enjoy my work.
We did investigate threats when I was ambassador, we took it very seriously, as did the Russian government.
One of the people who follows me confessed that he is paid to say nasty things: he said in a direct message to me  just so you know I personally admire you, but this is what I am paid to do. I took a photo of the message, and will release it someday.
There is no doubt that these attacks induce self-censorship. They want to chase me away from debates on Twitter . They are succeeding.
Occasionally they threaten my children

Michael McFaul, professor of political science, former US ambassador to Russia:
Online abuse has got much worse since the annexation of Crimea : the Russian-language debates on Twitter are much more personal.
Sometimes its just a few very unpleasant tweets. Sometimes its hundreds of Twitter messages saying the same thing, as if they are coordinated.
Occasionally people send threatening tweets to me about my physical security, they even threaten my children.
Ive moved back to the US to teach at Stanford University and its only got worse.
Now I have a policy that if someone insults me personally, I block them. If they say youre against free speech my response is you have the right to say whatever you want, but I have the right to read whatever I want.
If the Russian president wanted to reduce the hatred on Twitter, it would take him five minutes. I believe if he said something critical about this kind of activity it would have a giant effect.
The hatred and pain will pass
Rights activist Lena Klimova. Photograph: Screenshot/Facebook
Lena Klimova, LGBT activist, Children-404 :
I cant remember the first time someone wrote to insult me. It was probably in early 2013, when I was writing for [the news agency] Rosbalt. Readers commented beneath the article, or they found me on social networks: they told me I was a smart girl or dumb whore  I remember feeling hurt and confused.
But after I started running Children-404, an LGBT campaign group, I had to get used to it. After hearing the same words over and over for several years, they lose their meaning. Right now, Im attacked up to three times a day.
Ive been attacked by my own people too.
A lesbian once approached me and claimed that the authorities approved the anti-gay law (in 2013) because of my awareness-raising project Children-404. She said it used to be OK before, but now she cant even hold her girlfriends hand while walking down the street  and she blames me and other activists for this.
Recently I created a photo album  beautiful people and what they say about me  collecting threats I received online.
I would look at the photos of the people who had written terrible things about me, marvelling at the disparity between their appearance and their words. I made the album so others could enjoy the contrast.
If you find yourself confronted by hatred and in pain, its vital to remember that it will pass. It hurts at first, but then you move on. The main thing is not to become too cold. Just take the abuse and the praise as it comes. Do your thing and dont listen to anyone.

This rock is a dragon, left here before the last great war.
Look at the top of the cliff. We call that rock Ferdowsi, as it looks from afar like the great poet.
Locals have stories for the rocks and cliffs that resemble birds, animals or mythical creatures. We grew up with our grandparents taking us on long walks and telling us about the rocks, says Ali Hormuzi, a 44-year-old resident.
Colourful mountains in shades of pink, red, purple and yellow overlook shorelines where turtles and flamingos roam or sunbathe.
This is Hormuz island in the Persian Gulf , the mostly forgotten land of colours in the Strait of Hormuz, 5km from the mainland, and southeast of Bandar Abbas, major port and capital of the province of Hormuzgan. The island was visited among others by Marco Polo. Ibn Battuta who came twice between 1330 and 1340, wrote that the islands city was fine and large...with magnificent bazaars.

The island was once settled by tens of thousands but its population has fallen below 10,000. Many have been unemployed since relations with Oman , an important trading partner, soured during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013).
Before, most men on the island were involved in trade with Khasab, a coastal city in Oman, says Ali. We would go in the morning and come back at night, never leaving the special reserved area for Iranians. I never saw the rest of Khasab despite going there for years. We just werent allowed in.

Locals would bring goods back to Hormuz, and then sell to traders in Bandar Abbas and Qeshm, a neighbouring Iranian island. Technically, it was smuggling, since it was all done under the rug, Ali explains.
Ali has worked hard to make ends meet since trading with Oman declined. Smuggling, qhachagh, is a word you hear all over the Persian Gulf islands, including Qeshm, from where I have travelled the 60km to Hormuz.
In some ways the islands are distinct from the rest of Iran . The wind-catchers  long, rectangular structures that cause airflow from the cooler undergrounds to the main rooms  in old homes are even more intricate than those found in Yazd, in the central desert. The cats resemble Siamese cats more than any feline you will find in Tehran, Isfahan or other mainland cities: one can only imagine they arrived on trade ships.
Unlike many parts of the country where women have shed traditional regional attire, the women of Qeshm and Hormuz mostly wear the colourful bandari pants, loose at the top and tight at the bottom with vibrant embroidery. A loose cotton chador with rich, bright flower patterns covers their heads.

But despite deep trade and cultural ties to India and Pakistan, locals know themselves to be Iranian first and foremost. Rice is cooked the particular Iranian way, steamed and then crisped at the bottom and along the edges - tahdig.
Local cuisine, especially on Qeshm, which sees most tourists, is plentiful and delicious, with seafood offered once the sun sets and residents get out by the water. Octopus, fish and shrimps are sauted with onions, tomatoes and local spices, and put into a sandwich with pickled cucumbers and cabbage. A local mix of ten spices and herbs including turmeric, cloves, dried rose petals and cinnamon makes meals exemplary.
In recent years, with the absence of hotels across the islands, people have begun turning their homes into restaurants and hostels. The most famous is nakhoda (captain) Amini, a sailor turned restaurateur in Tabl village , on Qeshm island. He has a dozen rooms, and theirs is a family business: his wife cooks, he manages, the children and grandchildren take care of affairs.
Guests are given a notebook to sign, and captain Amini says he now has a sack full of them, and plans to publish a book on his 20 years in the business. There are notes by people from as far away as Australia and Germany, and there is a family from Spain staying in the room next to me.
Traditionally, homes on the islands were all built with wind-catchers. But today, on Qeshm, Loft village is the only place where they can be found. Following an earthquake in 2005, the houses were rebuilt with cement and air-conditioning. Its an archaeological artefact, a woman tells me, pointing to her wind-catcher.
Lotf village is also known for its view of the Persian Gulf, and as we walk the village in the late afternoon, at least a dozen European tourists are waiting on a hill to watch the sunset. Where are the Iranians? I ask a resident. In the shopping malls, he answers.
With sanctions against Iran , smuggling has supplied the Dubai-style malls sprouting up. Most of the merchandise came that way, a storeowner in Qeshm city centre tells me.
Qeshm was declared a free trade zone under the presidency of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-1997), following a boom in Kish, another island in the province. The quest to create a business-friendly environment around glitzy island resorts in the Persian Gulf began under the Shah. After he built a villa on Kish, his regular trips were well publicised and led to the establishment of the Development Organisation of Kish.
Whole villages were razed to make way for large-scale projects. Following the 1979 Revolution and end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, the vision was carried forward despite tight economic sanctions. There are now many Iranian free trade zones including not just Kish and Qeshm but Chabahar in Sistan-Baluchistan province and most recently Arvand in Khuzestan.
What makes Qeshm different from Kish, known throughout Iran as a shoppers haven, is that many locals own stores and malls. But while locals that are savvy enough to jump ship can prosper, those wedded to the traditional pastoral life are pushed into deep poverty. In Kish, locals live in almost slum-like conditions beyond the high rises and shopping malls.
Naeem, an acquaintance in Qeshm, has been smuggling fuels like petrol to Dubai since he was 14. Its been lucrative, he tells me. I have a house, a car, and will be fully paying for my own wedding next week. Weddings on the island are seven-day affairs where the entire village is fed many times, so paying for ones own at 25 years of age is an achievement.
From 2014 to 2015, the number of petrol smugglers has dwindled. The profit used to be threefold, says Naeem, who is trying to get into tourism, while still transporting cargoes of clothing and foodstuffs from time to time. In summer of 2014, Naeem counted more than 100 petrol smugglers in one day. In 2015, I see less than half a dozen on the same road. The guards have cracked down hard, he says.
Toyota Hilux pickup trucks are invariably used, and as we drive along the coast, Naeem points out one after another: smuggling clothes, gas. On Naz island, off the coast of Qeshm, he takes a childs shirt from the water and puts it in the back of his pickup. Its brand new, thats alarming. Sometimes smuggling ships have to dump their load if they notice guards coming close. Ill take it to show the rest of the boys in the village, they have to be careful these days.

The veil
The origin of the Tuaregs trademark blue allichu veil is open to debate. In addition to giving protection from dust whipped up by desert winds, the veils are believed to prevent bad spirits from entering the body. The dye bleeds freely onto the skin, giving the wearer a blue-grey complexion

Both the cloth and the dye for the allichu veil come from Nigeria, and merchants in camel caravans travel a thousand miles south to the Nigerian towns of Tano and Sokoto to trade. A round trip can take six months, and for accompanying boys  some as young as ten  this is an important rite of passage. In times of peak trade in the 1920s and 1930s, the caravans had up to 20,000 camels

        <title>'Sorry mum, I’m still gay': Russian club helps parents accept sexual preference</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/russia-gay-rights-parents-group-lgbt</Link>

The parents club has a few rules: you can only speak if youre holding the navy dragon, a soft toy that has grown shabby in the clubs four-year existence; no interrupting is allowed; and phones must be switched off.
In an unassuming building in the centre of St Petersburg, families of Russian gay men and women gather each month, hoping for understanding and reconciliation.
Although the group is ostensibly for parents, they are far outnumbered by sons and daughters who have faced the difficulties of coming out in a homophobic country. Not one father is present.
Mum fell seriously ill recently and she allowed me to care for her, says Sergei. At least she didnt yell at me, like before: Stop that, [you] gay, get away from me, dont touch my things!
Seventeen people sit in the circle listening to him, wearing badges with handwritten names. Now that mum is no longer rejecting me, it means that she [has started to] care again, Sergei continues. For now though, he doesnt speak to his mother often.
Nina, a club veteran, asks for the dragon. She believes that, whatever the circumstances, talking helps: You have to explain to [your parents] that homosexuals are not the people they [are made out to be] on television. It will take them a long time to grasp what is going on. Everyone loves their kids, they will all understand.
Others immediately pipe up, recounting stories of parents who drove their children out of the house and sent them to be cured of their sexuality. Ok, not all, most, Nina corrects herself.
At these meetings, parents are encouraged to ask questions. A few people recommend films on LGBT themes, others yet to come out to their families ask the mothers in the group how best to go about it, and whether, in fact, it is worth it.

Only towards the end of the meeting does the toy dragon arrive in the hands of Sasha, a new arrival in St Petersburg.
I lived for a long time in a small village. There, the word gay is horrific, you can be grabbed on the street and killed for it, he said. All my relatives are old-fashioned types. I fear that if I tell my mum, she will blame herself. Did you go through this?
The group tells him that coming out in a small town is often more difficult.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993 after the fall of the Soviet Union, but rights groups say the situation for Russias gay population has become more dangerous.
In 2014 Human Rights Watch released a report documenting a rise in homophobic rhetoric and violence in Russia. It blamed a law passed in 2013 banning the promotion of non-traditional lifestyles among minors.
Its in this climate of fear that the mothers and their children meet. After two-and-a-half hours, they wrap up. One woman looks out of the window onto the street and says quietly: I dont want to go back out there.

Elena: Its not a death sentence
Elena became an activist out of the belief that the parents of LGBT children can find it helpful to talk to people who have been in the same boat.
Five years ago her son Dmitry came back from Japan, where he had been living for the past decade. She sensed instantly that he was troubled, but put it down to the difficulties of adapting to life back in Russia .
When Dmitry began his coming out talk with the words I want you to listen to me but this might frighten you, she says the possibility that her son might be gay had never occurred to her.
After our conversation, it was horrible, recalls Elena. It seemed that I was the only mother this had happened to. I tried not to show him how upset I was.
But I was brought to my senses and comforted by something Dmitry said: Now I feel much happier than when I was pretending.
Dmitry took her to a meeting of the parents club a year after coming out. She expected her son to lead her into a basement where gays live, she says, and when I saw that no one was dancing in tights, just decent people sitting around, I was quite surprised, she adds. Elena quickly became a club activist and she now helps other parents to accept their LGBT children.
They usually come to us with horror in their eyes. They look as if a tragedy has befallen their family. We ask them to relax and take a look at us: do we look downtrodden? Being a parent of an LGBT child  its not a death sentence, you can live with it quite happily.
Acceptance can take months, if not years, she says. But if parents keep coming to the club, they always make progress. You see mothers picking themselves up, smiling, being prepared to discuss the situation  that is already a good sign.
The mothers from the club believe that the problems with acceptance lie not with them, but with Russian society as a whole: if gay people are constantly being abused on television, why should someone suddenly believe a handful of people who take a different view?
Marina: The shock lasted 10 days
After the coming out blows your mind, the world as it was crumbles away, together with your plans for your childs future, says Marina Melnik, the founder of parents club: her son Roman told her he was gay six years ago. Every parent in that position goes through five stages of acceptance, she explains. In her case the shock lasted 10 days. Then came denial. Thats when you try to change their mind and prove that its all in their head.
She says it was painful process: I blamed myself for a long time. Did I not love him enough or did I love him too much? When he was a kid, maybe I bought him the wrong toy, an animal, not a car.
I was scared to tell the people around me that my son was gay. It was like that for almost a year
Marina
Six months after her sons admission, Marina became an activist. She founded the club with other mothers she met at an LGBT film festival, Side by Side . Four people came to the first meeting, she remembers, and none of them knew how to deal with their feelings of guilt.
After talking to other mothers, it finally came to me, Marina says. Thats when she went through the last stage, acceptance, followed by her own coming out of sorts: I was scared to tell the people around me [that my son was gay], she remembers. It was like that for almost a year.

Igor: No one talked about gay people
Igor finally managed to bring his mother to the club two years after coming out. Until then, talking to her about anything LGBT-related was difficult, he says.
No one talked about gay people in our family. Mum used the word blues (Russian slang for homosexual) and dad, fags, Igor recalls. He describes his parents as people with differing views: his dad is an orthodox patriot whose favourite political writer is Gregory Klimov , author of the aphorism: If all is not right between the legs, all is not right between the ears. His mother, on the other hand, isuninterested in politics and more liberal, in a cultural sense, he says.
When I was little, I asked my mum what sexual orientation was. Whos blue and whos not, she replied. At 11, he picked up from family conversations that gays were perverts who practise anal sex.
In September 2007, Igor left his native village in the Pskov region to go and study in St Petersburg and in October, he returned to visit his parents. Youre nervous about something, have you fallen in love? his mother asked him. Yes Igor answered, truthfully. With a man or a woman? she probed. With a man, as it turned out. Both of them cried but they soon calmed down and a week later, Igor went back to St Petersburg. It was not long before his father heard the news.
Dad was breaking dishes, slamming doors, Igor says.
Igor told a priest in confession that he was in love with a young man and was advised to cure the sickness in his soul and repent: but Igor argued back. Officially, he absolved me of my sins but we were both clearly dissatisfied with the outcome. It was after this I lost faith in the church. That was my last communion and confession and I am feeling all right, he laughs.
Igor is convinced that if his mother watched less television, lived with him in St Petersburg and talked to other parents from the club, she would soon accept him fully. No precise statistics exist, but the clubs activists believe that for every LGBT person accepted by their family, another five are rejected.
Dmitry: Sorry mum, but Im still gay
Dmitry is one of these five. He first came out when he was 18. Assuming that everything would go smoothly, he didnt prepare for the conversation. At first, his mother reacted calmly but a few hours later, she started to cry.
She shouted about HIV and how I would never have children, he remembers. From then on, Dmitry decided not to talk to his mother about his personal life. Gradually, she seemed to forget about her sons sexuality and their relationship improved.
But Dmitry couldnt rid himself of the feeling that his mother didnt understand him. So three years later, he decided to try again. He prepared better this time, taking brochures from the LGBT group. But his opening gambit  Sorry mum, but Im still gay  set off another argument.

Unsure of what to do next, he went to the parents club, where he was advised to show his mother the film Prayers for Bobby , about a gay man who kills himself because his religious parents refused to accept him.
I watched it myself first and cried, it was so painful, Dmitry says. Then I watched it with mum but I didnt understand her reaction. The parents lost their son, she said, because they didnt believe in God or pray enough.
Religious icons soon started appearing in their flat, together with images of the Virgin Mary, Orthodox magazines and brochures about monasteries. They hadnt spoken to each other for a long time, Dmitry says, and it was clear his mother had decided the Church was the only way to save him.
I arrived home one day and could already smell burning incense from the hallway, he says. What was the point, I asked her. In reply, she talked of evil influences, clouding of souls and false paths. Our flat started to resemble a church gift shop. The arguments grew more frequent and after one such bust-up, his mother decided to move to a friends.

Dmitry will not try his luck a third time. He tells his mother that he has a girlfriend, despite seeing his partner Grigory for over two years now.
It takes a lot of energy to live a double life: when Dmitrys mother calls him and asks him about his personal life, he answers truthfully  but substitutes the name Grigory with Irina.
Parents club dont approve of stories like mine. They suggested I bring my mother along but Im scared of what her reaction would be, says Dmitry. If she believes that religion helped me, so be it. The main thing is that mum is happy.

Why did the Taliban go to Tehran?
In the fight against Isis, the Taliban has softened its approach toward Iran and Shia groups, says veteran Afghan journalist

Reports of an official Taliban delegations clandestine visit to Iran this week raised eyebrows in both Kabul and Tehran: why would Iran, a Shia powerhouse involved in proxy wars with several Sunni states and sectarian groups in the Middle East, host a radical Sunni militant group on its soil?
The two erstwhile foes once came to the brink of a full-blown war against each other. However, when it comes to regional politicking the two have found much in common, including their fear of the spread of the Islamic State influence in the region.
In 1998, Tehran deployed more than 70,000 forces along the Afghan border in a clear show of military might and threatened to invade Afghanistan and avenge the deaths of at least eight Iranian diplomats at the hands of Taliban in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif that year. Iranian generals predicted they would topple the Taliban regime within 24 hours, but the situation was defused when the United Nations interfered.
Then, when the US-led coalition forces ousted the Taliban in late 2001 for harboring Osama bin Laden , the mastermind of attacks on 11 September 2001, Iran tacitly supported the operation.
However, more than a decade later, the two archrivals seem to be willing to coexist in the face of the growing threat posed by Isis. This dovetails with another shared goal: pushing the United States and its western allies out of Afghanistan.
While Tehran may not wish to see a return of a Taliban government on its eastern border, Iranian officials would not have a problem seeing the Taliban becoming part of the current western-backed Kabul administration through a much-awaited reconciliation.
Related: The price of an education for Afghan refugees in Iran
It is for this reason that a delegation of Taliban, led by Mohammad Tayyab Agha, visited Iran on Monday and held talks with Iranian leaders. While officials in Tehran denied the visit , Iranian newspapers and Taliban confirmed that the delegation was comprised of Taliban members from their political bureau in Qatar. A Taliban statement said that the delegation discussed a number of issues with Iranian officials, including the current situation in Afghanistan, regional and Islamic world issues, and the condition of Afghan refugees in Iran.
Mondays visit was not the first time a Taliban delegation has visited Iran. They have already been to the country twice. Two years ago, they even attended an Islamic vigilance conference hosted by Iran , according to state media reports.
Given the ideological differences between the two, this tepid friendship between Iran and the Taliban can be explained through regional rivalries and the emergence of Isis in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Isis leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi has proclaimed himself as a Caliph of all Muslims, the same title that the one-eyed Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, claimed nearly two decades ago.
Since last fall, the Taliban and a small number of militants have pledged their allegiance to al Baghdadi and raised black Isis flags during several armed skirmishes inside Afghanistan. Although the Taliban themselves repeatedly targeted civilians in the past, its spokesmen have condemned Isis for carrying out a deadly attack in eastern Afghanistan last month that left at least 35 people dead.
Although both groups rival one another in brutal attacks, the Taliban has called on Isis to avoid extremism in their war in the Middle East, a plea that al Baghdadi mocked. He reportedly called Mullah Omar a fool and illiterate warlord undeserving of a religious title.
Similarly, Iran has been fighting Isis forces through its militia groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen . Tehran has reportedly sent more than 1,000 military advisers to Iraq, conducted airstrikes against Isis targets, and has spent more than $1b dollars in military aid to Iraq. The last thing Tehran wants is an Isis presence inside Afghanistan, from where the militants could attack targets inside Iran.

An Iran-Taliban alliance would not only serve as deterrence vis--vis Isis, it could also act as a bargaining chip in Tehrans relations with the new government in Kabul, whose recent signals of support for Saudi Arabias military strikes against Shia factions in Yemen did not go unnoticed. Supporting a fundamental Sunni group could also show that Tehran is not in an all-out-war against Sunni Muslims.
Sectarian violence
During the Taliban regime in the late 1990s, they were accused of ethnic cleansing by massacring Hazaras, a Shia minority ethnic group in Afghanistan, and of burning their villages as they advanced towards northern regions of the country. However, since its ouster, the Taliban has largely avoided sectarian and ethnic undertones in their narratives.
In fact, the Taliban have recently publicly condemned sectarian violence against Shia. When five civilians were reportedly kidnapped and killed in a central region of the country on 17 April, the local officials blamed the Taliban for the killing. However, a Taliban statement rejected the claim a day later, saying the Kabul administration and certain media were stoking sectarian violence. It said the Taliban militants on the ground had tried to find and rescue our Hazara countrymen, but they were killed before they succeeded.
Additionally, when 31 Hazara passengers were kidnapped on Kabul-Kandahar highway earlier this year (19 were released in an apparent prisoner swap later) the Taliban vehemently denied being behind the abduction. A Taliban statement last month even said that their militants diverted a convoy of Hazaras to protect them from crossfire between their fighters and government forces in the southern region.
Although it is difficult to prove that the recent spate of attacks against Hazaras and Shia are the work of Isis associates or Taliban splinter groups operating without the orders of their leadership, the Talibans public positions on the events are noteworthy.
In past months, the Taliban appears to be softening its formerly hostile position towards both Iran and Shia minorities.
When a Saudi Arabia-led coalition began airstrikes against the Houthis, an Iran-backed Shia group in Yemen, in late March, most Sunni Islamic states, including the Afghan government , supported the operation. Hezi Islami, an insurgent group led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar that has separately waged war against the Kabul administration, not only supported intervention, but showed readiness to send fighters in support of the Saudi-led operation. However, despite Saudi Arabia being one of the three countries that formally recognized the Taliban regime in 1990s, the Taliban has yet to declare its official position regarding the war in Yemen.
While a public show of cooperation is new for Iran and the Taliban, the two have covertly cooperated in the past. In 2007, Afghan border police officials in the western province of Herat showed this reporter confiscated land mines with clear Iranian trademarks intended for the Taliban in Afghanistan. They blamed Iran for training Taliban near the Iranian holy city of Mashhad .
The same year, Nato officials accused Iran of supplying Taliban with armor-piercing bombs, or explosively formed projectiles, the same weapons that Iran was accused of providing to Iraqi insurgents fighting against US forces. Both sides denied the allegations.
The public rapprochements concerning Iran-Taliban relations proves one thing: when faced with a common enemy  in this case Isis  even archrivals like Iran and the Taliban, which ascribe to opposing radical ideologies, can put aside their sectarian differences for the sake of national and group interests.

The little-seen older brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has surfaced in London, attending concerts by Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall.
A man identified as Kim Jong-chul was filmed by Japanese TV crews at the guitarists concert on Thursday evening.
Broadcaster TBS filmed Kim , wearing dark sunglasses and clad in a leather jacket, getting out of a people carrier outside the central London venue, flanked by suited men who appeared to be North Korean officials.
More TBS footage shows the 33-year-old applauding in the crowd and then leaving the venue via a corridor. How was the concert? asked the TBS reporter, in response to which one of Kims entourage places a hand over the camera lens.
The NK News website cited an anonymous source who said Kim saw Clapton play on both Wednesday and Thursday, sitting near the stage.
He wasnt so distinctive, NK News quoted the source as saying. But the obviously older guy next to him was clearly neither a typical Clapton fan or dressed for a gig.
According to NK News, Japanese and South Korean media learned of Kims appearance at the Wednesday concert and so arrived in force the next day.
South Korean diplomats in London confirmed that the concert-goer was indeed Kim Jong-chul, and that the fervent Clapton fan had attended the concert on both nights.
The diplomats said he had been given substantial support by the North Korean embassy in London, who organised transport to and from the Royal Albert Hall, but the leaders brother had stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, rather than at the embassy in a semi-detached house in Ealing .
Kim Jong-chul is the middle of the three sons of North Koreas late leader, Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011. The eldest of the trio, Kim Jong-nam, 44, who has a different mother to the other siblings, was seen as most likely to succeed as leader before an incident in 2001 when he tried to enter Japan on a false passport, supposedly to visit Disneyland.
While Kim Jong-chul has previously held some mid-level official positions, he has kept a low profile under the rule of his younger brother.
North Korea is officially run on a highly nationalistic and insular philosophy of self-reliance, known as juche. But top-ranking citizens have previously shown a taste for foreign culture. Kim Jong-il was well know for his love of foreign cuisine and US cinema, while his youngest son is a basketball fan who has repeatedly met former NBA star Dennis Rodman .
According to the Financial Times in 2008 , North Korea had formally invited Clapton to play in the country. The overtures reportedly followed a concert in Pyongyang by the New York Philharmonic.

At least 100 women were brutally attacked in the South Kivu province of Congo last week  yet another atrocity amid more than a decade of sexual violence that has earned the region the title rape capital of the world.
Many of the victims are being treated at a free hospital run by Denis Mukwege, a leading Congolese gynaecologist and rights activist who has been working in the region for the past 18 years. His Panzi hospital is in Bukavu, the epicentre of the ongoing conflict .
This type of violence has little to do with sex and much more with power through a sort of terrorism
Denis Mukwege
In a region critically lacking basic healthcare, Mukwege, an expert in reconstructive surgeries for rape victims, has saved the lives of more than 40,000 women  the majority of them victims of brutal gang rapes by soldiers and militias that started during the second Congo war in 1998, and have continued to the present day.
In 2014 Mukwege was the recipient of the EUs highest human rights award, the Sakharov Prize .
Having treated women at different thresholds of psychological and physical suffering, Mukwege has been a prime witness to rape used as a weapon of war.
It is a method of torture. It is a way to terrorise the population. When I see some of the injuries on the women and children, I realise this type of violence has little to do with sex and much more with power through a sort of terrorism, says Mukwege.
According to a report, 48 women were raped every hour in Congo during the height of the conflict in 2006-7. Recent reports from local health centres in South Kivu claim that an estimated 40 women continue to experience sexual violence every day.
Mukwege has little doubt that rape is the monstrosity of the century.

Broken promises
The most difficult reality for us is when we help a woman give birth to a daughter, born as a result of rape, and then years later we have to treat the daughter who is also raped. These are very difficult and painful moments for the whole medical team, explains Mukwege.
This year on 8 March, the UN commemorated 20 years of the Beijing Declaration, still deemed the most progressive blueprint for advancing womens rights across the world. The event also marked the beginning of a new platform for action, called Beijing +20. However, despite politicians reconvening to renew commitments to gender equality, most states have fallen woefully short of promises made in 1995.
The International Federation of Human Rights reports that due to ineffective domestic laws and weak international conventions, rape and other crimes of sexual violence continue to be committed on a massive scale, particularly in conflict situations. The report cites Congo as a prime example of colossal and continued failure to protect.
For most Congolese women, reporting rape is unthinkable. Aside from social stigmatisation of victims, going to a police station could put them at greater danger. Perpetual violence against women has eroded whole communities, with no effective social or legal remedies.
Mukwege insists that the domestic laws are present, they are simply not used. Many of the perpetrators occupy high-ranking positions in the government and armed forces. Not bringing them to justice has institutionalised rape.
He believes that ignorance and desensitisation have created a deep divide between the genders.
The concept of equality begins in childrens minds with the very first contact. We usually tell girls to dress a certain way and instill fear in them that if they dont, they might be attacked. But we dont tell boys about how to behave and consequences of bad behavior, he says.

Educating men
It is this dearth of medical infrastructure and collective social responsibility for the safety of women that compelled Mukwege to fight for change. An obstetrician by training, he entered the medical profession with the desire to aid the formation of life. But witnessing his first gang rape victim made him realise that there were existing lives that needed to be saved and sustained.
Alongside his medical work, he has campaigned for Congolese womens rights at national and international levels. But he believes change does not simply mean protecting women.
Movements geared towards educating men about sexual violence have emerged in recent years in Congo. Along with psycho-social support for victims of rape, Mukwege advocates help for those men who have left the armed forces, helping to reintegrate them into their communities.
Demobilisation is a psychological process that requires long-term counselling, he says.

It is obvious that when a young boy is recruited and learns to rape, kill and destroy women, we need to integrate him. Shedding the uniform does not mean that this ingrained mentality has changed, says Mukwege.
Peace in Congo, Mukwege contends, will require rehabilitating the men and reinforcing the voices of women. He has organised groups where men and boys discuss the violence that has pervaded their societies, while women gather to demand justice and reparations.
If you destroy wombs, there will be no children and no future, he says.
For Mukwege, it is simply a matter of saving the common humanity of Congo.

Ukraine fears spread of separatist conflict amid hostility towards Kiev
Attacks in Odessa and Kharkiv suggest instability is extending across the country, fuelled by rising inflation and rocketing utility prices

On a bright Sunday morning in February, Ihor Rassokha was at a pro-Ukraine rally in Kharkhiv with a friend, the local scientist Igor Tolmachov.
Suddenly there was an explosion , Rossokha recalled, sounding like a firecracker at a football match. Everyone dropped to the ground but a splinter hit Tolmachov in the heart. He managed to run a few metres before falling over.
I tried to resuscitate him although I could see the splinter sticking out of his chest, said Rassokha, who only realised his friend was dead when the ambulance crews refused to load the body. Tolmachov was one of four people, including a police officer and a 15-year-old boy, killed that day. Dozens of others were injured.

The attack, which took place on the day marked by Orthodox believers as Forgiveness Sunday, was the most deadly of dozens of similar explosions in the Ukrainian cities of Kharkhiv and Odessa in recent months.
The violence has raised fears that the instability of the separatist war, largely contained to a pocket of eastern Ukraine , is spreading across the country.
Both Odessa and Kharkhiv are deeply divided along political lines, with large numbers opposed to the government in Kiev and in favour of closer ties with Moscow. Kharkhiv has seen an influx of at least 150,000 refugees from fighting in the east and is just a few miles from the Russian border. The Black Sea port of Odessa, which has deep historical and cultural ties with its neighbour, saw over 40 pro-Moscow activists killed during street battles last May.
Attacks in the two big cities have been directed at pro-Ukraine groups and the military, with targets including the premises of volunteer organisations, bars frequented by activists, military bases, banks, railway lines and even a flagpole.
Though there have been more than 40 blasts since last autumn, only five deaths have been confirmed. The bombers, who use crude explosive devices, seem to want to avoid large loss of life. Instead, they appear intent on destabilising the fragile political situation, intimidating pro-Ukraine groups and creating an atmosphere of fear.
The frequency of attacks has fallen recently after a recent wave of arrests by Ukrainian security services. But on 13 May a bomb exploded on a railway line on the outskirts of Odessa, narrowly missing an approaching passenger train.
Sometimes you can sense the fear in the air  sometimes you feel something is coming; you feel the danger, said Kateryna Roshchyna, who works for an NGO in Kharkhiv.
Responsibility for some of the blasts has been claimed by a shadowy group calling itself the Kharkhiv Partisans, which issues statements on YouTube and appears to be based in Russia. But the identity of those behind most of the attacks is unclear.
Ukrainian security services claim to have arrested attackers and seized weapons and bomb-making equipment. They have also released videos of confessions by alleged terrorists, who say they were paid for their services.
The countrys interior minister, Arsen Avakov, has published a diary purportedly kept by a bomber in Odessa. The long and rambling text catalogues the amateur efforts of one terrorist cell, and openly discusses payments.
A 3 March entry describes the moments after one bomb was planted: Igor is nervous and talking more than usual. Zhenya is also nervous and farting. I am shaking and munching on chocolate Every second we expect the explosion and every second our hopes are fading and then: Bo-Boom. Hooray! We can relax. We havent caused significant damage, but we have shown there are people who care about the fate of Odessa.
Odessans joke that the person used to carry this bomb was given a device set to Moscow time  an hour ahead
Pro-Ukraine activists believe the terrorists are financed and organised by Moscows security services, which run training camps in Russia and the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering western Ukraine. They say attacks are orchestrated from the Kremlin-backed self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.
They want to destabilise the region and show that the authorities cannot maintain security  we are fighting with Putin and the Kremlin, said Dmitry Gumenyuk head of Odessas Maidan self-defence group. He retold a local joke about a man who is believed to have been killed when a bomb he was planting went off: Odessans joke that the person used to carry this bomb was given a device set to Moscow time  an hour ahead!

An organisation known as Oberig, has been established in Odessa to collect information on terrorists and pressure the local security services to act. Members claim that the going rate to plant a bomb is $2,000, and that 90% of pro-Russia activists work for cash.
Pro-Russia political groups have been pushed out of public life with many activists fleeing Ukraine
Instability is not only linked to the explosions. Activists also point to political initiatives apparently sponsored from Russia. A group calling itself the Bessarabian Rada , claiming to represent a historical territory encompassing much of south-west Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova, held a founding meeting in Odessa recently. Their website was registered in Russia.
Three weeks later, Ukrainian security forces arrested 20 people allegedly planning to announce the formation of a Bessarabian Republic as a political entity.
Whatever Russias role, few deny that hostility towards the government in Kiev is growing in both Odessa and Kharkhiv, fuelled by a sharp economic downturn, rising inflation and rocketing utility prices. Pro-Russia political groups have been pushed out of public life with many activists fleeing Ukraine out of fear of arrest, or assault. Posters calling on people to turn in separatists hang prominently in cities in southern and eastern Ukraine.
When people with radical opinions are not allowed to speak of course they go underground, said Artyom Buzila, a pro-Russia journalist in Odessa who was briefly detained by Ukrainian security forces last month.
No one in either Kharkhiv or Odessa think the explosions are likely to cease any time soon, pointing out that the relatively small death toll is only down to good fortune: bombs have been placed in residential areas and near gas pipes, and several were detonated in the early evening. Many draw comparisons with the sort of day-to-day terrorism associated with living in Israel.
Ukrainian poet Boris Khersonsky, whose own flat has been bombed, recounted a recent dinner with friends in Odessa. The restaurant was full when suddenly there was the sound of what was obviously an explosion two blocks away. People raised their eyes, looked around and then went back to their food. Nobody ran away, there was no panic. We have already got used to it, he said.

It appears that Pyongyang has been periscoped for the first time.
Coleen Baik, a designer who previously worked at Twitter, has been using the live video streaming tool during a trip to North Korea as part of the Women Cross DMZ peace movement .
The group of 30 women, including leading rights activist Gloria Steinem and nobel laureates Leymah Gbowe and Mairead Maguire, plan to cross from North Korea to South Korea at the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ).

But their plans appear to have hit a stumbling block as theyre yet to have formal approval from Seoul to cross back in to the South at Panmunjom  one of the most fortified borders in the world due to ongoing hostilities between the two countries .
Speaking from Pyongyang on Tuesday organiser Christine Ahn said the group may have to change the route so they cross at Kaesong, a border used by business and civilians.
We have approval from both governments to cross the DMZ, but we dont know precisely where, she said.
Korean-American peace activist Ahn says that border crossing has a symbolic value for the group who hope their march will help break the impasse and stalemate between the two countries whove technically been at war since 1953.

Baik told North Korea Tech that she was streaming via the Koryolink 3G cellular service. She paid $250 (160) for the basic service and $450 for 2GB of data. Its expensive but actually not as much as I expected, she said.
The ability to live stream from Pyongyang has been available since the mobile internet arrived in 2013 , but the recent launch of apps like Periscope and competitor Meerkat have made it much easier.
It raises interesting questions for the guides that escort tourists around the city. Typically, almost everything on a guided tour can be photographed, but tourists are sometimes requested to delete sensitive images .
With live streaming, the image is immediately broadcast out of the country and cant be edited  its too late to take it back.

North Korean state media KCNA carried pictures of the groups tour around the capital yesterday, including a trip to a nursery, a maternity hospital and the historic relics of Mangyongdae, the birth place of Kim Il-sung.
Several updates from Baik today include a live  art performance  and lunch followed by  decompression  with the live stream expected to continue throughout the trip.

How Nigeria turned a corner against Boko Haram
After five years of insurgency, the military has made significant gains on the battlefield. But now the battle for peace must begin, says Max Siollun

The Nigerian army has recaptured all of the major towns occupied by Boko Haram in recent months, and rescued nearly 1,000 kidnapped women and children. It claims to have destroyed several of the militants camps , pursued the group into the Sambisa forest and arrested those suspected of supplying them with food and fuel .
Isolated attacks have continued, but after more than five years of torment, the insurgents seem to have been transformed from the hunters to the hunted. It is now Boko Haram fighters who are fleeing, with the army in pursuit. Recently released footage shows militants running away in disarray from aerial bombardments by the Nigerian air force.
Only five months ago Boko Haram was wreaking havoc in the north east, seemingly able to launch attacks at will after having captured an area about the same size as Belgium.
A failure to stop militants played a part in the political downfall of Goodluck Jonathan, the first Nigerian president to lose an election, amid promises by his challenger Muhammadu Buhari to crush the insurgency.
Relations between the previous commander and his men were so poor that enraged troops opened fire on him
Yet even before Buharis inauguration, the military seems to have turned a corner in its fight against Boko Haram .
The recent rescue of hundreds of women and children was a watershed. Although hostages have escaped from Boko Haram captivity before, they did so of their own volition. This was the first time that the army had rescued hostages in significant numbers. Some of the women claimed that their former captors had complained of battle fatigue and of being under-equipped  complaints formerly heard from soldiers.
Also it seems Boko Harams leader Abubakar Shekau has been uncharacteristically quiet of late  not having released any of his customary propaganda videos since March.
After failing for so long, how has the army managed this turnaround? Although many factors played a part, perhaps the most obvious has been a ruthless crackdown on dissent within the military itself.
After being stung by reports that some soldiers had refused to fight Boko Haram or had tactically retreated from battle, chief of army staff Lt-General Kenneth Minimah ordered that deserters be court-martialled. More than 60 were sentenced to death . He rejected complaints about being poorly equipped, arguing that  It is the soldier that fights, not the equipment .

His tough tactics appear to have worked. Soldiers now say they would rather fight Boko Haram, that confront  that mad man [Minimah] .
A change of command also helped. Since taking charge of the division in charge of combatting Boko Haram less than five months ago, Major-General Lamidi Adeosun has provided charismatic leadership and is respected by his men  unlike his predecessors.
Relations between the former commander and his men were so poor that enraged troops opened fire on him last May, blaming him for a botched night-time operation that led to several of their colleagues being killed.
In contrast, Adeosun personally led his men into battle in a recent operation . The new commander has quietly got on with the job with little fanfare, implementing more aggressive tactics to take the fight to the enemy.
But the armys gains on the battlefield have inadvertently exposed the magnitude of the task still ahead. The fact that the military rescued nearly 1,000 women and children and yet not one of the nearly 300 kidnapped Chibok teenagers was among them demonstrates just how many people are being held.
The rescued hostages, including children fathered by Boko Haram insurgents, may struggle to be accepted
An intermediary who entered Boko Harams camp last year to negotiate the Chibok girls release was shocked to find their presence dwarfed by other captives . The teenagers may represent less than 10% of the total number of hostages held by the militants, amid estimates that more than 3,000 other teenagers have been kidnapped.
Boko Haram kidnaps, rapes, and impregnates female abductees not just to sow terror but also to replenish its ranks . More than 200 of the women recently rescued are pregnant , and several of the rescued children were born and raised in Boko Harams stronghold in the Sambisa forest.
It is clear that the Islamic militants will not just disappear, no matter how successful the army is militarily. There is no magic bullet that will end the insurgency and nothing short of a comprehensive armistice deal will neutralise its ability to give the army a bloody nose from time to time.
Military force is the means, but not the end. All it can do is buy enough breathing room for the government to devise comprehensive solutions. For that, eyes will turn to Buharis new government taking office on 29 May.
The last time the army inflicted heavy losses on Boko Haram, in 2009, the government relaxed and thought the conflict was over. The militants laid low, re-armed, regrouped, and returned more deadly than before. The government must learn from this missed opportunity.
The conflict is entering a phase where it needs to be fought not just with bombs and guns, but also by addressing the consequences of the insurgency. Those raped or rendered refugees or orphans by Boko Haram need rehabilitation and support. The rescued hostages, including children fathered by insurgents, may not be accepted back in their communities. The groups indoctrination was so effective that some of the women captives opened fire on the soldiers who came to free them . Some who escaped captivity in the past were sent away by their families in order to escape stigmatisation.
Also, even if Boko Haram agrees to lay down its weapons, the level of hostility towards the group means that security forces may have to protect former insurgents from score-settling attacks by their victims.
Nigeria may win the war, but could find that winning the peace will require different tactics.

Herds of one of Central Asias most symbolic animals, the saiga antelope, are declining rapidly  and no one knows why.
The Kazakh department for emergency situations says more than 19,000 saiga carcasses have now been buried in the countrys Qostanai region, though unofficial reports on 20 May suggested the number of dead animals may already exceed 30,000.
Its shaping up to be a complete catastrophe, says EJ Milner-Gulland, a UK-based academic who heads the Saiga Conservation Alliance , a network of conservationists working to protect the antelope.
Im afraid the animals are still dying and we are not actually getting a final number yet, she added. Im expecting that number to go up quite substantially in the coming days.
The saiga, with its distinctive bulging eyes, tubular snout and spiralled horns, is as distinctive as it is endangered. Conservationists estimate there are 260,000 saigas in Central Asia, including 200,000 in west-central Kazakhstan .
The recent animal deaths already represents the biggest decline of the species in recent history.
Bacteria
Senior officials from Kazakhstans agriculture ministry and the regional governor visited the area this week to coordinate a response. So far, theyre baffled by whats causing the deaths.
Officials say the carcasses bear no wounds or other signs of trauma that would indicate mass poaching  a problem in past efforts to maintain healthy saiga populations. Instead, they say the culprit is likely the Pasteurella bacteria  a naturally occurring bacteria that is carried in animals mouths and nasal passages.
Milner-Gulland says that while guess the cause of death may indeed be Pasteurella, its probably not the whole story. Pasteurella normally kills only weaker animals that have already been stressed or sickened by something else.
The fact that were getting positive reports of Pasteurella doesnt mean the bacterium is the underlying reason the animals are dying, she says. [The bacteria] is there naturally.
Milner-Gulland is reluctant to speculate on the cause of death but says current evidence points to a highly infectious disease.

Russian rockets
This explanation is not likely to satisfy activists like Musaghali Duambekov of the Kazakh-based environmental movement Anti-Heptyl , a name that references compounds used in rocket fuel.
His group traces many of the countrys environmental problems to the highly toxic fuels used by Russian rockets launched from Kazakhstans Baikonur Cosmodrome .
I think the authorities [in Kazakhstan] are hiding the real causes of the loss of the large numbers of saiga antelope every year, he says.
As an active member of the Anti-Heptyl movement, which has been against the [Russian] Proton rocket launches, I think the situation, among other things, is connected to the rockets, as large parts of Kazakhstan are being affected by poisonous elements on a regular basis, Duambekov says.
Several Russian Proton-M rockets in recent years have exploded over Kazakhstan after lifting off from Baikonur, sparking concerns among local residents and environmental activists.
While its unclear to what extent environmental poisons like heptyl compounds might be harming animal populations, international experts say thats probably not whats killing off the saiga.
I think there is no evidence to that at all, says Milner-Gulland. Well get toxicology reports from the environmental sampling thats being taken, and that will help us to understand one way or the other. She points out that if antelope mortality continues to spread, it will make the environmental-poisoning theory that much more untenable.
The saiga has been the victim of several mass declines over the years, reaching near-extinction in the 1920s and again in 2003 due to poaching and over-hunting. At one point in 2003, the number of live animals fell to just 21,000.
One source of hope is that the saiga has the capacity to rebound quickly from mass-mortality events. The females give birth fairly rapidly and are fertile from one year of age.
Its an extraordinary species, Milner-Gulland says. Because it lives in a really harsh environment, where you have really cold winters and drought condition, it has a natural ability to rebound.
While Kazakhstan has the largest surviving saiga population, other significant populations are found in Mongolia and Russias Kalmykia Republic.

Conservative politicians in Uganda say that a music video by singer Jemimah Kansiime has broken the countrys tough new anti-pornography laws .
The 21-year-old has already spent five weeks in jail for appearing in a foam-covered bikini in the video , promoting her single, Ensolo Yange.
Under the new law, which took effect in February, Kansiime faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of wilfully and unlawfully producing, trafficking, importing, selling and abetting pornography.
But critics say the ruling is part of a growing anti-liberal movement that includes tough laws against homosexuals in a country where religiously-driven conservatism appears to be on the rise.
Human Rights Watch argue that the new law so loosely defines pornography that it has encouraged public attacks on women wearing skimpy clothing , while Amnesty International has called for it to be repealed.
Sex sells
I was aware that there are some sections of society that are conservative, said Kansiime, but she never dreamt her new video  played over 190,000 times on YouTube  was breaking the law.
One thing she says she learnt from her idols  including Rihanna and Nicki Minaj  is that sex sells.
I was just experimenting to see if I put on a short dress, will the audience like it? said the singer.
She was arrested in November along with her then manager, Didi Muchwa Mugisha.
Mugisha pleaded guilty and was fined 200, 000 Ugandan shillings (43), but Kansiime pleaded not guilty, and was detained for five weeks before raising money for bail.
My rights have been trampled upon, my freedom of expression has been trampled upon, she said at her home in Kampala.
Kansiimes lawyer, Isaac Semakadde, argues the case is a test for the right of Ugandan performers to express themselves.
That right to erotic entertainment, there has to be a space for it in an open and free society, hesaid, arguing divisions must be made between clearly criminal offences and entertainment.
To ban all forms of pornography, all forms of nudity, is outrageous, he said.

Obscene and vulgar
Kansiime was tracked down and arrested after Ugandas ethics minister Simon Lokodo was apparently shocked by the video .
He described Kansiimes videos as very obscene and vulgar, and warned of further arrests.
Under his continued crackdown on pornography, Lokodo has this year ordered police to arrest men who procure prostitutes , and described a popular local television dating show as prostitution.
Local media reported that he also confronted Ugandas youngest MP when she walked into parliament in a short skirt.
The law has also become known as the mini skirt ban after some Ugandans misinterpreted the ruling and targeted people they considered to be improperly dressed, in some cases stripping women in the street .
Semakadde accuses the government of ignoring more pressing issues.
The decadence in society does not start and stop with prostitution, he said. Theres corruption  but they have no answers to that, so they go for the most vulnerable.

Kansiime is due in court later this month. But Semakadde said he will request the case is halted while the constitutional court deals with a separate petition brought by activists against the law, arguing it is over broad and vague.
As she awaits her next court appearance, Kansiime insisted that she had the right to film whatever I want, but conceded she may need to cater for more conservative tastes if she is to continue to make a living from her music.
I have to do something that people like, I have not benefitted from that video, she admitted.

Tinder, the dating app phenomena that since its 2012 inception has made more than six billion matches across the globe, like me has Iranian roots. After several months of matching, messaging and arranging meet-ups through Tinder, I was surprised to learn that two of its Los Angeles-based founders, Sean Rad and Justin Mateen, are both of Iranian descent . But back in Iran, a country that is considered the worlds most internet censored nation, let alone a place that restricts interactions between unrelated women and men, is such an app accessible?
I recently returned to Tehran after two years, defying incessant and increasing calls from my family to marry, and had the opportunity to find out firsthand. During my time in Irans capital, I noticed that dating had evolved from being a covert operation to something quite commonplace. Even though on several occasions Id been stopped by the patrolling moral guidance authorities who questioned my relationship with the woman Id been walking with, in many other ways dating is no longer as complicated as it once was.
Aside from illicit parties while mum and dad are out of town (or even illicit parties while mum and dad are in the house), an increasing number of cafs, restaurants and parks are popping up, making meeting and subsequently dating so much easier. But I wondered how much easier things might get for Irans young hopefuls with the introduction of dating apps. Having just arrived from London, staring down at Tinders familiar red flamed icon on my mobile, I was excited to find out if the app would work in Iran , and if so, how many here would be using it.
Even before mobiles got smart, their increasing presence in the socially conservative Islamic republic seemed to bring about a profound cultural shift . For the nations bulging post-1979 Revolution baby boomers  the under thirty-fives that still account for nearly half the nation  mobile phones allowed individuals to interact with one another with less interception from moral authorities , be it the paramilitary militia known as the Basij, the Moral Guidance authorities or parents. But with my recent visit I noticed that things had shifted up a gear, with the nations largest network operator offering cheap and widely available 3G and its closest competitor advertising a new 4G service. It is with the introduction of services like these that Iranians can more freely access app-based, location-sensitive dating services.

With Tinder, Facebook details are selectively displayed for others to swipe right to show interest or left to reject  mutual interest gets a match, allowing for messaging and then more. Tinder has shaken off its reputation as a hook-up (read casual sex) app since going worldwide, representing itself more as a game for which users are asked if they want to continue playing or chat after each match is made.
For this player, Tehrans Tinder total availability tallied at 20 throughout my two-week visit. My preset London settings had only allowed me two swipes to the left before a message popped up below my profile picture telling me that there was nobody new nearby. Realising that two kilometres  my default distance setting  doesnt cover much of Tehrans ever-expanding metropolitan area of nearly 9 million residents, I slid my profile settings wide open, 50 kilometres and 18-50 age range. With this change, I saw my profile quickly linked with, among others, Sara, 22, not her real name, which goes for others in this article. (Publication was also delayed to protect the privacy of those who may have been active.)

Saras first profile picture showed her casually dressed, wearing a loose, white V-neck top and without a headscarf. I swiped right indicating to Tinder that Im interested. Later that night it appeared shed done the same as a message flashes up on my mobile informing me that wed made a match. Following a brief exchange of messages and numbers, we made vague plans to meet.
To set up Tinder, you need to be on Facebook, but unsurprisingly social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are blocked in Iran. Even with these blocks at least 4m Iranians use Facebook , according to the governments own statistics, with the Supreme Leader  or at least his office  being an avid tweeter , boasting 122,000 Twitter followers.
A site can be blocked outright, like the BBC, or filtered for containing a suspicious word in its name, like the Sussex police website. Despite such restrictions many Iranians continue to access these sites.
Within a day of arriving in Iran, a tech-savvy friend kindly set me up with one of the more common methods used by Iranians to evade the blocking, a virtual private network, or VPN. With his local bank card hed pulled up a local site, made a payment of about one pound for a months access, tapped in a few setting changes on my mobile, and as far as any server is concerned, Im back accessing the digital world from the United Kingdom. My mobiles GPS however, still recognising me as a local to Iran, lets the active Tehran-based Tinder users know Im in the same city.
Hey Sara, hows your weekend going so far? I begin in English, confident that she can speak the language based on her profile warning me that she doesnt reply to boring clichd messages, in case you are wondering.
Fluency in English in Iran can suggest a certain status, but I use it just as much for practicality, what with my Persian being on a par with any Iranian pre-schooler. Well so far everyday has been a weekend for me since i came back, she responds, reassuring me that she does at least respond to clichd if not boring messages. Hows yours?
We shoot a few messages back and forth before I invite her to meet me at a caf. Im actually dying to find some decent coffee here, she somewhat snobbishly answers, re-establishing her transient association with Iran and playing the foreign-thus-better card right back at me. I suggest a fancy new joint in a wealthy neighbourhood in the north of Tehran, a place that boasts urban-industrial chic interior design and more than 22,500 Instagram followers. She agrees, and we both round up by pretending to be busy over the coming days, leaving a vague timeframe by which wed meet.
Tehrans upscale Sam Cafe.
Then it was over to Leila, my second match, a young woman proudly wearing the Bayern Munich strip in her third profile picture. Leila seemed to be different from the average girl in Iran who likes to make an ostentatious display of herself. Leila wore little make-up and her hair seemed to be a natural colour.
So tell me about yourself? In either language ;)
I pick up.
A red bubble eventually pops out beside her smiling profile icon, 27, female.
27 and female! I respond, not typing out how Im figuratively ROFLing - rolling on the floor laughing.
I remind myself that she Is female by looking once again at her profile pictures and notice that shes made a little update between my exchanges with Sara. I like the new pictures, I tell her, referencing her cute smile. Thanks fer the compliment, she says. U have great headshape.
I tell her that Ive not had that one before. I had to come up with st, she says.
Leila tells me she Is between jobs. So you have time to meet during the day to go for coffee? I ask.
Im hesitant, she says. I ask why.
Bad memoriesBad experiences with tourists slash visitors.
In an attempt to reassure her I send a link to some of my writing online, to which she types out a smiling smiley and adds, trust building?
After some additional reassurance from me she writes, then no superior gaze?
Haha! Thats funny, I respond.
To you maybe :D she writes back, before feeling comfortable enough to suggest we go for a stroll in the park in the coming days. And with that, like Sara before her, she leaves the specifics for later.
Several other unspecified plans chop and change during an afternoon as I take myself to Tehrans newly developed and hugely popular recreational area, known as the Park of Water and Fire. The park displays both of the elements, and also provides a massive dose of polluted air up top the adjoining double decker bridge that oversees the city, as well as a hideous highway. I take myself to the large skate park at the far end hoping to take shots of the skater girls and biker boys flipping their inline skates, skateboards, and adapted mountain bikes.

As the sun sets and the temperature drops from cold to unbearable, I pick up the conversation with Sara in a WhatsApp message and ask her to join me at a nearby popular food court named Wooden Road  a series of international restaurants separated by little bridges arching over synthetic waterways. She agrees to join me there instead of our previously planned location, but lets it be known that I apparently now have terrible taste in venues.
We meet, take a seat, order and get straight to business. She tells me about her digital startup and her hopes for it. We discuss facts and figures about Iran and its evolving online market, noting a buzz based on a rumoured $200m budget for digital startups in Iran by a South African company. Sara is frank and direct, questioning the details as I talk about my experiences of working in Iran, reconfirming my suspicion that were having a business meeting rather than a date. She drops authors names and book titles before stating that she believes everything, absolutely everything, should be commodified and commercialised.
I believe that capitalism is the answer to our problems, she confidently asserts. I accept the challenge and question her about functions of the state, more specifically about how street lighting should be paid for. She doesnt up-and-leave, but the conversation intensifies as I notice the coffee kicking in  dating is easier with an alcoholic drink or threewhen a nations laws allow it, of course.
My meet-up with Leila, date number two, took place at another nearby park, probably Tehrans strangest. It is sunk into the ground and hosts a variety of odd animals - mostly exotic birds - caged up and taunted by a frightening number of street cats. The park is situated half-way up Tehrans longest street, Vali Asr, which once bridged two of the former Shahs palaces.
This was the street where I met Leila, shook her hand and stood silenced by how tall she was. Thankfully she was stumped too.
Hi, I dont know how to do this. What do I say now? she asks me, avoiding eye contact.
How are you? I both ask and answer. She answers with another question. Where should we go?
I continue the game and awkwardly ask, Howd you get so tall? before taking the lead and guiding us through the entrance.
She continues to avoid looking in my direction, made easier by us walking beside one another, but she puts an end to the question game, and begins to open up: My parents are doctors, quite religious I guess, but I have nothing in common with them. They find me odd.
She doesnt see my lack of surprise and continues to tell me about how shed studied engineering and was now between jobs. Im reminded that although Iran has the largest student gender ratio difference across the world  with more females than males studying at university  finding work thereafter is hard for women, even before international sanctions were imposed. She asks herself a few more questions and helpfully answers them too before asking me why Im in Iran, what I do for a living as well as general questions about my confusing background.
We meander through the park, aimlessly choosing from the many paths separating banks of grass and trees, each with an adjoining bench and on each, a single cat shifting for the breaks of sunlight beaming through the trees that towered above. Our conversation was as fractured as the park layout, with mostly Leila feeding me parts of her life in patchwork. We passed a bench where an old woman sat feeding a large congress of cats, undeterred by the four men loudly commentating while playing on one of the parks fixed football tables. Crazy cat lady, says Leila, humorously in English, causing the cats to turn to see why Im laughing.
I ask about her experiences on Tinder in Tehran and more specifically about the superior gaze. She tells me about her last date, also with an English man, but unlike me, fully so. I didnt fully understand what had happened, mostly due to my poor Persian, but it sounded like she had a good case for sexual harassment. She continued, telling me that shes not a prude but should her parents learn about her sexual activities shed likely be kicked out of the house. On the other hand, she was clear that she doesnt take kindly to being treated like a sex object.
Both of my dates concluded with a simple handshake, followed by a slightly insincere see you later, although in the case of Sara, this still remains my hope. There was however one last Tehran Tinder encounter, but upon my return to London, which can occasionally happen when jumping between locations. I matched with Mena, 27, and after a brief exchange she asked me, Is this a business trip?
I then realised what had happened.
Tinder thinks Im still in Iran. I was there on business, pleasure and seeing family, I respond to which she quickly replies, So youre back home :)
Returning to London and seeing profile pictures of girls in bars, drinks-in-hand or leaping into the air, star-shaped, in a bikini before a sunset, reminded me that yes, I was indeed back. Her message however, sent another reminder to me: I slide my settings back down to a more narrow two kilometre range and 26-36 and continue playing.
Both of my Tinder dates in Tehran  although destined to be nothing more than just one-offs  were probably more successful than several of my London attempts. Tinder can be quick and callous, but this is how dating is in Iran, where the classic method of cruising here can display girls left and right, before a brief exchange that hopefully leads to a further exchange of numbers.
Although there arent many users at the moment, I believe that Tinder is set to take off in Iran, not only because of the nations quick adoption of most things digital but also because of the further empowerment that this type of technology enables the youth  allowing them to quite literally take things into their own hands for a change.

A video showing the interrogation of alleged Russian servicemen captured in Ukraine has sparked concerns about the treatment of prisoners of war in the conflict.
The footage of one of the two men captured in eastern Ukraine on Saturday appears to show him lying on a hospital bed identifying himself as serviceman Aleksandr Aleksandrov, who says he was part of a Russian special forces group.
We were discovered. I was wounded in the leg as I tried to get away... Weve been here four to five days, he says to the camera.
First shared on the Facebook page of Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashchenko , the release of the footage has been criticised amid claims it violates the Geneva conventions .
The conventions ban exposing POWs to public curiosity.
The treatment of prisoners of war in the Ukraine conflict has repeatedly sparked concerns since fighting between army forces and Russian-backed separatists erupted last year.

In the past months, rebels have paraded Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) before an angry crowd on the streets of Donetsk, Ukraine has released videos showing apparent forced confessions of captured Russian paratroopers, and several videos posted online appear to show brutal treatment of Ukrainian soldiers at the hands separatist groups.
This week, Kievs capture of the two alleged Russian servicemen has once again raised concerns about whether Ukraine is abiding by international law in its handling of POWs.
Its in violation of Geneva rules on treatment of POWs, Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, said on Twitter of the video .

Conflict between states
At the heart of the debate over whether the release of the video constitutes a violation of international law is the question: is Ukraine at war with Russia ?
The Geneva conventions ban on subjecting POWs to insults and public curiosity applies specifically to armed conflicts between states, which Russia steadfastly insists the Ukraine conflict is not, portraying it instead as a civil war.
Kiev, Nato and western governments say there is evidence that Moscow is backing separatist rebels with personnel, weapons and training, allegations that the Kremlin has repeatedly rejected while conceding that Russian volunteers and soldiers no longer in active duty have fought with separatists.
Some Ukrainians argue the video shows that Moscow is indeed involved in military conflict, despite its denials
The Russian Defence Ministry said on 18 May that Aleksandrov and the other captured man, Yevgeny Yerofeyev, indeed served in the military but were not active servicemen at the time they were detained.
Either these are POWs and Russia is involved, or they are illegal trespassers, and Geneva Conventions do not apply. You decide. Regardless, they are treated humanely by all accounts, the Ukrainian embassy in the Netherlands claimed in a Twitter discussion about the ethics of releasing the video .
The International Committee of the Red Cross, the guardian of the Geneva Conventions, has called the war in Ukraine a  non-international armed conflict .
Under this status, public curiosity does not constitute a war crime. Instead, there must be evidence of outrages upon personal dignity and  humiliating and degrading treatment .
But Ukraine claims the video is proof of Russias involvement in the conflict. For us, it is very important to present to the entire world Russian soldiers who supposedly do not exist on our land, Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov told news agencies.
But the footage presents an interesting catch-22: by gaining recognition from the international community  and the Red Cross  that it is at war with Russia, Kiev would bind itself to the Geneva conventions ban on subjecting POWs to public curiosity, making it liable to charges for sharing the video footage.

A violation of international law?
Experts differ on whether the release of the video constitutes a Ukrainian violation of the conventions.
Gary Solis, a former US military judge, says that even if the Red Cross has not classified the Ukraine conflict as a war between states, that doesnt mean that you can do anything you want.
There are still rules and theres still customary international law that applies, Solis says. He adds that under the Geneva conventions criteria for international conflicts, the video absolutely violates the statute barring insults and public curiosity.
You dont show someone in any circumstance, whether theyre in a hospital bed or standing upright, for purposes of satisfying public curiosity, Solis says.
Related: I killed 15 prisoners of war in Ukraine, claims Russian fighter
David Glazier, a former surface-warfare officer in the US Navy who now teaches national international law, disagrees.
Glazier says the video is the sort of the minimal and respectful amount of exposure necessary for them [Ukraine] to make the case to the world that there are in fact Russian soldiers involved in hostilities in their conflict.
It has since been reported that the Ukrainian Armys chief of staff, Viktor Muzhenko, vowed to put the two prisoners on display for the international media, a move that Glazier says probably would cross the line.

15 March, friendly
Ward Two 1  1 Ward Seven
A decade ago, Opio Moses was a lowly policeman out in the sticks of Eastern Uganda with a complicated love life. He had fallen for the wrong woman. One day, her uncle, who was politically connected, came to pay Moses a visit at home. He told Moses at gunpoint that their match was unsuitable and that the relationship was now over. Moses also had a gun. Both men fired at each other. Moses was wounded and the uncle was left dead, shot in the chest. Moses then turned his gun on himself. These days, his greying hair is cropped short and barely conceals the long jagged scar where his own bullet split his scalp and skull.
Moses was sentenced to 20 years for murder. When he first arrived at Luzira Upper Prison, Ugandas only maximumsecurity facility on the southern edge of Kampala, he was filled with despair. His days were bleak and purposeless. He was paralysed by remorse and did not know how he would serve out his term. But as the shock began to wear off, he realised Luzira was not like other prisons. The inmates could play football. And the football was not just kickabouts in the yard. There were formal clubs and tournaments, even fans. In 2006, Moses began to play as an accomplished striker with a prison team.
Now, nine years later, he is the chairman of UPSA, the Upper Prison Sports Association, footballs sovereign body in Luzira. Moses, among his other duties, is also a warder, personally responsible for the care of two dozen psychiatric patients, who are among the most vulnerable inmates in the jail. He shares their ward, organises their medication and generally keeps an eye on them. This is not his toughest duty, however. Being chairman of UPSA is the most challenging, stressful, disturbing and tiresome work that one can do in the Upper Prison, he said. His daily duties include finding sponsors, organising tournaments, dealing with disciplinary issues, and running a player registration and transfer system.
Over the past two decades, Luzira has gone from being a notoriously violent and squalid place, to one of the most progressive prisons in Africa. By any standard, it is a success. It has a recidivism rate of less than 30%, better than its counterparts in the UK, where, according to the Prison Reform Trust, 46% of former inmates commit crimes on release . Its schools, staffed by the prisoners themselves, put almost every inmate through a programme of education that stretches from basic literacy to the completion of high school and then offers vocational training (tailoring and carpentry) or university degrees in law with the local Royal Mutessa University and the University of London. Luziras infrastructure is dilapidated, its poverty is harsh but it is a deeply humane environment. The philosophy behind the prison is very simple. People need to be busy, the officer-in-charge, Wilson Magomu, told me.
Upper Prison has kept itself busy with extraordinary ingenuity. The prisoners have created their own drama, they dance, and they play music on homemade instruments. There is prayer and counselling in the church and mosque. But more popular than anything else is football. Within the prison there are 10 football clubs, some of them almost two decades old, each with their own players, boards and constitutions. Alongside Mosess old team Aston Villa, there is Liverpool and Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle United. There is Barcelona, Juventus and Hannover 96 too, but football in Luzira, like football in all of Uganda, is dominated by the Premier League.
Since the arrival of satellite television in the early 2000s, English football has come to fill the sports pages of every Ugandan paper, as well as eating up the radio and television schedules. Nine out of 10 inmates who I spoke to supported a Premier League team. The same was true of the guards, nearly all of whom were Arsenal supporters. Every day, during my time at Upper Prison, a young inmate named White Angel  because Im good inside  would come and find me to discuss the latest news from Arsenal and Tottenham. Do you really think Soldado was worth the money at Spurs? Do you have Arsne Wengers address? Could you get a letter out to him? John, one of the guys who drove us to the prison each day, followed Chelsea, or my Chelsea as he preferred to put it. Our trips around Kampala were always accompanied by the staccato rap of Lugandan football commentary on the radio, broken by ecstatic English: Oh my God! Ross Barkley! Ross Barkley! Ross Barkley! Goal!

The centre of the prisons football culture is Boma A, the main prison yard, which is just big enough to accommodate a full-size pitch. On the first day I visited Luzira, in March, a match was due to take place. In the rainy season, which had not yet begun, the Boma sometimes resembles a grass pitch, but under searing sunlight it had been reduced to scorched red earth. At both goal ends there were two-storey cell-blocks, known as the wards. Along one touchline was a low school building with a tiny veranda under a corrugated iron roof  the only slice of shade available for a quietly gathering crowd of around 500. The game was just a friendly. Ward Two were in white, Ward Seven were in blue.
Life in Luzira is colour-coded with precision. Remand prisoners and those serving less than 20 years are in intense canary yellow. Those serving more are in atomic tangerine. You get a red stripe for trying to escape, and blue trim for seniority and privilege. RPs  the regimental police  are the inmates who keep order in the Boma, and they get a white armband. Psychiatric patients are in green, their garb is the most ragged of all. The condemned, as they are known, waiting out time on death row, live separately and wear white.
The guards are in tan with maroon trim. There are fewer than 100 on any given shift, responsible for over 3,500 prisoners in a space designed for 500. In a British prison the overall staff-to-inmate ratio is around 1:5. At Luzira the ratio is 1:15.According to the staff, a significant fraction of inmates should not be there  because they were framed or because the glacially slow Ugandan court system has left them on remand for years. But the majority of the people in Luzira have done awful things: murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping. Given all this, the atmosphere is remarkably tranquil. In the week that I spent there, I never had a sense that aggression was near. Of course, a guard was often around, but the mood was always calm. Everyone looked everyone in the eye.
The match between the wards was highly physical but there was no time-wasting, no talking back and no slide-tackling, tripping or diving. Given the state of the pitch, it was remarkable that any player was able to complete a pass. Ball control skills, under impossible circumstances, are the mark of the best players in Luzira.
Once the game was over and the Boma crowd were drifting back to the wards for the 3pm lock-up, Moses handed me a scrap of paper: 5 foot playing boots. 12 footballs. 3 volleyballs. 1 box of laundry soap. 2 Sets of Jersey. A Trophy. A Goat. These were the supplies required if a tournament was to take place during the next week. Football at the prison comes in the form of kickabouts, practices, friendlies. But valued above all are the knockout tournaments, with trophies and prizes. After I had agreed to provide them all, Moses offered me a provisional schedule and I wondered where I would find a goat.

Manchester United 2 - 1 Arsenal
Barcelona 4 - 3 Aston Villa
Juventus 0 - 0 Hannover 96
(Hannover 96 won 4-2 on penalties)
The opening match of the tournament was Manchester United vs Arsenal. United, of course, were the favourites, while the Luzira Arsenal were the minnows. Before the game could begin, the pitch needed to be marked out. The lines from the previous days match had been erased by the busy footfall of the Boma. An hour before kick-off, a pair of inmates stretched out a length of green string until it was taut; this was the guide line. Then a third, stooping low, his cupped hands holding a mound of manioc flour, moved along the string and let the flour fall through his fingers. The referees, dressed in a motley collection of part-black kits, were next to arrive and limbered up in the newly drawn centre circle. Members of the UPSA executive  chairman, vice chairman, secretary, treasurer and match officials  took up their positions against the chainlink fence on the halfway line and checked their team sheets.
Players arrived one by one and began to mingle with what was left of the morning Boma crowd: broom-makers, draughts players and lounging conversationalists. Slowly, as people drifted to the sidelines and the shade, the teams emerged on the pitch, while the referees and UPSA officials conferred. Money is not permitted in the prison, so there was no coin to be tossed to decide which team would play at which end. The teams posed for photographs, six standing at the back, five squatting at the front. The referee checked in with his assistants, looked at his watch, held his arm aloft, and blew the whistle.
Prisoners have been playing football in the Boma for decadesas long as anyone can remember, but inmates began to create more formal clubs with managers, coaches and fans around the turn of the century, shortly after more liberal conditions were introduced. The first club to emerge was Liverpool, which was founded around 2000 by a group of a dozen former soldiers who had turned to armed robbery. Despite being incarcerated, they were able to draw on the wealth they had accumulated outside the jail to obtain the best kit and attract the prisons best players.
Manchester United were the team of non-Bugundans. In the 19th century, the Bugunda were the leading tribe of the central region of Uganda. They were used as an instrument of devolved colonial rule by the British, who gave them more autonomy than any other tribal group. Too small to dominate post-colonial Uganda  a nation-state that began life in 1962 with at least 50 ethnic groups and languages within its borders  there continued to be tension between the Bugunda and other tribes. Manchester United, in their early days, gathered rural prisoners and inmates from peripheral tribes in the north and east, united by their marginalised status.

Today, Liverpool and Manchester United remain the largest clubs in the prison, reflecting the huge support enjoyed by their namesakes within the wider Ugandan population. But there are other challengers. A side called the Orange Bees, created by former students of Kampalas Makere University, became known as the team of the elites. After the release of its founders in 2003, it mutated into Chelsea FC, which has established itself as the tribune of youthful talent. The same year, Woodworkers FC and Kitchen FC became Juventus and Germany respectively. Rebranding as Germany proved so unpopular that the team was once again renamed, this time as Aston Villa. Newcastle United was the brainchild of Angina Boscso, a man renowned in the prison for his skill as a talent spotter, and his deftness at buying players cheap and selling them dear. Boscso has been released but Newcastle endures, now serving as a feeder club and academy for Liverpool.
Prince FC turned into Everton  the leagues perennial underdogs  a club that is staffed by Kampala street kids, ex-addicts and dealers. Police FC, a testament to the number of former officers in this jail, became the suitably rough-house Leeds United. The financial demise and multiple relegations of the teams English counterpart in the mid-2000s led to it changing its name once more. It became Hannover 96, and Manchester Uniteds feeder club; though one dogged fan, Brian, who came to talk to me almost every day, had trouble saying goodbye to the glory years and still insisted on calling it Leeds.
The two newest clubs are Barcelona and Arsenal. Although most inmates come from poor backgrounds, occasionally someone really powerful ends up in Luzira on remand  a businessman, an opposition politician, a high-ranking soldier  though they rarely stay long. A Kampala businessman, long since released, was so enamoured by the short-passing tiki-taka style of Barcelona circa 2009 that he created a namesake side out of thin air. Arsenal, meanwhile, benefited from the wider popularity in Uganda of the team that had won the Premier League in 2004, unbeaten and invincible. Luziras Arsenal is known as the Catholic team  another kind of minority group in predominantly protestant Uganda.
The way in which the clubs are run is now strictly regulated by the UPSA constitution. They must have their own constitutions, a chairman, coach, secretary and treasurer, a minimum of 16 registered players and a maximum of 25. Each club also has its fans, who are essential in providing services and resources to develop the side; they are the errand-runners who specialise in finding people when meetings are called, the cobblers who patch up boots, the medics and the healers.
Manchester United has a trio of fanatical supporters who carry their own tiny banner and regularly run on to the pitch when the team scores, which it regularly does. Luziras single Chinese inmate is also a fan. His huge United beach towel, weighted with plastic water bottles, hangs from the barred windows of an upper floor cell behind one of the goals. Arsenal has its own little group of ultras, too, while Liverpools supporters have made a flag recalling the Hillsborough disaster and the clubs most recent European cup triumph.
Perhaps the most important role the fans play is donating kits and food to their clubs in order to attract the best players. Watching the opening rounds of the tournament, it soon became clear that the Manchester United and Liverpool players were noticeably bigger and evidently better-fed than the others. Everton and Chelseas squads, in particular, looked spindly; these clubs have a tiny fan base within Luzira so their players are more reliant on the basic food ration: porridge in the morning and a supper of posho  a glutinous mash made of manioc  and beans, which are so tough they need to be boiled for eight hours. Posho is particularly hard going: sticky yet dry, pulped but gritty, and utterly tasteless.

Despite the dedication of the prisons football fans, the crowd that turned out for the tournament, which often numbered more than 1,500, was curiously quiet. There was some joy and jubilation, stray shouts and calls, the occasional hug and holler, but it was hardly a cauldron. Opio Moses reminded me that fans are not above the rule of law and that constitutionally, the clubs have been made responsible for their behaviour. Unsporting conduct by the crowd is punished as severely as it is on the pitch.

Everton 1  1 Newcastle United (Newcastle won 5-4 on pens)
Liverpool 0  0 Chelsea (Chelsea won 5-4 on penalties)
The next day, early in the second half of the Liverpool-Chelsea game, play was stopped for over 20 minutes when a hundred sacks of manioc flour, which had just been delivered to the prison, needed to be carried across the pitch. Jonathan Mugerwa, a match official, who had to keep a report of players, substitutions, goals and cards, noted this down. Later on, all the match reports would be collated and a detailed official account of the tournament produced, handwritten on lined paper and filed in UPSAs own archive.
Life in Luzira wasnt always like this. The prison was built by the British in the 1920s, 30 years after Uganda had been made a British protectorate. The imperial state replaced the British East African Company as Ugandas notional rulers but, with very few colonists on the ground, the country was run by a system of divide-and-rule that delegated power to selected tribal groups. In its colonial incarnation, the prison was less crowded than today but still barbaric: pitiful living conditions, institutionalised humiliation and a harsh regime of discipline including the use of punishment cells, deliberately flooded with water to make them uninhabitable. The British, who finally left in 1962, used the prison to house nationalists and political dissidents.
Post-colonial Uganda was no more humane to its prison population. Idi Amins eccentric and brutal dictatorship in the 1970s was followed by coups, uncertainty and a gruelling civil war that destroyed the economy, what was left of the Ugandan state, and made the use of violence and torture the norm. By the early 1990s, Luzira was ravaged by HIV and so starved of funding that less than a quarter of the prisoners could be supplied with even a blanket; inmates buried the dead in mass graves and grew vegetables on the same ground to keep the living fed. In 1993, a group of former soldiers staged a two-day riot that required an intervention by the army and left two prisoners dead and many injured.
Something had to change. In 1999, the high commissioner of the Ugandan Prison Service, Joseph Etima, a progressive who also opposed the death penalty, declared an open-door policy to the outside world. At Luzira, the Red Cross and Swedish development agencies brought money, best practice and international law. Local churches and European NGOs, including the African Prisons Project , began to improve healthcare and living conditions. Together they inculcated a hybrid prison culture that drew on western concepts of human rights and individual rehabilitation, Christian notions of redemption and forgiveness, and African traditions of collectivism and restitutive justice. The success of the prison depends on keeping the peace, the fragile rule of law and the consent of the prisoners themselves.
Wilson Magomu began working at Luzira around the time that the changes first started. After a decade rising through the ranks of the prison service, working in provincial jails, he returned in 2011 as officer-in-charge. Magomu is a big man who moves through the prison with unhurried poise, shuffling between his three mobile phones, dispensing orders, casting an eye over the CCTV. He seems to speak and think in the same manner. Recalling a visit to Belmarsh prison in London he observed: You have all of the technology, but you do not have calm. He looked out of the window into the Boma. I have just 100 guards on duty to look after more than 3,000 of my inmates, he said. I have to have calm. He believes that adding guns, as is common in America, makes matters worse. There, the guards are afraid of your inmates and your inmates are afraid of the guards. This causes tension. I do not like to work in a place that is full of tension. There is an implicit deal at Luzira. Prisoners will be incarcerated but their rights will be respected. Violence will not be tolerated. Laws and rules are applied consistently. In return, the prisoners must not only stay put, they must help to run and organise the place.
UPSA was one product of this system. In the early 2000s, individual football clubs existed and there was a desire for competition, but no neutral organisation to make it happen. So in 2003, the administration and the prisoners created UPSA. The bodys leading figures are voted in annually by an electoral college of the prisons referees, the clubs and their officials. It has the practical and logistical task of seeking out sponsors and putting on properly refereed tournaments. It must regulate and negotiate with the football clubs and the prison administration over the use of the Boma, behaviour and discipline, and the timing of tournaments.
Like any football association it runs a player-registration system  one that requires players to appear in person on three consecutive days once a year at a specific place in the Boma. It has also had to police the black market in players as clubs have used every means at their disposal  extra food, contraband, blackmail and persuasion  to get them to switch teams. Two years ago UPSA introduced transfer windows, two short periods each year in which players can move between clubs.
In this regard, UPSA is part of a long African nationalist tradition of football as a school of administration, politics and democracy. Before the first world war, Albert Luthuli, an early president of the ANC, was vice president of an African football association in Durban. Then, in the 1940s, the trade unions formed in Bulawayo were led by shop stewards who also captained the Zimbabwean teams Matabele Highlanders and Red Army.
But there is another tradition at work in the UPSA constitution. The preamble to the most recent edition, written by the inmates themselves, brings to mind the Victorian moralists and public-school teachers who saw football as a school of character, an ethical, even spiritual, enterprise. These were the kind of Britons who brought imperial rule, Christianity and football to Uganda in the late 19th century.
We the inmates of Ugandan Government Prison Upper
- OBSERVING that society imprisoned us demanding that we learn to adhere to the rule of Law, and
- DESIROUS of transforming ourselves into Law abiding citizens.
- YET REALISING the inestimable influence to abide by the rules and regulations on all who culture themselves to regular competitive sports activities.
- AWARE of the benefits of physical fitness and entertainment effect of sports to human health,
- AND NOTING the development of the talents of the youths that can be delivered from sporting events
- DO SOLEMNLY DECIDE to enact and adopt the following articles as the constitution of the Uganda Upper Government Prison
sports fraternity.
The reformers of the English public schools sought to turn out muscular Christian gentleman who would go on to rule the empire. UPSA has been trying something much harder. Through football, its members have been trying to turn themselves into citizens ready to rejoin a society they damaged. You can read it in their words and you can see it in their play. Dissent, footballs code word for slagging off the referee, is almost entirely absent. Unsporting behaviour of any kind is frowned upon. A red card means a two-month ban from football  an agonising punishment for any player here.
The Liverpool-Chelsea game went to penalties. When Chelsea scored the winning goal, Jonathan Mugerwa made the final entry in his notebook and then turned back to his Bible. Before he arrived in the prison, Mugerwa sold shoes on the streets of downtown Kampala. He was, in his own words, a drinker and a drug taker, an illiterate troublemaking youth. One evening, a man suspected of multiple robberies in his neighbourhood was caught and confronted by a small group of angry locals. By the time Jonathan and his friends arrived after a night of drinking, the crowd had turned violent, and Jonathan joined them. As Mugerwa told the story, his eyes remained fixed on me but his voice trembled. I am here because of mob justice. I played my part, but my greatest sin was not to save the boy. Now, Mugerwa has finished high school, works as a counsellor, and has turned himself into to a poet and pastor. He eyed me, in all seriousness, and said: Timothy 2, Chapter 2, Verse 5. An athlete is not crowned in glory unless he competes according to the rules.

Barcelona 1  2 Manchester United
Newcastle United 0 - 1 Hannover 96
In the first of the semi-finals, Barcelona took an early lead but I missed the goal; Bertrand Lavalle was talking to me again. A short, round-faced Congolese man, he was simultaneously delighted to be speaking French and exasperated that he could not form DRC FC, a Congolese football team. Oui, Il y a beaucoup de discrimination, Professor. Il y a un problme congolais. During the second half, as Manchester United turned the tide, I asked Opio Moses why UPSA would not let Bertrand form a team. Moses patiently explained the Congolese problem to me. First, clubs have to join in pairs. As there are already 10 clubs, adding a single club makes matters impossible. Second, We do not seek to encourage teams that are tribal. There had been trouble in the past with this, explained Moses. (I pointed out that Arsenal were Catholics and that Manchester United were once non-Bugundans, but Moses demurred). Third, English is the official language of UPSA. The administration cannot have a team speaking only French.
As we were talking, Manchester United equalised and the crowd, a little more excitable today, began advancing over the touchline and on to the field. Moses, who is neither large nor loud, gently waved them back behind the line with understated but impressive authority  an authority derived in part from his status as chairman of UPSA. When he has done his time, Moses plans to found an NGO devoted to bringing vocational education to the prison. Football is so good for many things, but it will not allow a man to eat, he said.
Mosess predecessors were no less politically adept. In the early days of UPSA there was a widespread problem of bribery, as ambitious chairmen paid opposition players in food and contraband goods to throw games. The organisation was also threatened by a breakaway movement, fired by discontent amongst the devotees of sports other than football. Even more seriously, in 2006 the highly polarised atmosphere of Ugandan politics found its way into Luzira. Clubs began to align themselves with President Yoweri Musevenis governing National Resistance Movement party or the opposition Democratic party. Competition turned to conflict, referees lost control of games. Now, by force of law, clubs must not assume a political identity. Bribery, always illegal, was tackled by the UPSA executive, who persuaded club chairman that it was better to spend their resources on making their team better, rather than making other teams worse. The indoor sports and volleyball fraternities have been given their own administrative committees, and UPSA has a legal duty to promote these minority interests.
Above all, while making decisions and dispensing the rule of law you should incline to the constitution, Moses said with quiet pride. Alex Rwinomugisha, the chair of the referees committee joined us as Hannover 96 squeezed past Newcastle United. An imperiously tall former solider, imprisoned for 20 years for shooting a man, Rwinomugisha agreed that the constitution is important. But, he added, the rule of law needs referees as well as words, and of course no one wants to sponsor the referees. Did I see the kit they were wearing, the state of their boots? How can we improve as referees without coaching? I promised Alex that I would find them new kit for tomorrows final, and Moses that I would track down the goat.

20 March, final
Manchester United 5  1 Hannover 96
On the morning of the final, a marquee was erected. A table of honour was laid with the prisons cleanest white cloth and a plastic rose centrepiece. The Guardian Spring Trophy 2015 was placed behind it. The officer-in-charges straight-backed chair, with its brushed red velvet cushion, sat centre-stage. The inmates put on their smartest and cleanest kit, making their yellow and orange glow more incandescent than ever. Manchester United saved their best for last with official-looking away jerseys. Their opponents, who had hitherto played in the strip of the Portuguese national team and shirts that must have come for a Coca-Cola-sponsored youth tournament, had the real thing on today: maroon Hannover 96 jerseys. The referees were wearing the new matching black strips I had bought for them in downtown. They looked the part.
By mid-morning, two hours before kick-off, the musicians had arrived and old Congolese rumba crackled out of the prisons PA. The entertainment programme began with ritual circumcision dances from the north, wild hip-swirling gyrations, accompanied by harps and home-made pipes. A two-man wooden xylophone and drum ensemble combined to play traditional music from the east of the country. We heard dancehall reggae tunes that declaimed the pain of prison life, and comic African pop on the importance of the soap bar in the economics of the jail.
The final itself was a walkover. Manchester United scored twice in the first half, wobbled for a moment at 2-1, and then scored three more. At the final whistle, their small coterie of flag-wavers did half a victory lap but everyone else, even the team, headed for the marquee, the shade and the prizes. Magomu, the officer-in-charge, was stern, but visibly swelling with pride that his inmates had put on such an extraordinary show of organisation, or as he liked to say, maximum discipline.

Opio Moses addressed the crowd: Generally a prisoner is deemed, and is by definition, a person quite incapable of following and abiding by established laws and regulations. Soccer tends to correct this disability. He also asked that I become UPSAs official ambassador to the Premier League. I promised that they will get their place in the global history of football, and that I would come back and see them again.
It was time for the prizes, hastily distributed from the table of honour as the clock ticked towards lock-up time. Manchester United got the new set of jerseys, Hannover 96 were awarded the goat, though it still had not shown up. The referees and the executive committee got sugar and soap, notebooks and pens. Everyone got toothbrushes: the clubs and committees, all the players and musicians, the Boma chief, the regimental police, the cobbler who makes boots last forever and, finally, the line-markers and net man. (Most inmates do not posses a functioning toothbrush.)
The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for the announcement that I had stumped up for a new satellite decoder for the TV that sits in its own corrugated iron hut, and enough of a subscription to get the men through to the end of the Premier League season. The goat, it later transpired, had been delivered to the wrong address and had been eaten. (Measures have been taken to purchase a replacement.)

Police in the Ecuadorian port city of Manta say they have seized about 200,000 shark fins destined to be illegally exported to Asia where they would fetch up to $1.5m.
Colonel Rommel Tapia, the head of the judicial police in Manta, said on Thursday nine properties were raided in the city and six people were arrested, including one of Chinese nationality. Those arrested face charges of damaging wildlife.
The interior minister, Jos Serrano, told the Democracia radio station that authorities in Ecuador had dealt a major blow to an international network that trafficked shark fins.
The fins are often used to make shark fin soup, a traditional Chinese dish.
Manta is 260 kilometres south-west of the capital, Quito.

        <title>Khorasan: are Syria's mysterious 'strangers with horses' a threat to the west?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/28/khorasan-a-syrian-mystery</Link>

In Idlib province, they are known as the strangers with the horses. Among the senior ranks of Jabhat al-Nusra, they are referred to as our friends. In Europe and the US, the small band of jihadis is known by the contentious name Khorasan and blamed for hatching plots to attack the west.
All seem to agree on one thing: just what the highly secretive group is up to in northern Syria remains one of the civil wars enduring mysteries. This week, the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra claimed there was no such group as Khorasan and said he had been directed by al-Qaidas central leadership to concentrate his groups energies on Syria .
Abu Mohamed al-Jolanis remarks, in an interview with al-Jazeera, were the first time that al-Nusra  a jihadi organisation with links to al-Qaida and a formidable player in the Syrian war  had addressed the issue of Khorasan, which the US accuses of collaborating with al-Nusra to target western interests outside of Syria.
The remarks were immediately rejected by western officials and residents of Idlib. Two senior Islamists with close links to al-Nusra have also outlined to the Guardian in recent weeks their understanding of Khorasans intent and its close ties to homegrown jihadi groups.
Until recently they wanted nothing to do with the Syrian war, said one ranking official. They only wanted to use Syria as a stadium for whatever they were up to elsewhere.
But thats different now. In the attack on Idlib city they played a direct role. They co-ordinated most of the dangerous attacks. Without them, Idlib would not have fallen.
Related: Syria not a launching pad for attacks on west says al-Nusra chief in TV interview
The claim that Khorasan had played a direct role in helping jihadi and mainstream elements of the Syrian opposition seize a major city marks the first time that any official has been prepared to acknowledge working alongside the group. They are a very big secret, you know, the official said. They work directly for [al-Qaida leader Ayman] al-Zawahiri.
Until recently, all residents and jihadis interviewed by the Guardian had painted a picture of a remote and impenetrable outfit that kept entirely to itself and whose members regularly moved to avoid US air strikes.
On the first night of a US-led air campaign, ostensibly to attack the Islamic State group last September, three bases for Jabhat al-Nusra and a second jihadi group, Ahrar al-Sham, were bombed in the opening salvoes.
The attacks killed more than 70 militants and Washington claimed to have struck cells of leaders who had been seconded to Khorasan and tasked with scoping for targets outside of Syria.
Both groups quickly denied any connection to Khorasan, and vowed vengeance against the US. Al-Nusra officials claimed they had not heard of Khorasan, leading the US to claim it had been monitoring its growth for more than two years as the opposition landscape had splintered and radicalised in parts of Syrias north. Two local residents say the people they referred to as the strangers with horses first moved into the Idlib countryside early in 2013.
They were from all the places that end in stans, said one man. Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, places like that. They dressed like Osama bin Ladens mujahideen and they slept in the forests with their horses next to them. Big, beautiful stallions. They wanted nothing to do with us, or any of the opposition groups.
A second resident said that the group was known locally as Khorasan by the end of 2013. Although it became difficult to know who was directly with them and who was with [al-Nusra]. They started to become similar.
But until the Americans bombed them, we didnt know what they were up to. And we still dont.
One senior jihadi confirmed to the Guardian that the groups leader was Muhsin al-Fadhli, a veteran of al-Qaida who had travelled to Syria at the beginning of 2013 along with a small number of other members of Ayman al-Zawahiris inner circle.
The US government claims that al-Fadhli, a Kuwaiti, was one of the few Bin Laden confidantes who knew about the 9/11 attacks ahead of them being carried out.
The Pentagon claimed to have killed al-Fadhli during an air strike on 22 September, but later said he had survived the strike. A French jihadi, David Drugeon, was believed to have been badly wounded.
Critics of the US decision to fight Isis in Syria and Iraq point to Khorasans complete lack of profile before the air strikes and claim its emergence was a convenient pretext to justify intervention.
Local officials, though, say the group was gathering strength throughout 2014. One official said Khorasan leaders now remained on the move to avoid air strikes. Everywhere they go, the Americans are looking for them, he said. Their houses get blown up all the time.
I dont doubt that they are planning something outside Syria. But it is impossible to know. There are no Syrians working directly for them. Only big men from al-Qaida. To be honest, when they worked with Nusra in Idlib, it was the first time.
In denying Khorasans existence, or being linked to any plan to attack targets outside of Syria, Jolani appeared to be positioning al-Nusra as a more palatable jihadi current, distinct from the unchecked savagery of Isis.
However, western officials say Khorasan remain near the top of the list of potential threats to the US, the UK and Europe, with no sign that any order from Zawahiri had eased the threat.
They are more prominent than before, said the second Nusra-aligned leader. The one thing that hasnt changed though is that no one wants to speak about them.

        <title>Christine Lagarde's strong stance reveals weakness of Greek position</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/28/christine-lagardes-strong-stance-reveals-weakness-of-greek-position</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
For anyone who believes Greece should stick with the euro, her comments were ominous. Christine Lagarde , the boss of the International Monetary Fund, said Greeces exit from the eurozone is a possibility  but it would not signify an end to the single currency.
Together, these statements show that while a Greek exit is not the preferred option, it is a realistic proposition for which plans have been made.
The force of Lagardes statement reveals the weakness of the stance taken by the radical leftist Syriza party, which governs Greece, in negotiations over the past four months.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the arguments over Athens debt, and the prospects for growth while that debt weighs on the public finances, the countrys major lenders  of which the IMF is the third largest  have tired of Syriza.
And there is support from unlikely places. Portugal and Ireland, both run by right-of-centre coalitions, want Syriza to emerge empty-handed despite the prospect of cheaper credit that could follow a Brussels rethink.
The governments in Dublin and Lisbon must soon face elections and want to defeat their own versions of Syriza.
Spain is also an enemy of Athens now that the popularity of the Peoples party (PP) led by Mariano Rajoy has slumped and he faces defeat in an election later this year.
Lagarde went on to say, in effect, that optimistic speeches by Greek ministers  and finance chief Yanis Varoufakis is a culprit in this instance  are so much hot air.
Speaking at the G7 summit, she obviously felt comfortable issuing the warning, knowing that her supporters remain solid. Syrizas abject failure in garnering alternative funds  from the Russians in particular  has further weakened Athens stance.
It wasnt always the case. There have been times when senior officials in Brussels and the IMF have shown their sympathy for a country that must spend the next 42 years paying back an average of 10bn (7bn) a year to the IMF, the European Central Bank, the EU and each EU country that has made loans separately  not to mention the private sector creditors.
They understand that Greece cannot repay loans at this level, especially when they are front-loaded with a 38bn repayment this year.
But Lagarde wants Syriza to adopt her policies of austerity to create a budget surplus and refuses to accept anything less. The doubters in her own ranks appear to have been demoted or cast aside.
In the next few days a capitulation of sorts by Syriza must be the result. With the cupboard bare, prime minister Alexis Tsipras must consider how to pay public sector wages and vital welfare payments.
He will need all his political skill to present his defeat as a victory.
Zero hours + zero bonus for those who flog trainers and themselves

If we needed another example of the growing divide between young workers  most of them on short-term, flexible contracts  and those, usually older, who have secured a better deal, then look no further than Sports Direct.
This not a story about the largesse enjoyed by the boss, Mike Ashley , who is well-known for his wealth. This is a more commonplace tale of those with skills and experience taking what is left on the table after the boss has taken his slice.
Sports Direct is now justly infamous for its zero-hour contracts. Most of the 14,800 shop workers on zero-hours terms must accept the minimum wage and few fringe benefits.
None of them will enjoy even a tiny fraction of the 34m bonus pool that will be awarded to Sports Direct staff, it emerged on Thursday. This will go to 3,000 head office staff and shop managers.
To some it will be equivalent to a lottery win. A number of longstanding staff gained 100,000 plus under the previous bonus scheme  the same people who qualify for pensions and sick leave when zero-hours staff do not.
While it is true that many of the workers on zero hours are students who enjoy flexible working, as ministers in this and the last government have emphasised, it is worth saying again that zero hours consigns people with families to a hand-to-mouth existence where credit is more expensive, if not impossible to find.
Ashley has failed to take the hint from countless stories by staff past and present that resentment is rife on the shopfloor. He could probably afford to ignore pleas for greater fairness in a post-crash world of plentiful labour and declining welfare payments.
Finding staff over the next few years should prove more difficult given the tightening labour market, but the next wave of welfare cuts will probably give workers reason to have two or three part-time jobs, not just one.
And this supply of cheap labour will allow him to generate the next batch of bonuses.

The US-trained commander of Tajikistans elite police force has appeared in a YouTube video announcing his defection to Islamic State .
Colonel Gulmurod Khalimov, 40, who commanded the central Asian nations special-purpose police force known as Omon, disappeared in late April, prompting a search by Tajik police.
He reappeared on Wednesday, dressed in black, brandishing a sniper rifle and vowing to bring jihad to Russia and the Unites States, in a 10-minute video clip posted online.
Listen, you dogs, the president and ministers, if only you knew how many boys, our brothers, are here, waiting and yearning to return to Tajikistan to re-establish sharia law there, he said, addressing the Tajik president, Imomali Rakhmon. We are coming for you, inshallah.
Rakhmon has run Tajikistan, the poorest post-Soviet nation, since 1992. He used Russian support to crush Islamist guerrillas in a 1992-97 civil war and tolerates little dissent. His government has been criticised by rights groups for everything from forced beard shavings to numerous convictions of believers on religious extremism grounds.
In the video, Khalimov asked soldiers whether they were prepared to die for a government that cracks down on public expressions of Islam such as wearing a hijab and praying in the street.
He said he had been trained by elite Russian spetsnaz forces in Moscow and US special forces in America.
Listen, you American pigs, Ive been three times to America, and I saw how you train fighters to kill Muslims, he said, patting his rifle. God willing, I will come with this weapon to your cities, your homes, and we will kill you.
He appealed to the more than one million Tajik nationals working in Russia to cease being slaves and join Isis.
Tajikistans interior ministry refused to comment on the video.
Both Russia and Nato, alarmed by the threat posed by radical Islam to predominantly Muslim central Asia, have stepped up military drills with the regions post-Soviet nations. The International Crisis Group thinktank estimates that about 4,000 central Asians fight for Islamic State.
Alexander Knyazev, a Kazakhstan-based central Asia analyst, said Khalimovs defection showed that some local security units could not be trusted.
I think Islamist propaganda will now exploit Khalimovs example in full, he told Reuters, adding that volatile neighbouring Kyrgyzstan faced similar problems.

Garda officer prosecuted in Ireland for speaking to journalist
Former head of Irish police press office allegedly breached law that civil liberties campaigners say is designed to prevent police whistleblowing

A serving garda superintendent and former head of the Irish polices press office has been arrested over claims he spoke to a journalist without authorisation.
The officer is being prosecuted under Section 62 of the Garda Sochna Act 2000 which civil liberties groups have criticised as draconian and designed to gag the media in Ireland.
The superintendent was arrested over claims he unlawfully briefed a journalist about the Garda Sochnas controversial seizure of two Roma children in October 2013, which the force wrongly believed had been abducted from non-Roma families somewhere in Europe.
The two Roma childrens families are currently suing the Irish state over the wrongful removal of each child.
The children were taken from their families after a wholly incorrect rumour started on Facebook that because they had blonde hair they did not belong to their Roma parents. The rumour was started after a controversy in Greece over a blonde-haired child who was being looked after by a Roma family .
The garda officer held a senior position in the forces press office at the time of the controversy and his supporters have told the Guardian that he believed he had lawfully briefed a journalist about the errors made by officers to forcibly remove the Roma children.
If convicted of breaching Section 62 of the Garda Sochna Act he could face up to seven years in jail and lose his pension.
He was arrested after he arrived at a Co Dublin garda station by appointment at 7.30am this morning. He has been suspended from duty by the head of the force, garda commissioner Nirn OSullivan.
The investigation is being led by a chief superintendent and a detective superintendent based in a Dublin city centre garda station.
The garda press office in Dublin would neither confirm nor deny the officers arrest.
Journalists working in the Irish Republic alongside civil liberties organisations have criticised Section 62 and have claimed it is designed to prevent whistleblowing within the force.
Reporters have claimed there is now a climate of fear among garda rank and file, and officers to speak out to the media about any controversies or wrong-doings within the Irish police force.
A number of investigative journalists told the Guardian last year that they believed senior command within the garda ordered searches of their phone records in order to track potential telephone or mobile traffic between reporters and members of the force.
Several of these journalists have lodged complaints with the police watchdog body, the garda ombudsman.

The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that a Greek exit from the eurozone is a possibility as debt talks reach a critical stage.
Christine Lagarde said a deal with Athens was unlikely to be reached over the next few days, as the indebted country strives to meet a 5 June deadline for a 305m (218m) payment to the IMF. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , the IMF managing director said: A Greek exit is a possibility.
Lagarde added that such a step would not be a walk in the park, but would probably not mean the end of the euro.
The IMF head is attending a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 leading nations in Dresden, where the crisis in Greece was discussed, though it was not on the formal agenda.
Her comments came as Athens lead negotiator admitted Greece required intervention at the highest political level in Europe in order to seal an agreement after acknowledging that ongoing negotiations in Brussels would not achieve a final deal.
Euclid Tsakalotos, the deputy foreign minister who is now leading Greeces negotiating team, said both sides were drawing closer together but a final trade-off would have to take place between senior political figures.

Tsakalotos, speaking from the Belgian capital, where the so-called Brussels Group of technical teams resumed talks on Thursday, said: The [two sides] will never converge completely but the general impression is that they are converging.
There is now a reasonable chance that whatever convergence still needs to be done after the Brussels Group will be done at a higher level where politicians will be called in for the final trade-off and will bridge the gap.
Tsakalotos has been coordinating Athens negotiating team since last month, when the combative finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was sidelined after repeatedly riling Greeces creditors with his controversial public statements.
Of the two-and-a-half-hour talks Alexis Tsipras , the Greek prime minister, had with his French and German counterparts on the sidelines of the EU summit in Latvia last week, Tsakalotos added: The meeting with Hollande and Merkel in Riga went very well.
But the Oxford-educated economics professor suggested the negotiators could only go so far. The Brussels Group works in little boxes, ticking off [issues], there is no trade-off there, he said, adding that talks on Thursday would focus on VAT.
For Athens, he said, negotiations boiled down to what we are willing to give, what are our red lines and what we are going to get.
Tsakalotos, who has infused a more measured tone into the talks, blamed some of the lack of headway on the hardened stance of the IMF. On Wednesday, Tsipras accused lenders of holding back progress because of their different approaches.
The IMF is being very, very tough on all the issues and not really engaging in proper discussion, Tsakalotos said.
The IMF is said to be insisting that Athens must be offered debt relief if its future repayments are to be manageable, but that would mean lenders, including the European Central Bank , writing off some of the Greek debts they own. That proposal is being resisted by other members of what was known as the creditors troika of the IMF, the EU and the ECB, before Syriza insisted that the hated term be dropped.
Lagardes downbeat tone contrasted with suggestions from a government spokesman earlier in the day that a deal could be done as early as this Sunday.
Depending on developments, the Greek side may well request a euro group meeting of finance ministers on either the 3 June or 4 June  the eve of the first in a series of loan instalments it must make to the IMF next month. Any agreement could then be ratified by European leaders at an EU summit later in the month.
Tsakalotos repeated that the leftist Greek government was not interested in drafting an agreement that would ensure liquidity only for June when it faced such a heavy debt repayment schedule throughout the summer, with repayments on ECB bonds worth 6.7bn due in July and August alone.
The two negotiations [long- and short-term] are de facto merging given that it is now 28 May, he said. We are now looking at a medium-term deal, maybe a year, so that we are given some macro-economic space to carry out our programme.
Syrizas coalition government was elected on a wave of popular support with a pledge to reject austerity and reverse some of the painful reforms imposed by the troika. But it looks increasingly likely that it will have to compromise.
The consequences of the failure so far to secure a deal were underlined in the ECBs twice-yearly financial stability review , published earlier on Thursday. Sovereign risks emanating from Greece, in particular, have increased sharply owing to heightened political uncertainty over the past six months, while the banking sector in Greece has witnessed substantial deposit outflows, a loss of access to the wholesale funding market and deteriorating asset quality, the report warned.

Related: Methodist Church in Britain apologises for historical abuse
In a 100-page report published by the church on Thursday, ministers or lay employees are said to have been involved in a quarter of the cases, which included sexual, physical, emotional and domestic abuse as well as neglect.
In the 200 cases concerning ministers, 102 were of a sexual nature. There were six ongoing police investigations.
The report, called Courage, Cost and Hope, follows a three-year independent review commissioned by the church to learn lessons of the past and to make the church safe for all. The reports author, Jane Stacey, called for major and far-reaching changes both in practice and culture.
Childrens charity NSPCC described it as a horrifying catalogue of abuse.
Rev Dr Martyn Atkins, general secretary of the Methodist Conference, said it was deeply regrettable that the church had not always listened properly to those abused.
On behalf of the Methodist Church in Britain I want to express an unreserved apology for the failure of its current and earlier processes fully to protect children, young people and adults from physical and sexual abuse inflicted by some ministers, Atkins said in a statement.
The abuse that has been inflicted by some Methodists on children, young people and adults is and will remain a deep source of grief and shame to the church.
The review looked at safeguarding cases for which there were written records, and also cases recalled from memory by ministers and church members going back to 1950. Cases examined include those that occurred within a church context and those reported to the church but which occurred away from it. Alleged perpetrators ranged from ministers to church attendees.
It examined each case to review whether the churchs response had been safe, pastorally appropriate and compliant with legislation, and whether it had been referred to police, if that was deemed appropriate, or if other remedial action had been taken.
Stacey, former deputy chief executive of childrens charity Barnardos, said religious ministers were in an almost unique position of trust often at vulnerable times in peoples lives. She told BBC Radio 4s Today programme there needed to be more robust accountability structures.
One case concerned the grooming of teenage girls on Facebook; another involved a youth officer who had indecent images of children on his computer.
Among victims who came forward was a man in his 30s, allegedly abused in the early 1990s by a church youth worker, who is now a lay pastor and youth worker in four churches. The alleged perpetrator has been suspended while a police investigation takes place.
The review found four alleged victims of a minister jailed for sexually assaulting children. Two of the alleged victims had made complaints which are being investigated by police. The minister was allowed to retire on compassionate grounds, which caused great offence to victims and their families, the report said.
Of the 1,885 cases, 187 alleged perpetrators were still alive and known to safeguarding teams. More than half (1,011) of the cases were closed as there was no longer an identifiable risk, while 687 cases (36%) were open to further action. Around half (914) of all cases were of a sexual nature. In 241 responses the respondent felt that matters were not left safely and that there may still be a risk to children or vulnerable adults.
Children aged under 18 made up 34% of victims. Those over 18 made up 31%, and the ages of the rest were unknown. Almost half (46%) of victims in the cases were female, and 19% male but in 29% the gender of the vicim was unknown.
One victim told the review team: I have learned that it is impossible to recover from sexual abuse when no one recognises the seriousness of it. My church did not want a scandal, my parents did not want a scandal. I was left to feel worthless and devalued, while the man was left to get on with his life and, for all I know, repeat the crime with someone else. 
Others welcomed the report and opportunity to tell their story. A candle is lit and it is no longer completely dark, said one. I want to prevent the church and other people from handling things wrong in the future. I dont want other girls to suffer like I have.
The NSPCC said: This is a horrifying catalogue of abuse that the Methodist Church has revealed by confronting the dark side of its history. Having the courage to come clean about the extent of abuse, [the church] must now have measures in place to ensure there are no more such incidents and all children they have dealings with are given the protection and support they deserve.
Law firm Leigh Day, representing a group of individuals taking action against the Methodist Church who allege they were abused by a church missionary in Africa in the 1980s, welcomed the investigation. It has taken my clients over 30 years to have the courage to come forward with their allegations of abuse against the Methodist Church, said Nichola Marshall, the firms head of international abuse.
They welcome this public acknowledgment by the Methodist Church as they have faced criticism and disapproval from members of the community for speaking out in the past.

A judge has acquitted a Chicago man of animal cruelty charges filed after the man posted a video of himself smoking marijuana with a chameleon.
After viewing the video and hearing the arguments of prosecutors and the defence, Cook county Circuit Judge Robert Kuzas ruled that Bruce Blunts behaviour was uncalled for and immature but did not amount to criminality.
Blunt had posted a Facebook video of himself smoking marijuana with the chameleon, Binna. It prompted a complaint from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .
After his acquittal Blunt said he blew smoke into the chameleons mouth because it seemed to calm the aggressive reptile.
The Chicago Tribune reported that Blunt said he hoped to get the chameleon back from Chicago Animal Care and Control.

Malaysian authorities said on Thursday they were investigating official complicity and links to the shocking discovery of a network of people-smuggling camps and mass graves hidden in the jungle.
Deputy home minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said two police officers had been arrested, fuelling long-standing criticism by rights groups over a lack of action against alleged official involvement in the illicit trade.
Two police officers who are suspected of involvement in transporting the people from Myanmar [Burma] have been arrested, he told reporters in Wang Kelian, the Malaysias border town near the discovery of the camps.
He declined to comment on whether more police officers might be involved, saying authorities would investigate everybody and anybody. He also said several Rohingya who were already in Malaysia were arrested for helping to recruit migrants to the country.
Malaysia announced this week it had uncovered 28 camps deep in the jungle in the countrys north, close to the Thai border, and 139 grave sites scattered around the area.
It was the latest shocking development in Asias migrant crisis, which has exposed the plight of Rohingya Muslims from Burma who are fleeing persecution and of Bangladeshis escaping poverty, brought by boat to the dense forests of southern Thailand and northern Malaysia by people smugglers.
The authorities have faced criticism following the discovery, with mounting questions about their failure to detect the sites earlier and whether police may have been complicit.
The Guardian talked to a number of residents in Wang Kelian this week who said migrants had been coming out of the jungle for at least two years  indicating that the problem was not new.
But the police defended themselves, saying they had swept a distance of 48 kilometres along the Malaysia-Thai border, although admitting that they could have focused on the wrong area.
We focused on the people smuggling routes, deputy national police chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim said. Normally, smuggling routes are areas which are accessible, where people can walk to.
Thats why we didnt go to the top of the hill.
He said the police only decided to comb every inch of our land after Thailand found mass graves in early May.
Ibrahim argued that signs from the camps, along with wooden sticks used to build structures and the clothes used to wrap the bodies, still appeared new, suggesting that the camps had not been around for long.
But human rights groups said they began passing information about the camps to authorities years ago but no action was taken, according to anti-trafficking expert Matthew Friedman, the former regional head of the United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking.
Officials have now begun the grisly task of exhuming bodies from the 139 grave sites. Four have been found so far, minister Wan Junaidi said.
He also said indications so far were that each single grave site only contained one body based on the size of the site and how it was marked with sticks and stones. Officials said previously the grave sites might have contained multiple bodies.
Its one person, one grave, he said. Its a proper burial ground, like a graveyard, not mass graves.
The Guardian visited one of the camps in the jungle on Tuesday, and saw first hand indications of the horrific abuse meted out to the migrants.
At the camp, which is reached after a two-hour hike up a steep jungle path, there was a watchtower, cages and a large wooden enclosure wrapped in barbed wire. It is believed that the camp had been abandoned only recently.
The massive scale and sophistication of the camp, which could hold up to 500 people, police said, suggested machinery could have been used in building it and that it had a certain degree of permanence, raising further questions over failure to detect it.
Many Rohingya, a Muslim minority persecuted in Burma , and Bangladeshis, normally trying to escape grinding poverty in their homeland, reach the jungle camps after harrowing journeys on overcrowded boats.
They are dumped there by people smugglers and held in pitiful conditions until their families can pay ransoms for their release, after which they normally seek work in Malaysia, where they are quietly welcomed as a source of cheap labour.
Malaysia is currently listed at tier 3 in the US State Departments annual human-trafficking report, the lowest tier for countries which are failing to stop the illicit trade.
A report in 2009 by the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which was based on a year-long review, found that a few thousand Burmese migrants had become victims of extortion and trafficking once they were deported across Malaysias border with Thailand.
In addition, it said there were questions about the level of participation of government officials in Malaysia and Thailand.

Hong Kongs leader was challenged to step down on Thursday as he clashed with angry pro-democracy lawmakers over the governments controversial electoral reform package, which goes to a vote next month.
Chief executive Leung Chun-ying dodged the resignation question and told legislators the city was at a critical juncture, urging them to support the roadmap for leadership elections in 2017  the first ever public vote for the chief executive.

Pro-democracy lawmakers have vowed to block the package when it goes to the vote in June, calling it fake democracy as candidates for leader will be vetted by a loyalist committee, a stipulation laid down by Beijing .
Beijings decision sparked more than two months of street rallies late last year, which brought parts of the city to a standstill.
James To of the Democratic party asked Leung whether he would step down to take responsibility if the package were rejected, a question Leung did not answer directly.
If Legco [legislative council] members do not endorse the proposal, will people ask them to step down? a riled Leung countered.
Two lawmakers were removed from the heated question-and-answer session for heckling, one holding a yellow umbrella, symbol of the democracy movement, and another shouting Liar!.
Pro-democracy legislators had also brought cardboard cut-outs of deer, printed with the Chinese character for horse. They reflected the Chinese idiom, Point at a deer, call it a horse, used to refer to deliberate misrepresentation.
Leung argued that the government had majority support from residents for the election proposal, citing unspecified opinion polls as backing the plan by 50%-60%.
The government has asked all 70 Hong Kong legislators to meet with Beijing officials in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Sunday to discuss the plan.
But pan-democrat lawmakers questioned what could be achieved, with both Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities consistently saying that they cannot diverge from the candidate screening policy.
What are we doing in Shenzhen? There is no room for modifications, pro-democracy lawmaker Ray Chan said in a furious exchange with Leung.
Fifteen pro-democracy lawmakers  with 12 opting out  have said they will attend Sundays meeting with three Beijing officials who deal with Hong Kong affairs.
Authorities have been criticised by pan-democrats for scheduling the meeting on the same day as a march in Hong Kong to mark the anniversary of Beijings Tiananmen Square crackdown .

One week ago a letter, lengthy but beautifully written, was posted online calling for the Chinese government to end its long-standing secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre. In one part it boldly proclaimed: The butcher must stand trial.
It was signed by 11 Chinese students, mainly living in the US with one from Britain. The eleventh and final name belonged to Wu Lebao, a 31-year-old Chinese refugee living in Melbourne.

Wu describes the bloodshed of 4 June 1989, when the Chinese government opened fire on hundreds of students who had been calling for democracy, as the day authorities want people to forget. When he was a student in China his history textbook dedicated just one sentence to the incident, trivialising it as political turmoil.
That was the closest we came to achieving democracy, says Wu. Many people died and lots of people lost their family, friends and classmates.
The letters public critique of the government is unusual, more so because it comes from a new generation of Chinese students who are too young to remember the massacre first-hand and have grown up in a ruthless media blackout, with government censors actively scrubbing the Chinese internet clean of any frank discussion about that fateful week in 1989.
A fraction of Chinas 600 million internet users, including Wu, use a VPN to jump the firewall and access censored content and global perspectives on blocked sites like Twitter.
The letter triggered an angry editorial by Chinas nationalist paper The Global Times, which accused the authors of trying to tear society apart, adding: When China is moving forward, some are trying to drag up history in an attempt to tear apart society.
The lead signatory to the letter, Gu Yi, called the papers response the best advertisement the letter could have ever received.
Last week the Chinese president Xi Jinping rallied overseas students to serve the country and become a united front  a term Wu says was first applied by Chairman Mao. Even in western countries most Chinese students are under the control of Chinese authorities, he says.
Not one of the Chinese student groups at any Australian university can be called autonomous and they are all funded by the Chinese embassy, he claims. Student leaders overseas are not elected but installed by the Chinese government, just as they are at home, he says.
Political action is considered a taboo subject in China, one in which personal risks are high and the rewards low. I was imprisoned for it  so it is dangerous, Wu says. He used to work as a lecturer at a training college in Bengbu, a town in the northern Chinese province of Anhui, and says some of his fellow teachers knew nothing of the massacre.
Wu is in the habit of apologising for his heavy Chinese accent, yet he commands an impressive vocabulary, using words like apostate and jingoist. He describes one of his tweets  the one eventually used by authorities as evidence to detain him  as doggerel, poetry that is irregular in rhythm and rhyme, often deliberately for burlesque or comic effect.

In 2011 whispers that the political uprising in Tunisia, known as the Jasmine Revolution, would come to China were blowing like seeds in the wind. While the talk bore no real fruit, the rumours alone were enough to rattle the authorities who came crashing down on anyone suspected of being involved.
Wu had visited Chinese artist and famous pot-stirrer Ai Wei Wei in his Beijing studio earlier that year. Authorities would later use this fact and cherry pick a few of Wus tweets, including one that stated if you hold jasmine in your hand the police will arrest you, as evidence he had plans to incite an overthrow of the government  something Wu denies.
After 107 days of detention, filled with endless hours of interrogation, Wu was released to house arrest. The following year he decided he could no longer live under such conditions and in early 2013 fled to Australia where he was eventually granted refugee status.
Wu lives a lonely life in Melbourne. At times he is gripped by powerful feelings of homesickness. Sometimes in my dreams Im in China, he says. After I wake up I must find something, like a flag, to make sure I am in Australia. He is on medication to treat his depression; he does not know when he will see his family in China again and is concerned for their safety.
In the south-west Melbourne suburb of Leveton, he keeps his refugee status hidden from his Chinese landlord and flatmate. A previous tenancy application had been rejected after the landlord searched his name and uncovered his history.
Renting hasnt been easy without steady work, but he has a part-time job managing a website and every afternoon takes English classes at a language centre for new migrants.
Right now his goals are modest. I want to improve my English, he says. Then I will apply to go to university and continue my study.
He has few Chinese friends. There is a kind of gap between him and other young Chinese people in Australia. I know some Chinese students in Australia, for example, he says, who will tell their teachers and classmates, If you want to keep me in this classroom, you cant criticise the Chinese political system.
They think if you criticise the party, you criticise China. And if you criticise China, you insult them. In my opinion, thats very ridiculous.
Wu, on the other hand, is taking full advantage of Australias relative freedom of expression and has felt more responsibility to say something about Chinese politics since his exile. He says on the whole western countries are deluded in thinking the political situation in China is getting better. On the contrary, he says, its becoming worse.
But he still hopes it will improve. Not just the Communist regime being overthrown, but many deep-rooted aspects of Chinese culture need to be revolutionised, he says. Every culture has its pros and cons. Something wrong cannot be justified simply because it belongs to a culture.

Dalai Lama urges Suu Kyi to speak out on Burma's persecuted Rohingya people
The Burmese opposition leader has failed to act on the worsening Rohingya crisis, possibly fearful of alienating voters before elections later this year

The Dalai Lama has urged fellow Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to do more to help Burmas persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority in a worsening migration crisis.
Despite thousands of Rohingya fleeing on harrowing boat journeys to south-east Asia to escape poverty and discriminatory treatment by the countrys Buddhist majority, opposition leader Suu Kyi is yet to comment .
Observers have attributed this to fears about alienating voters ahead of elections expected in November.
Related: Why is Aung San Suu Kyi silent on the plight of the Rohingya people?
The Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader said Suu Kyi must speak up, adding that he had already appealed twice to her in person since 2012, when deadly sectarian violence in Burmas Rakhine state pitted the Rohingya against local Buddhists, to do more on their behalf.
Its very sad. In the Burmese case I hope Aung San Suu Kyi, as a Nobel laureate, can do something, he told The Australians Thursday paper in an interview before a visit to Australia next week.
I met her two times, first in London and then the Czech Republic. I mentioned this problem and she told me she found some difficulties, that things were not simple but very complicated.
But in spite of that I feel she can do something.
The issue was thrown under the spotlight this month when thousands of Rohingya, together with Bangladeshi migrants, were rescued on south-east Asian shores after fleeing by boat .
The crisis has shone a spotlight on the dire conditions and discrimination faced by the roughly one million Rohingya in western Burma.
The Dalai Lama said it was not enough to ask how to help the Rohingya.
This is not sufficient, he said. Theres something wrong with humanitys way of thinking. Ultimately we are lacking concern for others lives, others wellbeing.
Seven camps  some with dozens of graves believed to contain the bodies of Rohingya  have been uncovered in Thailands Songkhla province close to the Malaysian border.

Istanbul shows ferries have a future
Critics say they are expensive, slow and can only reach selected parts of a city but  with New York and London planning expansions  ferry traffic is on the rise

The Istanbul rush hour commute is like no other. Passengers feast on toasted sandwiches, tea and freshly brewed coffee before taking one of a choice of seats. Some even get to light up a cigarette out the back.
Thats because 300,000 people in Turkeys biggest city take the ferry to work every day.
Besides enjoying a peaceful ride, it was the fastest way to reach the office, said graphic designer Baris Akdogan who took the boat between the citys European and Asian shores to work every day until early this year. The alternatives can be a real pain  [the] bus takes at least an hour or the subway can be really crowded, said fellow passenger Melike Son, a project manager who gets breakfast on board.
In Istanbul, more than 100 ferries and sea buses carry up to 2,100 commuters per trip with many routes served by eight departures an hour. The Istanbul Deniz Otobusleri (IDO) or Istanbul Sea Bus company, the largest maritime transport corporation in the world, carried 47 million passengers around the city last year, with a similar number using other ferry companies in the city.
But around the world, holding up ferry transport as a serious commuting alternative has regularly been ridiculed. Critics maintain they are too slow and expensive, can reach only selected parts of a city and are no match for mass transit systems such as subway trains or even buses.
Among the criticisms heard in New York are that fares are too expensive, winters are too cold, and the ferries too slow

In February, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio announced that a new ferry service for the city is to begin operating in 2017. New York is the ultimate coastal city, he said, and plans to spend $55m (36m) linking Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and elsewhere by boat. As in Istanbul, De Blasios plan would see ferry fares the same as bus and subway, and outlying districts are expected to enjoy increased service.
Currently New York misses an opportunity for market expansion by not being better integrated, said Roberta Weisbrod, a maritime consultant and executive director of Worldwide Ferry Safety Association. But there are strong hopes that that will change in the near future.
Among the criticisms heard in New York is that fares are too expensive, winters too cold for ferry use and that ferries cant move people as quickly as subway trains.
My concerns are classic even among ferry enthusiasts [and] include whether specific routes will attract adequate ridership, require significantly higher levels of operating subsidies than other modes of transport, said Gene Russianoff from the Straphangers public transport advocacy organisation, who calls himself a ferry sceptic, not a ferry opponent.
Theres much world cities can learn from the example set by Turkeys biggest metropolis. Unlike Istanbuls ferry system, New Yorks Pier 11 at Wall Street, for example, has no bus or mass transit connections. Londons Woolwich Ferry is forced to compete with a footbridge and light rail serving the same route.
New Yorks proposed ferry network
Were well on our way to reaching our goal of getting 12 million passengers on the Thames by 2020, said Andy Thompson, Transport for Londons (TfLs) head of London river services, and TfL demand models suggest river bus commuter numbers could double in the next five years with the right investment in new piers and riverside development delivery.
But even if they do, ferry traffic would account for just 20 million of the current 3.5 billion annual journeys taken in London.
In other cities, ferry infrastructure is popular mainly because it is well integrated. Manly Wharf in Sydneys north-east is connected to a fleet of buses that move commuters deep into suburbia, and the Hong Kong-mainland China passenger ferry line is linked by coach to a host of Chinese provinces.
Something New York and many other city ferries lack are the lateral-thrust propellers that give many Istanbul boats a critical edge in attracting travellers. The propellers help ferries pull up alongside docks allowing passengers to embark and disembark quickly. In the way the airline Ryanair whittles profit from its ultra-quick turnaround schedule, the Istanbul ferry system is able to do likewise, and it must.
With projected ridership of over 36 million by 2018, ferry services are a substantial part of New York's transit mix
Istanbuls ferries remain popular because they are deeply connected to other transport systems. In Kadikoy, a teeming district on Istanbuls Asian shore, just 20 steps separate ferry stations from the entrance of a 16-stop metro line that stretches to the city southern limits. A two-minute walk brings commuters to a major bus terminal.
Whats more, Istanbul is able to call on a series of natural advantages many other cities cant. A history of popular, municipal-run ferry use dates back to 1853, predating the first Bosphorus bridge  the only alternative way to cross the city  by 120 years. As a result, much of Istanbuls central shoreline is publicly owned, unlike in cities across the Atlantic such as New York or San Diego. Pensioners (and accredited journalists) travel for free on Istanbuls public transport and locals say ferries are a link to the citys historical soul.
Despite this, the citys ferries face a challenging future. A city whose population has increased 15-fold since 1960 means residents are increasingly moving inland to find affordable housing . Despite the equivalent of the entire population of Pittsburgh using ferries every day, that represents just a tiny percentage of Istanbuls overall commuter total; the majority use metrobuses that run on dedicated highway lanes.
Local media reports that the IDO is losing money to a combination of competition and mismanagement, and city authorities are planning to reduce ferry services on some routes. Even as Istanbul has been recently noted as the worlds most congested city , ferry traffic is falling as authorities invest more in underwater rail and road transportation systems linking the European and Asian districts. And though its ferry service may be romantic and relaxing, it cant compete with modern technology: the recently opened Marmaray train line takes passengers under the Bosphorus Strait in just four minutes.
The future of ferry commuting will be coloured by faster, cleaner vessels  though experts say theyre unlikely to ever be the centrepiece of urban transportation. The Norwegian Zero Cat 120 , the worlds first battery-powered, zero-emission car ferry, is set to begin operating this year. However, this model needs to be recharged after every six-kilometre trip, and in cities prone to blackouts caused by storms and hurricanes, would result in chaos.
Related: Has the time come for floating cities?
Others look to forecasts of increased passenger traffic as a sign of the strength of the ferry. With projected ridership of over 36 million by 2018, ferry services are a substantial part of the transit mix in New York, said Roland Lewis of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, a pro-ferry non-governmental organisation.
Weisbrod thinks the broader future of urban ferry use looks similarly positive. It is an old form of transport that was supplanted by bus, auto and train [but] Sydney, Brisbane, Stockholm, London, New York and Bangkok already have linear urban ferries; Manila, the most dense city on earth, just started a linear urban service on the Passig River; Mumbai is considering coastal service, she said.
Now that those forms are suffering congestion, ferry transport is being reconsidered.

Learning from Seoul's Sampoong Department Store disaster  a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 44
After a string of ill-considered decisions led to the collapse of Seouls luxury department store and the death of 502 people in 1995, the disaster continues to offers an important lesson to other cities urbanising at such an impressive pace

Observers tend to describe the rise of South Korea as a miracle, and the actual story makes the word seem only a minor exaggeration. Having emerged an utter wreck from the Korean War in the early 1950s, by the 21st century the country had become a rich, infrastructurally impressive, technologically forward-thinking global economic and cultural force. But South Koreas unprecedentedly rapid entry into the first world has taken its tolls, and no one event of its dizzying 20th-century period of growth forced as many of its people to face them as the collapse of the Sampoong Department Store .
Those who endured the hardships of the Korean War and its aftermath had to welcome whatever prosperity the future could bring, despite the repression of the dictators who oversaw it and the grinding nature of a national life rigorously dedicated to nation-building. But from the 1970s through to the early 1990s, even the most development-minded Korean couldnt help but suspect that something had gone wrong. An apartment block falls to the ground, a hotel catches fire, a train station explodes, a bridge collapses : the built environment that had risen so recently and triumphantly around them had already begun to crumble.
From the beginning, South Korea has understood that development and urbanisation go hand in hand. In fact, it understands that almost too well, resulting in what ranks today as one of the most capital-centric countries in the world. The resources it has devoted to Seoul make the rest of South Korea seem almost like a mere support system for that 24-hour high-rise megalopolis of 25 million people, built over the rubble of the modest Japanese colonial city it had been before the second world war.
The creation of postwar Seoul involved plenty of rebuilding, but even more new building. The old city lies north of the Han River, which runs through Seoul much as the Thames does London. On the Hans other side, the area known as Gangnam (literally, south of the river), made famous in recent years by pop music and television dramas, has grown since the 1970s as a deliberately designed hub of private affluence, corporate investment, and skyline-defining towers  a concrete advertisement for just how far up South Korea has come in the world.
A former landfill in Gangnams especially wealthy district of Seocho made the perfect location for the upscale Sampoong Department Store. Construction on this bright pink symbol of Seouls advanced consumer culture began in 1987, the year South Korea became a democracy and the year before the modernised country made its debut on the world stage by hosting the Olympic Games.

But it didnt enter construction as a department store: the original plan called for a large four-storey apartment complex. After work had already begun, owner Lee Joon , in the first of many ill-considered decisions, switched the project from a residential one to a commercial one, a conversion which necessitated the removal of support columns to make room for escalators. When the contractors balked at this, Lee exchanged them for a more obedient in-house crew.
Using a building of this size entirely as a department store went against zoning regulations, which Lee circumvented by ordering the addition of a skating rink on an originally unplanned-for fifth floor. Again, when the first building company he hired advised against such a structure-compromising modification, he simply sacked them. The firm that did build the fifth floor even went along when he changed his mind once again, turning it into a gallery of restaurants heated by a system of under-floor hot-water pipes, increasing the stress on the already overburdened columns remaining.
Still, the Sampoong Department Store might stand today if not for the air-conditioning machinery installed on top. When tenants of neighbouring buildings to the east complained about the noise it made, management moved the three units to the west, not by lifting them with cranes, but by dragging them  their combined 45-tonne weight four times what the building was designed to handle  all the way across the roof. This opened up cracks that widened each and every morning the air conditioners clicked on and vibrated to life over the next two years.
Then came the morning of 29 June 1995. The structures visible cracks had widened alarmingly and continued to do so as the day wore on, provoking enough concern to force two executive decisions: first, to switch off the air conditioning, and second, to close the top floor. But Lee refused to evacuate the days unusually large and lucrative shopping crowd, and so in the store they remained at 5:52 pm, when the air-conditioning units fell through the roof and the support columns gave way, resulting in the deadliest building collapse since antiquity.

More than 500 people died in the Sampoong Department Store  not because of a gas explosion or a North Korean bomb (two early suspicions)  but because of sheer negligence in construction and maintenance of a building not yet six years old. As the facts emerged, Lee and his associates became the most reviled men in South Korea, not just for their own actions (most damningly, their selective evacuation of Sampoongs executives from the building, hours before the collapse) but for the shameful strain they represented in the countrys modern history: their reckless corner-cutting, bribery and irresponsibility, far from isolated tendencies, had become endemic in a society desperate to develop as rapidly as possible, a sensibility which renders the law nothing more than an obstacle to prosperity.
Endless Disaster, Disaster, Disaster, declared one local headline in the wake of the Sampoong collapse. Not only had the public caught on to that pattern, but the investigation of the Sampoong Group and the government officials with which they dealt threw light on a staggering depth and breadth of corruption. Worse still, the thoroughgoing inspection of Seouls by then proudly characteristic towers found that one out of seven needed rebuilding, four out of five needed major repairs, and just one in 50 could qualify as safe.
People should do their best at their jobs, said Jeong Gwang-jin, a prominent lawyer who lost three daughters in the Sampoong Department Store. This accident happened because they didnt. The prioritisation of size and quantity over safety and quality demanded by South Koreas ideology of accelerated nation-building, expressed as a practice of accelerated city-building, visited this resoundingly third-world accident on Seouls newly minted upper-middle class.

And Lee, born in 1922, would have come of age in a time when Korea was a land that still relied to a great extent on horse carts and thatched roofs, one where nobody considered the prospect of opulent shopping complexes, let alone of the prospect of opulent shopping complexes suddenly falling down. Like most of South Koreas ruling class in the 1970s and 1980s, Lee found himself in a position of power in a reality almost incomprehensibly different from any hed known before, with a mandate only to generate wealth, and he made decisions that reflected his circumstances.
The story offers a lesson to all the cities currently and dramatically expanding in developing countries over the world, most notably China, where the impressive and frightening aspects of South Koreas development now play out on a larger scale and shorter timeline. It also continues to offer a valuable lesson for South Korea. Despite the insistence that a Sampoong Department Store must never happen again, a similar disaster did indeed happen again: last year, this time at sea rather than in the city. On 16 April 2014, 304 passengers, many of them high school students, died in the sinking of the badly overloaded, procedurally unprepared MV Sewol , a tragedy which echoed not just Sampoong but the earlier MV Seohae, another ferry which claimed 292 lives when it went under in 1993.
On the whole, South Korea has built a formidable city in Seoul, and one that will serve ably as a model for other countries looking to craft world-class urban environments of their own. If a living city is a changing city, Seoul counts as one of the most intensely city-like cities going today. Seoul seems to remain in a constant state of architectural and infrastructural metamorphosis  and not always because pieces have fallen off. But that constant revision of the built environment can also feel like an erasure of history. Visit the site of the Sampoong Department Store, and youd never guess what happened there almost exactly 20 years ago  a luxury apartment complex now stands in its place.

        <title>Real street food: Spiced fish and rice from Dakar</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/27/spiced-fish-rice-dakar-senegal-recipe-real-street-food</Link>

Whats the dish?
There are about as many variations for spelling thiebou dieune (thiep bou dien, ceebu jn) as there are to making it. This rice (thieb) and fish (dieune) recipe is the national dish of Senegal , and can also be made with beef (thiebou yapp) or by swapping out the spicy tomato-based sauce for a milder seafood broth. Pull up at any roadside street food stall in Dakar and youll find it.
Whats the history?
The story goes that a woman by the name of Penda Mbaye is to be credited with creating thiebou dieune. She lived in Saint-Louis, Senegal, the former colonial capital of West Africa , and worked for the governor. Her first recipe used barley, but when there was a shortage she substituted rice and it took off from there, rising to be the national dish in Senegal and also very popular in Mauritania.
What does it taste like?
Comfort food with a kick. Its spicy and flavourful, but not overpoweringly hot. The fish itself is usually mild, but the broth is made with smoked fish and other seafood and used to infuse the rice with rich, bold flavours.
How is it served?
Normally you eat from this large common bowl, not from individual plates, using only your right hand. If youre in a house, not a street food stall, the host will divide up the fish and vegetables on to each persons rice portion in front of them. Take a piece of fish or vegetable and some rice in your right hand. Squeeze to make a small, tight ball and then pop it into your mouth.
Anything extra?
To each their own, but in general you might top it off with a fresh squeeze of lime juice, spicy hot piment sauce or xoon, bits of crispy, fried rice.
Why should someone try it?
First, because its the quintessential Dakar dish. But secondly, because its absolutely delicious.
Whats the bill?
In Dakar you can pull up a bench at a roadside stall and enjoy a plate of thiebou dieune for 500 Fcfa ($1). In upscale restaurants that cater to the tourist crowd, you can find yourself paying up to 7500 Fcfa ($15).
Where can you get it?
Thiebou dieune is available on street food stalls and is the daily special in family-style restaurants  you can even get it delivered, too. If youre invited to a Senegalese home, it will likely be the meal you are served. Le Galard restaurant in the Mdina neighbourhood is a Dakar institution, dating back to 1954. Youll find thiebou dieune on their menu every day and can eat it surrounded by the restaurants regulars who have been coming for 60 years.
Can you make it at home?
With a bit of patience and perseverance, you can learn to make thiebou dieune. But odds are good that it will never taste as good as when its served from a common bowl among friends seated on the floor outside.
What does this dish say about Dakar?
Come eat, come share. There is always room for one more person at the thieb bowl.
Thiebou dieune recipe (serves four)
Cloves from 1 garlic bulb
Large bunch fresh parsley
2 cubes of Maggi or Jumbo bouillon
1 tsp black pepper
 tsp dried red pepper flakes
160-240ml oil
Whole capitaine fish or red snapper, cleaned
2-3 ripe tomatoes, chopped

How Curitiba's BRT stations sparked a transport revolution  a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 43
When Curitibas bus rapid transit stations were revamped in 1991, the futuristic glass-tube stops became a new symbol for the Brazilian city

Rua Padre Anchieta, as one of the main thoroughfares in Curitiba, Brazil, is a logical focal point for the citys bus network. But whereas bus stops in many other cities consist of little more than a sign and perhaps a bench , the ones on Rua Padre Anchieta are a bit different. In the middle of the street sit two tube-shaped stations, raised from ground level and protected from the elements, that open on to two-way express lanes. These lanes are reserved for long orange buses, which zip past slower car traffic and quickly shuttle passengers on and off at the stations on outward-folding ramps. Stations like this now exist throughout the city and metropolitan area.
Though difficult to imagine, these distinctive stations that are now the symbol of the city were originally a cost-cutting measure. Implemented as a practical way for the city to create faster mass transit without breaking the bank, they would go on to revolutionise transport, not just in Curitiba but in cities around the world.
For much of its existence, Curitiba was a sleepy town eclipsed by So Paulo, its much larger neighbour to the north-east. But by 1960, the citys population was beginning to grow significantly and within 20 years it had surged from 120,000 people to 361,000. Planners began wondering how to cope with this growth, and initially, there were plans to make the city more like Brasilia, the nations newly built capital. Avenues were to be widened and the city centre was to be adapted so that cars could become the primary mode of transport.

However, these plans would be cut short when Curitiban architect Jaime Lerner, then in his early thirties, took office as mayor in 1971. Under the dictatorship ruling Brazil in the late 1960s, the local governor selected Lerner as mayor, confident that the young architect wouldnt challenge his political order.
Lerner immediately began to shake things up. His vision for Curitiba turned the conventional urban planning at play in Brasilia on its head. Instead of widening avenues, he created a pedestrian mall in the city centre. And rather than turning frequently flooding arroyos into concrete drainage canals, he dammed the small streams to create parks, which would close during floods. But his most memorable contribution came in his ideas for the citys bus network.
Realising the importance of mass transit, planners called for the creation of subway lines, as well as widened streets for cars  but construction would be costly and could take decades to complete.
Instead, Lerner saw an opportunity in the one form of transport that many considered a lost cause: the bus. His idea was to devise a system that gave buses as many of the functional advantages of urban train systems as possible. He proposed to integrate dedicated bus lanes along the citys main arteries, with stations placed on medians along the routes. This would allow buses to run at speeds comparable to light rail, while dramatically reducing the cost.
A savvy deal-maker, Lerner made a bargain with private bus operators to pay for the creation of the new infrastructure, while they would provide the vehicles in exchange. With this trade-off in place, the first rapid bus lanes of Curitiba ended up costing 50 times less than rail.

Though the system wasnt an instant success after the opening of the first line in 1974, it gradually worked its way into the livelihoods of residents. In 1979, Lerner created the Rede Integrada de Transporte (Integrated Transport Network) to better manage the system and, as new routes were added, it began to show its full potential. By 1993, it was carrying 1.5 million passengers a day.
But high ridership created a problem. Buses in the system still used conventional boarding systems, where passengers entered through the front of the bus and paid fares on board. Lerner, who was back in office for his third term as mayor, came up with an elegant solution.
He called for a revamped station design that enabled faster boarding through multiple doors, and fares would be exchanged before entering the station  similar to subway or light-rail systems. Offboard payment would also allow for the creation of transfer stations, meaning one fare would cover the entire system. To top it off, Lerner gave the stations a distinctive look by placing them in futuristic glass tubes. These new tube stations debuted in October 1991 as part of the first Ligeirinho express line. Today there are 357 tube stations throughout the city.
With this important addition, the citys system became the worlds first bus rapid transit (BRT) network . Curitiba was the first to include the essential elements necessary for a BRT system to function effectively, says Andrs Fingeret, director of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy in Buenos Aires.

The success of Curitibas BRT, which had mostly gone unnoticed elsewhere, began to attract attention from other cities in Latin America. BRT would be soon be given the chance to prove itself on a much larger scale in Bogot, Colombia, a city of 8 million people. There, mayor Enrique Pealosa seized on the concept as a way to solve the crippling traffic problems of his city. After taking office in 1998 he borrowed and added to many of the systems concepts to build a viable BRT network, the Transmilenio. The stations, which feature many of the key functional elements of Curitibas, contributed to its success.
From there, BRTs success continued to grow, spreading as far as the United States, South Africa and China. However, Latin America continues to have a special relationship with BRT, where the systems carry more people than in any other region in the world . Due to the similar language and cultural context, it was easier for the success of BRT in Curitiba to be replicated elsewhere in Latin America, says Fingeret.
But as BRT took off internationally, it began to face problems back in Curitiba. Though ridership remained among the highest in the world for BRT, a 2012 article in CityLab reported that it was declining with respect to previous years , while car usage climbed.Curitiba newspaper Gazeta do Povo has noted that the stations did a poor job protecting passengers from extreme temperatures, and in some cases were inefficient at keeping out rainwater.

In addition, Curitibas population has now swelled to over 1.8 million people  more than four times what it was when the BRT system first opened. Mobility remains an issue in the city and, despite BRTs success, the city has made initial plans for the creation of a subway system  a form of transport Lerner called a thing of the past and did his best to avoid.
One other potential solution now being considered in Curitiba is the bicycle. Unlike other cities known for sustainability, Curitiba is only recently beginning to take cycling seriously. After two decades of hardly any new plans for cycling, a 2012 bicycle masterplan called for the creation of 400km of new lanes.
Fortunately, the bus system may be an asset toward these efforts. The BRT system and cycling can and should work together to provide better mobility options for the city, says Alexandre Costa Nascimento, editor of the Curitiba cycling blog Ir e Vir de Bike . Though critical of the implementation of the citys current bike masterplan, he notes: Planners should consider integration programmes such as bike racks, bike parking and fare incentives.
Despite these lingering issues, BRT in Curitiba has become a cultural touchstone, the citys answer to the freewheeling carnival spirit of Rio and the fast-paced, business-dominated lifestyle in So Paulo. The citys ministry of culture has set up the Tuboteca , a book exchange programme, in the citys bus stations. And, as if to remove any doubt as to their status as this citys symbol, Curitibas airport gift shop is built in the shape of a life-size BRT station.

Jamyang is originally from a small town in Inner Mongolia. She moved to Beijing following the desertification of her local arable land. Her youngest son died of colon cancer in 2010, possibly as a result of chromium poisoning from a waste dumping site near their village, and her husband subsequently committed suicide. She now lives in tiny slum accommodations on the outskirts of Beijing with her elder son; part of Chinas growing generation of eco-migrants

This weeks roundup of the best city stories from the web takes a look at plans for an elevated park in the South Korean capital, the issue of heritage preservation in Calcutta and the death-defying leaps of urban explorers on the rooftops of Paris.
Wed love to hear your responses to these stories and any others youve read recently, both at Guardian Cities and elsewhere. Share your thoughts in the comments below.
Seoul aims high
An abandoned elevated highway in the middle of Seoul is being transformed into something call the Skygarden . Similar to New Yorks regeneration of a derelict elevated railway to make the High Line park, Seouls new grand urban project (designed by MVRDV ) aims to create a raised public space full of local plants and flowers, as well as cafes, street markets, libraries and greenhouses.
London v Houston
Some eye-catching maps over at City Metric lay the outline of Houston over cities around the world, from London to Lagos, highlighting just how sprawling that American city is. Placed over London, Houstons outline almost reaches the south coast, and encompasses Stevenage, Guildford and Tunbridge Wells  with a population just over half that of the UK capitals.
Barbara Speed writes: The urban sprawl which has resulted from the citys liberal approach to development brings its own problems: poor health outcomes (Houston is Americas fattest city), long commuting distances, congestion and poor public transport.
Calcuttas heritage
In Calcutta, a lack of guidelines for building demolition means houses are being indiscriminately torn down  and rapidly, too. As Amit Chaudhuri explains in Scroll , many people in the city are concerned that local architectural heritage is under threat because of real estate development.
Measures protecting not just heritage but both the cultural individuality and the multifariousness of the city as represented by its architecture are now long overdue in Calcutta, Chaudhuri writes. He calls for the declaration of heritage zones in the city. Their introduction would show an unprecedented commitment to re-engage with this great citys identity and history.
Parkour in Paris
Buildering, parkour, rooftopping : whatever the term, there are urban explorers who take serious risks to venture where others dont. CityLab shares this video of two such cityscape-scalers in Paris, climbing and leaping over the rooftops with great views over the City of Light.

Heard of New York?
Ann Friedmans tongue-in-cheek article in the LA Times aims to respond to the growing number of pieces  including from New York publications  that marvel at the so-called liveability of Los Angeles, a city known for its dominant car infrastructure . New York is a liveable place  who knew?, reads the title of Friedmans piece, which goes on to paint a picture of Angelenos discovering the apparent wonders of the Big Apple.
Southern Californians are overcoming their fears of subway germs, and reversing the American directive to go west, Friedman writes. Theyre finding that New York is more than a capitalist prison that runs on the fumes of the finance industry and nostalgia for CBGB. It now offers many of the lifestyle amenities that their hometown has boasted for decades.
Cycling in Byzantium
Istanbul suffers from traffic congestion, poor air quality and inadequate cycling infrastructure. This may change, however, as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) has pledged to build 1,050km of cycle lanes by 2023.
Embarq Turkeys Safe Cycling Design Manual for Istanbul provides guidelines for improving the citys cycling infrastructure. The report includes surveys with Istanbuls cyclists: 90% percent of respondents believed that there are major problems with cycling infrastructure in Istanbul; 35% thought there is a lack of signs on the road for safe navigation.
Bike lanes should be designed with this data in mind, writes Cigdem Crek zta in the City Fix . They should both serve neighbourhood life and integrate with public transit systems. Local decision makers need to raise awareness about cycling as a viable transport option and implement accessible infrastructure across Istanbul.

In 2012, as the Russian government announced the formation of a new greater Moscow, Marat Khusnullin, the deputy mayor, headed up an international competition that invited plans for the newly expanded city region. There is talk of a grand urban vision: new jobs, homes, infrastructure and city-wide improvements.
In the meantime, Moscow is already transforming. From plans for Zaryadye Park  Moscows first new park in 50 years  to burgeoning creative industries, rapid gentrification and a food revolution, the fabric of the city is being reworked. Plans involve pedestrianised embankments along a transformed riverfront , high-speed water transport and brand-new cycling infrastructure.
But how much has life really changed for Moscows residents? Has the transformation been for the benefit of everyone or just a select few? And what of the future of this new Moscow?
Starting 8 June, the Guardian will spend a week focusing on what life is really like in Moscow. From the city centre to the suburbs, from women to migrant workers to prisoners, from cycling to food to religion, we hope to get under the skin of this remarkable city  and we want Moscows residents to help shape our coverage.

Yamoussoukro's Notre-Dame de la Paix, the world's largest basilica - a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 37
In the Ivory Coasts small and remote capital city stands a church as tall as St Peters in Rome, with personal air-conditioning for every seat. It is a bewildering legacy of the countrys founding father, Flix Houphout-Boigny

Notre-Dame de la Paix, built in Ivory Coasts administrative capital Yamoussoukro between 1985 and 1989, is a church of such national pride that, during the countrys decade of periodic civil conflict , citizens often sought refuge within its walls, knowing it would never be attacked.
Bishop Simon Ahouna recalls one visitor in particular, General Gu  who fronted the west African countrys first coup in 1999 and then ruled for 10 months  turning up at the basilica late one night. It was in 2000, and he came to pray. My advice to him was not to cling to power, says Ahouna, who heads the foundation charged with looking after the worlds largest basilica . It wasnt just him, either; whenever there were political crises, people would come and shelter because nobody would ransack here.
Gus assassination two years later plunged the country into a decade of civil turmoil, the seeds of which had been sown by ageing former president Flix Houphout-Boigny , Ivory Coasts founding father and the man who built Notre-Dame de la Paix.
As the 1980s drew to a close, Houphout-Boigny was nearing the end of three decades in power. Under his regime, Ivory Coast had grown rich on the back of cocoa exports and soaring world commodity prices. Not one to do things by halves, the leader affectionately known as The Old Man lavished much of that money on monuments  mostly in honour of himself.
Modelled on St Peters in Rome, John Paul II requested the cupola be slightly lower so as not to surpass the papal one

In the economic capital, Abidjan, he built the towering Htel Ivoire, a favourite for French expatriates which for a time possessed the only ice-skating rink in west Africa. His birthplace, Yamoussoukro  formerly a small agricultural village  became home to a palace surrounded by a crocodile-filled lake; a visit there inspired VS Naipauls celebrated essay The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro , in which the writer suggested the reptiles symbolised Houphout-Boignys mystique over his people.
Elsewhere in Africa, other strongmen whose coffers were swelling on the commodity boom were doing similar things. Ivory Coasts 3,000-metre airport runway was one of only two on the whole continent that was long enough to land a Concorde; the other was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire), where President Mobutu Sese Seko built the Versailles in the Jungle in his birthplace of Gbadolite .
In 1983, Houphout-Boigny rechristened Yamoussoukro as his countrys new capital. Another crop of grand monuments followed, including the five-star Htel Prsident and a marble-floored, rarely-used convention centre. But neither embassies nor ministries ever relocated from Abidjan, so Notre-Dame de la Paixs chosen location was a near-deserted, forest-surrounded town of empty six-lane highways that led nowhere.
The resulting building was  and still is  staggering, nonetheless. A sudden mirage rises on a stretch of lonely scrubland; kaleidoscopic stained-glass windows and ivory-white columns are topped with a giant pearl dome that rises 158 metres above the bush. Inside there is standing room for 11,000, while each of the 7,000 seats in the nave has its own personal (Italian-built) air-conditioning system. Five-thousand shades of stained glass make up the windows, including one depicting Houphout-Boigny kneeling in front of Jesus.
Inside there is standing room for 11,000 people, yet attendances usually only number in the few hundreds

The history behind Notre-Dame de la Paixs construction is no less dramatic; negotiations with Rome were apparently fraught. Loosely modelled after St Peters basilica in the Vatican, Pope John Paul II requested the cupola be slightly lower so as not to surpass the papal one. Houphout-Boigny complied, but instead topped it with a giant golden cross, making this the worlds tallest church.
Pierre Fakhoury , the celebrated LebaneseIvorian architect behind the monument, frequently batted away claims that the basilica was intended to be the worlds largest. This project from Houphout was fundamentally driven by his faith. He had a deal with Ivory Coast, but most of all he had a deal with God, Fakhoury said in an interview on the basilicas 20th anniversary. The intention was never to surpass [St Peters in] Rome. But we surpassed it because evolutions in architecture  allowed us to go much further than previously possible.
In light of the basilicas brash imitation of the Vaticans holy shrine, a reluctant John Paul II consecrated the building in 1990 only on the condition that a hospital be constructed near the church. To date, that hospital remains unfinished .

Controversy also surrounded the financing of Notre-Dame de la Paix. By the time the basilica was finished, the Ivorian economy was reeling from a crash in world commodity prices, and so its estimated US $300 million tag raised eyebrows. The cost of the churchs construction had doubled the countrys debt.
Maintenance today costs around $1.5m annually, paid for by the foundation set up by the former president. He thought about everything, because this was inspired by God, says Bishop Ahouna.
With less than one-third of the nations population Christian, attendances at the basilicas services are low  usually numbering in the few hundreds, according to 63-year-old businessman Jean Baptiste Golly, a regular attendee. But you know what? I remember when this site was just farmland and yam plantations. Its incredible to think that today, it is a place which inspires prayer and soothes the soul.

Celebrate the Moscow metro's 80th birthday with a journey through the city's history - in pictures
When it opened on 15 May 1935, the Moscow metro was a subterranean Communist paradise: its chandeliers, marble, intricate mosaics and heroic statues created an opulent space that was accessible for the citys workers. Eighty years on, it transports up to nine million people a day, with expansion plans set to make it the worlds fourth largest subway system by 2020

The first designs for Moscows metro were submitted to city authorities under the reign of Tsar Nicholas II in 1902. Moscow wanted to rival earlier systems in London, Paris and Berlin (New Yorks opened in 1904)  but the Russian citys plans were repeatedly derailed: by the uprising of 1905, the first world war and the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. Metro plans were finally approved under Joseph Stalin in 1931 and construction work is pictured here two years later

The first line ran from Sokolniki () to Dvorets Sovetov. Soviet workers carried out the construction under Iron Commissar Lazar Kaganovich  at the cost of many lives  but the engineers were from the London Underground. Stalins secret police arrested many on espionage charges  apparently they had gained a dangerous knowledge of the subway and the citys layout  and they were deported in 1933 after a show trial. Architect Charles Holden was one of the advisers, and the barrel-vaulted hall he built at Gants Hill on the Central Line echoes the standard Moscow station design

An estimated 285,000 people rode the Moscow metro on the day it opened, 15 May 1935. Its construction was hailed as a technological and ideological triumph for socialism and Stalinism. After witnessing its first days, the German poet and playwright Bertholt Brecht wrote : Now that the railway was built in accordance with the most perfect plans/ And the owners came to view it and/ To ride on it, they were the selfsame people/ Who had built it.

Dvorets Sovetov, another in the first batch of stations, was named after Stalins planned Palace of the Soviets. The building  on the site of the demolished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour  was to be the tallest structure in the world and topped with a 100-metre statue of Lenin. The station was decorated with marble from the cathedral, but plans for the palace were scuppered by the second world war and it was never built. The station was renamed Kropotkinskaya in the 1950s after anarchist Peter Kropotkin, who was born nearby. The cathedral was rebuilt after the collapse of the Soviet Union

Of the 90 pavilions built for Expo 67, Montreals 1967 worlds fair , only two still stand more-or-less intact. One is Buckminster Fuller s famed geodesic dome: though the acrylic cover burned off in a fire in 1976, the former United States pavilion is now the Montreal Biosphere , a museum devoted to the environment. The other pavilion to live on is Habitat 67  the young Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie s wildly ambitious, government-sponsored attempt at reimagining apartment living, and one of the most important buildings of the 1960s.
Part of Canadas centenary celebrations, Expo 67 was a point of pride for a city that was alive with newness  a new metro system, new downtown skyscrapers and a burgeoning Qubcois nationalist movement (it was on a visit to Expo that Charles de Gaulle made his famous  Vive le Qubec libre!  speech).
The event drew 50 million visitors (still an Expo world record) to what was then a country of 20 million and a city of under three million. And amid the various nations trumpeting and boasting, the snaking monorail system , the snack bars and souvenir stands, stood a modular jumble of prefabricated concrete housing cubes which have since drawn comparisons to everything from Lego to a Cubist painting or the pueblos built by native tribes in the southwestern US.
Safdie returned home to Montreal with a mission: to 'reinvent the apartment building'

Habitat 67 echoes a little known post-war Japanese architectural movement called Metabolism, whose proponents believed buildings should be designed as living, organic, interconnected webs of prefabricated cells. Perhaps the most famous Metabolist incarnation is Tokyos Nakagin Capsule Tower , another pile of concrete cubes dotted with porthole-like windows, erected in 1972. The influence of Le Corbusier, especially the French masters love affair with concrete, on Habitat 67 is also clear. But Safdie set his own course, attempting to balance cold geometry against living, breathing nature.
It was while travelling across North America as a student that Safdie surveyed grim apartment high-rises and unsustainable suburban sprawl. He returned home to Montreal with a mission: to reinvent the apartment building. He longed to create, as he put it in a 2014 Ted Talk, a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit  Habitat would be all about gardens, contact with nature, streets instead of corridors (each cube has access to a roof garden built atop an adjacent cube).
Moshe Safdies 2014 Ted Talk
Habitat 67 was a pilot project, intended as just the first application of a salve for urban ills that would spread across the world. Only it didnt quite work out that way. The Walrus, Canadas answer to the Atlantic magazine, called Habitat 67 a  failed dream .
From the beginning, the finances were a mess. The budget  it was funded by the federal governments Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation  spiralled out of control, despite the assembly line-style production, which was carried out at a specially built, on-site prefabrication plant. To recoup costs, the government set rents so high that no one could afford them. Then, as the 1960s began to fizzle out, modern utopian architecture did, too.
By the early 70s you have a global economic downturn, the oil crisis, Nixon de-links the dollar from the gold standard, and the Vietnam war is raging ... the money for these types of projects simply dries up, says Indebir Singh Riar , assistant professor of architecture at Carlton University in Ottawa.
The concrete needed frequent repair. One former resident, who lived there more than a decade ago for three years (and stilll prefers to remain anonymous, lest he offend the buildings diehard cheerleaders), says he fled after developing asthma and finding his cat dead. From an architectural point of view, its spectacular, but water got into that concrete, and mould seeped into the ventilation system. It blew the spores around. By the mid-1980s, the building was in private hands.

Though there may be some truth in the pronouncement of Habitat 67s failure, it doesnt tell the whole story. Too much has been made of the socialist ideals the building supposedly embodied. Though Safdie has a history of kibbutz living, Habitat was never meant to be public housing; it was built for middle-class city-dwellers, the kind who flee to the green suburbs once they start a family.
Safdie himself still maintains a pied--terre in the 13-storey building, which stands on a narrow, man-made peninsula just south of the Old Port section of Montreal. Today Habitat apartments  many of them linking two or three cubes, luxuriously renovated and connected into sprawling residences with multiple terraces and views over the water  are often listed by Sothebys. Longtime resident Jeannie Saunders, whose home is a four-cube penthouse, says that Habitat will always be a a community, where people have a feeling of friendship with neighbours, a special place to live.

It may never have achieved affordability but the building, just two years shy of its 50th birthday, remains a potent symbol. In 2009, the Quebec government gave it heritage status, recognising that despite the controversies and maintenance issues, Habitat represents much more than a yuppified ghost of 1960s idealism.
Safdies expression For everyone a garden is still an incredible idea, says Riar. At such a young age, he realised that suburbs are not necessarily bad, but city living is important. He asked: if people had more space and light, would they stay in the city? Its a very noble idea.

A four-storey high rug of twinkling LEDs proclaims the glories of Turkmenistans textile traditions above a rain-soaked scene, casting a pinkish glow across the golden arches of the neighbouring McDonalds. Across the way, a half-finished Nepalese pagoda towers over a faceted glass dome of Belgian produce, while Russia thrusts a gargantuan mirrored canopy into the air, aggressively cocked like a missile next to Estonias wooden shed. A bugle call is the signal for a Korean marching band to strike up, trumpeting the arrival of the countrys futuristic white space-blob, just as an Argentinian drumming troop thunders into action next door.
Sprawling across 110 hectares on the outskirts of Milan , this crazed collage of undulating tents, tilting green walls and parametrically-contorted lumps can mean only one thing: Expo 2015, latest in a long and controversial tradition of worlds fairs, has landed.
Weve tried to build a stage where all the actors can make their voices heard, says its design director Matteo Gatto, fresh from touring the Italian prime minister and the pope (who has his own, relatively restrained, pavilion ) around the frenzied fairground. And Gatto appears to have achieved his aim: the 140 participating countries and brand sponsors are screaming their presence at full volume.
In the centre of Milan, however, others have been making their voices heard in a different way. As the fair opened on May Day, thousands took to the streets to protest , while violent splinter groups smashed shopfronts and torched cars. The Expo is a machine for burning public money, said one protester, carrying a No Expo banner. It promised to bring jobs and boost the economy, but its being run by voluntary labour and has wasted billions on pointless infrastructure.
Expo claims to be a celebration of slow food and healthy eating but is sponsored by giants like Coca-Cola and McDonalds

It claims to be a celebration of slow food, local agriculture and healthy eating, added another activist, carrying an anti-globalisation placard. Its official motto is Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life , but it is sponsored by corporate giants like Coca-Cola and McDonalds. The whole thing is beyond a joke.
Expo 2015 has been one of the most controversial worlds fairs ever staged in Europe. It has been plagued by escalating budgets , seeing total expenditure balloon to around 13bn, including the costs of building new transport infrastructure to service the site, 10 miles from the centre of town. It has suffered interminable construction delays, meaning 1m has had to be spent on building camouflage structures to hide the unfinished pavilions for the opening. And, while being touted as a model of a cleaner, post-Berlusconi Italy, it has been damned by charges of corruption and bribery, seeing seven senior managers and former members of parliament arrested last year , and more indicted for bid rigging a few months later. So what does the city have to show for its seven-year struggle?
Traipsing the kilometre-long gauntlet of novelty structures, past Daniel Libeskinds twisted totem poles for Siemens and Norman Fosters 60m rippling pink concrete walls for the United Arab Emirates , its hard not to see the whole endeavour as a monumentally misplaced allocation of resources. The exhibition content is, in the main, as vapid as the architecture is extravagant. Visitors roam like herds of lobotomised oxen in search of nourishment, from clambering on a net over some flowerbeds inside Brazils giant climbing frame, to the touch-screen excitement of playing Lithuania or not? (a game of swiping national dishes into a digital shopping basket). Most countries exhibitions feel like a cross between a Waitrose advert and a travel agents trade fair  immersive multimedia dioramas of bountiful produce and spectacular scenery, dotted with stalls selling craft trinkets and samples of cheese.

We thought we had a chance to do something radically different, says Stefano Boeri, the Milanese architect and planner originally responsible for coordinating the Expo masterplan when the city won the bid in 2008, until he was removed in 2010. Knowing that previous Expos have been quite weak, and have failed to leave a serious legacy, we thought we could really do something that would benefit the city.
Boeri assembled a crack team to develop the masterplan. Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron were joined by the London Olympics chief adviser on architecture and urbanism, Ricky Burdett , American designer and cradle to cradle evangelist William McDonough, and Joan Busquets, the Spanish architect and planner responsible for much of the good that resulted from the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. It would have been hard to conjure a better legacy-minded think-tank on paper.
We really wanted to get away from the usual vanity fair of competing architectural innovations, says Jacques Herzog, speaking from his studio in Basel. I was honestly shocked when I visited the Shanghai Expo [in 2010]. You were blinded by the amount of design, so by the time you left the show you had forgotten everything about the exhibition. We wanted to focus on the content, and use the site as a laboratory for creating something useful for Milan, which wouldnt leave the usual wasteland of ruins.
Their plan did away entirely with the conventional format of bombastic national pavilions, sweeping the countries under a field of tent-like canopies instead, arranged in long strips either side of a central axis. We went back to the Roman foundation of Milan, says Boeri, laying out big Cardo and Decumano axes with lateral side-streets, abolishing any kind of hierarchy, so there would be no difference in size between the rich and poor countries.
Expos entrance with the same sense of contemptuous captivation that comes from watching the Eurovision Song Contest

Embodying the agricultural theme, half of each plot would be given over to a cultivated garden, where the countries would grow a food of their nation and then bring their produce to a kilometre-long table running down the central boulevard  like a global last supper, says Herzog.
In reality, you can now admire photos of the fairtrade coffee cultures of East Timor and Rwanda, then go and have an Illy espresso at the sponsored coffee bar. Or you can learn about the cocoa industries of Cameroon and Gabon, then stuff your face with Ferrero products at the Nutella concept bar .
As for the masterplan structure, it was planned to be shovel ready for development after the Expo, so as not to leave Milan lumbered with the usual white elephant. It was a very simple plan to create something that leaves behind a physical armature for a city, says Burdett. So when the tents came down, you would have the infrastructure there, with all the services already laid.
As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that this light-touch plan was too radical for the international exposition movement and its attendant entourage of sponsors to adopt. Judging by the track-record of what other Expos have left in their wake, the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) in Paris  the intergovernmental agency responsible for co-ordinating worlds fairs since 1928  appears even less aligned to the subtleties of city-making than the steamrolling bureaucracy of the International Olympic Committee. The BIE might talk in lofty platitudes about the intellectual legacies that are supposed to emerge in the form of grand declarations and charters, but in reality there seems precious little care taken to ensure the host city is left better off than it was found.

Despite brimming with positivity about the final result, Gatto is candid about the difficulties of developing the Expo masterplan. It was not so easy to make the design advisors ideas a reality, he says. We couldnt force the participating countries to do what we wanted  the rules of the BIE mean we have to give them freedom to design what they want. The structure of the routes and public space is still as we planned, but the sultans and sheikhs will always have their way and follow their own ideas. And thats really what makes the beauty of the Expo, this amazing variety.
The architectural smorgasbord is certainly varied, as you stroll from Qatars concrete fort, topped with a giant woven basket , past the mirrored labyrinth of Iran , to the bloated Italian pavilion , which appears to be modelled on a Chinese shopping mall. When you get to the one structure designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron at the end  a series of wooden barns for Carlo Petrinis Slow Food movement  you sense the whole thing might actually have been a bit insipid if left in the hands of their restrained Swiss good taste. Because, ultimately, surely the only point of visiting an Expo is to marvel, drop-jawed with morbid fascination, at the bizarre architectural freak-show, and be entranced by the same sense of contemptuous captivation that comes from watching the Eurovision Song Contest. It is a spectacular mess, but its also fascinating to see national ambitions embodied, side by side, in a line-up of skin-deep architectural flourishes.
But then youre rudely awaken out of your kitsch reverie by remembering quite what will be left, and at what cost it all came. Before the Expo arrived, this site was a place of overgrown, formerly agricultural land. The intention was to leave it in such a way that development could happen in a productive landscape, creating a new kind of high-density garden city once the tents were taken down. Such a bucolic idea was soon abandoned and, for ease of development, the entire site has been covered with an enormous concrete foundation slab  at a cost of 224m , mysteriously up 60m from the original tender price.
The elaborate 'canal city' idea didnt quite turn out as planned either

The elaborate canal city idea didnt quite turn out as planned either. The Expo was to be a catalyst for reviving Milans network of waterways , opening up canals to irrigate surrounding farms. Work was begun, before it was realised that the water pressure would not be strong enough to reach the fields. The revised plan met with huge environmental opposition, so instead the network was to be buried underground. With 60m already spent on the project, the fabled  Vie dAcqua  has yet to materialise. It is the real scandal of the Expo, says Boeri. A ditch going to nowhere that will never be used.
Nor does the future look much brighter. The Arexpo company  the joint-venture Expo legacy vehicle, co-owned by the City of Milan, the Region of Lombardy and, in smaller parts, the Fiera Foundation and City of Rho  is now in the unenviable position of trying to find a buyer for the site, a place severed on all sides by motorways and railway lines.
Having first acquired the land at a vastly inflated price from private owners (for 160 per square metre, when agricultural land in the area is worth 8-12 per square metre), the public sector is also burdened with trying to make back some of the huge outlay on remediating the site and building the Expos infrastructure. Recently, the site was offered up for sale at 315m  to deafening silence. What happens next is still up in the air, with vague plans ranging from building a new stadium , to a scientific campus for the State University of Milan and an innovation hub for tech startups. But dont worry, at least therell be a charter .

Theres simply been far too much speculation on the land and now theyre stuck with it, says Emanuele Braga, co-founder of Macao , a politicised arts group that has been organising campaigns against the Expo since it was first announced. The first mistake was buying land from private developers; the second was covering it all in concrete  when the theme is about feeding the planet and reviving urban agriculture. They should have used a site they already owned that was in need of regeneration.
I meet Braga in a former slaughterhouse now squatted as the HQ of Macao, on the other side of town from the Expo. Working groups busy themselves discussing labour conditions and workers rights, while a symposium led by Robin Hood Minor Asset Management takes place upstairs. (A few days later, Macao would stage an occupation of the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, in protest against labour conditions in Saadiyat Island , where the Guggenheim is building its latest outpost.)
Standing on the slaughterhouse rooftop, Braga points to a landscape of derelict meat- and fish-market buildings spreading out before us that he says would have made an ideal setting for an Expo themed around food. But such a site would have necessitated the intelligence of adaptive reuse and careful planning, of a kind clearly at odds with the tabula rasa predilections of the Expo juggernaut.
Few can point to Expos that have left a lasting legacy, other than the Victorian originator and its Crystal Palace

One hundred and sixty four years on from the first such extravaganza, Londons Great Exhibition of 1851 , it seems clearer than ever that the format of the world exposition is well past its expiry date, leaving a trail of debt and destruction wherever it strikes. When pushed, even Expo boosters can point to few events that left a positive, lasting legacy for their cities other than the Victorian originator  which brought us the Crystal Palace and left a great axis of cultural institutions lined up along Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the famed Albertopolis, which the Olympic park is now trying to mimic.
Sure, Vancouvers 1986 Expo opened up its waterfront for development , and Montreal 67 left a nice park with a big Bucky dome and a small amount of experimental housing , but all these benefits could have been achieved without the vast expense of putting on a fair. For several billion dollars, cities could build vast quantities of real, affordable housing and acres of beautiful, truly public space.
Sevilles Expo 92 was one of the largest ever at the time, sprawling across 215 hectares dotted with geodesic domes and snaking monorails, at a cost of almost 10bn. Most of the structures were intended to be temporary, but the city had no money left to remove them following the event. They mostly still stand there, abandoned, as forlorn symbols of a future that never arrived , with the first European space rocket and a strange pyramid of national flags still looming above a post-apocalyptic landscape. The event left the city mired in debt for decades.

Hannover 2000 suffered a similar fate . Buoyed by the light-headed optimism of the Millennium year, the bubble was soon pricked when only around half of the expected number of visitors turned up, once again leaving the region saddled with debt and a landscape of overgrown ruins. The site was laid out by Albert Speer Jr, son of Hitlers architect, who also planned the Beijing Olympics  a strangely prescient choice, given his father coined the idea of ruin value in his grandiose Nazi works.
Hot on the heels of the Beijing Olympics, Shanghais 2010 Expo was the biggest in history, spread across an area five times the size of Milans exposition at a cost of $50bn (32bn)  a level of ambition that saw 18,000 families forcibly displaced , according to Amnesty International. The Chinese pavilion has since been converted into an art museum, while most others have been demolished to make way for cranes, now busy building a new swathe of mixed-use city across the site. Better City, Better Life was the theme  for those who can afford it.

It is a scale of autocratic ambition only likely to be matched by the next Expo, to be hosted in the global capital of architectural hubris, Dubai; home of the tallest building in the world, the largest aquarium on the planet, and an artificial archipelago shaped like the world itself, all soon to be joined by  the worlds first indoor city . Expo 2020 is the jewel in the crown of Dubais national programme of steroidal grands projets but, given the troubled trajectory of fellow Gulf state Qatars endeavours for the 2022 World Cup , the world is watching with trepidation.
Still, in the fantasy playground of the United Arab Emirates, where impossible dreams are daily conjured from the desert at untold human and environmental costs, perhaps the world expo movement has finally found its spiritual home. For the good of other cities around the world, may it be its final resting place.

        <title>The Habana Libre hotel, pawn in Castro's battle against the US - a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 34</title>

Latin Americas tallest, largest hotel was the Habana Hiltons slogan when it opened in Cubas capital in 1958. Eight months later, Fidel Castro and his revolutionaries marched into this unapologetic icon of capitalism to begin their socialist rule of Cuba. Soon, the hotel was nationalised and renamed Habana Libre (Free Havana); throughout its existence, Habana Libre has charted the turbulent relationship between Cuba and the US.
The US fought on Cubas side in its war of independence from Spain, ending with victory in 1898. Following the conflict, the US helped revive the ravaged islands infrastructure and economy  though not without considerable self-interest. The next decades saw a glut of sugar money fuel the flamboyant expansion of Havana . The baroque and neo-classical styles of colonial Cuba were left behind, and an eclectic modern style took over in the form of mansions and edifices built in the newer quarters of the city.
Havana turned into a convenient backyard playground for US tourists, partly thanks to prohibition in the 1920s. But with casinos and nightclubs came the US mafia, and with increasing investments came US-backed dictators such as Fulgencio Batista.

For Batista, the hotel was a project of considerable symbolic value. Built in a strikingly prominent location at the top of La Rampa, a street sloping up from the sea in the downtown district of Vedado, the project was funded through the pension plan of the Cuban Catering Workers Union, to be run by Hilton Hotels International, and designed by the Los Angeles firm of Welton Becket &amp; Associates along with a Cuban firm, Arroyo and Menndez.
Castro set up the new regimes command post in room 2324 of the hotel: the Continental Suite
When complete, an advertisement for the new hotel noted that the 30-storey block had 630 lavishly appointed rooms and suites, a casino, a Trader Vics and a terrace bar. The opening in March 1958 was by all accounts a spectacular affair, with Becket and Conrad Hilton playing host to officials, celebrities and journalists, many flown in from the US.
Architectural historian Peter Moruzzi, author of Havana Before Castro , explains what the hotel meant to Cubas then ruler: Batista considered the Habana Hilton among his proudest achievements, its huge blue-lit rooftop Hilton name announcing to the world that the eminent Conrad Hilton had confidence in Cubas future  that the country was a safe place in which to invest  and that tourists could now find in Havana the modern comforts they expected in a top international resort.
Batista could not take comfort in the Hilton for long, however. With the revolution making rapid advances, he fled Cuba in the early hours of 1 January 1959, while some of his associates welcomed in the new year in the Hilton ballroom. The revolutionaries entered Havana in a jubilant motorcade on 8 January, and Castro made for the Hilton. According to Moruzzi, The Hilton was located at the highest point in Havana and visible throughout the city; it was the most prominent symbol of American influence in Cuba . Thats why Castro made it his provisional headquarters when he took Havana in January 1959.
Photographs from the time show scruffy soldiers lounging with guns in a plush lobby, sitting on the floor eating, machetes still attached to their belts. Castro set up the new regimes command post in room 2324 of the hotel: the Continental Suite. Press conferences and announcements were held here, as were meetings with visiting leaders from other countries.

It was also in the lobby of the Hilton that Castro told a gathered crowd: If the Americans dont like what is happening in Cuba , they can land the marines, and then there will be 200,000 gringos dead. With two floors of the hotel given to the incipient Soviet embassy, changing allegiances were evident. In 1960, the hotel was taken over by the state and its name changed to Habana Libre.
Architecture in Havana changed after the revolution. The multi-centred city was  and still is  a museum of sorts for every European style of building seen in the last few centuries, many with local interpretations. The new regimes attempt at revolutionary architecture came with Castro commissioning a set of national art schools . Two out of five, designed by the architect Ricardo Porro, were completed. These were exuberant, expressive, curvy brick structures, soon criticised for being expensive and idiosyncratic. But they were true products of the revolution for another reason  their design, using brick arches, was directly influenced by the US embargo that caused a shortage of steel.

From the 1960s, Soviet influence is held to have steered post-revolutionary Cuban architecture towards more plain and functional designs  whereas the pre-revolution 1950s had witnessed the construction of several tall buildings in Havana including the FOCSA building , still the tallest in Cuba. The last of those buildings, opened months before the revolution, was the Habana Hilton.
The Habana Libre continues to function as one of the citys leading hotels. In 1996 its management was shared by the Cuban government with the Spanish Sol Meli group and the hotel was subsequently restored, the highlight being the re-emergence of an enormous ceramic mural by Cuban avant-garde painter Amelia Pelez.
Up until 1959, Cubas legislature had assembled in El Capitolio  a replica of the US Capitol building built in 1929. Castros regime shifted it from this too-obvious reminder of the past  but it is perhaps a sign of time elapsed that, as US-Cuba relations ease, the National Assembly is due to meet in a restored Capitolio this year for the first time since the revolution. Meanwhile, in February this year, Paris Hilton visited Havana and the hotel her great-grandfather Conrad inaugurated in 1958. From the selfie she took with Fidel Castros son, it would appear all is forgiven.

        <title>Johannesburg's Ponte City: 'the tallest and grandest urban slum in the world' – a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 33</title>

On the 13th and 14th floor you could get anything from a blow-job to an acid trip in a few minutes. Essentially, the building was hijacked.
In his penthouse apartment on the 52nd floor, Mike Luptak is talking about the bad old days when Ponte, the tallest residential building in the southern hemisphere , fell into the hands of drug dealers, gangsters, pimps and prostitutes. The inner core of this 173-metre high concrete cylinder became a giant rubbish tip piled up as far as the fifth floor. Among the refuse and junk were, so legend has it, the bodies of residents who took a suicidal leap.
A great deal has changed since then. Featured in newspaper articles, photography exhibitions , documentaries and movies, Ponte has come to symbolise the rise and fall and rise again of South Africas commercial capital. It is part of an inner-city renaissance in recent years that has seen previous no-go areas turned into gourmet food markets, artists studios and trendy apartments.

The young middle class are moving back into Ponte 40 years after it first opened its doors amid a surge of optimism and wall-to-wall shag carpeting. Johannesburg , an economic engine and magnet for immigrants, can claim to be the New York of Africa, so this audacious experiment in skyscraper homes, designed by 29-year-old architect Rodney Grosskopff, was the height of aspiration for apartheids ruling white minority.
Through the 1970s, this was the crme de la crmeof living, says Luptak, 30, who gave up his job as a chartered accountant to run youth projects here. If you had this address, you were part of the in-crowd.
In those days the surrounding area, Hillbrow, was a vibrant multicultural hub of bookshops and cafes. But not for long. By the 1980s the middle class was fleeing to the suburbs, and by the 1990s Hillbrow  home to immigrants from the rest Africa  became rife with drugs, poverty, prostitution, gun crime and urban degradation, and Ponte was dragged down with it.
This was, perhaps, the tallest and grandest urban slum in the world, a gravity-defying dystopia that might have sprung from the imagination of a science fiction writer. It is said two floors were stripped bare and, along with the downstairs parking lot, became an informal brothel. Luptak adds: From a kitchen sink, there was a tomato plant growing with tomatoes the size of tennis balls.

By the late 1990s there was talk of turning Ponte into a prison. But then, in 2001, it began a journey to redemption. Its owner, the Kempston Group, hired a husband-and-wife management team, Elma and Danie Celliers, to set about its rehabilitation. A decade later, almost all 54 floors had been refurbished, many from scratch, with around 2km of electrical wiring and sanitary piping used on each. Eight lifts had been refurbished.
Quinton Oosthuizen, construction and maintenance manager for Ponte, who led the team clearing out its central core, told South Africas Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper: It was nasty; we pulled out some very funny things.

To stand in the core today craning ones neck is to feel like an ant gazing up the inside of a monumental concrete tree. At the top is a blue disc of sky.

Luptak and his business partner, Nickolaus Bauer, have set up a social enterprise at Ponte called Dlala Nje , which organises cultural, educational and sporting activities for local children, taking advantage of the 2,000 square metres of commercial space and a swimming pool on the ground floor. They also run tours of the building and neighbourhood that they hope will challenge perceptions. Most South Africans live in constant paranoia because of the crime issue, Luptak muses. They also live in bubbles. They spend the weekends at braais [barbecues] complaining about things. Theyre the worlds best complainers but they wont do anything about it.
He admits, however, that Hillbrow is still not everyones cup of tea. Ponte has 24-hour security guards and biometric fingerprint access at all entry points to the building. Hillbrow is still a very dangerous place but its changed a lot from five-to-10 years ago.

Other parts of the inner city are forging ahead too, gradually shaking off Johannesburgs notoriety for danger and violence. The past decade has seen urban regeneration projects including Braamfontein, the Maboneng Precinct , Newtown and The Sheds@1Fox , with light industrial buildings and warehouses converted to apartments, art galleries, cinemas, hotels, restaurants, theatres and markets featuring organic foods and craft beers. They attract a young, multi-racial crowd  a modern face of South Africa  although critics say they are islands of development surrounded by oceans of urban poverty.
Some of the shops in these nodes sell t-shirts and metal cut-outs portraying the Johannesburg skyline. The 54 storeys of Ponte, of course, loom large. It has a sad story, says Luptak, but also a resilient one.

The history of Mexico has been written, all too often, with the blood of the victims of unspeakable tragedies. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Aztecs and numerous other civilisations performed gruesome human sacrifice rituals. Today, bloodthirsty drug cartels terrorise local populations, sometimes with the cooperation of the authorities, as was revealed during last years massacre of 43 student protesters from an Ayotzinapa school . No one place embodies that painful history more than Tlatelolco.
Today a district of Mexico City , Tlatelolco began as a city-state on the shore of Lake Texcoco, eventually overtaken by the ascendant Aztecs, who made it a part of their empire. During the brutal conquest of Mexico by Hernn Corts, in 1521 Tlatelolco was the site of the last battle between the Aztecs and the Spanish conquistadors. In the battle, Corts triumphed, and some 40,000 Aztecs were killed. Centuries later, a plaque would be built on the site that reads: The battle was not a triumph, nor was it a defeat. It was the painful birth of the mestizo nation that is the Mexico of today.
The deaths of the battle left a scar on the national psyche of the new colony, and later Mexico . The Spaniards did their best to pave over Tlatelolcos dark history, demolishing its temple and using the stones to build a church. Much later, in the 1950s, Mexican leaders resolved to finally right the wrongs suffered on the site, putting it to good use by building a modern housing project there.
It was claimed that the complex would improve the lives of its inhabitants through the virtues of modern design

Naturally, the new plans were the subject of more practical motives too. Mexico City had grown significantly since the Spanish conquest and was continuing to boom. After infrastructure projects drained Lake Texcoco, the city grew steadily out from the centre of the Aztec city of Tenochtitln, which today is Mexico Citys central plaza. After the country gained independence in 1810, gradual industrialisation during the 19th century and the creation of a railway network laid the foundations for a steady population shift from rural to urban. By the 1950s, Mexico City was facing a serious housing shortage.
Seeking to address this issue, the Mexican government sought to implement the most innovative building design of the time. They contracted Mario Pani, a young architect who had become one of the biggest proponents of the modernist ideas of Le Corbusier in the country.
His plan called for 102 residential towers, ranging in height from four to 22 floors, placed in large blocks with plazas and public space in between  Le Corbusiers towers in the park concept . Additionally, the area near the recently excavated ruins of the former Tlatelolco temple and the Spanish church would be converted into a plaza, named Plaza de las Tres Culturas (Square of the Three Cultures, after the Aztecs, Spain and Mexico).
Though part of the plans rationale was to provide an economical solution to the housing crisis, it also claimed to improve the lives of the inhabitants of the complex, through the virtues of modern design. Pani believed that the complex would be part of a general process of regeneration. Far from achieving these lofty goals, the complex instead set the stage for the next instalment in Tlatelolcos tragic history.

At that point, the Plaza de las Tres Culturas became a living hell
Elena Poniatowska
In 1968, Mexico City was preparing to host the Olympics. While the government saw the event as a way to raise Mexicos stature in the eyes of the world, a coalition of left-leaning activists instead wanted to turn attention to social ills and the frequently violent overreach of military forces in Mexico. In response, the government created the Olympia battalion, a paramilitary squad intended to ensure the games wouldnt be interrupted by protesters.
The protests reached tipping point on 2 October, 10 days before the opening ceremony, when protesters gathered in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the late afternoon for a rally. At the same time, snipers from the battalion took strategic posts in the new housing complexes, providing them with a clear shoton the people below.
At 6:10pm, a shot was fired, though no one was sure where it came from. Security forces acted immediately, opening fire on the protesters. At that point, journalist Elena Poniatowska wrote in her book The Night of Tlatelolco, the Plaza de las Tres Culturas became a living hell.
The protesters ran eastward, but many did not escape. The battalion and other security forces broke into residences, and the wide superblocks made fleeing protesters easy targets. After the killings ended, the governments initial reaction was to minimise the carnage, estimating that only 24 had been killed. This figure was dramatically contradicted by other accounts. Poniatowskas account includes an interview with a mother living in Tlatelolco who claims to have seen at least 65 dead bodies during the massacre. John Rodda, Olympic correspondent for The Guardian, witnessed the event and concluded 350 had been killed. Though the final body count remains unknown, photos surfaced in 2001 confirming key elements of Roddas testimony.
The tragic events that night left a lasting legacy and remain a hot topic in Mexican politics . Alongside the plaque to the 1521 defeat of the Aztecs, another was placed to the memory of the student demonstrators. But though the events were seen as an indictment of the Mexican government, they didnt tarnish the reputation of the Tlatelolco complex itself. Two decades later, another tragedy would occur at the site that would do just that.
Two of the three segments of the Nuevo Len building collapsed, killing all residents inside

On the morning of 9 September 1985, Mexico was hit by an 8.1 magnitude earthquake. Though the epicentre was off the coast of the southwest state of Michoacn, it was powerful enough to cause major damage in Mexico City, demolishing buildings, damaging metro stations and killing thousands.
The Tlatelolco complex was hit particularly hard. Two of the three segments of the Nuevo Len building collapsed, killing all residents inside. The collapse, exacerbated by a toxic combination of cost cutting during the original construction and improper maintenance, left between 200 and 300 dead.
Due to earthquake damage, eight other buildings in the complex were demolished and four more had their uppermost floors removed. It was an event charged with symbolism. Just as Pruitt-Igoe in St Louis, Missouri had demonstrated the death of modernism in the United States, the partial demolition of Tlatelolco showed it to be a failure south of the border as well.
Today, Tlatelolco seems to have put its tragic days in the past, but living conditions there remain far from perfect. Mexicos El Universal characterises the complex as being under a virtual curfew at night, as high crime rates keep most people inside. In addition, the dangerous lack of maintenance persists. Architecture magazine Plataforma Arqitectonica reports that five of the buildings are inclined at a level of 1.5%, where buildings inclining greater than 1% are considered at risk.

But the downfall of modernism at Tlatelolco may also represent the rise of a new trend in housing, with a uniquely Latin American twist. This change is at the centre of the argument made by architecture critic Justin McGuirk in his recent book Radical Cities. McGuirk sees the decline of Tlatelolco as coinciding with the beginning of a new movement he calls activist architecture.
McGuirk highlights programmes such as slum upgrading and the social urbanism of Medelln, Colombia, to be the future of cities in Latin America, as well as the rest of the world. [Activist architects] have to play off the private against the public to get the most out of both. They have to insinuate themselves into politicians plans, he writes. Above all, they have to be extroverts.
The activist architect approach seems to be gaining ground among planning professionals, and its becoming increasingly popular in Mexico as well. Even in Tlatelolco itself, groups like Unidos por Tlatelolco (United for Tlatelolco) have emerged to coordinate the efforts of residents to make up for neglect by authorities whenever possible. Today, it seems clear that groups like these, just as much as central planning authorities, will be the ones to confront the difficult task of creating better living conditions for the citizens of Mexico.

Is India's 100 smart cities project a recipe for social apartheid?
The emergence of hi-tech prototype cities is raising concerns that Indias new urban enclaves will override local laws and use surveillance to keep out the poor

In architectural renderings, Gujarat International Financial Tec-City resembles a thicket of glassy blue skyscrapers soaring above the Sabarmati River in Gandhinagar, capital of the western Indian state of Gujarat. Its signature towers include the Diamond, a 410-metre spire resembling an icy stalagmite, and the 362m Gateway Towers, a bendy, sinuous version of Rem Koolhaass CCTV headquarters in Beijing.
By 2021, the creators of Gift City, as it is commonly known, promise to surround these towers with world-class infrastructure which will provide residents with round-the-clock power and water, a district-cooling system that sluices chilled water through buildings, and an automatic garbage disposal system sending excrement hurtling through sewage pipes at 90kph  faster than most Indian trains, as the journalist Manu Joseph dryly observed .
The beating heart  or rather, robot brain  of Gift City is its Command and Control Centre, which keeps traffic moving smoothly and monitors every building through a network of CCTVs. In a country where more than 300 million people live without electricity, and twice as many dont have access to toilets, Gift Citys towers sound like hypertrophic castles in the sky. But they are an essential part of the Indian governments urban vision, one that it wants to see replicated a hundred times across the country. Recently, the Indian cabinet green-lit a 10 billion scheme that will be divided equally between building 100 smart cities, and rejuvenating another 500 cities and towns over the next five years.

Yet many experts and planners fear that such insta-cities, if they are made, will prove dystopic and inequitable. Some even hint that smart cities may turn into social apartheid cities, governed by powerful corporate entities that could override local laws and governments to keep out the poor.
In a monograph for a conference on smart cities in Mumbai in January, the economist and consultant Laveesh Bhandari described smart cities as special enclaves that would use prohibitive prices and harsh policing to prevent millions of poor Indians from enjoying the privileges of such great infrastructure. This is the natural way of things, he noted, for if we do not keep them out, they will override our ability to maintain such infrastructure.

Bhandaris bald statements sparked social-media pandemonium , and the economist is now at pains to assert he is far from uncritical of such plans. I am describing the unfeasibility and undesirability of a thoughtless smart-city vision, he says. When you invest so much without thinking about services and low-cost housing and governance, then you will end up creating enclaves that keep out the poor.
In their present form, Bhandari adds, smart cities are essentially rechristened Special Economic Zones (SEZs); neo-liberal business-friendly zones exempt from taxes , duties and stringent labour laws. They are also subject to what urban scholars say is a form of privatised governance, due to a constitutional amendment that renders local governments powerless. All of which, according to Bhandari, makes them inherently and unreservedly exclusionary. The current template for smart cities only mandates infrastructure creation. What we need is democracy and rule of law, not governance by fiat that holds in SEZs and smart cities created in China .
Last July, Narendra Modis newly elected government allocated 70.6 billion rupees (762m) to its 100 Smart Cities plan. This years allocation shrank to 1.4bn rupees, yet smart cities remain a key justification for a controversial land-acquisition ordinance the government is aiming to enact , which does away with mandatory consent and social safeguards for those whose lands are forcibly acquired. Over the past few months, smart city-themed conferences have been taking place every week in Delhi and Mumbai, culminating in the urban development minister Venkaiah Naidus announcement that the scheme would be  rolled out  imminently.
Yet no one is quite sure of what these cities might look like, or who theyre for. Naidu, with not a little wistfulness, said that smart cities would have clean water, assured power supply, efficient public transport and would not be polluted or congested. A concept note from his ministry, last revised in December, explains that they will have smart (intelligent) physical, social, institutional and economic infrastructure, guaranteeing their residents employment opportunities and a very high quality of life, comparable with any developed European city.
This repeated emphasis on high-end infrastructure and superlative quality of life hints at a discomfiting answer to the second question: who the intended inhabitants of smart cities are likely to be.
A visualisation of Palava Citys lakefront, designed to be the heart of this new citys cultural and social life.
The current template might have given us Palava City. This self-described smart city across 3,000 acres of Mumbais northeastern exurbs is being built by a city-based developer best known for treating skyscraper-erecting as a competitive sport . As its promotional video announces in a smug baritone, Palava City was inspired by the futuristic vision that brought Singapore, Dubai and even Mumbai into being.
What this translates into is essential public infrastructure such as 24x7 electricity, immaculate wide roads, public transport, malls, multiplexes and luxury housing, including Mumbais first and only golf-course-equipped residential township. To make sure that no one trespasses on its immaculate privatopia, Palava plans to issue its residents with  smart identity cards , and will watch over them through a system of  smart surveillance .
The emphasis on surveillance underlines the stratified, elitist nature of smart cities, according to the academic and author Pramod Nayar. Smart cities will be heavily policed spaces, he says, where only eligible people  economically productive consumers (shoppers) and producers (employees)  will be allowed freedom of walking and travel, while ambient and ubiquitous surveillance will be tracked so as to anticipate the anti-socials.
As such, Nayar adds, smart cities will be more fortresses than places of heterogeneous humanity, because they are meant only for specific classes of people. One class to be served, the other to be surveilled and contained.

The smart city paradigm comes from mid-scale European cities, and theyre meant to make existing infrastructure work in a more integrated way, whether its waste, habitation or transport connectivity, says Gautam Bhan, a researcher with the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Delhi. But Indian cities struggle with the absence of networks. Just 16% of Indian cities have underground sewage drainage systems. No technology can make the system work better if basic services dont exist.
Set against this context, Gift City, which models itself after financial hubs Canary Wharf in London and Pariss La Defense, starts to resemble the Emerald City, a glittering spectacle at the end of a shiny highway. In India such cities  geared towards high-end services  seem unlikely to provide many meaningful livelihood opportunities in the rural hinterlands where they come up.
Having islands of well-serviced smart cities amidst a vast sea of poorly-serviced and impoverished villages leads to what urban scholars have called the juxtaposition of the citadel and ghetto, says Sai Balakrishnan, an urban scholar at Rutgers, who studies land conflicts and urbanisation in India . If the government does succeed in building these premium 100 smart cities, but does nothing to alleviate poverty and poor services in the surrounding areas, it could well lead to a politically volatile situation. These visible forms of spatial inequalities engender social mistrust and even violence.
Nowhere is this combination of political volatility and spatial inequality more striking than in the giant expressway projects snaking across the countrys hinterland since 2006. These six-to-eight lane highways, intended to thread together luxury townships and special economic zones, often come up on fertile farmland that is forcibly acquired under the pretext of fulfilling a public purpose. In May 2011, one such project just outside Delhi  involving an expressway, private sports-themed city, and the countrys first Formula 1 racetrack  led to months-long protests among farmers from 10 villages. The rally descended into violence when villagers clashed with armed police, leading to the deaths of two farmers and two policemen.
Related: The truth about smart cities: In the end, they will destroy democracy'
Not all manifestations of disquiet end in gunshots and death, however. Balakrishnan recounts an incident that took place on the outskirts of Bangalore, where villages are rapidly being replaced with IT parks , gated communities and wealthy villas. A friend returned to her visibly opulent bungalow one evening to find a young man lounging on her porch, drinking a cold beer from her fridge. When she took out her phone to call the police, he brandished a small knife and motioned for her to sit down. She did, upon which he finished his beer, thanked her politely and left.
This incident makes palpable the sense of resentment and alienation among those excluded from partaking in Indias new urban wealth, Balakrishnan says. The young man wasnt out to harm anyone, but he felt justified, entitled almost, to break into an affluent home and to help himself to a few hours of luxury.
Every new smart city, she suggests, signals yet another temporary secession, each of them setting in place a new social order that will not be easy to reverse, and that takes urban planning dangerously away from the public domain. A hundred smart cities could spawn a thousand shadow cities, simmering with resentment and rage.

Why do Africa's mayors get so little respect?
Notwithstanding the inaugural African Mayor Awards, the continents presidents, prime ministers and kings dont leave much room for the humble mayor

Who is Africas Ken Livingstone or Boris Johnson? Its Rudy Giuliani or Bill de Blasio? The continent has seen emperors and still possesses an absolute monarch (in Swaziland), along with presidents, prime ministers, state governors and traditional leaders such as kings, chiefs and emirs, but that doesnt leave much room for the humble city mayor.
A plan to change that took a step forward last week when the first African mayor awards were held in Luanda, Angola, with organisers hoping to boost the profile of this oft-ignored tier of African politics. They claim the annual ceremony showcases excellence in urban development at a time that much of the continents population growth is concentrated in cities  with Luanda itself a stark example of the gap between rich and poor.
But the inaugural event suffered some peculiar branding. Its formal name, apparently due to a last-minute change for reasons open to speculation, was the Jos Eduardo dos Santos African Mayor Awards. This gave the impression that it was more about promoting the Angolan president, who has ruled with an iron fist for the past 36 years, than the mayors, whose names did not even feature in the official press release save for a picture caption.
The mayors' names did not even feature in the official press release save for a picture caption
The winners were divided into three sections. In the large metropolis category  a million residents or more  Accra in Ghana, under mayor Alfred Oko Vanderpuije, defeated Cape Town in South Africa and Dakar in Senegal. Among medium-sized cities (more than 200,000 residents and less than a million), the winner was Kinondini in Tanzania, represented at the ceremony by Sarah Kyessi (the identity of the mayor remains a mystery to almost everyone outside Kinondini). In the small cities (up to 200,000 residents) category, the winner was Praia in Cape Verde under Jos Ulisses Correia e Silva.
The awards organiser and publisher of African Business magazine, Omar Ben Yedder, told guests at the ceremony: The winning cities tonight are being led by individuals who are showing essential leadership qualities as they help build cities that work. And we will need more exemplary leadership, good governance and innovative thinking, whilst paying close attention to our culture and way of living when dreaming of the cities of tomorrow. Our leaders need to be close to the people, and our winners tonight are demonstrating these qualities.
Yet even most Africa aficionados would be hard pushed to name the mayor of Luanda, or indeed the mayor of most cities on the continent. What about that great Nigerian megacity, Lagos? A headline on the African Arguments website in 2012 read: Babatunde Fashola: the Mayor Bloomberg of Lagos State. Technically, Fashola is the governor of Lagos state, rather than mayor of Lagos city.
In South Africa, the mayor of Durban is James Nxumalo, whose Twitter profile shows him wearing traditional mayoral chain, but he is far less influential in the region than Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini, whose recent remarks on immigrants caused a storm.
There is a more high-profile figure in Cape Town, which was shortlisted for the awards: Patricia de Lille, a mixed-race veteran of the struggle against apartheid. De Lille fits the mould of a maverick mayor, and has been a constant thorn in the side of the governing African National Congress. A sign on the wall of her office, where she has reportedly banned air conditioning, reads: I prefer to do the talking myself, that way we avoid arguments.
But perhaps the best known personality to date is the former mayor of Mogadishu, Mohamed Nur, who lived in London for two decades, running community organisations for Somali expats, money exchanges, an internet cafe and an unsuccessful campaign to become a Labour councillor in Camden. He once told the Guardian his blueprint for Mogadishu was the regeneration of Kings Cross.

        <title>Southdale Center: America's first shopping mall – a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 30</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/06/southdale-center-america-first-shopping-mall-history-cities-50-buildings</Link>

Behold the shopping mall  the built epitome, according to its critics, of the mindless, car-bound consumerism of white-bread suburban America. Yet Southdale Center, the first fully enclosed, climate-controlled collection of shops from which all the 1,100 or so similarly designed malls now standing across the United States descend, came from the mind of an anti-car, pro-pedestrian European Jewish socialist.
Victor Gruen, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Austria, arrived in America in 1938 with high architectural aims. He soon launched a career creating New York City storefronts for urban businesses, like Ciros on Fifth Avenue and Stecklers on Broadway, 14 years into which he received a commission to design something else entirely: a shopping centre 10 miles outside Minneapolis.
This job offered Gruen a blank canvas on which to realise his long-imagined utopian vision of an indoor city centre that would import the urbanity of his native Vienna into his fast-growing adopted homeland. Southdale itself went up as he had imagined it  but nothing else went according to plan. By the 1970s, Gruen had returned to Austria to live out his days having all-too-clearly realised what a suburban monster hed created.
Though few built environments now seem as prosaic as that of the shopping mall, it looked downright radical when Gruen first came up with it. He first publicly submitted such a design in 1943, to Architectural Forum magazines competition Architecture 194X, which called upon modern architects to imagine the city of the post-war future. Alas Gruens entry, with its full enclosure and lack of a central square, struck even those forward-thinking editors as a bit much, and they sent him back to the drawing board.

The real postwar America proved far more accommodating to Gruens vision than the imagined one. The 1952 commission that brought Southdale into the world came from the Dayton family, a name synonymous with department stores in 1950s Minneapolis. They wanted a shopping centre to complement the new Daytons location that was planned for the suburb of Edina, a growing town of 15,000 people located  in line with the concerns of cold war America  just outside the blast radius of a nuclear bomb dropped on the city.
You have no idea what an innovation this was in the 1950s
James Lileks
When it opened in 1956, Southdale connected that new branch of Daytons with another large department store, the also now-forgotten Donaldsons, with space for more than 70 smaller shops in between. By then, the concept had some precedents around America, such as Seattles Northgate Mall, which opened in 1950, Appleton, Wisconsins Valley Fair Mall, which opened in 1954, and Gruens own Northland Mall, which opened outside Detroit that same year.
But where the open-air design of those projects left them exposed to the elements, Southdale sealed off the outside environment in order to better create its own world within. Gruen liked to call it introverted, as opposed to the extroverted commercial strips  avenues of horror, he called them  whose proliferation across suburban America he resented. And so Southdales vast, blank walls turned their backs to the street, enclosing not just all those stores, but cafs, public art, pedestrian boulevards and a lush courtyard, through whose skylight the sun shone on a fishpond, all manner of foliage, and a centrepiece cage filled with songbirds.
James Lileks, a chronicler of Minnesota modernism, describes Southdale early aesthetic as the joys of the outside brought inside. Discussing the outdoor eatery, complete with superfluous table umbrellas, Lileks says: You have no idea what an innovation this was in the 1950s; there wasnt any place where you could sit outside in your shirt-sleeves in January  least of all in a place with as inconvenient a climate as Minnesotas. Southdales advertisements promised an eternal spring, and its environment delivered.
But the utter controllability of the enclosed shopping mall, a built form that would arguably hit its zenith of popularity in California, had to do with much more than the climate. It both appealed to Gruens top-down design philosophy  like any good socialist, he believed in the improvability of man by man  and played straight into the fears of middle-class American shoppers. They didnt just want protection from the heat, wind, rain, snow and traffic encountered downtown; they also wanted protection from the people encountered there.
Those social concerns ran somewhat at odds with Gruens own. He wanted to create not just a gigantic shopping machine, but a community centre where, free from the terror of the automobile, Americans could stroll, congregate, debate and enjoy the human experience just as Gruen remembered doing in Vienna.
To this end, he designed Southdale not as an isolated structure, but as one element of a masterplan including hundreds of hectares of residential, commercial, medical, office and mixed-use projects around a lake and public park, most of which the developers ignored. Instead, it set the precedent for all the colossal boxes surrounded by what Gruen called land-wasting seas of parking  1,500 of which appeared across America in the half-century after Southdales unveiling, all of which benefited from a postwar change in tax law which dramatically increased the profitability of such big commercial projects.

Though Gruen himself would disown and decry the shopping mall, declaring in 1978 his refusal to pay alimony for those bastard developments, many Minnesotans, especially the 75,000 who turned out for opening day, loved Southdale. Generations of Americans who grew up far from a genuine city centre turned to places like Southdale for the closest thing to an urban experience they could find.
Hence the pangs of nostalgia that accompany the 21st centurys desertions or even demolitions of some of the United States enclosed malls. Even suburban Americans, no longer captive audiences for ersatz city centres, have not just a host of revitalised actual downtowns to choose from, but a new wave of high-design, urban-flavoured shopping malls that do away with introversion. (Some old enclosed malls, in a bid for the same appeal, have even gone so far as to remove their roofs and cut holes in their walls.)
You should have left downtown downtown, pronounced architect Frank Lloyd Wright in a characteristically grumpy 1956 visit to Southdale. But his comment reveals that he didnt quite grasp his colleagues intentions. M Jeffrey Hardwick titled his biography of Gruen, Mall Maker, but Gruen saw himself as more of a city builder, albeit an ultimately frustrated one. Socialists often claim that real socialism, in a properly supportive context, has never been tried. Victor Gruen could claim that neither has the real shopping mall.

        <title>The dangers of eco-gentrification: what's the best way to make a city greener?</title>

When construction on New York Citys famous High Line began in 2006 , the project to turn a remnant of the industrial age into a post-industrial garden and tourist attraction appeared innovative, but potentially very risky.
In fact, having finally opened in 2009, the High Line is now suffering from its own success : with more than 5 million estimated visitors to the site each year, this greening initiative has managed to transform the entire socio-economic character of the neighbourhood that surrounds it. Many small businesses and moderate-income residents have been forced to relocate due to rising land values, while even those who can afford it have begun to experience the downsides of living or working in an area that panders to tourists.
The High Line is thus a perfect example of environmental gentrification  the growing phenomenon of rising property values in the wake of a large-scale urban greening project. Its a bit like the introduction of a new transportation hub or other major infrastructure project: while intended to serve existing residents, in reality it tends to increase land values to the point that those who live there are forced to leave. This exodus in turn transforms the sociological contours of the area and, by extension, the spatial segregation of the entire city.
The High Line is a perfect example of 'environmental gentrification'
It feels timely, then, to revisit an old question: what is the best way to introduce nature into a city?
Land speculation in regard to large-scale greening projects is nothing new. When the very first public park in Europe, Birkenhead Park on Merseyside , was in the early phases of planning in the 1840s, park commissioners bought up parcels of land around the park and cashed in after it was built. Similarly, one of the main reasons behind the construction of New York Citys Central Park  designed by Frederick Law Olmsted after a trip to Birkenhead  was to raise property values and tax revenues for the city. (Olmsted himself carried out a series of studies on rising land values around the park from the mid-1850s to the mid-1870s, and used these findings to obtain support for the creation of parks in other cities.)
In our present neoliberal era, this process has been further amplified. Large-scale projects for greening cities, such as the High Line, have become bigger and more targeted to more specific audiences, contributing to the problem of residential segregation. In New York City, for instance, a proposed Lowline is scheduled to open in the Lower East Side in 2018. Funded in part by Absolut Vodka , the clientele of this underground park-museum is easily identified. Also expected in 2018 is the London Garden Bridge , presumably geared toward a similar, cocktail-oriented crowd.
Increasing the segregation of cities is not, of course, what the creators of these and other projects intended. But these plans nevertheless reflect a rather narrow-minded vision of what it means to bring nature into the city. They also appear to turn a blind eye to the drawbacks of endeavours such as the High Line  not only for moderate-income residents but for everyone in the city, no matter what their income level.
Such a myopic approach is a sign of our times: we want big projects that can be unveiled to spectators at a specific point in time. In reality, a more modest, piecemeal approach is often better both for the environment and for the socio-economic composition of large cities. Ideally, smaller-scale projects would be implemented in neighbourhoods across urban areas simultaneously.

Over the past few years, a new trend has emerged in direct response to the problem of eco-gentrification. I will label it conscious anti-gentrification. This kind of greening project aims to increase the environmental quality and public health of a neighbourhood but without changing its socio-economic character. This is done by explicitly rejecting elements that tend to lead to gentrification, such as fancy waterfronts; by including neighbourhood residents in the planning process; and by implementing changes gradually. Interestingly, many of the main players in todays conscious anti-gentrification movement were themselves gentrifiers in another era, especially the 1980s.
Conscious anti-gentrification aims to green a neighbourhood without changing its socio-economic character
The American academics Winifred Curran and Trina Hamilton brilliantly call this the just-green-enough approach, and point to Newtown Creek, a neighbourhood of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as an example. In the 19th century, Newtown Creek was a centre for oil refining and other industries, which left behind a massive oil plume. Over the last 10 or so years, Newtowns community has become increasingly active in the environmental clean-up of its own neighbourhood. Most recently, in 2010, Newtown Creek was declared a Superfund site ; an Environmental Protection Agency designation that brings federal funding but also the fear of stigmatisation.
What is unique in this case is the extent of public participation in determining how to carry out the clean-up, facilitated by the Newtown Creek Alliance and other groups. They explicitly rejected the all-too-familiar waterfront model, and instead focused on retaining the strong manufacturing base of the neighbourhood  replacing, when necessary, the type of manufacturing with more eco-friendly versions that better utilise the neighbourhoods proximity to water. The result, which is still ongoing, is a greening initiative that resists the need to mix gin and tonics.
Related: How Berliners refused to give Tempelhof airport over to developers
Across the Atlantic in Berlin, another example of conscious anti-gentrification is emerging. It involves the redevelopment of the former Tempelhof airport , located in the popular neighbourhoods of Kreuzberg and Neuklln. Once one of the largest airports in Europe, Tempelhof re-opened as a public park in 2008. Originally the park was going to be designed by a group of internationally renowned architects, and a recent plan for its redevelopment included the creation of 4,700 new residences as well as shopping amenities. Fearing the socio-economic changes that often accompany such development projects, however, Berliners rejected this plan in a referendum in spring 2014, and its future remains open.
Even if not a direct response to environmental gentrification, a variety of other approaches to greening cities exist. At the University of Virginia, urban planner Timothy Beatley has created the Biophilic Cities Project , devoted to developing new ways of making cities more biophilic, or close to nature  not only by increasing exposure to green spaces, but also by enhancing the emotional connection of urban residents to life outside. Rather than providing a set of guidelines, biophilic design simply asks urban planners to start by taking nature seriously, as well as its role in wellbeing and quality of life, rather than considering it as an afterthought.
Perhaps the most literal translation of greening a city is in simply planting more trees, an initiative taken up by many cities across the world. In Boston, where I live, the municipality plans to increase the number of trees across the city by 100,000 by 2020. It arrived at this number through a 2004-06 survey of tree canopy cover, carried out using aerial photography. The survey determined that the city had 28% canopy cover; increasing this to the municipalitys desired 35% meant adding 100,000 more trees.
More modest, gradual approaches such as these may not attract sponsorship from the likes of Absolut Vodka. But they do represent broader and more creative ways of thinking about how to bring nature into the city  and that is something we need now more than ever.

As cities increasingly seek to reduce car use and encourage more sustainable forms of transport, so cycling will surely play an ever-more important role in urban life.
Following a swath of activism in the 1970s, Dutch cities began to introduce measures for safer cycling . Now Amsterdam, Utrecht and Groningen  not to mention cities such as Copenhagen, Mnster and Seville  have become pioneers for a pro-cycling urban culture with extensive networks of cycle paths, as well as other clever ideas to make cycling around the metropolis easier.
But which other places around the world should we add to this list of most cycle-friendly towns and cities? Where is unexpected progress being made in the quest for safer and more innovative cycling infrastructure?

Six years after the end of Sri Lanka s long and bloody civil war, a silent conflict is being waged across the island, with tens of thousands of government troops continuing to occupy the north and east and the army expanding its property developments on land belonging to displaced Tamils, a new report claims.
Although the 26-year-long conflict between the majority Sinhalese government and Tamil separatists finally ended in 2009 with the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) , the study by the US-based thinktank the Oakland Institute finds little meaningful evidence of reconciliation.

It says hopes of peaceful coexistence are being thwarted by the enduring displacement of Tamils, the appropriation of their land by the military, the new governments refusal to take the country off its war footing, and the delay in investigating allegations of war crimes committed by both state forces and the Tamil Tigers .
Six years later, a silent war continues under a different guise, says the report, The Long Shadow of War: the Struggle for Justice in Postwar Sri Lanka . One major issue is the continued displacement of people from their lands and homes as a result of persistent military occupation of the northern and eastern provinces.
The study says thousands of Tamils are still internally displaced and without homes and livelihoods, adding that those who have been resettled through government schemes have often been moved involuntarily to areas that lack proper infrastructure.
Equally disruptive is the Sri Lankan armys ongoing occupation of what the government terms high security zones in the north and east of the country. The reports estimates that in 2014, there were at least 160,000 almost entirely Sinhalese soldiers stationed in the north. With the areas population standing at a little more than 1 million people, the occupation means there is one soldier for every six civilians.
One woman, whose husband was arrested by the army in 1990 and has not been seen since, told the reports authors that she and her family had been forced from their home by the army the same year and were still unable to return.
Today, my home is still occupied by the army, which pays LKR 300 [$2.25; 1.60] a month for the land, she said. I went to the human rights commission  and to the district officer to protest the continued occupation of my home. The army says, If the government asks us to move, we will vacate the lands. But there is no legal procedure to obtain my land back.
Having lived in a camp for internally displaced people and then a village that was destroyed by the 2004 tsunami, the woman now relies on a charity to put a roof over her head.
I have no hope of my husband returning  I hear there are mass graves of the missing  nor that the government will return my land, she said. I hear that the UN is investigating. I want the UN to know and investigate what I have gone through.
The report argues that the military occupation has long ceased to be about ensuring security.
The army officially runs luxury resorts that have been erected on land seized from nowinternally displaced peoples
Oakland Institute report
The army has expanded non-military activities and is engaged in large-scale property development , construction projects, and business ventures such as travel agencies, farming, holiday resorts, restaurants, and innumerable cafes that dot the highways in the northern and eastern provinces, it says. The army officially runs luxury resorts and golf courses that have been erected on land seized from nowinternally displaced peoples.
It says tourists can book holidays at luxury beach resorts by calling numbers at the ministry of defence, adding: These resorts and businesses are located on lands that were previously home to the local Tamil population, who were displaced by the war. They see no sign of return, despite numerous demands and petitions.
The study says the recent land grabs fall into an old and familiar pattern that has resulted in the marginalisation of Sri Lankas Tamil population through violence, pogroms, repressive laws and a government-orchestrated colonisation of the northern and eastern parts of the island, traditionally the Tamils homeland.
Despite the optimism that greeted Maithripala Sirisenas surprise victory over Mahinda Rajapaksa in Januarys presidential election , the report says the new administration has shown little sign so far of abandoning the battlefield mentality that was the hallmark of Rajapaksas regime. In February, President Sirisena extended an order made by his predecessor that transferred police powers to the armed forces .
The notification  calling out the armed forces to exercise police powers under the pretext of public security does not bode well for a return to civilian administration, says the report. Instead, the notification suggests concerns around public security and the inadequacy of the police to deal with the situation.
It also noted that Sirisenas administration had succeeded in persuading the UN to delay the publication of its report on war crimes and human rights abuses , which were alleged to have been committed by both sides in the final stages of the civil war. The government said the six-month postponement would give space for the domestic investigation process.
The report concludes that it remains to be seen whether Sri Lankas new government will deliver on all the promises it has made the international community .
The determination and willingness of the international community to ensure justice for the minorities in Sri Lanka, especially the Tamils, is also an open question, it says. One thing is clear: the human rights situation in Sri Lanka will not improve until the culture of impunity is replaced with a culture of responsibility, accountability, and fulfilment of full rights of the Tamil community and all other minorities in the country.
The Sri Lanka High Commission in London rejected several of the reports assertions, saying the Oakland Institute had overestimated both the number of troops in the northern province and the extent of the militarys property development programme.
It said the number of soldiers deployed in the north was much less than 160,000, adding that troops were deployed in different provinces of Sri Lanka according to local security assessments.
The high commission went on: The reference to the army being engaged in large- scale property development, construction projects and business ventures is an exaggeration. However, it may be noted that the new government has pledged to ensure that the military does not engage in civilian areas such as commercial activities  which was permitted by the previous government  and steps are being taken in this regard.
As a first step, it said, 1,000 acres of land in the Palali high-security zone in the far north of the island were released in March from the control of the army and air force to allow the resettlement of families displaced by the conflict. Similar releases were under way elsewhere in Sir Lanka, it added.
The high commission said that while the armed forces had operated some welfare shops in resettlement areas where there was no commercial activity, the shops had now been closed.
On the presidents decision to extend policing powers to the military, it said: The public security ordinance which confers police powers to armed forces had been in place for many decades  President Maithripala Sirisena only extended it.

Aiperi Isaeva, 23, travelled to Bishkek from her village in Issyk-Kul to give birth to her second child. The distance to the Kyrgyzstan capital is about 400km, but there is no maternity hospital in her village.
Isaeva, a primary school teacher, experienced no complications during labour and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. The birth went well, everything was good, and I had very experienced doctors, she says, speaking through a translator in a small, warm, three-bedded room in maternity hospital no 2.
Related: What are the millennium development goals on child mortality and maternal health all about?
In the room next door, Elvira Dairbek, 24, is recovering from the birth of her son, who arrived the same day. Its her third child, and the birth went without a hitch. Dairbek, who is in the final year of a finance degree, says she will be leaving hospital the next day. Her grandmother has arrived to help take care of her and her two other young sons. Her husband and parents live and work in Moscow.
The service here is very good, she says, cuddling her newborn son.
Both womens experiences are testament to the work being done in Kyrgyzstan to improve health services over the past decade, and in particular to decrease maternal and child deaths.
The country has successfully reduced under-five mortality from more than 40 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 1990 to 23 in 2012. But lowering the maternal mortality rate is proving considerably harder.
Kyrgyzstan has the highest maternal mortality rates among eastern European and central Asian countries, and is way off track to meet the 2015 deadline for the millennium development goal (MDG) on maternal mortality, which aimed to reduce by three-quarters the number of women dying as a result of childbirth.

Figures vary, but the latest data from the World Bank estimates that the number of women dying in childbirth for every 100,000 live births in Kyrgyzstan is 75, down only slightly from about 85 in 1990. The countrys MDG target is 15.
A 2013 report from the UN development programme found that most maternal fatalities were avoidable, with deaths from haemorraghing, acute sepsis, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia remaining stubbornly high.
Previous health programmes, including free healthcare for pregnant women and improvements to obstetric and gynaecological services, have made some inroads. But positive change has been largely dependent on where you live and whether you have money.
Womens lack of economic independence  particularly in rural parts of the country, where two-thirds of the population live  has a significant bearing on maternal health. In poorer, rural areas, women were less likely to receive adequate prenatal care. Fear of being sacked from their jobs made them less inclined to take maternity leave, and they also had difficulty affording drugs, such as iron tablets for anaemia (which can lead to premature births if left untreated). According to the countrys national statistics committee, 64% of women in Kyrgyzstan have anaemia, more than twice the number in 1990.
Funding for maternal health services has increased, largely thanks to donor funding . Between 2004 and 2011, funding rose from 213.5m soms (more than $3.6m, or 2.35m) to 761.1 million soms. But as a percentage of the entire health budget, the amount is small, and has fallen over that period from 9.9% to 7.9%.
But a three-year, $11m programme between the World Bank and the ministry of health, launched last year, aims to address the disparities and accelerate progress on cutting maternal deaths. Bishkeks maternity hospital no 2 is one of more than 40 health centres around the country involved in a pilot, a key part of which will involve training to improve staff skills.
90% [of maternal deaths] were found to be preventable, the result of the levels of skills of the staff and the speed of getting medicine to people, says Arsen Askerov, president of the Kyrgyz Association of Obstetricians, Gynaecologists and Neonatologists. We need more skills than resources.
While international guidelines on antenatal care  which stipulate that women should receive at least four visits  are widely adhered to in the country, the quality of that care is poor, adds Askerov.
There are not enough competent specialists, he says. We have young specialists who dont have a high level of skills. In rural areas there is a lack of specialists.
90% of maternal deaths were found to be preventable
Arsen Askerov, president, KOAGN
Although the programme is still in its early stages  it ends in 2017  Askerov is optimistic it will produce results. We hope that improved services will reduce deaths. We will be trying over the next three years as much as possible to strengthen these services.
But another element that needs attention is raising awareness around reproductive health, not least by ensuring that women know the danger signs of pregnancy and, crucially, have access to decent family planning services that  as well as reducing the number of teen births and decreasing the number of abortions  would allow them to space pregnancies.
Kyrgyzstan is one of the 69 priority countries under the Family Planning 2020 global partnership, which is working to increase access to modern forms of contraception for 120 million more women and girls globally by 2020. The percentage of women of reproductive age using a modern form of contraception in Kyrgyzstan is about 24%.
Sitting on her bed in the maternity hospital, Dairbek, who was married at 18, says she didnt use contraception. Were not allowed to take contraceptives in our family, she says. My mother didnt use it. It was not in her plans to have children so quickly after marriage  her eldest son is four  and although she says shes very happy to have three sons, she adds: For the next five years, no babies.

Inequality has transformed surviving childhood into a global postcode lottery
Childrens lives are shaped by social and economic factors that often differ wildly between and within countries  a grim reality that only a skilled, readily available health workforce with firm political backing can alter

You may already know the grim statistics: every day, 17,000 children under the age of five die; nearly half of them are newborn babies.
Almost all these deaths  which occur in just a handful of countries  could be prevented. The inequalities between countries are stark. A child born in Angola is 84 times more likely to die before the age of five than a child born in Luxembourg.
Related: What are the millennium development goals on child mortality and maternal health all about?
Contrary to what you might think, this is not just an issue in poor countries. It applies to poor communities everywhere, including those in some of the richest countries.
Every childs life is precious. But right now, a childs chance of survival is determined almost entirely by luck: where he or she is born, the income and education level of the parents, and other social and environmental factors that have a direct impact on health.
This means that despite the progress achieved, we have failed to reach the ones who need it the most  the poorest, the most disadvantaged, the most vulnerable. It is inexcusable that so many children die because they miss out on basic, cost-effective health services.
So what do we need to fill this equity gap?
A skilled health workforce. Many newborn deaths can be prevented by having a trained birth attendant nearby, someone with knowledge of simple, life-saving methods such as kangaroo mother care and exclusive breastfeeding , the latter of which is the single most effective intervention in high mortality settings. Skilled health workers are critical for providing care during childbirth and in the crucial week that follows, when more than 40% of child deaths occur.
Bringing care close to home. A key strategy in reaching the unreachable in remote areas is to make care more readily available by training local community members to give basic healthcare and treat common childhood illnesses. Antibiotics would prevent most child deaths from pneumonia and other infections. But access to these medicines remains difficult in the places where child death rates are highest. Removing legal barriers that prevent health workers from administering antibiotics for pneumonia would also save childrens lives.
We must bridge the gaps created by inequality and create conditions for a healthy, sustainable future for every child
Political commitment. Most important is political will and providing universal coverage to vulnerable populations. Countries such as India and Brazil, with strong economic disparities, are tackling inequalities and have set up special programmes to ensure free essential care to pregnant women, babies and young children. The results have been remarkable. Brazils infant mortality rate dropped from 47.1 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 1990 to 20 in 2007. And in India over the same period, under-five child mortality dropped 54.4%  from 118 to 52 deaths for every 1,000 live births.
I was recently in New York, where the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon convened world leaders to commit to a strategy for womens, childrens and adolescents health . Ban brings strong global leadership to this approach, which looks to save lives through a focus on equity and human rights, and will serve as a platform for implementing the sustainable development goals, which will be adopted at the UN general assembly in New York in September.
As we move beyond the era of the millennium development goals, we, the global community, must seize the opportunity to work together. The gaps created by inequality must be bridged, and the conditions created for a healthy, sustainable future for every infant, child and person, regardless of where they live. We need action at the highest level, with commitments and resources to back it up.
Lets not forget that action does not only rely on political commitment or the availability of medical knowhow. It must be founded on a recognition that our newborns and young children are not mere recipients of care, but are rights holders of their own, with legal entitlements to survival and the highest possible standards of health and care. Both in law and in practice. For all children. Without discrimination.

While progress has been made on ensuring that more women survive childbirth, basic maternal healthcare remains out of reach for millions of women. Around 800 women die each day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.
As the UN prepares to phase out its millennium development goals, which included the target of cutting maternal deaths by 75%, we asked readers to share their stories of maternal healthcare provision. Here are some of the responses we received.

The birth was three months premature, and midwives and doctors were present, but there was a fatal delay in finding an anaesthetist to enable an emergency caesarean section by general anaesthetic since an epidural was neither offered nor available.
I had been preparing for the birth in the UK, receiving prenatal care in London from consultants. As it was a multiple birth, prenatal consultants provided consistent care in the months leading up to my due date. However, I had to prepare for my wedding in Nigeria and had to travel to the country before my due date. I was assured that it should be fine to return home, get married, and make it back to London in time to give birth.
Yet on my wedding day, and within only 24 hours, I got married, gave birth three months prematurely, and lost one of my twin babies in childbirth. We were fortunate, however, that as soon as the emergency arose, I immediately received two of an indicated three steroid injections to help my babies lungs mature faster.
I came close to death myself, having become severely anaemic. I had to fight to save my life and the life of the surviving twin. In getting through this harrowing process, my child and I are very lucky to be here today. The care following the birth was diligent, but uncomfortable and difficult due to a lack of modern resources.
Three days after giving birth in the hospital, I suffered from painful engorgement and had to express my breast milk. The nurses treating me handed me a white plastic bucket, without explaining what I should do. They began pressing my breasts to pump milk into the bucket, leading to a lot of crying and pain on my part.
Knowing that an experience like mine is all-too-common for mothers and infants around the world is heartbreaking, but it could have been worse, because, in fact, 14% of Nigerian women give birth without anyone present. Some of these women  if they survive  suffer permanent birth injuries. Stillbirths often go unrecorded, let alone lead to counselling. This is why I started the Wellbeing Foundation Africa , which works to improve maternal, newborn, and child health across the continent.
Healthcare is underfunded in Poland, but I got the care I needed
Claudia, Poland
I decided to share my story because I was very satisfied with the care I received in a public hospital in eastern Europe and I thought this might go against the usual complaints we hear about public healthcare in this part of the world.
At 35 weeks of pregnancy, I was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis [a liver condition], which meant I had to stay in hospital until 37 weeks, when a baby is considered full term, and have an induced labour. I received excellent care for the almost three weeks while I was in hospital, from a team of midwives in Warsaw. I even got to choose a vegan diet.
At this hospital, women in labour are taken to newly renovated rooms, where conditions are very good: there is a bath, a private toilet, birthing balls and mattresses and many other items to use for finding comfort during labour. I gave birth with the midwife on call, who was extremely patient and discreet.
Im just happy to say that we got this very warm, thoughtful care at a public hospital despite health systems in Poland and the rest of eastern European countries being systematically underfunded. While I was in the hospital, I read a notice on the wall which said that state support for this hospital covers about two-thirds of the cost of a birth and that they do need support from donations and philanthropists, but it seems that they do manage in the end to find the funds they need. Or they manage somehow to compensate with love and care.
My mother didnt see a doctor for her entire pregnancy
Name withheld, Malawi
This is not my birthing story but my mothers. She had my brother at age 16 and me at 18 in Malawi. My mum never talked about her pregnancy or childbirth experiences, and it was only recently, on a return home to see her, that I found out she had given birth at home with both of us. She was with her mother-in-law and older sister both times, and she was in labour for two days with my brother. Living in the UK, my idea of homebirths is very different from my mothers experience. She didnt see a doctor or health professional for her entire pregnancy or labour. There was a health clinic about an hours drive away on public transport, but she says she never considered it an option. Her friends had all given birth at home with traditional birth attendants, and her mother-in-law had said that going to the clinic went against the family tradition of women delivering in their villages.
Things were tense with her first labour, but luckily my brother didnt require vital care when he finally arrived. Mum says she felt that God had watched over her during that labour. She says that now women in Malawi dont have to go through the same thing, and it is the norm to go to a clinic for at least one visit, even if you are delivering in your village. All of my friends still in Malawi have received all the basic care that I would receive here in the UK, but theyre mostly in the city. My hope is that every woman gets the choice to get the care they need.
The public health system is very good in Germany
Anna, Germany
I had monthly pre-natal check-ups up to two months before delivery, then bi-monthly check-ups until delivery, done by my gynaecologist-obstetrician. There was a week-long prenatal class to prepare for the delivery, paid for by public insurance. We hired a housekeeper as I was too large to do the usual share of domestic work. Also, privately I got weekly massages, weekly lymphatic drainages, weekly private antenatal lessons, bi-weekly pre-natal yoga classes, weekly osteopathy and acupuncture sessions, weekly prenatal pilates and aqua fitness classes. I also saw a personal trainer every week.
After the delivery and two nights in hospital, we were discharged to go home. A midwife visited every day for 10 days after we arrived home. We had also hired a maternity nanny to look after the baby. A paediatrician close to our house checked the baby after two weeks. For my personal antenatal care, my insurance paid for one weekly class. Privately, I attended four others. The public health system is very good in Germany, although we live a comfortable life in an affluent part of Germanys wealthiest city. Instead of buying a new car or expensive furniture, we paid for excellent care.
My sister-in-law gave birth in an overcrowded refugee camp
Samantha, Kenya and Canada
My husband spent 10 years in Daadab refugee camp in Kenya, and his sister gave birth there. She was one of the lucky ones who received care at a clinic, and that saved her life because she had to have an emergency caesarean. Most of her friends gave birth in their homes in the camp, sometimes for cultural reasons and sometimes because they simply didnt have a choice. The camp is so crowded, and is growing with around 1,000 births each month, apparently. Im so grateful that my nephew survived and is now a healthy little boy in Tanzania, where they were able to emigrate.
In comparison, I gave birth in Canada with a midwife present throughout the birth. I had weekly check-ups and had visiting home-care for the weeks after. I always felt safe and cared for, and knew that if any complications arose there would be help at hand. How is it fair that my son had a much greater chance of survival at birth than his cousin?
I could have saved my first child if I had had the chance to learn about maternal and child health

I had never heard about antenatal and postnatal care for mothers when I was expecting my first three children. I did not understand the importance of immunisations and nutrition. When World Vision started working in our community, I got to learn about the importance of maternal and child healthcare.
I think I could have saved my first child if I had the chance to learn about maternal and child healthcare earlier. Now, I always attend maternal, child health and nutrition awareness sessions. I also received iron tablets.
I realised that I was not eating properly while I was expecting my first three children. But while I was expecting my fourth child, I ate nutritious foods and followed what I had learned, so there were no problems during delivery. I only breastfed my daughter until she was six months old. She is healthier than my other children. Now, I promptly go to the clinic when my children are sick. I am afraid I might lose them like my first child.
I lost two brothers at a young age due to no access to basic medical facilities
Darjat, Pakistan
I was born in a mountain village 750km away from Islamabad, Pakistan. My grandmother was there but no health worker was present. During the time of my birth in 1959, [we] only [had] the indigenous knowledge of elder women, but during my kids time, they were provided with all the preventative vaccines and check-ups before and after birth in the small village, and later in the town and city. My wife also had access to basic check-ups before and after deliveries. I wish we had had basic medical facilities in the village where I was born. I lost two brothers at a young age due to no access to basic medical facilities.
My baby had to be resuscitated but I had full trust in the medical team
Lotte, Australia
We had public healthcare and it was fabulous. Prenatal care was uneventful and I felt informed. When I was admitted for labour, a midwife was with us the entire time, even when there wasnt much happening. She was there unobtrusively in the background doing paperwork if we didnt need her, and was right there to assure, advise, and answer questions when we did. As labour progressed, things got complicated  the babys heart rate dropped and he had to be brought [out] quickly with forceps, then resuscitated  but the wonderful care we had received up until that point meant that I had full trust in the medical team. I am so happy with the birth, even though it was complicated.

        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Between 1990 and 2012, the global child mortality rate almost halved . The UN has referred to this decline in preventable child deaths as one of the most significant achievements in human history.
About 17,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990 .
The mortality rate for children under five is declining faster than ever before . The annual rate of reduction has more than tripled since 1990.
Afghanistan has made significant progress in reducing child deaths. The countrys under-five mortality rate dropped from 257 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2002, to 97 for every 1,000 live births in 2012.
In 2013, global measles immunisation coverage was 84% among children aged 12 to 23 months. It is estimated that measles vaccines have averted more than 14 million deaths since 2000.
Globally, 90% of children receive immunisations for tuberculosis and 82% receive protection from neonatal tetanus.
Since 1990, every region has lowered its under-five mortality rate by at least 44% . However, the pace and scale of regional progress varies, and deep inequalities remain within countries and regions.
Bangladesh, Nepal, Ethiopia, Malawi and Liberia are among the 10 countries that recorded the largest absolute declines in neonatal mortality rates from 1990 to 2013.
The two best-performing regions in reducing under-five deaths were east Asia and the Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean, where rates have been cut by more than two-thirds since 1990.
Between 1990 and 2013, maternal mortality decreased by 45% . Despite this progress, the figure is well short of the MDG target.
In Guinea, 95% of pregnant women received prenatal care from a skilled-health worker in 2012, an increase from 83% the year before.
The number of 15- to 19-year olds giving birth declined globally between 1990 and 2011. In southern Asia, the adolescent birth rate dropped from 88 to 50 births for every 1,000 girls. This decrease was accompanied by a rise in school attendance, increased demand for contraception and lower marriage rates among teens.
The global rate of skilled attendants present at a delivery rose by 12% between 1990 and 2012 and has accelerated across all regions since 2000. Despite this, progress is too slow and skilled birth attendant coverage remains inadequate.
In Burundi, 25% more women gave birth at health facilities in 2011 than in 2010. In the same period, prenatal consultations rose by 20%.
The proportion of women delivering in a health facility rose from 37% in 1990 to 63% in 2012 . East Asia and the Pacific, south Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean registered the most progress.

What are the millennium development goals on child mortality and maternal health all about?
The goals on reducing child mortality and improving maternal health are closely related. How have they fared since their launch?

What are MDGs 4 and 5 all about?
MDG4 aims to reduce child mortality , while MDG5 is focused on improving maternal health .
The child health goal has one target: to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds by 2015. At its inception in 2000, the maternal health goal was also limited to a single target : to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters. In 2005, global leaders added an additional target to achieve universal access to reproductive healthcare. Progress on th e latter is measured by the prevalence of contraception, adolescent birth rate, antenatal care coverage and the unmet need for family planning, which refers to the number of women who want but do not have access to contraception.
Will the child health goal be met?
There has been substantial progress in reducing child mortality over the past 15 years, but not enough to achieve the goal of a reduction by two-thirds. Between 1990 and 2012, the child mortality rate almost halved , meaning that 6 million fewer children died in 2012 than in 1990. But while child mortality rates ha ve fallen, progress has been too slow. According to UN figures , it would take until 2028 to achieve MDG4 globally. Less than one-third of all countries have achieved or are on track to meet the goal by the end of this year.
Child mortality
What are the leading causes of child death ?
Globally, the most dangerous day in a childs life is the day it is born. Data indicate that preterm birth complications are now the leading cause of under-five deaths, accounting for 17% of all deaths in this age group. Prematurity, which applies to babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy , is a global problem that is increasing in almost all countries with reliable data. The majority of premature babies in high-income countries survive, but a lack of basic and cost-effective care such as breastfeeding support, warmth and treatment for infections means the chance of survival is reduced in low-income countries. Also, women who were undernourished during their own childhood and pregnancy are more likely to deliver babies who are preterm or small at birth.
Child mortality causes
Other leading causes of under- five mortality are pneumonia, diarrhoea and birth asphyxia  a failure to establish breathing at birth. Between 2000 and 2012 , deaths due to measles fell by 80% and there were also considerable reductions in deaths due to HIV and Aids (-51%), diarrhoea (-50%), pneumonia (-40%) and malaria (-37%). In contrast, relatively little progress was made in reducing the number of deaths due to prematurity, which had a decline of only 14%.
Will the maternal health goal be met?
The world is likely to fall far short of the targeted 75% reduction in the number of women dying due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth by 2015. The data collected so far is from 1990 to 2013, and shows a 45% drop in the global maternal mortality rate. The World Bank says that, of the eight millennium development goals, the one on maternal health has made the least progress . Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest maternal mortality ratio of developing regions, with 510 deaths for every 100,000 live births, followed by southern Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean.
Maternal mortality
The reproductive health target is a similar story of progress achieved at too slow a rate. The number of women in developing countries who saw a skilled birth attendant at least once during their pregnancy increased from 65% in 1990 to 83% in 2012 , but only half of those women received the recommended four antenatal check-ups. Access to antenatal care differs widely from region to region  80% of women in south-east Asia and the Caribbean reported at least four antenatal care visits, compared with 50% in sub-Saharan Africa and only 36% in southern Asia.
Improved access to safe, affordable and effective methods of contraception has led to an increase in its use. In sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion of women between the ages of 15 and 49 who were using contraception doubled between 1990 and 2012, from 13% to 26%. Tthe unmet need for family planning has decreased, but the issue remains problematic. In sub-Saharan Africa in 2012, 25% of women aged 15 to 29 who were married or in a partnership and wanted to avoid or delay pregnancy did not have access to any form of contraception.
What still needs to be addressed?
While significant progress has been made in tackling child mortality, experts say closer attention must be paid to growing inequalities within countries. In its report, The Lottery of Birth , Save the Children found that country-level statistics on child mortality often masked inequalities between different social and economic groups, including children from the poorest sections of society, those from disadvantaged regions, those from rural areas and those belonging to ethnic minorities.
Campaigners argue that womens sexual and reproductive rights must be at the centre of any discussion about maternal and reproductive health. Womens rights groups say that provision of health services is not enough . They argue that girls and women must have the ability to decide if, when and how many children they have, and to have control of the reproductive healthcare services they receive.
How do MDG4 and 5 fit into the next set of goals ?
The sustainable development goals , set to replace the MDGs next year, will aim to resolve the unfinished business of the maternal and child health MDGs and drive further progress. The three health-related MDGs, which focus on child health, maternal health and diseases, will merge into one sustainable development goal to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages. The 13 proposed targets include an aim to reduce the global maternity mortality ratio to less than 70 for every 100,000 live births. The goal also includes a target to end all preventable deaths of newborns and under-five children.

At a dispensary in Nyaluoyo village in western Kenya, there is just one midwife on duty. There are three women in labour, about 40 children waiting to be vaccinated, and another 15 people with other ailments.
It is 3pm and the lone midwife has yet to take lunch. She does not earn enough to buy school books for her own child, and she cannot meet other basic monthly needs. She has participated in health worker strikes in the past to push for higher salaries, but to no avail.

Africa has taken great strides in developing a favourable policy environment for reproductive and maternal health. But this positive environment has not translated into better health for African women, because it has not been supported by the funding required for implementation.
In 2001, 189 African heads of states and governments met in Abuja, Nigeria , where they committed to spending at least 15% of their annual budgets on improving the health sector (although it is important to note that even this level of commitment is not adequate to meet needs across the continent).
Ten years on, only six countries had kept this promise. Fourteen years later and the vision seems to have been lost altogether, with 11 countries actually reducing their relative contributions during the period.
The consequences are tragic, with maternal health epitomising the impact that underfunding can have on a health system. Too many Africans, including mothers, are dying of preventable diseases. The main causes include weak health systems characterised by poor infrastructure, inadequate supplies of drugs and equipment, a critical shortage of health workers, and weak management capacity.
A woman living in sub-Saharan Africa has a one in 16 chance of dying in pregnancy or childbirth, compared with a one in 4,000 risk in a developing country. The major causes of maternal deaths are preventable ones, including haemorrhage, infection, hypertensive diseases and unsafe abortion.

For reasons beyond their control, more than half of African women deliver at home without the services of a skilled birth attendant. It is estimated that sub-Saharan Africa needs 551,000 additional midwives by the end of 2015 to bridge its deficit, a tall order that cannot be met with the meagre resources currently committed to health systems.
In fact, at the current rate of increase in midwife numbers, it will take an estimated 29 years to reach the World Health Organisation s recommended numbers in Africa.
As 2015 progresses, it is becoming increasingly obvious that countries in Africa will not meet millennium development goal five, which aimed to reduce maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the figure has been reduced by 41% ; in northern Africa, by 66%.
Amref Health Africa works to bridge this gap by training cadres of community health workers, nurses and midwives  strengthening the provision of care at facility level, linking communities to formal health services and supporting the realignment of these services to community needs. Were successful in our field, but in itself this  and the work of numerous NGOs  simply isnt enough. It is imperative that governments devote more resources to their health systems.
Almost all African governments, for example, are yet to meet the target of committing 15% of their national budgets to health. Donor funding is estimated to account for more than a quarter of total healthcare funding in about 35% of African countries, while in 5% of countries more than half of all healthcare funding comes from external sources.
While this support is important, it is not sustainable. The lack of domestic resources devoted to healthcare is undermining the positive policy environment for maternal and reproductive health.

The Continental Policy Framework on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and the Maputo Plan of Action are key instruments guiding Africas efforts to achieve maternal health goals. The Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Mortality in Africa , an initiative of the African Union , serves as a critical advocacy platform for improvement of maternal, newborn and child health, and has been launched in more than 40 of the 54 AU member states. The campaign has motivated national ownership of significant maternal, newborn, and child health initiatives.
Without adequate funding, however, these laudable initiatives lack teeth.
Saving a mother is the most definite pathway to giving children the future they deserve. To eradicate poverty and underdevelopment, we must all commit to breaking the vicious cycle by making pregnancy and childbirth safer.

If targets to end world hunger by 2030 are to be met, governments and donors in developing countries must spend more on cash transfers to poor farmers, school meals and other social protection schemes, a UN report has said.
Economic inequality, which is particularly acute in rural areas, is a key reason why 795 million people do not have enough food enough to eat, according to a report released on Wednesday by the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad).

What we need is to put in place a more distributive [mechanism] of growth, and we have learned from Latin America a very important tool, which is social protection. Expanding social protection schemes helps a lot to tackle undernourishment, said the FAOs director general, Jose Graziano da Silva.
About 150 million people have been kept from falling into extreme poverty because of social safety nets, but roughly 70% of the global population lacks access to some form of social security, the report said. The worlds next development agenda, the sustainable development goals (SDGs), includes a target to implement nationally appropriate social protection measures by 2030.
Since 1990, the number of people who do not receive enough nutrients to live an active and healthy life has been cut by 216 million, according to the State of Food Insecurity report, which covers 129 countries in the developing world.
At least 72 countries have met the millennium development goal (MDG) to halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of undernourished people, the FAO said. In the past year alone, eight countries  Bolivia, Costa Rica, Laos, Mozambique, Nepal, the Solomon Islands, Suriname and Uzbekistan  met the MDG hunger target, according to the report.
But the global average has failed to drop to half of the 1990 rate, meaning that the world will not meet the hunger goal, said Da Silva.
Development targets should also help people in rural areas to access jobs and education, which will contribute to lifting them out of poverty and create lasting food security, said Ifads director, Kanayo Nwanze. We must invest in rural areas so that our nations can have balanced growth and so that the three billion people who live in rural areas can fulfil their potential, Nwanze said.
About 80% of poor people depend on vulnerable jobs in the informal economy, according to the report. Promoting enterprise in rural areas of developing countries will help to spread economic growth more evenly, said Josefina Stubbs, Ifads associate-vice president. We need to encourage business in the rural sector as a way of distributing the benefits [of economic growth] to the society.
Most of the worlds poor live in Asia or Africa, with only a small number in Latin America, the Middle East or the Americas, according to the report. Across the developing world, the majority of the poor and most of the hungry live in rural areas, where family farming and smallholder agriculture is a prevailing  albeit not universal  mode of farm organisation, the report said.
China has succeeded in reducing hunger by combining government investment in rural areas with agricultural subsidies and tax exemptions. China accounts for almost two-thirds of the reduction in the number of undernourished people in poor countries since 1990, the report said.

East Asia and Latin America have made the most progress in reducing the amount of hungry people over the past 25 years, according to the FAO. Mostly because of Chinas success, east Asias hungry population fell from 295 million in 1990 to 145 million in 2016.
Sub-Saharan Africa and western Asia, areas struggling with several ongoing conflicts, have been slow to reduce hunger, the report said. Sustained unrest has wreaked havoc on food security in countries such as Central African Republic, Syria and Somalia. About 19% of the worlds hungry live in areas affected by protracted crises.
More aid needs to be directed towards long-term development projects that aim to boost infrastructure and services that help people afford to buy food. Prolonged crises have diverted 80% of all development aid away from long-term development projects, which are needed to bring about food security, Da Silva said. We cannot compromise the long-term aid for developing countries, especially for the poorest countries.
At least 24 African countries are facing food crises, which present serious challenges to meeting the SDG hunger target. About 19 of these countries have been struggling with severe food shortages for at least eight of the past 10 years as a result of internal conflicts.
Da Silva said: The near-achievement of the MDG hunger targets shows us that we can indeed eliminate the scourge of hunger in our lifetime. We must be the zero hunger generation. That goal should be mainstreamed into all policy interventions and at the heart of the new sustainable development agenda to be established this year.

LH Sometimes people start fighting partly as a means to get access to resources, whether its to get access to territory or natural resources  or maybe its just because joining the military is a paid job, in a place in which there arent very many paid jobs.
CA Governments are the clients, the customers. They are the ones who are putting up money for this militarisation that we see all around the world.
MB We believe that including women its not about including women for more representation, its about including women to transform those exact systems of exclusion. The women are excluded from peace processes and that is why there continues to be unsustained conflict prevention.
HM Hello, and welcome to this edition of the Guardians Global Development podcast. My name is Hugh Muir. This month were talking about conflict and resolution and were looking at the main drivers of conflict, as well as the role of women and the UN in peacekeeping. We also hope to look at how the sustainable development goals may help us tackle the issue of conflict.
So lets start off by listening to a report from Clr N Chonghaile, the Guardians Global Development assistant editor, on the main drivers of conflict.
CNC There are many factors that can drive a population into conflict. Arguably one of the main drivers is militarisation. Since the end of the cold war, spending on arms has remained high while the nature of conflict itself has evolved.
GdC In the last 20 years there has been a change in the dynamics and trends in the ways the conflicts operate. We see less types of intrastate conflicts like what we used to see during the Cold War. My name is Gustavo de Carvalho, and Im a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. So a lot of the types of conflicts that we see are internal within borders, which of course in terms of militarisation then you have in different types of groups  and also access to arms and to different sources of arms then becomes a particular challenge. Were not seeing that type of traditional type of engagement of military actors like we used to see.
CNC The availability of weapons is one factor. Last week UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon told the security council that the widespread availability of small arms and light weapons, as well as their ammunition, was the common factor in over 250 conflicts around the globe in the last decade. This proliferation of weapons can also serve to normalise violence in societies.
LH I am Laura Hammond. I am a reader and head of the Development Studies Department at SOAS, the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. For instance, the Horn of Africa  the proliferation of small arms is everywhere. The fact that they exist not only on the battlefields and on the frontlines but as well in villages, in homes, leads to a whole kind of heightening of the role of violence within society generally, where violence becomes much more a tool than would otherwise I think be the case.
CNC The normalisation of violence is tied in also to the sidelining of women. Conflict tends to be driven by men and some analysts have noted that leaders can exploit masculinity myths, such as the idea of the man as protector.
LH Militarisation tends to be a process of really stressing some aspects of masculinity in particular and what tends to happen in militarised processes is that womens activity, their contributions, their activism, their roles in peace and in conflict tend to be sidelined, so militarisation processes almost by definition tend to write women out of the picture and out of the story.
CNC Economics can also play a part, both by driving a population towards violence and in the aftermath when poverty caused by conflict can lead vulnerable and destitute populations back towards violence again.
LH Sometimes people start fighting partly to get access to territory or natural resources, or maybe its just because joining the military is a paid job in a place in which there arent very many paid jobs. So impoverishment comes about as a result of conflict for civilians and it is very much intrinsically tied to the experience of conflict.
GdC I think what weve seen, and especially in countries that have had some sorts of conflict and that are going through the post-conflict settings, what we see is that the economic recovery then becomes a very important issue. Economic recovery then gives the population availability and access to resources, it gives opportunities to be able to have a more productive engagement within society. What we see then is that the idea of creating sustainable conditions for peace then goes hand in hand to economic recovery.
CNC Notwithstanding the broad trends we have identified economics, militarisation and myths of masculinity  many conflicts are routed in much more complex local dynamics.
LH Thats one of the difficulties, I think, of conflict studies is that one needs to take a very finely grained sort of localised approach towards understanding what are the nature of the grievances that are being expressed, what is the nature of the local economy that is perhaps driving people to be more likely to fight or not to fight, and to base an assessment on that rather than to have sort of grand overarching theories.
GdC Its very important when issues are being addressed around identifying root causes of conflicts and what we need to do to avoid a lapse, a relapse, into conflicts, that we need to be very cautious and to develop strategies that are enabling the population to actually become a productive part of society.
HM Joining us on the phone now to discuss this is Radhika Coomaraswamy, the former under-secretary general at the UN; Maria Butler, director of the PeaceWomen project, which is hosted by the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom; and Colin Archer, secretary general of the International Peace Bureau. Welcome to all of you. You heard that report of the three drivers of conflict: militarisation, economics and the myths of masculinity. How would you rate each of them in terms of prioritisation, in terms of weighting, how much they actually add to the proliferation of conflict? Radhika, let me start with you.
RC Well of course if you take a long term view all of this is very interconnected, but I notice that one driver is not mentioned and thats ideology  political, religious, national, ethnic, what I would call ideology. And in the old days of course influenced by leftist thinking or Clintons famous Its the economy, stupid, everybody believed it was the economy and that the ideologies were dependent on whatever economic system you had. But we know looking around the world at the way religions and political ideologies proliferate that ideologies have a momentum of their own.
So my sense is that it is economics and political and social ideology that are the true drivers of conflict, and that both militarisation and masculinity are the by-products of that. So that if you have, for example, a fascist, nationalist ideology with sort of state-oriented capitalism you will have a very aggressive military with men with very high levels of testosterone taking the lead. But if you have a more sort of democratic, pluralist, sort of a Gandhian kind of ideology you will find it to be with less emphasis on the military and with more sensitive men.
In fact it is argued that the man who assassinated Ghandi actually was not a madman but a man who believed in the former kind of India, that India should look like that  aggressive and male. That Ghandi was really kind of a feminine version and he found that offensive. So again, I think its economics and ideology that drive conflict and that masculinity as well as militarisation are by-products that that initial combination puts together.
HM Maria, let me bring you in there. So thats Radhika. She adds to our list of militarisation, economics and the myths of masculinity  ideology. How would you weight those various factors?
MB Yes, I agree that we now are living in a period of a culture of violence where we are faced with a spectrum of conflicts and what interlinks these systems of patriarchy with male dominance or economic exploitation or militarism and ideology is the interconnected issue of power thats constituted. And I think what were seeing as a womens peace organisation is that women activists are living and surviving and challenging these structures of power today.
For example our partners in the Middle East have faced in a way this distortion between choosing between extremist ideology and extremist military action and what theyre saying and what were saying is that there is still a voice for peaceful political revolution today but that voice is being marginalised. And I think the power dynamics play out in a broad spectrum from violence in our homes  where women are directly affected and targeted and their rights violated  and to on the streets and we see this through many examples. When women went to the streets in Egypt they were directly targeted, not because they were powerless, but because of the message they were bringing to challenge the power structures that were in place.
So we just held a large convening of women activists and they brought the demands to the table again that the majority, the peaceful majority, should not be silenced by the powerful minority. And there was innovative calls, for example, to adopt real feminist foreign policy by governments today, and what that would mean would be challenging those exact structures of power, so making human rights more valuable than economic gains. So stopping arms trade where the violating country continues to perpetrate gender race violence. So taking our words and actions into foreign policy was the demand of women activists today.
HM Colin Archer, the secretary general of the International Peace Bureau, is that roughly the assessment? Would that be your weighting too?
CA Well, if I could say, I do support very much what the two previous speakers have said. My organisation has historically focused primarily on disarmament and in the last ten years, particularly on military spending by governments, which is, if you like the root of the spending that gets made on armaments. The governments are the clients, the customers, they are the ones who are putting up money for this militarisation that we see all around the world. I mean it is extraordinary that 25 years after the end of the cold war as a global society the total amount of money spent on the military sector is higher even than the highest peak of the cold war period. And that has been driven by, of course, many factors, for example the impact of 9/11 and the whole transformation of American ideology regarding terrorism, the global war on terrorism, and now increasingly confrontation with Russia and China at the same time. The US is now facing three fronts, if you like, and most of the western world is falling in behind that definition of where the threats are.
But having said that for us the question of armaments and the huge amounts of money spent  and in many ways wasted  on the arms industry, I dont think its necessarily the root cause. And when you ask to give a weighting to all of these different factors I think thats almost an impossible task, but I do think that theres a couple of additional things that could be mentioned. One is the fact that weve neglected very often the weight of history, the sort of long shadow of colonial rule and the resentments that have grown up and have in many ways been intensified by the globalisation process. Weve seen a reaction against globalisation, against western values, and many nationalist and ethnic assertions have come in their place and thats combined with a sense of humiliation which comes from having been bombed, occupied, invaded and so on by western powers who claim to be democratic.
And so that is in a sense a framing of what we could regard as the struggle for geopolitical domination which brings in this fight between the big powers as well as the smaller local powers. And I think you cant grasp whats going on in so many of these conflicts without getting a sense of the global picture. And I would just, as just a small comment on the intro, I would somewhat contest the idea that most conflicts nowadays are intrastate. Its true that after the cold war that became the fashion for describing things, but just have a think about recent conflicts and see where there are outside powers and including super powers. Ukraine, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Mali  theyve all had to some extent or other major involvement from outside powers. So were dealing in a world where theres a mixture of intrastate and interstate conflict.
HM Well of course these are all very complex interlinked issues and we will try and explain them as best we can. Thank you for that, and those are some of the drivers, perhaps, of conflict, so what to do about that? What might be some of the possible agents of change here? Lets go back to the Guardians Clr N Chonghaile.
CNC Given the myriad causes how can we tackle global conflict? Experts say one possible agent of change is an increased role for women in peace-building processes. The United Nations Resolution 1325 on women and peace and security, which was passed in 2000, attempts to address this directly. Laura Hammond from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.
LH 1325 is quite an amazing document in some ways because it tries to do so many different things. Its trying to really take on board the challenges of promoting peace at all levels. It says we need to engage with women at all levels of society, and we need to work towards greater emphasis on peace-building processes, greater inclusion of women in all aspects of civic and political life.
CNC Gustavo de Carvalho is from the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa.
GdC Resolution 1325 is very important because it brings the idea of women not only as victims but also as potential providers of solutions. I think the last 15 years weve seen an increased attention to the role of women as a positive actor within issues of peace and security.
CNC Leymah Gbowee is a Nobel peace prize laureate and Liberian peace activist and she spoke to us at the Womens Power to Stop War conference in The Hague this April.
LG What I would like to see in different conflict contexts, women being given the space to exert all of their energy in promoting peace, not just at the grassroots level but also at the national, international level, sitting at the table and bringing some of those unique qualities to bear on the processes of peace-building. And I feel and strongly believe that once we do that we can make some of the biggest gains in building peace globally.
CNC If activists, both male and female, have an important role to play in reducing conflict, so too does the United Nations. In 2015 the United Nations wider role will come under intense scrutiny during a series of major reviews, including an assessment of Resolution 1325 and the launch of sustainable development goals to replace the millennium development goals which culminate this year. At this critical time some are asking whether the UN itself needs to reform to become more effective in reducing conflict.
LH Well is it the UN that needs to reform its own structures or the member states and particularly the donor countries  who as you say are major arms manufacturers and who stand to benefit quite significantly economically from the manufacture and sale of weapons to whatever customers will take them  who need to be much more committed to the rules that they set, the arms embargoes that they set? The rules about who they can sell to are broken regularly. So you cant sign on to this kind of a commitment on one hand while at the same time continuing to carry on business as usual with the other.
GdC If they want to promote changes on the ground and the recommendations that all of those reviews will bring the member states need to get a strong buy-in and to really be able to push that in terms of their own discussion.
CNC Some observers hope the drafting of sustainable development goals may drive change. Goal number 16 will recognise the importance of peace, good governance, justice and security  all elements which were absent from the MDGs.
GdC So in a way, including a goal that relates to issues of peace and security and to conflict issues helps in the way that the sustainable development goals will be an assisting tool to planning processes at a national, international level. So well be able to channel efforts, well be able to channel resources to particular areas, but we also need to be cautious to not create too much emphasis on one tool that will resolve all of the problems. We still need to be very aware of the fact that conflict dynamics are very specific to different situations and the responses are generally going to be related to the specifics of the contexts that were operating under.
HM So if we look first at the role of women in conflict, Radhika, can you first explain UN security council resolution 1325 and what that means for women in peace-building and in conflict resolution?
RC Well, you know, the first time women ever came on the international stage was in the 1920s and they came on the platform  and its Marias organisation, actually  of peace. It was the Women for Peace movement and a demilitarisation movement. And therefore this women and peace equation has been there since the 1920s, theyve been present at practically every international gathering and they inspired a lot of the women for peace movements from Vietnam right up to the security council resolution. Now what 1325 did as you know the security council really never dealt with human rights issues. Russia and China were firmly objecting to that. But the wars in Bosnia and Rwanda really were so horrific that they changed toward the end of the 1990s and in the famous resolution in 2000 they said human rights humanitarian violations are a threat to international peace and security.
It was only in 2000  the UN was formed in 1947  that the Security Council accepted that human rights are humanitarian aspects. And then they moved on to three areas that they began to look at more in-depth: one of them women, the other children in armed conflict and the other protection of civilians. So the women foot had this 1325 resolution as well as a lot of resolutions on sexual violence and conflicts. Women negotiators realised the Security Council being such a hard-nosed place that they would have to give up just the call for peace per se and demilitarisation, which actually was the Faustian contract that we made with the council and now we may regret it, given the figures that were just mentioned, that maybe we have to now think of going back. And my global study is I think going to emphasise the need that we just go back to peace per se. But a lot has been done with 1325, especially as an empowerer of groups at the local level to force governments to do various things.

HM OK, let me talk to Maria about that. Maria, would it be fair to say that women have been empowered by 1325 to play a more active and effective role in conflict resolution?
MB I think from our perspective, from their perspective, women have been forces for change. They have been empowered but theyre using women and peace and security as a tool from conflict prevention at a local level to peace-building. So its how theyre using it and how theyre organising where weve seen the most impact in terms of implementation of the resolution in the hands of civil society. And for example last month women organised in Nigeria to implement a process to prevent violence and unrest around the elections. They initiated, they led and they implemented the Womens Situation Room in Nigeria . They received thousands of phone calls from civilians. They documented election violence, they prevented violence on the street and also at the elections ballot box, and this is the sort of work where we really see the impact, the local powerful work, of womens peace organisations.
Yes, they use the tools of womens peace and security where they need them and when they need them with decision makers, but theres also been a clear frustration  and I think Radhika has heard this in her consultations on the global study  that women are and continue to be marginalised in those official processes, in decision-making processes. And this is what 1325 demanded of the international community, was to reprioritise gender, was to include women in peacemaking, and we have not seen that implemented. For example we were involved in supporting Syrian women activists in the peace negotiation. They were not recognised or allowed at the table.
Although they continued civil society activities in the margins, its still not recognised as official. And what we hear as civil society organisations continue to be similar rhetoric than there was years ago  that we will deal with that later, we will deal with womens rights and gender inclusion later. Right now, its hard politics. And what women activists are saying and what Wilpf is saying is now is about transforming the system and the systems of power that we discussed earlier is what we want to transform. And we believe that including women  its not about including women for more representation, its about including women to transform those exact systems of exclusion. The women are excluded from peace processes and that is why theres continued to be unsustained conflict prevention.
HM Let me bring Colin back in here. Colin, moving on to conflict resolution in general its clear that  as we heard from the first package  that the nuances of peacekeeping are very much unique to the situation locally. Would you say that theres a need to concentrate on those local issues?
CA A lot of peacemaking has to relate to the fact that the framework for conflict is often national but as we said earlier that includes international players but also regional players in the sense of parts of the country that may wish to, for example, secede or to contest power, so often you have this scenario of governments versus rebels. Now the rebels might be occupying an enormous chunk of the country  thats hardly just local, were not just talking about the village level here. So I think there has to be peacemaking initiatives and that clearly must include women all the way from the village level right up to the national and global levels. Thats what 1325 is about, and weve just heard very good examples of that. But I think that the place where the most important politics has to be done nowadays is national and subnational, and the difficulty is that women are not just excluded from peace negotiations, theyre excluded from politics per se because of the patriarchal nature of those societies. And I think it would have been surprising if, even 15 years on from 1325, one resolution and its associated forces had been able to transform societies that have been patriarchal for thousands of years.
So I think its a tool that has helped peacemaking and peace-building and peacekeeping but its only one tool. And one of the points that I would make is that where are the resources for peacemaking processes, when you consider that theres $1.7 trillion being spent on military forces around the world? And, well, for example, to compare it with the aid budget, $135bn for aid and even less for the UNs work on peacekeeping. So were talking about a David and Goliath type of situation, if you like, to take two male images, that peacemaking has to find ways to be effective even though at this stage we still have far less resources and most of those resources are devoted towards male-dominated institutions.
There is potential for the United Nations to play a far more effective role, but its in the hands of member states, and in the current mood if we look around the world theres not much appetite for giving the United Nations that power. One can dream of a brilliant secretary general, a kind of new Dag Hammarskjld or hopefully a female version of that, but even that person would find it difficult to resist the pressures by powerful nation states for their own interests to be taken into account. So Im somewhat pessimistic but I think that 1325 and the womens effort that that represents is our best hope.
HM Of course the UNs drafting an ambitious set of targets, the sustainable development goals, to replace the millennium development goals . Sustainable development goal 16 refers to the need to reduce all forms of violence. Do we think this target will bring any effective results or is it just more an expression of hope? Radhika?

RC Well, let me just begin by saying that I agree that the UN at the moment, especially at the global level, looks ineffective. So one of the recommendations of our study is going to be localisation; lets go local, lets make the difference there. The UN was started with the whole notion of swords into ploughshares now theyre doing the opposite. $9bn is the budget of DPKO . But lets be very clear, women have been absolutely key to peacemaking and peace-building. They may not have been at the formal table but they create the atmosphere that makes it possible. As you know in Liberia, in Bosnia, the Women in Black , the Mothers of the Plaza in Argentina  we can go and on and even now in Syria at the local level they are absolutely key to peacemaking.
Now I agree  I mean aiming against violence is sort of like getting rid of motherhood, people will say, or whatever, but one has to have an aspiration to work toward and this is one aspiration. And our argument is that not enough is done about prevention and also finding nonviolent means of protecting people, because often the excuse used is were going in to protect somebody. And what we mean about prevention is mediation  not only between combatants, you know, Dayton-style, lock them all up in a room and throw away the key, we mean at the local level, at the community level, with women, everybody, a much more broader sense of the political. So prevention means effective, proactive diplomacy by the UN and others at all levels of that society, at the local civil society actors, all stakeholders.
HM Radhika, of course the UNs role here is crucial. I mean some people point to the role of UN members though in the armaments trade and say that the problem is exacerbated by those UN members and the scale in which they continue to trade in arms.
RC Yeah, but one can only fight them if one goes local. theyre not going to be fought in the security council. They can only be forced through social movements. And one of the things that we are going to advocate at the end of  its a very non-UN report  were going to advocate massive funding to women peace-builders at the local level and the creation of a global movement for peace that uses the networks that women have created at the local level. No state has ever just stood up one day and got the political will to get rid of its arms, I mean thats just ga-ga land, but they respond to social movements so we have to create that social movement.
HM Colin Archer, is the UN doing enough to stop its members from dealing in arms?
CA Well I think you have to ask whether the member states are doing enough. I mean the UN is only an instrument that can operate within the framework established and the policies established by the member states. So yes the problem is at the level of nation states. Having said that I think, I mean theres a huge debate about the
RC I just want to say one thing, excuse me, can I just interrupt? This is wrong.
HM Let him finish and then Ill bring you back in.
CA Well I was just going to say I think that the MDGs have a mixed record. Theres a huge debate about whether theyve been successful or not and whether the things that have been achieved would have happened anyway without them. This is one of the sort of counter-factuals  you never really know what would have happened if that initiative had not taken place. But it seems to have focused energy on a whole range of key development targets and theres evidence to say that in the period of the MDGs there has been some real progress.
Now the SDGs looks like being a much more complex and sophisticated set of goals which will cover many more of the angles. It doesnt cover disarmament, it doesnt cover many of the peace dimensions that we would like to see. Theres no mention of military spending  which, by the way, would be an enormous resource available in order to fund the SDGs. Nobody mentions that, thats an issue weve been campaigning on for a while, that if we move some of the money we could in fact finance the SDGs. But still, goal number 16 does talk about violence, reducing death rates, particularly against children, and it does mention illicit arms flows but of course it doesnt mention the legal arms flows.
HM OK, I want to end with Maria Butler, but first I did say I would let Radhika come back in.
RC No, its a very quick point which is that people constantly say the UN is made up of member states. We keep pointing out that the UN charter begins, We, the people, are tired of war and the whole human rights movement and humanitarian part of the UN, which is often neglected by the media, comes out of that statement. So we have to pull that up again, you know, member states have been very successfully telling the world that the UN is a member state organisation and its important to remind them that it begins, We, the people  thats all I wanted to say.
HM OK, well thank you for that. So Maria, let me end with you. SDG16, is this basically wishful thinking or do you think it can actually have a meaningful impact?
MB I think the sustainable development goals, the impact and effectiveness of them will depend on, I think, two major things in the next few months. One is how progressive member states are in September in the adoption of the sustainable development goals and civil society  independent civil society has been key in pushing for progressive goals to include targets such as reducing military spending to ensure that womens meaningful participation is tracked across the goals. And the second factor really depends if and how this policy framework is implemented beyond New York, and thats a big challenge for member states, but also in the hands of a civil society afterwards.

HM OK, well can I thank all of our guests here, Radhika Coomaraswamy, the former under secretary general at the UN; Maria Butler of the PeaceWomen programme, director at the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom; and Colin Archer, the secretary general of the International Peace Bureau. Thank you all for your contributions today. And its worth remembering that in the coming months well be covering the international debates and consultations around the sustainable development goals, including key events such as the financing conference ahead of the September meeting at the UN to finalise the targets.
Its worth remembering too that all of our programmes are available on the Guardians website, theguardian.com/global-development and on iTunes, SoundCloud and all podcasting apps. But there we must end it for this weeks Global Development podcast. Thank you to all of our guests and interviewees. My names Hugh Muir, the producer was Kary Stewart. Until next time, goodbye.

Child marriage in India finally meets its match as young brides turn to courts
Almost half of Indian girls marry before they turn 18, even though it is illegal. Now, womens rights activists are helping them fight back

Santa Devi Meghwal was married off when she was 11 months old. She knew that, on turning 16, she would move in with her husband and his parents.
The reality hit her when they turned up at her house in Rohicha Kallan village in Rajasthans Jodhpur district on a scorching day three years ago to take her away. It was the first time she had set eyes on her husband, Saanval Ram.
My strongest emotion was the unfairness of it. Why should I go along with something I wasnt party to, or even aware of? I couldnt face being treated like a parcel to be picked up by a man I didnt care for, she said, speaking on the telephone from Jodhpur.
Under the 2006 Prohibition of Child Marriage Act , it is illegal for girls under 18 and boys under 21 to marry in India. Those convicted of involvement face up to two years in jail and fines of up to 200,000 rupees (about 2,100). However, 2014 figures from Unicef, the UN childrens agency, show that 47% of girls in India were married before they turned 18 . The practice is common in rural areas.
Almost all the people know that there is a law in place against child marriage  however, it still takes place as societal norms and pressure pushes people into breaking these rules, said Dora Giusti, a child protection specialist with Unicef in New Delhi.
Child marriage can result in girls dropping out of school , early pregnancies, and mothers who are ill-equipped to raise children, activists say.
Parents sometimes marry off their daughters because they fear that later, as teenagers, they might have sexual relations and bring shame upon their families. Another factor is peer pressure: parents worry that unless they act, they wont be able to find their daughters a husband. Opposition to change is entrenched.
Villagers dont like city people coming and telling them their customs are wrong. Changing attitudes is a slow process, said Kavita Srivastava, a Jaipur-based womens rights activist.
Meghwal found herself hemmed in by these traditions. During that first visit by Ram and his family she made an excuse not to leave with them. The excuses continued as she turned 18, then 19. Rams family grew angry.
Elders in Meghwals village imposed a fine of 1.6 million rupees on her parents. With no way to pay such a colossal sum, the family moved to Jodhpur.
Running out of excuses to go to her husband, Meghwal called Kriti Bharti, a child rights campaigner who runs the Saarthi Trust in Jodhpur.
Bharti, 27, made headlines in 2012 for obtaining Indias first annulment of a child marriage . Since then, she has won 27 more annulments in the family courts.
A child psychologist, Bharti says the law on child marriage makes provision for annulments, but previously it had never been tested in court. She describes her first petition as a stab in the dark. Laxmi Sargara, who was married off when she was one, was Bhartis first case. That victory set a legal precedent and gave hope to other girls. The case made it into school textbooks .
When Sargara was 16, and about to move to her husbands house in Rajasthan, she heard that another girl, who married into the same family, had killed herself after years of abuse. She decided not to go, and contacted Bharti.
India still has one of the lowest divorce rates in the world. Ending a marriage still carries stigma in rural areas, where a woman will find it very hard to remarry. Divorce also takes longer to rule on in Indias overburdened courts and is very expensive.
For an annulment, however, one only has to prove that the bride was underage at the time of marriage. A birth certificate or school certificate can prove this. Bharti said this process can take between three days and six months.
In Sangaras case, the Jodhpur magistrate was sympathetic, and her husband also consented. The marriage was declared null in April 2012. Two years ago, when she reached 19, Sargara married a man of her own choosing.
Kriti saved me from misery. Child marriage is a form of abuse and exploitation of helpless children, said Sargara. Bharti is still in touch with her. She is the queen of her home. Her husband gives her so much affection and respect that she always looks like a radiant bride, she said.
With Meghwals marriage, however, annulment proceedings may not be so straightforward.
Ram opposes the annulment and has threatened to abduct his unwilling bride, Bharti said. He has also warned Bharti that her health is at risk if she persists with the case.
But Meghwal refuses to be cowed. She says she has glimpsed a better future and is now studying to be a teacher. Kriti has given me a new life. I cant wait to see what it holds for me, she said.
It will take longer than we would have wanted but it will happen, said Bharti. His [Rams] so-called honour has been slighted. But all he can do is drag it out. In the end, Santa Devi will win because the law is on her side.

Barantiriza Deudeone did not want to make the same mistake as his parents. He was one of the first to sign up for the grim voyage across Lake Tanganyika and into the mushrooming refugee camps packed full of fleeing Burundians in neighbouring Tanzania.
In 1997, during the civil war, my father and mother said they would not leave. They had survived the war in 1972 and told us there was no reason to run. They were both killed. I could not wait for the same fate and will never go back. If we die here, that is fine.
The political crisis in the small east African country of Burundi, sparked by President Pierre Nkurunzizas bitterly contested decision to run for a third term , has translated into a growing humanitarian crisis, with more than 100,000 men, women and children fleeing from what they describe as a campaign of intimidation by armed Nkurunziza supporters.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda have taken in scores of refugees, but it is the lake port of Kigoma on the western tip of Tanzania that has seen the greatest number of arrivals.
Thousands of villagers have trekked for days to a UN-run, cramped holding camp in the Burundi-Tanzania border town of Kagunga before boarding the MV Liemba , a century-old German ship that has ferried refugees into Tanzania during each of the countrys deadly bouts of conflict over the past three decades.
A cholera outbreak in the holding camp where the refugees are cleared for entry into Tanzania has claimed 31 lives. The World Health Organisation said this week that the situation appears to be improving, but the risk of transmission remains high. Aid agencies warn that far more help is needed to avert a bigger catastrophe.
About six in 10 of the refugees are women and children, all trying to get onto buses transporting refugees to a bigger camp inland.
Many of the women clutched small charcoal-powered stoves known as jikos, while men carried transistor radios.
The predominant emotion among them is fear and tiredness, says Aimee Brown of Oxfam. Many have walked for days and weeks and fear what will happen to them if they go back. The key thing they need now is water and clean water vessels to beat the threat of disease.
Burundi experienced a 12-year civil war from 1993, which claimed around 300,000 lives.
Protracted negotiations led to the signing of a peace accord in 2005, with Nkurunziza nominated as president. Opponents accuse the former rebel leader of tightening his grip on power and indulging his appetite for amateur football instead of improving the lot of citizens.

Nkurunziza was expected to stand down this year after serving two terms but a decision to contest the election due in June  despite pressure from regional leaders, the European Union and the UN  has sparked weeks of protests in which at least 20 people have been killed.
Many of the refugees who spoke to The Guardian at the Kigoma stadium  a 20,000-seater football arena that has been taken over by hundreds of civilians  said the death toll from the crisis was far higher than has been reported, especially in rural Burundi, where there are few independent journalists.
They kill people at night and in the morning you just see blood, said Innocent Kuguimana, a 34-year-old farmer. Nobody knows where they take the bodies. Two of my friends were killed in the last two weeks.
All the refugees blamed the Imbonerakure, a feared militia allied to Nkurunzizas ruling CNDD-FDD party, of being behind the campaign of killings.
The militia is primarily composed of youths, who made up the ranks of the rebel group that later turned into Nkurunzizas political party. It has been accused of carrying out a relentless campaign of intimidation against government critics by Amnesty International.
A leaked April 2014 cable to UN headquarters described efforts to arm the militia to fight government opponents and warned that the Imbonerakure was one of the major threats to peace in Burundi and to the credibility of the 2015 elections as they are responsible for most politically motivated violence against opposition.
Clutching his small transistor radio, Joseph Msihoku Mbugayo, a 65-year-old father of six, said the climate of menace created by the roaming bands of party supporters had made life unbearable.
They go from house to house saying our sons must join the war against opposition supporters or die.
The regularity with which people have been forced from their homes and livelihoods have left many vowing never to return.
Neema Minani, a 23-year-old mother of two sons, said she could not bear the thought of tilling her field to take care of her young family and then losing everything due to political conflict.
I am a young person but I have fled my country twice. The UN is a big agency. Let them give us farms in another country so we can build new lives.
Women and children have been given first priority to escape the difficult conditions in the holding camp on the Burundi-Tanzania border. The first priority for many families when they arrive at the larger sea of faded brown canvas tents and claustrophobic aluminium shelters at the Nyarugusa camp is to trace friends and family.
Odisto Nyandui, 30, said he was desperately looking for his wifeElizabeth Nyasabandi, and their four children.
Like almost everyone interviewed, he vowed never to return. These people in Bujumbura care about power and nothing else. They will never change. I have to find a new life elsewhere.

Extreme violence 'blighting a generation' in Central African Republic
Two years of conflict have left more than 90% of children fearing they will be killed or injured, warns Save the Children

Almost two-thirds of school-aged children in the Central African Republic are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because of the violence they have seen or experienced during the countrys two-year conflict, according to Save the Children .
A new study from the international childrens NGO suggests that more than 60% of CARs children have witnessed or been subjected to acts of extreme violence since March 2013, when the mainly Muslim rebels of the Seleka alliance seized the capital Bangui and installed the countrys first Muslim president, Michel Djotodia.
The Seleka went on to terrorise the majority Christian population, killing men, women and children until they were ousted in January 2014. Predominantly Christian forces known as the anti-balaka (anti-machete) militia retaliated by slaughtering thousands of Muslims and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Close to three quarters of the children, aged between five and 16, are said to have directly witnessed beatings, killings, artillery fire, or machete attacks on either their own relatives or members of their community during  months of violence and suffering, says Ren Yetamasso, programme quality director at Save the Children in CAR.
The study  which directly consulted 111 children, 113 parents and 66 teachers  found that 91% of children interviewed had feared that they would be killed or seriously injured. Some 43% of children reported being victims of being physical abuse, shootings, or death threats; 65% said they often felt afraid, and 25% said they were too frightened to go to school.
More than half of parents said they felt their neighbourhoods were dangerous environments for their children, while almost two-thirds of children either described themselves  or were described by their parents and teachers  as suffering from emotional, behavioural, learning or relationship difficulties.
Yetamasso said the traumas they had experienced would blight not only the childrens individual futures but also the future of their country.
These numbers underline the disastrous impact the conflict is having on CARs children, he said. If we dont ensure those affected get the appropriate support to move on with their lives, an entire generation runs the risk of suffering for years to come, unable to get over their experiences or contribute to building a better Central African Republic .
Among the reports recommendations are: the establishment of after-school support groups for children suffering from PTSD and other emotional disorders; training for school counsellors; improvements to school security; promotion of positive discipline in schools to end physical and emotional punishment for misbehaviour; creation of school safety plans, and emergency training for children.
The new study was published as donors gathered in Brussels at an international fund-raising conference for CAR. Save the Children is calling on those present to step up their efforts, pointing out that the humanitarian community has received only about a fifth of the total funds required for the UN strategic response plan, while the education plan is almost completely unfunded.
We must urgently restore schools as physical and emotional safe places for children, as well as training communities, parents, teachers, and health practitioners to identify children with psychological difficulties and help them resume a normal life at their homes and in schools, said Yetamasso.
On Tuesday the European Union announced a new assistance package for CAR worth 72m (51m). The new package comes in addition to the 377m the EU mobilised for CAR between 2013 and 2014. In July last year, the union also launched the first European trust fund, the Bkou Trust Fund for the Central African Republic. The fund, which began with original funding of 74m, is intended to support actions linking humanitarian response to reconstruction and mid-term development programmes.
We live in turbulent times, where new crises hit any time and anywhere, said Christos Stylianides, the commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management . But our attention must not shift from ongoing humanitarian crises such as this one. The people of the CAR continue to need our help to survive and rebuild their lives.
Last month, the UN warned that the CAR crisis was becoming the largest forgotten humanitarian crisis of our time . According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR , 2.7 million people are in need of aid in CAR, 436,000 are internally displaced, while more than 460,000 people are living as refugees in neighbouring countries.

Leading figure in the development of the New Left in the 1950s and 60s who became a driving force in the fair trade movement
Michael Barratt Brown taught adult evening classes and founded Northern College as an adult and community education residential college

In the late 1950s and 60s, a number of British leftwing intellectuals and activists began to look beyond the prevailing concerns of Marxist thinkers  initially, to critical examinations of the Soviet model of socialism and of British imperialism. Michael Barratt Brown, who has died aged 97, was a leading figure in the development of this New Left , a pioneer in industrial worker education and the drive for workplace democracy, and later active in the movement for fair trade. He was one of the founders of New Left Review in 1960, of the Peace Foundation established by Bertrand Russell in 1963 and its journal, the Spokesman, of the Institute for Workers Control in 1968, and of the Conference of Socialist Economists in 1970.
From 1948, he taught adult evening classes in Essex, and 10 years later moved to Sheffield. There, in the next two decades, he established and taught extension classes for miners and steelworkers. In 1978 he founded Northern College at Wentworth Castle, near Barnsley, as an adult and community education residential college, and was its first principal. The intake at the outset was largely male but Michael responded to the demand from women by making over a residential block for them and opening a creche.
After retiring in 1983, he went to the Greater London council, led by Ken Livingstone, to produce study materials on the issues that its industrial sections were trying to address. Out of this work came his interest in fair trade: in 1985 he co-founded Twin Trading which, under his chairmanship, developed Cafdirect , the Divine chocolate business and other F airtrade brands as a model for a different kind of trade between peasant producers and consumers in developed countries.
All these initiatives in different forms are still running. His industrial classes in Sheffield produced a whole generation of shop stewards, union officials, local councillors and Westminster politicians. Northern College now has an annual student roll of 6,000, primarily those returning to education. Twin Trading acts as the developed world partner to, and is owned by, 30 co-operative networks in the developing world, with 300,000 members.
Like his New Left contemporaries Raymond Williams and Edward Thompson, Michael had joined the Communist party in the 1940s, but he abandoned it after the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. Like them, Michael was committed to being a peripatetic teacher for adults in the evening, after their daytime work. Like them, he attempted to make sense of the simultaneous twin events of Hungary and the Suez crisis . These were the years when Williams developed his ideas of a long cultural revolution and Thompson his equally influential work on a long political revolution. Michael, as an economist, set out to describe the contours of a long economic revolution. Together they marked out the three strands of the post-1956 British New Left.
Michaels first book, After Imperialism (1963), was a landmark in critical economic thinking at the time of decolonisation, and was widely translated. It argued that the end of formal colonial power was likely to intensify neo-colonial economic power, particularly in the form of the large corporations. What was needed was for the newly independent countries to use their political independence to resist these new forms of economic power and create their own path of social and economic development.
Many of his books continued with these themes, examining the ever more complex and tightening webs of post-colonial economic control, and the alternatives. He thought planning was part of the answer (in developed as much as in developing countries), but it had to be decentralised and democratic.
He applied a similar argument in relation to British economic policy, first in his contribution to The May Day Manifesto (1968), a socialist alternative to Labour government policies as the cover of the Penguin Special paperback proclaimed, and then in his book From Labourism to Socialism (1972). His work for the Institute for Workers Control, for adult education, and later for Twin Trading and fair trade were all initiatives aiming to put these ideas into practice.
In all he did and wrote, Michael was part of the British tradition of nonconformist, dissident champions of democracy. Born in Birmingham, he came from Quaker stock. His father, Alfred, was one of the conscientious objectors who had been imprisoned because of their religious, and in his case political, opposition to the first world war: he was given leave to be present when his wife, Eileen (nee Cockshott), gave birth to Michael. There was a strong Quaker culture in and around Oxford, where his father was principal of Ruskin College, and Michael was sent to Bootham school, a Quaker establishment in York. After taking a degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, in 1940 he married Frances Lloyd and started serving full-time with the Friends Ambulance Unit, whose wartime postings took him to Cairo, Italy and Yugoslavia, with Titos partisans.
This last experience led him to renounce pacifism, leave the Quakers, and join the Communist party, though his lifes work and writing reflected his view of Quakerism and its practices as the foundation of real democracy. He coupled this with a secular humanism that he said he owed to the Greek scholar and liberal Gilbert Murray, which he called Comtian stoicism. On this view, the ideas of the 19th-century French philosopher Auguste Comte resonated with the ancient Greek Stoics belief in reason, high-mindedness and altruism as a route to deterring conflict and promoting cooperation.
Michael and Frances had two sons, Christopher and Richard, before divorcing in 1948. With his second wife, Eleanor Singer, he had two further children, Daniel and Deborah. Eleanor was a doctor with whom he had worked in Yugoslavia, and they shared an interest in public health issues and the development of Twin Trading that lasted until Eleanors death in 1995.
Michael was then still running five miles every morning, gardening, cooking, sailing and travelling, quite apart from his involvement in fair trade, about which he wrote three books. In 2005, he met again Annette Caulkin, whom he had known in the Friends Ambulance Unit. He moved to London and lived with her until her death in 2012.
Michael is survived by his four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

How clamping down on tax avoidance can unlock billions for development
There is an existing global instrument to help prevent the 2tn annually lost to governments. The UN should focus on making it work

Tax evasion is a major cause of underdevelopment. Against the backdrop of Greece struggling to plug budgetary holes , aggravated by rampant tax evasion , the upcoming UN financing for development conference to support achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to cultivating domestic resources to promote development.
Rather than adopting new initiatives to bolster tax bases and reduce evasion, UN members ought to focus on making existing tools work better. Among the most powerful instruments available is the anodyne-sounding convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters , which was developed under the OECD and Council of Europe , but is open to all jurisdictions.
The convention is the result of tough negotiations and constitutes a major breakthrough, but has yet to achieve its potential. With governments worldwide losing an estimated $3tn (2tn) annually to tax dodging, making this agreement effective particularly for developing countries  could help unlock billions of dollars for national development efforts.
There are many reasons why taxation is central to development. Most obvious is that taxes give states resources to invest in essentials such as education, roads, and healthcare. As countries become wealthier, taxes fund social welfare and pensions, reducing poverty and inequality and evening out aggregate demand.
Less appreciated is the role of taxes in the development of states themselves. Historical scholarship, such as John Brewers classic work on18th-century Britain, shows that revenue collection builds governments bureaucratic competence and institutional integrity. The need for revenue drives capacity to collect taxes, which leads to improvements in state administration overall, thereby supporting broader economic growth.
One of the sad ironies of public finance is that countries level of development is positively correlated with the share of gross domestic product (GDP) represented by taxes. In other words, wealthier states take a greater percentage of national income in the form of taxes than poorer countries. Within the OECD, the percentage of GDP taken up by the state ranges from 26-48% , while in developing countries the state typically receives only 5-20% .
This is where the convention can make a major contribution.
Developing countries relative inability to tax effectively has a variety of causes but lack of information tops the list. To avoid scrutiny by domestic tax authorities, wealthy persons and companies routinely shift their funds to foreign jurisdictions.
Lacking legal means to demand the information from their counterparts overseas, national revenue authorities have often been without recourse. Until now.
The convention is meant to reduce the need to enter individual bilateral tax information-sharing agreements, while streamlining the actual exchange of information.
The process is quite simple. A tax authority in one country suspects a taxpayer of having income or assets in a foreign jurisdiction. The authority sends a request for information to the equivalent foreign body. Subject to procedural protections, including assurances of confidentiality, that authority processes the request and transmits the information to the requesting authority, which can then take steps to assess taxes owed.
While the conventions mechanisms are straightforward, a number of steps are needed to make it effective and the UN financing for development conference should back these.
First, developing countries need to sign and ratify the agreement. Until now, although 85 jurisdictions have joined, only 26 are developing countries and in only 15 of those has it entered into force. If developing countries dont enter, they cant use the treatys mechanisms.
Indeed, as more countries enter, the convention will become more useful because the pool of jurisdictions from which others can obtain tax information will be enlarged.
Next, to encourage ratification and improve implementation, the convention should be prioritized in development activities. With OECD figures showing that support for tax administration represents less than 1% of all official development assistance, much more emphasis should be placed on making theconvention work.
Above all, these initiatives should focus on building developing countries administrative capacity. Training and technical assistance are essential. Rather than being a vaguely defined ambition, these efforts must achieve demonstrable results.
Specifically, they must help to upgrade national standards to a level that allows other participating countries to disclose confidential taxpayer information with certainty that its integrity will not be compromised.
Official development proclamations regularly pay homage to goals of financial sustainability, while doing little to achieve it. Foreign aid can contribute to development but it will never rival states own tax and revenue-generating capacities. Developing those competencies, in relation to international revenue cooperation, will have spillover benefits for overall domestic revenue collection. And this will put governments firmly in charge of their own development efforts.
As a legally binding treaty, the convention can catalyse activity by all stakeholders. If it is fully operational, there will be more chance of achieving the SDGs. Its time to put this task at the top of the development agenda.

2015 is 'year of fear' for children worldwide, warns Gordon Brown

Children are bearing the brunt of escalating worldwide refugee crises, armed conflicts and natural emergencies with 2015  dubbed the year of fear  already the most dangerous since 1945 for the youngest and most vulnerable in society, according to Gordon Brown , UN special envoy for global education.
Delivering an impassioned call for urgent international action in a briefing in New York , the former British prime minister and Labour party leader said more than half the worlds record numbers of 38 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 16.7 million refugees are children.

An estimated 825,000 children are being trafficked each year and 5 million girls under the age of 15 are forced to marry. In total, according to UN figures, about 168 million children are used for unskilled labour, 85 million of whom are engaged in hazardous work. It is estimated 8.6 million children are in slavery, Brown said.
This is not the year of the child but the year of fear, with 2015 already the worst year since 1945 for children being displaced, the worst year for children becoming refugees, the worst year for children seeing their schools attacked, he said. We expect the figure to rise in crisis zone after crisis zone as even school-age children who were once at school are being forced into child labour. Today in some of the worlds most troubled spots it is open season for traffickers, with girls snatched from the streets in Nepal to adolescents forced into marriage in Syria , Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
The extreme impact on children of the four-year-old civil war in Syria has received more international attention than many other crises. According to Save the Children , 10,000 Syrian children have been killed since the conflict began, 5.6 million are in need of humanitarian aid and 3.5 million have been forced from their homes. Nearly 2 million children have fled the country, while 3 million are unable to go to school.

In northern Nigeria and Pakistan, schools have been attacked and schoolgirls abducted by Islamist extremists. In Burundi, more than 100,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have fled current political unrest. Many are now at risk from a cholera epidemic affecting makeshift camps in Tanzania, with 400 new cases being reported daily.
In South Sudan, children are being forcibly recruited as child soldiers as internal conflict has flared in the wake of the countrys 2011 declaration of independence. In Nepal, meanwhile, homeless young girls have become increasingly vulnerable to people traffickers in the wake of the recent earthquake disaster.
This week, Nepalese state radio messages are confirming what we already know, Brown said. In the midst of the fallout from the earthquake, the government is directly warning half a million girls  now on the streets  and their parents, to beware of suspicious gangs trying to recruit them and traffic them out of the country.
Brown said improved educational opportunities provided the best way to help vulnerable children, and called for the creation of a new international fund to help quickly target and assist young people caught up in wars and emergencies. He called on governments, aid agencies and development organisations to back the proposed global humanitarian fund for education in emergencies, which he said could be launched at the UN general assembly in New York in September.
The UNs World Education Forum, held in Incheon, South Korea, this month, heard that worldwide, 58 million children currently have no schooling at all , while 250 million are not learning basic skills even though half have spent at least four years at school.
2015 is the worst year since 1945 for children being displaced, for becoming refugees, for seeing their schools attacked

The forum adopted targets intended to provide inclusive, equitable, quality education for all, underpinning the new Sustainable Development Goals that will supersede the 15-year-old Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) when the general assembly meets this autumn.
Significant progress has been made in some least developed countries in improving early life education but many aspects of the MDGs on education, including universal access to primary education, remain unmet, the forum was told.
Anthony Lake, executive director of the UN childrens fund (Unicef), said: If this generation of children is to someday reduce the inequalities and injustices that afflict the world today, we must give all our children a fair chance to learn. This must be our collective vision and commitment.
Kishore Singh, UN special rapporteur on education, called for new strategies focusing on girls and women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and children living in conflict-affected areas, rural areas and urban slums. He said: It is the weakest among us who need education the most and we cannot stand by as they are being excluded.

Water at Shatila refugee camp in Beiruts southern suburbs is now so salty and ridden with chemicals that metal cutlery rusts after less than half an hours exposure to the brine.
Imagine having water so bad that you cant have metal cutlery? Its hell water really, says Ahmed, a resident at the camp.
Gesturing at the salty, foul-smelling liquid oozing from a nearby tap, his friend Moussa Deeb, an electrician originally from Damascus, adds: Have you ever woken up and tried washing your face with sea water?

Camp authorities now have to bring in water for bathing and cleaning from outside.
The site of a brutal massacre during the Lebanese civil war, Shatilas population has doubled to about 40,000 in the four years since the conflict in Syria began. At least 1.5 million refugees are estimated to have spilled over the border into Lebanon, with many seeking affordable housing in the populous coastal strip.
The water infrastructure was already reeling from decades of over-pumping, and the effect of these new arrivals has been devastating.
Families who used to receive four subsidised gallons of clean drinking water a week must now make do with half of that as cash-strapped camp bosses struggle to meet demand. Few communities in Lebanon have seen their water quality deteriorate as dangerously as Shatila, but the camps problems point to the countrys difficulties in coping with a sudden 30% growth in population.
People just dont realise how critical the status of our water resources is, said Nadim Farajalla, a professor of hydrology and water resources at the American University of Beirut. Refugees arriving when there was already a drought really killed us.
Unlike Jordan and Iraq, both of which have also taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, Lebanon usually enjoys a long rainy season and receives ample recharge from melting mountain snows, although rains are beginning to become less predictable because of climate change.
But poor management of water sources and the additional refugee demand have set the country on a destructive path.
Because of the Syrians, a water balance that should have been negative in 2030 is negative now, said Fadi Georges Comair, general director of hydraulics and electrical resources at the ministry of energy and water. We were organised to fulfil water demand management for about 4.5 million [people]. We were not ready to deal with the one-and-a-half to two million extras that have come already.
Over the mountains from Beirut, and alongside the Syrian border, residents of the agricultural Bekaa Valley are experiencing their own water crisis.

Water demand from the thousands of makeshift refugee tent settlements has meant rivers are drying up earlier than usual. Farmers, who previously resorted to using expensive wells for water in the hot summer months, are now having to pay out for these earlier in the year. According to Farajalla, the effects in a country that already imports 80% of its cereals , and where the amount of land devoted to food has fallen by 45% in 20 years, are obvious. Many farmers have simply given up.
Every week, theres a bad pump here or a revolution there, so agriculture is not easy in Lebanon, said Mohammed al-Arigi, who grows wheat, radishes and a variety of vegetables within earshot of heavy shelling and bombs three miles away across the border.
The crisis has had some compensations, farmers say. The glut of young, desperate men has meant theres plenty of cheap labour. But the tide of wastewater seeping from the haphazardly built refugee shelters has forced some to shift away from growing vegetables that are usually served raw, such as lettuce, due to concerns about exposure to contaminated water.

Water experts acknowledge that no country of Lebanons size could cope easily with such an influx of refugees, but they say infrastructural neglect by Beiruts paralysed political class has left it particularly poorly placed to handle the crisis.
Water establishments are highly understaffed, lack financial means, technical competence, and effective internal organisation, said Marie-Hlne Nassif, a consultant for the International Water Management Institute , who has conducted extensive research in the Bekaa.
A national water strategy proposed in 2010 was never implemented properly due to political disagreements. Authorities are left to practically guess how much water they can count on because they lack the equipment necessary to gauge snowmelt.
Shatilas residents have tried to offset the terrible water quality by stocking up on rust-proof plastic cutlery. Nearby shops are doing a roaring trade selling water filters that offer the promise of usable tap water.
But civic leaders fear that conditions in the camp, where children are at risk of electrocution by the low-hanging mess of water pipes and electrical wires, will only worsen as more Syrians seek sanctuary among its creaking tower blocks.
For sure, the population will increase as the Syria war continues, said Abu Moujahed, director of the camps Children and Youth Centre. And the water and services will, of course, just get worse and worse too.

The battle to eliminate extreme poverty will require rich western nations to step up their financial help and spend at least half their aid budgets in the worlds poorest countries, a leading development campaign group said on Tuesday.
ONE, the organisation co-founded by U2 frontman Bono , said donor nations should reverse the trend of recent years that has seen only 30% of assistance go to the 37 least-developed countries (LDCs).
Total overseas development assistance flows to the least-developed countries have been in worrying decline in recent years. In 2014, total overseas development aid to LDCs fell by 2% compared with 2013 and by 6% compared with 2010, ONE said in a report designed to pressure the G8 leading western nations before their summit in Germany next month.
It added that only one country directed more than 50% of its overseas development aid to LDCs in 2014  Iceland. If the 24 rich countries that sit on the OECDs development assistance committee had allocated half of their budgets to LDCs in 2014, it would have made an additional $26.5bn (17.1bn) available to the worlds poorest countries, the report added.
Donor nations have generally failed to fulfil the promise made at the Gleneagles summit of 2005 to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid. Only five countries  Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain  achieved the 0.7% level in 2014, and aid budgets were skewed to parts of the world where western nations had strong historical links or where there was geo-political or security reason for providing help.
ONE said that 2015 would be a crucial year, with a conference in Addis Ababa on providing the finance for development followed in September by a meeting of the UN that will set 17 Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030.
A new set of global goals  will set out the path to a fairer, more prosperous world and an end to extreme poverty. But goals alone are not enough  need a clear plan of action and the determination to deliver it.
ONE added that the conference in the Ethiopian capital would be the pivotal point of the year. It would require governments, civil society and businesses to provide additional aid, curb the illicit financial flows and corruption that strip countries of precious development resources, and improve transparency and accountability.
The campaign group called for a mutual accountability pact to meet the basic needs of the poorest people, which would require the mobilisation of international and domestic resources. The pact would include minimum spending levels on essential services of $300 per person in the 27 LDCs by 2020; increased domestic government revenues; increased aid targeted at the poorest countries; specific investments in agriculture, infrastructure, energy and technology; and mechanisms to ensure commitments are kept to.
ONE added it was important that anti-poverty efforts concentrated on improving the lives of girls and women.
Poverty and gender inequality go hand in hand: girls and women in the poorest countries suffer a double hardship, of being born in a poor country and being born female. Put simply, poverty is sexist. Across virtually every measurable indicator, life is significantly harder for girls and women in LDCs compared with men, and compared with girls and women living in other countries, it said.

After more than 50 years of conflict marked by widespread and systemic sexual violence, Colombia has established a national day to remember the appalling suffering experienced by so many women, whose plight has until now been largely ignored.
The first National Day for the Dignity of Women Victims of Sexual Violence caused by the Internal Armed Conflict takes place on Monday 25 May.
The establishment of this special day and the inclusion of survivors of sexual violence in the peace talks in Havana aimed at ending the conflict demonstrate how public awareness of the issue is growing.
It is hard to quantify the numbers affected. One survey estimates that between 2000 and 2009, almost half a million women suffered some form of sexual violence in areas affected by the conflict.
But that is just an estimate. The truth is, in Colombia, as in many other countries with poor prosecution records, most women tend not to report acts of violence against them . According to the same survey, some 82% of women who have survived sexual violence in Colombia, domestic and conflict-related, have not reported the attacks.
One of those at the forefront of demanding public recognition of this form of violence, and the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators, is Colombian journalist Jineth Bedoya Lima , who 15 years ago was abducted, tortured and raped by three paramilitaries while investigating a story about arms trafficking. For years after the attack she had remained silent .
The UN security council recently commended Colombia for introducing a landmark law that recognises that sexual violence can constitute a crime against humanity, and enhances the status of sexual violence survivors so that they can receive reparations, psychosocial support and free medical care.
Related: Women's human rights defenders under threat  podcast
But the problem remains as marked as ever, if not worse, despite the fact the government and the Farc, the main insurgent group, have been engaged in peace talks for more than two years. Following a freedom of information request made by Claudia Meja, director of NGO Sisma Mujer  a Christian Aid partner  the National Institute of Forensic Services revealed that they recorded a 93% increase of sexual violence in the context of the conflict.
They also disclosed that there were 30% more killings of women by partners or ex-partners, and a sharp increase in threats against womens human rights defenders.
Explaining this apparent escalation of gender violence is not straightforward. One suggestion has been that more women are coming forward to report violence. Also, as more women dare to speak up, more may be facing a backlash.
To womens rights experts like Meja, the persistence of violence against women, however, shows that there are other forces at work. She believes that the root causes are the deeply entrenched discrimination and inequality that condones gender violence and, crucially, the almost complete impunity, particularly of military perpetrators. For this reason, Sisma Mujer and other organisations recently filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court, calling for sexual violence to be recognised as a deliberate strategy and war crime, and condemning the failure to prosecute perpetrators.
There is reason to hope that the final peace deal may bring some change. Thanks to relentless pressure by womens groups, the negotiators in Havana have established a special gender sub-committee and listened to testimonies of victims of sexual violence. These are positive and innovative steps, although long overdue given numerous, unfulfilled international commitments to incorporate women and gender perspectives in peace negotiations.
Allowing perpetrators of war crimes to walk free risks allowing such violence to become normalised
Yet, because these are negotiations, and because all parties continue to deny their responsibility for such crimes, there is a very real risk that perpetrators may get away with some form of amnesty, as has happened with a number of other peace deals in Latin America.
Failure to deal with abuses and allowing perpetrators of war crimes to walk free risks allowing such violence to become normalised, although the country may officially be at peace.
The peace deal that is sought is the opportunity to introduce radical change, and to shape a more equal society, tackling the root causes of the conflict. Guaranteeing justice and reparations for women and girls is an essential step towards a peace that is lasting and meaningful.
The work of womens rights groups including Sisma Mujer, alongside initiatives such as choosing a national day to recognise victims of sexual violence are vital to maintain pressure on the peace negotiators.

Democrats' committees face staggering early deficit among 2016 mega-donors
A provision quietly inserted into last years Cromnibus spending bill increased the maximum party committees can accept to over $334,000  and Republicans are out-raising Democrats among these mega-donors by an 11-to-1 margin

A new loophole stuck into a budget bill last year allows donors to gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to political parties. However, only the Republican party is benefiting from it.
A provision quietly inserted into the combination continuing resolution/omnibus spending bill  or Cromnibus  last year increased the maximum that party committees can accept from $33,400 to over $334,000 each year. (The limits were also increased for senate and congressional campaign committees to $234,000 apiece.)
And while Republicans are already taking advantage of this and have several donors giving this amount, Democrats are not keeping up.
According to the most recent FEC finance reports, while the Republican National Committee has six donors who have given the maximum of $334,600 to the GOP, not a single Democratic donor has even approached these totals in gifts to the Democratic National Committee. This imbalance is less pronounced but still present in contributions to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and National Republican Campaign Committee versus those to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
The result is that even as Democrats worry about the growing rise of Republican Super Pacs heavily funded by conservative mega-donors, they are lagging even further in competing with the GOP in this new category of hard money.
Yet, this shortfall isnt necessary fatal for Democrats yet. The additional $300,000 that donors can give is only allowed to go to special accounts earmarked for specific purposes, party headquarters maintenance, recount preparations and presidential conventions. These are segregated from the partys regular accounts, which means that the money cannot legally be used for other purposes.
But its still likely to make an impact. Through the parties April fundraising report, the GOP is outraising Democrats in these new special accounts by a margin of over 11 to 1. This gap is particularly noticeable with the party committees. The RNC has raised over $36m with 101 donors giving the old maximum of $33,400 and six giving the new maximum of $334,000. In contrast, the DNC lags behind, raising only $20m with 32 donors at the old maximum and none at the new.
Both the DNC and RNC declined to comment to the Guardian about this fundraising and whether it had any implications for the 2016 election.
However, Joe Sandler, a prominent Democratic election lawyer, told the Guardian that he suspected that this was just a matter of timing and sequencing. He thought the DNC eventually will take advantage of the new rules, particularly for funding conventions. My guess is that thats a temporary difference, Sandler said.
But for now, this temporary difference gives the GOP a significant advantage. The headquarters account is a relatively amorphous category that can go to building maintenance for offices across the country, and the recount account means that campaigns dont have to hold some money back before Election Day just in case the race is too close to call. It frees up valuable hard money that can be used to elect candidates up and down the ticket in 2016, and gives additional advantages to the party which can attract the most big donors.

On Wednesday, nine Democratic senators came out in support of a resolution to make four-year public colleges in the US debt-free. The resolution, proposed last month by senators Brian Schatz, Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren , calls on the federal government to provide states with support so that they can lower tuition costs, increase financial aid, reduce the burden of existing student debt. The resolution currently has 20 supporters in the Senate, while a similar resolution in the House has roughly 40 co-sponsors.
The increased support for the resolution adds pressure on potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates to either endorse the resolution or come up with a plan of their own, with supporters of the debt-free college measure particularly interested in seeing where Hillary Clinton will come out on the issue.
A week prior to officially announcing his run for president , Vermont senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill that would eliminate tuition at four-year public colleges and universities. The bill is estimated to cost $70bn a year  two-thirds of which would be covered by the federal government and one-third of which would be covered by the states. Federal funds for the bill would be sourced from a new tax that Sanders referred to as a Wall Street speculation fee to be imposed on Wall Street investment firms and hedge funds.
One of the main differences between Sanders plan and that of the other Democrats lies in what they seek to eliminate. While Sanders has narrowed his focus to tuition, others have zeroed in on debt.
The debt-free college plan has been championed by liberal organizations like Demos and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), who argue that free tuition is not always enough as often times the debt taken on by students in college is used to cover expenses like room and board, books, and transportation.
Its more than just tuition, said Mark Huelsman, senior policy analyst at think tank Demos, who drafted his organizations proposal for debt-free four-year public colleges.
Martin OMalley has come out in favor of debt-free college.In April, the likely presidential candidate told his supporters that  every student should be able to go to college debt-free .
Clinton has also adopted the rhetoric of debt-free college, even though she has yet to officially lay out her plan on this particular issue.
We have to deal with the indebtedness and try to move toward making college as debt-free as possible, Clinton said last week in Iowa .
At yet another stop on the campaign trail, she said : Theres something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills they need in order to make the best of their own lives.
Clintons campaign has hinted that she might tackle the issue in order to appeal to the younger voters whom many credited with Obamas victory .
What voters are looking for is someone to be a champion for everyday people. And for young people, thats debt-free college; that is finding that job after you graduate, Robby Mook, Clintons campaign director, said on CNBCs Squawk Box a couple of weeks earlier. We are looking across the board and we are going to fight for every single vote in every single state.
Meanwhile, the PCCC has already begun organizing in states like New Hampshire and Iowa to rally young voters behind the Democrats idea of debt-free tuition. Over 200 political leaders in those two states have endorsed the PCCCs debt-free college plan. According to Adam Green, cofounder of the PCCC and a former MoveOn organizer, polling shows that for Democrats, going big on student debt and tuition costs appeals to potential voters.
Bigger is better. Bigger is more popular. If we want to both excite the voters and win a mandate in 2016, we need to propose a policy that will be game-changing in as many peoples lives as possible. Free community college is good, but debt-free at all public colleges is the game-changer, Green told the Guardian.
A poll conducted by PCCCs sister organization Progressive Change Institute found that likely Democratic voters in 2016 who didnt vote in 2014 have shown interest in debt-free college as an issue.
Related: Obama's plan for free community college explained step-by-step
Of all the issues that we polled, the number one most motivational issue that non-voters say they would have voted for if somebody had campaigned on it was debt-free college, explained Green. So what we are saying to the Democratic party is dont just endorse debt-free college, make it a centerpiece of the 2016 election. Make it so that voters come to the polls thinking: Today, voting is going to get debt-free college for my kid. If Democrats win a landslide in 2016, after making debt-free college central, then we will have a mandate that will be impossible for Republicans to stop.
Its the voice of the voters and their rallying behind the issue that Democrats hope will convince the Republicans to get on board come 2016.
At the moment, the Obama administration is attempting to push through a proposal that would eliminate tuition at two-year community colleges. The Americas College Promise, as the plan is known, would split the cost between the federal government, which would cover 75%, and state government, which would cover the other 25%. Even if the plan ends up going nowhere in Washington, it has raised the profile of the issue.
To make four-year public colleges debt-free, similar cost-sharing would have to happen. In light of cuts to state funding for higher education across the US, the federal government would need to step in and offer incentives, said Huelsman.
What would it take for such cost-sharing measures to actually pass through Congress in 2016? Campaigners say nothing short of a Democratic landslide.
A new Democratic president, a new Democratic senate and House Republicans who are well aware that they are in a political peril if they oppose this very popular issue of debt-free college, said the PCCCs Green.

The fall of Ramadi has not just exposed the weakness of Barack Obamas nine-month war against the Islamic State . It has also exposed his administration to accusations of a growing credibility gap between optimistic White House pronouncements and the grim realities on the ground.
Related: Iraq launches counterattack against Isis near Ramadi
Iraq veterans, thinktank analysts and former US officials have begun drawing comparisons to Donald Rumsfelds Pentagon during the darkest days of the Iraq occupation. Then as now, some suspect the US is sacrificing a truthful description of the war to avoid pressure to escalate.
Perhaps reality has smacked the administration over the head with a two-by-four in recent days, said retired army colonel Peter Mansoor, a multi-tour Iraq veteran who served as executive officer to general David Petraeus during the 2007-08 Iraq surge.
The long-simmering critique has boiled over after Ramadi fell to Isis fighters, a circumstance administration officials downplayed before and after the capital of Anbar province was overrun earlier this month. Administration pronouncements on Ramadi now openly contradict assurances issued just days earlier.
On Saturday, defense secretary Ashton Carter excoriated the Iraqi military for showing  no will to fight  Isis, after it abandoned Ramadi  a city it had previously held for a year.
Yet just days before, the senior US military officer, general Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had defended the Iraqi withdrawal as a strategic retreat to a more defensible position. The [Iraqi Security Force] was not driven out of Ramadi, they drove out of Ramadi, Dempsey told the Wall Street Journal on 20 May.
Five days before that, as Isis fighters carried out a string of assassinations and bomb attacks that heralded their capture of the city, senior US officials insisted that their coalition  not the insurgents  still held the momentum.
The Iraqis, with coalition support, are making sound progress, Marine brigadier general Thomas Weidley, the chief of staff of the US military command prosecuting the war, told Pentagon reporters on 15 May. Weidley conceded that Isis had for days assaulted the city, but pointed to 165 air strikes which had been launched in the past month to help government forces keep Ramadi.
We firmly believe Daesh is on the defensive throughout Iraq and Syria, attempting to hold previous gains, while conducting small-scale, localized harassing attacks, occasional complex or high-profile attacks, in order to feed their information and propaganda apparatus, Weidley said , using a dismissive Arabic acronym for Isis.
Asked about Isis hoisting its flag in Ramadi, Weidley suggested that Isis was merely taking photos and documenting small-term gains and then using it for propaganda purposes.
By 26 May, more than a week after Ramadi fell, a Central Command press release boasting of a robust coalition commitment to defeating Isis referred vaguely to recent tactical-level setbacks.
In the weeks before Ramadi fell, Pentagon officials dismissed fighting in the surrounding, mainly Sunni province of Anbar as a sideshow.
On 14 April, Dempsey said Ramadi  the capital of Anbar provice, which sits between Isis strongholds in Syria and the Iraqi capital of Baghdad  was  not symbolic in any way , calling the oil refinery at Baiji  a more strategic target . Baiji is about 180km south of Mosul, Iraqs second city, which US warplanners have publicly prioritized over Ramadi since autumn  an emphasis they have now reversed.
Anyone who was looking at the situation could tell that the loss of Ramadi would be hugely significant, Mansoor said.
Mansoor, now a history professor at the Ohio State University, bemoaned happy talk that the strategy is working and all they need to do is adjust at the margins, saying it could create a credibility gap going forward if they dont become more forthright.
Beyond Ramadi, questionable administration statements about Iraq and Isis have accumulated for months.
In April, the Pentagon released a map that seemed to show Isis losing its hold on territory throughout Iraq by more than 25% . Despite the administrations daily air strikes and its deployment of 3,000 noncombat military forces back to Iraq, Susan Rice, Obamas national security adviser, said on 20 May that Obama has  ended two wars responsibly   while both wars continue .
The deployment of those forces, many of them elite troops that the administration prefers to call advisers to the Iraqi military, has stretched the White House assurance against boots on the ground to the breaking point. So has the on-the-ground contributions to the war made by Shia militias and Iranian forces, which took the city of Tikrit back from Isis even as senior US generals denied they were present .
Even the Pentagons website for the war prefers the relatively antiseptic term  Targeted Operations Against [Isis] Terrorists . Meanwhile, a campaign that Obama unilaterally launched in August with the limited goal of preventing a  humanitarian catastrophe  has sprawled into daily strikes in two countries. The US military acknowledges causing only two civilian casualties despite launching more than 3,000 such air strikes.
Jack Keane, the former army vice chief of staff and an architect of the surge, told a Senate panel on Thursday that the specter of the Rumsfeld Pentagon, which for years insisted the Iraq occupation faced merely minor difficulties, had returned .
I hear a disturbing and frightening echo of the summer of 2006 when administration senior government  when a different administration, senior government officials and military senior generals came before this committee and in the face of compelling evidence that our strategy in Iraq was failing, these officials looked at you and defended that strategy and told you that overall the strategy was succeeding, Keane testified.
From the White House, the administration has taken the view that the war would always be  long and difficult , as deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said on 18 May, and the fall of Ramadi is a setback that does not herald broader flaws in US strategy. Weve had other periods of setback too that have been followed shortly by important progress, press secretary Josh Earnest said on 19 May.
Taking a broader view, Obama last week rebuffed the idea that he overlearned the mistake of Iraq, suggesting that the limits he has placed on the US military commitment to Iraq reflect and hedge against Iraqi sectarianism that outside pressure cannot resolve.
If the Iraqis themselves are not willing or capable to arrive at the political accommodations necessary to govern, if they are not willing to fight for the security of their country, we cannot do that for them, Obama told the Atlantics Jeffrey Goldberg , adding: No, I dont think were losing.

Despite fierce campaigning by women rights groups and an international outcry, Burma has introduced a birth control law which opponents say is aimed at ethnic minorities.
The controversial bill is one of four pieces of legislation driven by nationalist Buddhist monks who fear that the Muslim population is growing too quickly.
Under the law signed by president Thein Sein, governments of the 14 states and regions can request a presidential order so that local authorities can organise women to have a gap of 36 months between births.

The World Health Organisation recommends a similar policy to reduce child mortality. However, the law explicitly states that factors taken into consideration, as well as mortality rates and food shortage, can be a high number of migrants in the area, a high population growth rate and a high birth rate, that are seen negatively impacting regional development.
This has reinforced concerns of international observers that the law is aimed primarily at controlling birth rates of the Muslim community  which has been subject to birth-control policies in the past  and non-Buddhists more widely.
Burmas attorney general Tun Shin, who is reported to be a London-educated Christian, will oversee the laws and will be supported by Khin Yi, a retired brigadier-general who was previously chief of police.
The Health Care for Population Control act does not identify any specific group within Burmas web of ethnic communities and religions. But as the plight of thousands of Rohingya Muslim fleeing persecution unfolds, the US and human rights organisations have stepped up their criticism.
US deputy secretary of state Antony Blinken said at a press conference in Yangon on Saturday that he was deeply concerned about the four laws, that could exacerbate ethnic and religious divisions. He said the population law could be enforced in such a way as to undermine the reproductive rights of minorities. Blinken lobbied president Thein Sein about the law on a visit last week while it had already been discreetly signed.
We are particularly concerned that the bill could provide a legal basis for discrimination through coercive, uneven application of birth control policies, and differing standards of care for different communities across the country, the US State Department said.
Comments by extremist monk Ashin Wirathu, close to the Committee for the Protection of Nationality and Religion movement that inspired the laws, has fueled concerns. If the bill is enacted, it could stop the Bengalis that call themselves Rohingya, who are trying to seize control, he told The Irrawaddy, a local magazine.
[The bill] was drafted for healthcare. The World Health Organization also advised a three-year interval between each child. Will it only be legal when women join the discussion? Did women have any participation in sharia law? He added.
The three other laws would impose restrictions on religious conversion and inter-religious marriage and prohibit extra-marital affairs.
The final version of the bill was approved by the joint houses of parliament on 14 May following minor amendments submitted by the president. Members of Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy opposed the bill.
Activists with a racist, anti-Muslim agenda pressed this population law so there is every reason to expect it to be implemented in a discriminatory way, Human Rights Watch Asia director Brad Adams said, warning that the package of laws was likely to escalate repression and sectarian violence.
Rights groups complain that they have not seen the final text of the law but earlier drafts instruct authorities in designated health zones to organise married couples to practise birth spacing. The bill does not contain explicit guarantees that contraceptive use should be voluntary with consent of the user. It does not specify punishments either, nor does it mention abortion.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al-Hussein, also expressed concern over the four bills as they moved through parliament in February.
During an election year, it will be tempting for some politicians to fan the flames of prejudice for electoral gain, he said, placing the legislation in the context of an unpopular quasi-civilian government facing parliamentary elections in November and unwilling to antagonise powerful lobby groups of Burmas Bamar Buddhist majority.
One of the constant narratives of a hardline minority of Buddhist monks is that the ancient religion of Burma must be defended against an advancing tide of radical Islam, with the Muslim population growing more swiftly within the country and entering as illegal immigrants from without.
A report commissioned by the government after violent clashes between Buddhists and Muslims concluded in 2013 that the extremely rapid growth rate of the Bengali population also contributed to fear and insecurity ... The growth was not only due to high birth rates, but also to a steady increase of illegal immigration from neighbouring Bangladesh.
Khon Ja, a member of the Kachin Womens Peace Network which is part of a wider group of womens organisations trying to stop the law, said it particularly affected minority groups.
The target is the Rohingya, she said, referring to the Muslim minority. But the law could affect anyone, she added.
She is worried about the vagueness of the law and what punishments might be entailed. There are concerns it would be applied to pregnant women in prison, and whether they might come under pressure to have abortions.
Members of the Akhaya womens group, which promotes education about sexual health, said they were sexually harassed on social media and even accused of treason for speaking out against the law.
Activists still hope that even after becoming law the government will fail to follow up with the specific directives that would activate the population controls. If Aung San Suu Kyis party wins the elections in November and is allowed to form a government they could then influence that process and clarify the law. However, a new government will not take office until next March 2016.

        <title>Brexit: would it mean dancing to our own tune, or being out of step with the world?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/24/brexit-anti-eu-lobby-must-come-clean</Link>
        <Description>The anti-EU lobby needs to explain in detail what the reality of leaving the union will mean </Description>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
We learned last week that the business world is not united on the burning issue of the UKs membership of the European Union . There is clearly a powerful pro-EU lobby that will rally to CBI president Sir Mike Rakes call for business to turn up the volume and be crystal clear that membership is in our national interest. Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao, for example, said last week: Its in the interests of our customers and our shareholders that Britain does not leave the EU.
But there are also vocal opponents. Graeme MacDonald, chief executive of digger firm JCB, said he did not think a UK exit would make a blind bit of difference to trading with Europe. Others advise waiting to see what David Camerons attempt at renegotiating the UKs relationship with the EU yields.
Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, said: Some of these reforms can be done and should be done, and it is best for Britain to see what those reforms are before making a judgment.
That position may also be closer to the mood of the majority of small and medium-sized businesses. In a survey last year the Institute of Directors  which has a very different membership from the CBI, with its battalion of multinationals and large banks  found that for 60% of members, support for continued EU membership was conditional on successful reforms in key areas, such as employment law.
At least we will have a debate. Despite the CBIs irritating claim to be the voice of business (as if there could be only one), Rake is correct on two central points. First, it would be a good thing if business folk spoke in a language people can understand. Second, opponents of EU membership should explain in detail what an alternative would look like.
The first point cuts both ways. If employers, when they grumble about the EU working time directive and other employment laws, really mean that they would like greater freedom to fire staff cheaply, they should say so. Such an admission might not convert many waverers to the EU cause, but it would be honest.
Equally, though, directors should feel free to say what Brexit  the UKs exit from the EU  would mean for jobs and investment at their companies. High-minded notions about open economies and the benefits of free trade dont cut it. Workers want to know if their jobs are on the line. In the Scottish referendum, the threat of specific jobs and companies moving to England injected a much-needed dose of economic realism into the debate.
Few would mourn the departure of crisis-ridden Deutsche Bank from the City, but if a more respected institution  say, Lloyds of London, the insurance market  could make a detailed case about the damaging effect of Brexit on the financial services industry, voters would wish to hear it.
The second point  about an alternative to EU membership  is critical. Here Rake makes a good argument: Norway and Switzerland are not in the EU but still have to abide by EU rules to sell into the single market, so where is the supposed escape from European red tape?
MacDonald at JCB says it is easier selling to North America than to Europe sometimes, but why does he believe exit, as opposed to engagement from within, would improve matters?
Thats the challenge to get-out lobby must face. Its easy to maintain that the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals with countries across the globe, rather than be bound by the EUs agreements. Of course there could be deals. But would they be better deals? Common sense suggests the US, for example, would give more generous terms to a zone of 500 million citizens than to a single country with 64 million people. If the reality is different, lets hear a detailed account rather than vague aspiration.
Wongas back: would you credit it?
Three years ago Wonga , pumping out profits of 62m on turnover of just 309m, proclaimed its borrowers were young, single, employed, digitally savvy and can pay us back on time. Except that much of its lavish profit margin was from multiple fees racked up by less than savvy individuals who did not pay back on time, and who were wiped out by its 5,853% interest rate.
Last month, a humbled Wonga  having been forced to write off loans to 330,000 clients and pay millions after it was found to have issued fake legal letters  reported a loss of 37m. As one wag put it, the loss would only have been 1.50 if it hadnt taken out a loan with itself in December.
Last week Wonga relaunched, were told, to a more middle-class audience. Its less-than-catchy new slogan is credit for the real world. Its press release proclaims: Our focus is on serving hard-working people throughout the UK. With admirable chutzpah, Andy Haste, the chairman brought in to clean up the operation, said it had decided to keep the Wonga name as it was still seen as a trusted brand by our core audience.
That core audience has shrunk dramatically, from more than 1million to around 600,000 today. Wonga believes new customers will be impressed by a 24-hour money-back guarantee, a three-day grace period, where customers will escape the 15 default fee, and freezing all balances in arrears to stop them racking up interest for longer than seven days.
It has even slashed the interest it charges. It faces stiff competition, as personal loan rates have tumbled in recent months. M&amp;S Bank is offering an APR of 3.6% (although the minimum term is 12 months, rather more than with Wonga). Nationwide and Sainsburys are also charging 3.6%.
So what is Wonga now charging? Its new APR is 1,509%, or, using its preferred calculation, 292%. The Wonga puppets may have been retired but evidently the company reckons there are plenty more muppets out there.
Half a dozen of the other sex isnt much FTSE 100 progress
A small victory for diversity at the top of Britains biggest companies was scored on Friday when Alison Brittain was named as the new chief executive of Whitbread, owner of Premier Inns and Costa Coffee. Not only has Brittain managed to jump sectors  she has spent her entire career as a banker until now  she has managed to take the number of female bosses in the FTSE 100 to six.
Brittain joins Vronique Laury at Kingfisher, Liv Garfield at Severn Trent, Moya Greene at Royal Mail, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall at easyJet in the higher echelons of corporate Britain.
But keep the champagne on ice. In 2015, six female bosses out of 100 should not be a cause for celebration. The truth is that there are still nearly three times as many bosses called John (or Jean) at the helm of big UK businesses as there are women.

Canadian three-way split might enable Harper to pull a Cameron in election
Conservative government has got through a tough spring and could, like its UK counterparts, achieve a majority unless Liberals and New Democrats cooperate

Canadas increasingly unpopular Conservative government stumbled through a bruising spring in which it enraged the nation and alienated some of its most faithful supporters. But the prime minister, Stephen Harper , is entering the race for re-election this autumn with the wind at its back.
The reason parallels the situation in the UK, where David Cameron returned with a majority of seats conjured from a bare plurality of votes. Opposition to Harper is evenly divided between two major opposition parties  the Liberals and the New Democrats  so the one-third of voters who vote Conservative are set once again to choose Canadas national government.
Most analysts here think that vote-splitting will help Harper and the Conservatives, says Ted Morton, a former Conservative politician and senior fellow at the Manning Foundation thinktank in Calgary. As evidence, he points to the last election, in which Harper prefigured Camerons feat by winning a solid majority of seats with fewer than 40% of votes.
Harper is still within reach of a minority, if not yet a majority, Morton says.

The Conservatives gained fresh hope of a sort this week with the release of polls showing a strong surge in support for the leftwing New Democratic party following its surprise victory in a recent provincial election in Alberta, a staunchly conservative region often called the Texas of Canada .
The NDP gains have drawn the federal party tied with the Conservatives and the Liberal party in voter approval ratings as the long campaign begins, thus improving the odds that the increasingly restive majority of Canadians who oppose the Harper government will once again divide their votes and usher him to victory.
Outsiders will find little to distinguish between the two parties now promising a progressive alternative to the Conservatives.
Under their dashing but unproven young leader, Justin Trudeau, the Liberals have attempted a youth-centred revival promising a break from the complacency and cronyism of the partys recent past.
The New Democrats  led by bearded, experienced Thomas Mulcair  have emulated Tony Blairs New Labour by jettisoning their old-school socialist baggage and veering onto the centre-left terrain previously monopolized by the Liberals.
The one wedge that opens clear light between the two opposition leaders is their stated willingness to cooperate in an effort to defeat Harper. After some prevarication this spring, Trudeau ultimately rejected calls to form a coalition with the NDP in order to topple the Tories, citing personal differences with Mulcair. His style is anchored in the old way of practising politics, Trudeau said.
By contrast, Mulcair has openly embraced cooperation in an effort to distinguish himself from the Liberal leader, eldest son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau. My first priority is to get rid of Stephen Harper, he said in response to the Liberal leaders rebuff. The first priority of Justin Trudeau is Justin Trudeau.
As deadlock looms and commentators descend into familiar demands for electoral reform, the leftwing campaign group Council of Canadians has launched a voter registration campaign, confident that increasing the last campaigns historically low 61% turnout will accomplish the necessary work automatically.
Its a complicated situation, says the councils head, Maude Barlow. But if we can get the issues out and get more people voting, we can get rid of Harper even if there isnt any formal coalition ahead of time.
Barlow accuses the Conservatives of hollowing out Canadian civil society, cancelling thousands of programmes, rescinding grants, removing regulations, shutting institutions and rescinding the tax-exempt status of annoying charities. They dont care about us and I dont believe they try to represent us, she says. They only care about the 35% of the population they want to vote for them.
Related: Canada poised to pass anti-terror legislation despite widespread outrage
Even former supporters have joined the attack. The governments sweeping anti-terror legislation, seen as a political masterstroke when introduced, ultimately inspired a massive outcry that echoed from every establishment pulpit in the country. The governments more recent attempt to announce clearly unattainable carbon-emission targets  and its subsequent U-turn inspired derision on both the right and left.
Partisan cooperation is unknown in Canadian election campaigns, according to Bob Rae, a senior statesman who served as the NDP premier of Ontario 20 years ago and more recently as the federal Liberal partys caretaker leader following its 2011 electoral collapse under Michael Ignatieff .
People are very determined to maintain the identity of their parties and to maintain their separateness, Rae says, and the intensity to do that seems to grow as the ideological differences between the parties becomes less and less significant.
Despite that, Rae adds, there is a long history of Canadian parties cooperating to form governments following less than decisive elections. And despite the reliable perversity of a first-past-the-post electoral system in a multiparty democracy, theres never any easy way to tell whom it may favour.
First-past-the-post is a momentum play, Rae says. I think what were seeing, particularly with this long campaign, is that its quite possible any of the three parties will make a breakthrough.

        <title>First Ramadi, then Palmyra: Isis shows it can storm bastions of Syria and Iraq</title>

Islamic State fighters are celebrating their second major conquest in a week in Syria and Iraq as they pick through the ruins of the historic city of Palmyra.
The sudden advance of the militants into the UN heritage site in central Syria resulted in the rout of a national army, the exodus of refugees and a fresh pulse of regional alarm at the resilience of the self-styled caliphate force.
The UN said one-third of Palmyras 200,000-strong population had fled. And Isis militants used social media to show themselves posing amid ancient columns in Palmyra on Thursday. Other images displayed a more familiar theme: the summary slaughter of local men whose blood drenched the road.

Isiss latest advance has prompted a re-evaluation across the region, which had earlier sensed it might be in retreat. From Beirut to Baghdad and as far away as Riyadh, regional actors are coming to terms with an organisation that can win most of its battles and successfully storm Syria and Iraqs best-defended bastions.
The seizure of Palmyra followed the equally startling conquest of Ramadi in Iraqs Anbar province last weekend. Both operations, around 600 miles apart, have become emblematic of a terror group that can have its way across two crumbling countries despite embattled state forces being propped up by global powers.
In Syria, forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad had committed to defend gas fields to the north of Palmyra that are essential to the nations electricity supply. The ruins themselves, as well as being enduring testaments to the countrys diverse past, are central to the pluralistic image conveyed by the modern state. Both sites are strategic, yet they fell in less than four days  with elite army units unwilling and unable to defend them.
Ramadi in Iraq , meanwhile, had been a holdout in the heart of the countrys most hostile province  a place where local Sunni leaders allied with the Shia-led government and its militia proxies to keep Isis at bay.
That too changed in less than 72 hours of clashes, where top-tier troops and tribes posed little resistance. In both cases, once the battles started going badly, state forces surrendered the cities to their fate, leaving large amounts of ammunition behind.
They wanted to defend this area, said a government official who fled Palmyra for Damascus on Thursday. They even tried to. But if thats the best that they can do when they try, then the country is lost.
Officials who had fled Palmyra said jets from the US-led coalition that had bombed Isis targets elsewhere in the country had not joined the fight. US jets were instrumental in expelling the terror group from the two cities it has lost so far, Kobani, in Syrias north, and Tikrit, in central Iraq.

The fall of Ramadi stirred ghosts of a painful past: jihadis had used the city as a launch pad to spread nationwide chaos from 2004-07. That could never happen again, Iraqi officials claimed. The fact that it has  yielding Isis its most spectacular triumph this year  has shattered already brittle confidence in the ability of Iraq to hold the country together.
In both countries, residents said the Isis victories said perhaps more about the weakness of the states than about the potency of the jihadis. And while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fall of Palmyra meant Isis now controls more than 50% of the country, opposition groups countered by saying that battle lines elsewhere in Syria had not shifted in Isiss favour since 2013.
Gains against the Syrian regime, they said, had been made by groups who previously fought Isis and included an amalgam of mainstream fighters and jihadis, among them the ascendant al-Nusra front, which like Isis has been prescribed by the US and much of Europe as a terrorist group.
The anti-Assad opposition played no role in the Palmyra clashes. Regime troops had been the areas primary defenders.
In Ramadi, despair was endemic. There are no police left, said the police chief, Colonel Jabbar al-Assif, himself a recent exile. Everyone left was killed or is injured. Whoever didnt make it out was killed later on by Isis. They have a list of all the policemen and the soldiers, with addresses, and they were going to their homes to kill them. So all of the police families fled too.

Most people in Ramadi want to fight but they dont have weapons. The government hasnt helped us. The police ask the government for weapons and the government tells them: Go and buy weapons and we will reimburse you. When did that ever happen in any country?

The Isis advances mark a sharp turnaround from events earlier this year when it lost Kobani and Tikrit and was forced to retreat from around 7,700 sq miles (20,000 sqkm) of land in northern Iraq. That had led to claims that it could not hold its gains, and that after a year in which sociopolitics of the Middle East had been overturned, Isis could no longer secure its objectives.
If the state was strong, then that would be the case, said an army officer who ordered his men to flee Ramadi. They are not winning because they are powerful. They are winning because we are weak. Im not sure about Syria, but I think its the same there.
Thirty miles closer to Baghdad, in the city of Falluja, which is also under Isis control, some residents say they have become used to the jihadis in their midst and have come to prefer them to the vagaries of central government rule.
We dont have much electricity and fuel and we have been bombed a lot by the air strikes, but apart from that we are in a better condition than we were under the army, said a doctor to whom Isis had offered security and a platform that Iraqs government could not match.
We in Falluja prefer to stay here in our homes than become refugees begging to enter Baghdad or left to rot in refugee camps which arent even suitable for animals. We prefer to live with our dignity in our city. We are all viewed by the government as Isis, this is our identity.

Seizure of Palmyra and Ramadi by Isis reveal gaping holes in US jihadi strategy
Far from being on the defensive, Islamic State has shown that the arms-length approach of the US to Iraq is failing and Washington is operating day by day

Islamic States victories in Palmyra and Ramadi have been painful blows for the US-led coalition in both Syria and Iraq respectively, underlining the flaws in a strategy that has been widely criticised as both wrong-headed and half-hearted.
Until the last few weeks the conventional wisdom in Washington, London and Arab capitals was that Isis had been forced on to the back foot, suffering from shortages of cash, weapons and problems of resupply, even if its morale was sustained by a slick propaganda machine that kept attracting recruits.
Now events may be forcing a rethink. The Obama administration is taking an extremely hard look at its approach, in the words of an unnamed official who declared in the wake of the fall of Ramadi: Youd have to be delusional not to take something like this and say what went wrong, how do you fix it and how do we correct course to go from here?
Robert Gates, the former US defence secretary, put it even more bluntly: We dont really have a strategy at all. Were basically playing this day by day. The urgent delivery of new anti-tank missiles for the Iraqi army has been one short-term response. But larger military and political questions are still unanswered.
Iraq remains the priority. Air attacks launched last September have been carried out by the US, Britain and half a dozen other countries, while operations in Syria are limited to the US and the largely symbolic presence of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . Coalition aircraft have carried out 2,200 air strikes in Iraq and 1,400 in Syria.
The recapture of Kobani on the Syrian-Turkish border has been the headline achievement for the air campaign. Last week the US highlighted a special forces raid that killed a Isis financier. Britain made great play of the imposition of EU sanctions on the Syrian purchasing oil from the group on behalf of Bashar al-Assad. Squeezing Isis cash is an important element of the overall strategy, officials say. So is domestic counter-terrorism work.
In recent weeks a significant novelty in the regional mix has been the greater effectiveness of Saudi Arabia , which is now working with its old rivals Qatar and Turkey to build a more potent coalition of non-Isis Syrian rebel groups fighting Assad on the ground, not just from 30,000ft.
By contrast, the US programme to train and equip a Syrian force to fight Isis  though not Assad  is moving agonisingly slowly after its launch in Jordan a few weeks ago. Britain backs that effort as well as maintaining financial and political support for the opposition Syrian National Coalition. But the SNCs unceasing demands for a no-fly zone or a safety zone to protect civilians from the regimes barrel bombs and chlorine gas are getting nowhere slowly.
On the Iraqi front, analysts say the US has to decide how many more victories by Isis it can sustain before increasing support to the underperforming Baghdad government forces on the ground. It and its allies must also do more to back acceptable insurgent groups in Syria, argues Charles Lister of the Brookings Institution.
But Obamas credibility is extremely low. Next time you read some grand statement by US officials on [the] campaign against Isis or see a Centcom [US Central Command] map about Isis reversals, just bin it, commented Emile Hokayem , a respected Middle East expert with the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
The fundamental problem is that Isis is waging war across two countries in a single interconnected crisis that is sustained by Sunni anger and the perception that the US and the west are content to look on as a confident Iran backs Shia groups in Iraq and beyond for its own strategic and sectarian reasons.
In the Middle East the conventional wisdom remains that Islamic State will not be defeated until Assad is. But while there is no doubt that the Syrian presidents position has weakened in recent weeks, his regimes demise is not in sight.

EU Eastern Partnership summit will highlight failure of plan to check Russia

A summit in Riga this week is likely to highlight the failure of the EUs flagship programme designed to entice six former Soviet states out of Moscows orbit and into the embrace of Brussels.
The Eastern Partnership scheme was set up in 2009 in response to Russian actions in Georgia and was meant to check Russias ambitions in what Moscow regards as its near abroad, while offering the vaguest of suggestions of future EU membership.
We will act more carefully with regard to Russia in the future. Perhaps there was not enough carefulness
The Kremlins intervention in Ukraine , however, combined with even less desire in the EU to see the bloc expand further, has left the Eastern Partnership concept in turmoil, with two of the six countries joining the Kremlins Eurasian Economic Union, explicitly designed as a rival to the EU.
Meanwhile, Ukraine and Georgia , the most fervently pro-EU of the six, are likely to be given little in the way of carrots at the summit in Riga, to be held on Thursday and Friday.
At a 2013 summit of the grouping in Vilnius, Lithuania , Ukraines then president Viktor Yanukovych said he would not sign a free trade agreement envisaged by the programme, under pressure from Russia. The decision set in motion a chain of events that led to protests in Ukraine, Yanukovychs downfall, the Russian annexation of Crimea and war in east Ukraine.

These events have loomed heavily over the Riga summit.
We have all experienced a collective shock that we have a neighbour who is willing to use any means in order to undermine sovereign choices in Europe . We thought that this time was long over, said a top EU official in the runup to the summit.
Amid internal EU divisions on whether the best response to this is redoubled commitment to integrating eastern neighbours or a scale-back of ambition, the result is a fudge.
The EU will never allow a third country to dictate the policy it has towards other countries, said the senior EU official. However, we will act more carefully with regard to Russia in the future. Perhaps there was not enough carefulness, not enough outreach, not enough dialogue before.

In the runup to Riga, EU officials are publicly claiming they are still as committed as ever to the Eastern Partnership. But the rhetoric shows the bloc is now extremely worried about provoking Russia and the voices of EU member states less hawkish on Russia are in the ascendancy.
We dont want to provoke Russia and give them one more reason to be aggressive, said another European diplomat attending the summit. We need to be extremely careful.
Trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the EU were held this week in Brussels to iron out the details and time scale of the implementation of the EU-Ukraine free trade agreement.
Among some of the partner countries, enthusiasm for the project is also on the wane. Azerbaijan , aware that the EU is interested in its energy supplies anyway, has lost interest in the programme. President Ilham Aliyev will not attend the Riga summit, apparently in protest at European complaints about the countrys human rights record. Belarus and Armenia are still engaging with the programme but have become members of Vladimir Putins Eurasian Union, ruling out real economic or political integration with the EU.

That leaves Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova still keen on EU integration and eventual membership, but here it is the EU itself that is trying to slow things down. Diplomats say they are preparing to manage expectations of Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova , because several EU countries do not want to commit even to the vague prospect of future membership as part of the Riga summit. Wrangling over the wording of the summits statement is ongoing. Even visa-free travel, a key carrot for Eastern partnership countries, seems unlikely to be extended to Ukraine and Georgia in Riga.
Before the summit, a new study released recommends the EU to do much more to counter Kremlin propaganda among Russian-speaking citizens of EU and neighbouring countries.
More than 90 media experts worked on the feasibility study presented by the European Endowment for Democracy, which works for greater coordination among Russian-language media resources and increased funding.

Peter Pomerantsev, one of the authors of the report, who writes extensively about Kremlin-controlled media propaganda, said: One thing we discovered across the Eastern Partnership and beyond: people often dont trust any media  be they Russian, western or their own. We need to rebuild trust in high-quality journalism.
Moscow boosted its budgets in 2015 for its English-language global network RT and for Rossiya Segodnya, the state news agency headed by television propagandist Dmitry Kiselev and producing output in a dozen languages. It also has a major Russian-language arm aimed at speakers in the Baltics and elsewhere.
However, some express unease over the fact that many of the calls for funding Russian-language media sound like calls to play Russia at its own game.
It should not mean counter-propaganda. We have to find a smarter way, said Jerzy Pomianowski, executive director of the European Endowment for Democracy.

Israel's bus segregation row shows high wire act facing Netanyahu
Caught between the Israeli right and the international community, the president is struggling to keep all his plates spinning

The first crisis in the new rightwing government of Binyamin Netanyahu  over a discriminatory pilot scheme that would have seen some Palestinian workers banned from using Israeli buses in the occupied West Bank  is deeply instructive.
Scotched by Netanyahu barely hours after it had been approved by defence minister Moshe Yaalon, amid an outcry from across the Israeli political spectrum that condemned the move as racist and smacking of apartheid, it has underscored the immense political challenges facing Israels prime minister.
At the head of a coalition with a majority of one in the Knesset, Netanyahu has found himself exactly where many expected him to be after having assembled a coalition heavily dominated by the pro-settler right: between a rock and a hard place.
Reliant on the support of Naftali Bennetts ultra-nationalist Jewish Home, he has found himself, too, under sharp and increasing scrutiny by the international community including the US and EU. During elections in March, Netanyahu appealed directly to Bennetts voters when he disavowed support for a two-state solution, a position he has since tried to row back on.
In any circumstances the events of Tuesday evening and Wednesday were bizarre in their timing.

Coinciding with the visit of the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter , who had flown in to try to persuade the Palestinian Football Association to drop its efforts to have Israeli football banned from international competition for discrimination, it also preceded the visit of EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini  who is under increasing pressure to formulate a tougher policy against Israels continued occupation and settlement-building.
While it is possible Netanyahu was not aware of the decision by his defence minister  one of his closest allies in cabinet, Moshe Yaalon  to press ahead with the controversial pilot scheme, that poses an equally awkward question: why not?
The explanation of Netanyahus own office has hardly helped shed light on what occurred  a series of events evoking more than a passing similarity to the political satire The Thick of It. The proposals, Netanyahus office told the Jerusalem Post without elaboration, were unacceptable to the prime minister.

What seems more than likely is that this will not be an isolated incident. For years Netanyahu has flourished on his own terms as the political equivalent of a plate spinner in an old-fashioned music hall act, supplying just enough momentum to avoid a crisis.
In the last year, however, that trick has seemed ever harder for him to pull off. Unhappy with what he thought was an unmanageable coalition last year, he has replaced it with a more tenuous one.
The reality, underscored by recent events, is that Netanyahu is confronting a potentially unsolvable problem.
On the one hand he cannot keep the pro-settlement lobby inside his government happy without increasing friction with an international community already deeply frustrated by the collapse of the Middle East peace process.
On the other, Netanyahu  under pressure from the US and the EU to show concrete signs that he is still committed to negotiations  has little room to move on them, surrounded in government as he is by those who oppose the creation of a Palestinian state.
Related: Shaky Israel coalition spells trouble for Netanyahu and peace process
If the bus-segregation row was one indicator of this increasingly precarious high-wire act, it has not been the only one in recent days.
As few have failed to notice, Silvan Shalom, the man Netanyahu has given responsibility for handling peace negotiations with the Palestinians, has been vocal in the past about his opposition to a Palestinian state.
And it is not only political figures from Israels left and centre that have been sounding warnings about the direction of the country under Netanyahus new coalition.
In Tuesdays Haaretz, prefiguring the bus segregation row, former Likud minister Dan Meridor warned in sharp terms about his old partys dangerous trajectory.
In the past, warned Meridor, the Likud had always tried to strike a balance between nationalism and the pursuit of the Zionist dream, on the one hand, and liberalism, respect for democracy and the individual, on the other.
This balance, unfortunately, has been disturbed and I see the Likud becoming much more nationalistic and less attentive to its liberal side. Today, in the party, when you use words like democracy, human rights and rule of law, they immediately depict you as a leftist.
For now all the plates are still spinning. But for how long?

        <title>Belfast gay cake ruling: the law may be clear, but was it wise to prosecute?</title>

Sections of the Tory press got predictably excited on Wednesday about a Belfast judges ruling that a local bakery firm run by staunch Christians had been guilty of discrimination for refusing to bake a cake with Sesame Street puppet decorations proclaiming the virtues of gay marriage.
Related: The gay cake ruling is a victory for equality in Northern Ireland | Joshua Rozenberg
So the law is clear, but were the plaintiffs wise? Im not sure.
In a 90-minute hearing on Tuesday Judge Isobel Brownlie decided the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland was right in bringing the case on behalf of Gareth Lee, described as a gay activist, who had tried to buy the cake from Belfast-based Ashers Baking Company. The firm must pay a token 500 in compensation, plus costs which will be larger.
The commissions head, Michael Wardlow, argues that people who take part in commercial activity must do so within the framework of the law which outlaws this kind of discrimination. Fair enough, and Northern Ireland is a corner of the kingdom which has seen more than its share of ugly discrimination down the decades.
As Joshua Rozenberg explains , the law is clear. When conflicting ethical values collide  in this case the hard-fought battle of gays to overcome persecution and achieve equal rights versus the embattled beliefs of Christians in a largely secular country  the law as stated must prevail.
As the Daily Mail loves to point out, there have been several such cases. A Cornish couple running a small hotel had a ruling (it went all the way to the supreme court) against them after refusing a double room to a gay couple on the grounds that they were not married. In vain did they plead that theyd have done the same to unmarried heterosexuals on religious grounds. While the marriage guidance charity Relate was upheld in sacking a staffer who would not counsel gay couples.
Each case is different, but we get their drift. My question is twofold. It may be legal, but is it wise? And is it fair of those who so recently suffered majoritarian persecution themselves to use the muscle they now enjoy to discomfort others when they can get their cakes baked or their hotel booked elsewhere?
I dont claim to be sure about this. I was sceptical  so were some gay people we all know  about the wisdom of the coalitions symbolic legislation in favour of same-sex marriage despite earlier promises that Labours civil partnership reform would suffice. It seemed needlessly divisive at a point in time when the fiddly consequences of legal discrimination  wills, property, that sort of thing  had finally been eradicated in most of Britain.
I should add that same-sex marriage is not yet legal in Northern Ireland or indeed across the border in the Republic, where a lot of catching up has taken place in the past 20 years and where voters go to the polls on Friday for a referendum on whether to legalise gay marriage. Hardliners on both sides of the sectarian divide often seem united in opposing social reform. Abortion remains a hot issue in all 32 counties . Beware stiff necked self-righteousness.
Since the coalitions marriage reform (so much cheaper than Daves marriage tax break) it has been touching to see and hear about the pleasure it has given thousands of gay couples to make their public affirmation of commitment, complete with all the OTT trimmings that accompany modern marriage. Poignant too, since statistics suggest the value of marriage has declined among heterosexuals.
But was it wise to press home an advantage against what is still a substantial minority  including all the great faiths and many of their activists  who opposed the move? Whatever else they are, our current political leaders are not profound thinkers. They can just about raise their sights to the next election, but rarely think long term. Public opinion is volatile, its mood changes. Just look at the changing frontiers of the abortion debate.
Lilly-livered stuff, you may say. Rights have to be policed and enforced. Abortion law proves that. Well, yes. But societys institutions behave much like individuals, they pick and choose the rigour with which they enforce.
Some police chiefs are keen on cracking down on speeding or drink driving, others it seems less so. Magistrates and judges follow fashions too. Regulators the world over fine banks (ie punish shareholders who did nothing wrong), but almost never jail the crooked traders who did the damage. Multiculturalism sensibilities are sometimes invoked (rightly so on occasion) to stay authoritys hand. Not paying your TV licence is not a crime to the Murdoch press, though it disapproves of bilking your Sky TV subscription.
In any case the Belfast bakery was not pursued by the police or the Crown Prosecution Service, but by the state-funded agency tasked with anti-discrimination enforcement, at the instigation of the QueenSpace campaign. It says it didnt realise that Asher was a biblical name (the Ashers were Old Testament bakers) and the six-branch firm run by devout Christians. It wasnt looking for trouble, honest.
To my mind a lot of these issues are about giving other people space in which to live their lives as they see fit in a plural and tolerant society. The Belfast bakery staff werent demonstrating or issuing threats  as the anti-abortion crowd so often do. They fell foul of the law by accident and the law has left them aggrieved.
We talk about tolerance but we sometimes dont include tolerance of attitudes, behaviour and people we dont like. Theyve learned that the hard way in Northern Ireland. But Im always amazed how indignantly secular western liberals can berate more tradition-bound societies beyond Europe (American attitudes are different, suffused with a fundamentalist strain) for clinging to attitudes which were orthodox in France, Britain, Germany and Co well within living memory.
Abortion? Capital punishment? Gay sex? Strict dress codes? Religious adherence? Above all, the treatment of women, who constitute one half of humanity? Good old New Zealand gave women the vote in 1893 , we completed the task only in 1918-29, France in 1944. Switzerlands courts finally confirmed the female vote in federal elections in 1971, six years before the French state stopped chopping peoples heads off Saudi- and-Isis-style in 1977. That was almost 200 years after the revolutionary declaration of the rights of man - from which women were excluded despite protest. Of course.
Beware self-righteous intolerance, wherever quarter it comes from.

Why is Aung San Suu Kyi silent on the plight of the Rohingya people?
Burmas opposition leader appears to be cowed by her need to dampen ethnic tensions and win votes from an electorate in the thrall of Islamophobia

When thousands of Rohingya people from Burma were discovered floating in boats on the south-east Asian seas much of the world was understandably gripped by this unfolding human tragedy.
Voices of anger were raised; something had to be done to end the suffering, to help those men, women and children in need.
But what has surprised some is the silence of the Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi .
After all, these are the poverty-stricken and disenfranchised refugees from her own country who are now the focus of greater attention than ever before.

The contrast could not be more striking: how could such an iconic figure of human rights be so reticent when it comes to defending an ethnic minority from her own country?
It was only at the urging of reporters on Monday that a spokesman for her opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), addressed the issue.
He said the Rohingya people should be entitled to human rights, while urging a solution that acknowledged their right to citizenship status.
But nothing has come directly from the partys leader. Aung San Suu Kyi herself has previously justified her reluctance to speak out on the issue of the Rohingya, even when pressed to do so during Buddhist-Muslim clashes that swept through the country in 2013.
She feared that any statement she made would only fuel tensions between the Buddhist majority and the Rohingya, who make up about a third of the population of Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh .
Now, a surge of Buddhist nationalism and the complex ethnic political ramifications for a country that has just started a transition to democracy are taking their toll on her international image.
In the courtyard of a Buddhist monastery in the ancient Rakhine capital of Mrauk-U, the difficulties faced by the opposition leader known as the Lady are illustrated by a senior monk who repeats what he says are the warnings of Ashin Wirathu, an influential monk based in Mandalay who has become a leading voice of a new generation of nationalists espousing the cause of the Bamar, the dominant ethnic group in Burma.
They will come with swords, they will kill us, the senior monk says of the Muslim hordes he sees encroaching on Burma .
Muslims reproduce like rabbits, they want to kill us with swords, they want to conquer us
Muslims reproduce like rabbits; they want to kill us with swords; they want to conquer us  we have to defend ourselves and our religion, he insists, explicitly identifying the Rohingya with Islamist terrorism around the world.
Extremist movements such as 969 , which is driven by Ashin Wirathu, and Ma Ba Tha  the Organisation for the Protection of Race and Religion  present themselves as defenders of the countrys interests and its Bamar soul against foreign influence in post-sanctions Burma.
While insisting that he is against violence, Ashin Wirathu and those like him have fuelled and exploited tensions between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine state, promoting the belief that Islam is penetrating the country to install sharia law and leave Buddhists as a minority.
The nationalists are also trying to smear Aung San Suu Kyi by depicting her as the Muslim lover.
In a country that is 90% Buddhist there is little sympathy to be found for the Rohingya cause, and expressing support could be political suicide for both the NLD and the military-backed ruling party less than six months before parliamentary elections.
A party source close to Aung San Suu Kyi, who asked not to be named, said the party leader was deeply upset over what was happening. But the source said she also understood the penalty for being seen as favouring Muslims and believed she needed to be in government to deal with the backlash.
There is a strong belief that powerful people with close links to radical monks are deliberately stirring up tensions between communities in an attempt to disrupt ongoing political reforms.
According to some observers, Aung San Suu Kyi and her strategists have decided that speaking up for the Rohingya may not be in their electoral interests.
Aung San Suu Kyi and her strategists are looking at the electoral maths, says Nicholas Farrelly, director of the Australian National Universitys Myanmar Research Centre.
They have long imagined that any perception the NLD is too cosy with the countrys Muslims could lose them millions of votes. That, at least, is the fear.
They are anxious that the Rohingya could serve as a wedge between Aung San Suu Kyi and tens of millions of Buddhists that she is counting on for votes. It doesnt help that many NLD members probably support harsh treatment for the Rohingya and feel no special compassion for them.
Burmas quasi-civilian government, which is headed by former generals, is in a similar situation. President Thein Seins success in bringing the country back into the international fold after decades of isolation is threatened by foreign coverage of the Rohingya boat crisis.
For days the government line was to resist diplomatic pressure and insist the root cause of the crisis was trafficking of migrants, not the persecution of a stateless people whose name, Rohingya, is not even officially recognised.
But on Tuesday the official newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar , reported on the crisis for the first time, in a further sign that the government is moderating its rejectionist position. The daily quoted the information minister, Ye Htut, as telling foreign ambassadors that Burma would cooperate with regional and international counterparts to tackle the ongoing boat people crisis, which is a consequence of human trafficking of people from Rakhine state and Bangladesh to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
The Myanmar [Burmese] government will scrutinise the boat people and bring back those who can show evidence of citizenship, the minister said.
The governments move to at least acknowledge the problem in public could make it easier for the NLD to follow suit and promote a united response.
On the other hand, Aung San Suu Kyi might decide to maintain her silence, calculating it is in her interests to leave the government on its own to deal with any backlash across the country but especially in Rakhine as the elections draw near.

        <title>New documents claim to prove Mugabe ordered Gukurahundi killings</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/mugabe-zimbabwe-gukurahundi-massacre-matabeleland</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>From January 1983, a campaign of terror was waged against the Ndebele people in Matabeleland in western Zimbabwe. The so-called Gukurahundi massacres remain the darkest period in the countrys post-independence history, when more than 20,000 civilians were killed by Robert Mugabes feared Fifth Brigade .
No one has accepted the blame for the violence, but the recent release of historical documents has shed new light on those responsible.
The wide-ranging reports include diplomatic correspondence, intelligence assessments and raw intelligence garnered by spies recruited from within the Zimbabwean government.
These papers  augmented by my investigations and the testimony of Zimbabwean witnesses  appear to substantiate what survivors and scholars have always suspected: Mugabe, then prime minister, was the prime architect of well-planned and systematically executed mass killings.
The documents, which include recently declassified cables from the Australian high commission , reinforce the view that Gukurahundi  a Shona word for the spring rains that sweep away dry season chaff - was closely associated with Mugabes Zanu-PF partys efforts to eliminate opposition groups after independence in 1980.

Zapu, a party led by nationalist rival Joshua Nkomo, represented the main obstacle . Zapu enjoyed overwhelming support among the Ndebele and was seen as an impediment by the leadership of Zanu-PF. In the words of Mugabe, the people of Matabeleland needed to be re-educated.
Mugabes explicit orders
The little that Mugabe has said since the 1980s has been a mixture of obfuscation and denial. The closest he has come to admitting official responsibility was after the death of Nkomo in 1999, when he described the early 1980s as a moment of madness  an ambivalent statement not since repeated.
In a recent interview with South African talk-show host Dali Tambo, he blamed the Gukurahundi killings on armed bandits coordinated by Zapu and a few subordinate, North Korean trained, Fifth Brigade soldiers. But recorded correspondence from his colleagues tells a different story.
By March 1983 news of the atrocities had leaked, prompting western ambassadors to ask questions of government ministers. Some, said to include defence minister of defence Sydney Sekeramayi, quickly pointed to Mugabe.
In a conversation with Cephas Msipa, one of the few remaining Zapu ministers of what had been a government of national unity, Sekeramayi reportedly said that not only was Mugabe fully aware of what was going on but the Fifth Brigade was operating under Mugabes explicit orders. Msipa later relayed this discussion to the Australian high commission, who reported back to its headquarters in Canberra.
Msipas credibility as a witness is strengthened by his amicable relationship with Mugabe. The pair had shared a room for two years during their earlier career as teachers and Msipa had welcomed Mugabe into his home when he returned from Ghana in 1960 to join the struggle against white rule .

Within Zapu, Msipa, a Shona-speaker, had consistently advocated amalgamation with Zanu-PF  earning him the ire of Ndebele-speaking colleagues  and was considerably more sympathetic to Zanu-PF and its leader than others in his party.
Crisis of conscience
Between 1980 and 1982, when tensions were rising between Zapu and Zanu-PF, Msipa had been in regular contact with Mugabe. This continued during the killings.
But yet, after speaking to Sekeramayi and others in Zanu-PF, he was convinced  as he told the Australians  that the prime minister was right behind what had been happening in Matabeleland. Never before had he had such a crisis of my conscience about remaining in government, he said.
Sekeramayi was more circumspect in direct diplomatic discussions but made it clear that the massacres were no accident. The army had had to act hard, he told the British defence attach, but  the situation was now under control. He later admitted to the British high commissioner that there had been atrocities.
Orchestrated killings
The documents also show that Msipa talked to other members of Zanu-PF, who claimed the killings were the result of a formal, broad-based decision by the leadership.
Eddison Zvobgo, a member of the partys 20-member policy-making group, spoke of a decision of the central committee that there had to be a massacre of Ndebeles.
Army commanders who directed the killings, many of whom still retain key positions in government, are shown in the documents to have been eager accomplices.
Zvobgo claimed that the first, Fifth Brigade commander , Perence Shiri, had said the politicians should leave it to us with regard to settling things in Matabeleland.

20,000 dead
The first six weeks of Fifth Brigades attacks were massive in their intensity but, as the documents show, an order was given for them to be curtailed after news had leaked to the outside world.
The breadth of the violence, along with the extent of official involvement, was significantly underestimated
The killing did not end but was scaled back and conducted more covertly.
Estimates of the death toll are frequently put at 20,000, a figure first mooted by Nkomo at the time, but on-the-ground surveys were piecemeal and vast areas of Matabeleland remain under-researched. Ongoing fear and the death of witnesses provide further challenges.
Whilst a forensically accurate number will never be possible, evidence suggests that the standard estimate is conservative.
Oral testimony from Zimbabweans in key government positions during the 1980s disinters a host of killings that were previously unknown. Cumulatively, it suggests that the breadth of the violence, along with the extent of official involvement, was significantly underestimated.
Western intervention
Survivors, scholars and other Zimbabweans have always questioned the extent of western governments knowledge. Evidence suggests that they knew a great deal and that diplomatic interventions were pivotal to the Zimbabwean decision to reduce the violence.
Nevertheless, western governments did little once the scale of massacres were dialled down to a lower, but still savage, intensity. The campaign continued in the north of Matabeleland during the remainder of 1983 with Fifth Brigade troops re-deployed to the south in 1984 .
The western response to violence against black countrymen in the 1980s was a pale shadow of the reaction to attacks on white farmers in 2000 . Many Ndebele remain bitter about this inconsistency.

At the same time, to put too much emphasis on the international dimension of the Matabeleland massacres would be to miss the point. Mugabe has repeatedly used the charge of neo-colonialism to cover his misdemeanours in the hope of garnering support from fellow African leaders.
Zimbabwes second vice-president Phelekezela Mphoko recently claimed that the Matabeleland massacres were a  conspiracy of the west , with nothing to do with Mugabe. Yet the evidence appears to suggest otherwise.
One-party state
The documents point to internal killings neither provoked nor sustained by outsiders, suggesting that the atrocities were driven from the top by Zanu-PF in pursuit of specific political objectives.
Viewed across a period of several years, the documents appear to provide evidence that the massacres were but one component of a sustained and strategic effort to remove all political opposition within five years of independence. Zanu-PF leaders were determined to secure a victory against a non-existent opposition in elections scheduled for 1985, after which there would be a mandate from the people to impose a one-party state.

        <MainBody>WHAT WE KNOW
Nine people are dead
Eight people were pronounced dead at the scene and one other died in hospital a few hours later. Police said that all nine were members of two motorcycle gangs, the Bandidos and the Cossacks. Sergeant Patrick Swanton, a spokesman for the Waco police department, said it was one of the most violent scenes hed seen in his career. The bodies have now been sent off for autopsy.
 and 18 injured
In addition to those killed, 18 people were injured and taken to area hospitals. All those injured were members of biker gangs, according to police, with no officers, bystanders or shoppers hurt.

170 arrested on charges relating to capital murder
At last count, 170 people were apprehended by local police from the scene of the shootout on Sunday, Swanton said at a press conference on Monday, but this number is subject to change. The figure was revised down from an earlier figure of 192, as police initially were not sure how many people they had detained due to the chaos on scene. Waco police transformed the citys Convention Center into a staging area overnight to hold those arrested; most at the site had been or were in the process of being booked into the McLennan county jail.
They have now all been charged with engaging in organized crime in reference to the shooting at Twin Peaks. Swanton said this is a capital murder charge because of the number of victims killed at one site.
The number of shots, who shot who and all of that will be part of our investigative process and wont be released right away, Swanton said. Officers found more than 100 weapons at the scene.
Gangs involved
Police said that the shootout involved members from five different motorcycle gangs, including the Bandidos , the worlds second largest biker gang , and the Cossacks, a smaller Texas-based outfit. Photographs of arrests at the scene showed several members of the Scimitars biker gang were also present. Swanton declined to elaborate on the groups specifics. You wont hear their name from us here today, Swanton said. Were not about to give them the respect of knowing their names. We dont care.
At a press conference on Monday, Swanton said the fight started in the Twin Peaks restroom and quickly escalated to the patio/bar area. Shots were fired inside the restaurant by rival gang members at each other, Swanton said, before the fighting moved swiftly into the parking lot.
Police involvement
Sergeant Swanton said that 18 police officers, including command staff, were present at the scene prior to the multiple shootings, as they had been alerted to the presence of multiple biker gangs in advance. We have been made aware over two months that rival gangs are meeting here and that the potential for violence is increasing, Swanton said of Twin Peaks.
Once the fighting moved into the parking lot outside Twin Peaks, the bikers turned their guns away from each other and towards police, who returned fire, Swanton said, reportedly possibly wounding and possibly killing several. It is not yet clear how many, if any had been killed by police fire.
The officers on scene became involved in the gunfight within a matter of seconds from the initial indication that there was a disturbance inside.
Local, state and federal law enforcement officials descended on the scene and many are still present, providing support and manpower, Swanton said. Swat officers are still on the scene, providing protection.

Twin Peaks franchise license revoked
The restaurants liquor sales will be revoked for at least seven days due to the ongoing danger it presents to the community, Swanton said, but they will be open for food sales. The Texas Alcohol and Beverage Commission is conducting a parallel investigation into the incident, which raised the possibility of further violence.
A spokesperson for the Twin Peaks parent company issued a statement on Monday saying that it was revoking the franchise from the Waco location.
WHAT WE DONT KNOW
Why the fight started
Multiple theories abound as to why the gang members had gathered that evening at Twin Peaks, though none are conclusive. Steve Cook, a Kansas City-area police officer who said he has worked undercover in gangs linked to the Bandidos, said the fight appeared to have started as turf war between the Cossacks and the Bandidos. Citing police sources, he told the Washington Post that he understood the shootout started because the Cossacks, backed by the Hells Angels, had challenged the Bandidos for control of Texas.
Twin Peaks involvement
Twin Peaks and Waco police are at odds over their versions of events. Twin Peaks local franchise owner said on Sunday night that they had been cooperating with polices investigation and had had ongoing, positive communications with police. Swanton later addressed those comments, calling them a fabrication and saying that police had attempted to get the local management to assist but that they would not cooperate.
The restaurant had hosted biker groups in the past, police said. Weve been here over the past two months because of the problems weve had with biker gangs here at Twin Peaks, Swanton said. We have attempted to work with local management of Twin Peaks to no avail. They have continued to allow these bikers to gather here and this is the culmination of what has occurred.

Rout of Ramadi reawakens Iraq to 'brutal reality'

When Ramadi was last overrun by jihadis nine years ago, the rest of Iraq slid rapidly into chaos. Now Iraqis are trying to come to terms with the fall of the city for a second time, with some predicting that this loss may prove even more catastrophic.
Islamic State took full control of Ramadi on Sunday night after Iraqi federal troops and police officers withdrew from the last government compounds and bases they had held since the militants stormed towards them on Friday .
Outgunned though far from outmanned, up to 1,000 soldiers and officers were seen streaming from the city to a nearby highway, in scenes reminiscent of the fall of Mosul a year ago . This was Isiss biggest triumph since then  a victory that belied claims that it was withering in the face of relentless air strikes and that Iraqs military had learned how to hold its ground.

Iraqi troops retreat from Ramadi
The rout left government officials reeling. By early Monday, ministers and paramilitary leaders were mobilising Shia militias to travel from Baghdad to take on the estimated 400 Isis fighters now in control of the city. Such was the speed of events that the prospect of Shia fighters being sent to the predominantly Sunni Anbar province met with little hostility from Ramadi residents, who until this week had disavowed the role that militias had played in the fighting elsewhere in the country.
The ones to be blamed for this are the government and the local authorities in Ramadi, said Saleh Eraqi, a police colonel who fled on Sunday after his brother was killed in the fighting. The army dont have the fighting spirit. They were there waiting for Isis to attack. They are poorly equipped comparing to Isis. We are fighting with guns and pistols while Isis have Humvees and IEDs and suicide bombers.
There are many Sunnis inside the city who want to fight Isis but they dont have the weapons. Our only hope is that we can get real support from the Americans.
Eraqi said the Shia militias, known as Hashd al-Shaabi, or the popular mobilisation units, faced an enormous challenge in winning back the city as Isis members stream towards it from elsewhere in Anbar province.
The Hashd al-Shaabi cant do it, he said. They will suffer huge losses. I saw Isis fighting; they were more than 250, most of them Iraqis with some foreigners, and they had support from sleeper cells inside the city. We fought them from 12 in the morning till 4pm but we almost ran out of weapons and had to withdraw.
Ramadi, which sits on both the Euphrates river and a highway connecting Baghdad to the Jordanian and Syrian borders, has been the centre of gravity in Anbar province throughout the past 12 years of war and insurrection. It was a hub for foreign fighters crossing from Syria from 2003-07 and, over the past year, it has been contested by government forces and militants who have crept towards the city from Iraqs western deserts.
Sunni tribal leaders were instrumental in protecting the city, just as they were in 2006 during a crucial phase of the US occupation in which Ramadi tribes rose up against the Islamic State of Iraq, an earlier incarnation of Isis, ousting the group from their midst with the support of US ground forces.
But since then, some Sunni communities in Ramadi and Fallujah have been central to claims that Iraqs post-US governments have pursued sectarian policies that benefit the majority Shias.
Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Bahari, a tribal leader whose members were involved in the battles at the weekend, said the loss of the city was a reflection of a decade of neglect both by the Shia-dominated central government and by exiled Sunni tribal leaders.
We are exhausted, we want security and to be able to walk in our streets, he said. We are tired, we want peace, we want to live, and the government is run by thieves and ignorant people. I know most of the decision-makers in Anbar who pretended to be tribal leaders. They used to be shoeless and now they own streets in Jordan. They are sitting outside Anbar in Baghdad, Irbil, Jordan or Dubai and deciding our future by [the messaging service] Viber.
We are not welcoming Hashd in our city. We wont fight them if they enter, but we are emotionally against them. They are an ethnic militia who will treat us badly.
The Hashd al-Shaabi think they can win Ramadi as quickly they won Salaheddine [the province surrounding Tikrit] but thats a lie because Salaheddine is small compared to Ramadi. It was surrounded by other areas which they had already won, while Ramadi is a big city and is surrounded by desert.
Shia militias led government troops in a successful battle to reclaim Saddam Husseins home town of Tikrit in late March.
Along the way, though, the militias have faced persistent claims that some members have pursued sectarian agendas and committed abuses against some Sunni communities. While Hashd al-Shabi has struck alliances with some Sunni tribes near Tikrit, it is distrusted by Sunni residents in Diyyala province, north of Baghdad, who claim its fighters are answerable to no state authority.

Hakim Zamili, a member of the Iraqi parliaments defence committee and leader of the Salam Brigades, a Shia militia, said other Anbar tribes had been more circumspect about militias being sent to replace the vanquished national army.
I have just finished a meeting with the leaders of Hashd al-Shaabi, Iraqi generals and the defence minister and we have put a plan to coordinate the fighting in Ramadi, he said. I have received many requests from the tribe leaders in Anbar asking us to bring the Hashd al-Shaabi to defend them.
Ihsan Shimari, a Baghdad-based political analyst, said the fall of Ramadi was a wakeup call for Iraqi citizens who had been persuaded by the government that the campaign against Isis had been going well, especially since the reclaiming of Tikrit.
Iraqis are easily misled by their emotions and they used to believe in a quick victory, but now they are hit with a harsh reality in Ramadi, he said. Now they believe that the war against Isis will be long and difficult. It took them a long time to understand that brutal reality.
The militias dwarf Iraqs embattled security forces in number and influence. With resolute backing from Iran, they have led the war against Isis since June, regularly taking primacy over Iraqi forces, to whom they readily cede credit for most battlefield successes.
Hashd al-Shaabi  are stronger because they are ideological, said Shimari. They are better organised and some of their brigades even have better weapons than the Iraqi army.
Naim al-Ubaidi, a leader of Asaib ahl al-Haq, one of the militias that plays a leading role under the Hashd al-Shaabi banner, said: The Iraqi government asked us last night to intervene and rescue the city. We know that decision came late and we warned [the prime minister, Haidar] al-Abadi that they wont achieve victory without us, but we know that he was under pressure from the Americans to not let us be involved in this operation.
All the brigades are now gathering their elite fighters to go for the battle in Ramadi and we are expecting the rescue the city within few days. The fighting in Ramadi will be easier for us than the operations in Salaheddine because of the collaboration of the tribes.
Ramadi has fallen under the eyes of the Americans and they havent done anything. This isnt like what happened in Irbil when the Americans intervened there and prevented the fall of Irbil at all costs. This tells us that Iraqis are the ones who should deal with their problems together and get united to fight their enemies.
The US military said it had carried out nine air strikes as Isis advanced and officials in Washington said they were confident that the city could be retaken with their ongoing air support.
If so, that would almost certainly mean that the US would be flying in support of militia forces, rather than the national army. Asaib ahl al-Haq and the Jeish al-Mehdi, both strong allies of Iran, were two of the US militarys most formidable foes from 2006-11, accounting for more than 25% of its casualties, according to figures provided by Washington.
The US relationship with Iraqs Sunnis was at times equally fraught. However, it reached a high point in Anbar in 2007, when a grassroots revolt was amplified by an increased presence of US troops, which curbed violence drastically in Anbar.
Sheik Saddon al-Eifan, from the town of Amriyat al-Fallujah, said: We in Anbar need any help we can get to get rid of Isis. They are attacking every family who fought against them and seeking revenge from everyone. We are now between two bad choices but we prefer the Hashd, and once they kick out Isis from our city we will ask them to leave.
We need the Americans to intervene in our reconciliation like they did before in order to bring us together to fight Isis. We all want to fight but we dont have faith in the Iraqi government and it will take a lot to make us believe in them again.
