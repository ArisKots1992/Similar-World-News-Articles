More than half the countries in the world are currently generating Islamist extremist fighters for groups such as al-Qaida and Islamic State , the UN has said.
A report by the UN security council says there are more than 25,000 foreign terrorist fighters currently involved in jihadi conflicts and they are travelling from more than 100 member states.
The number of fighters may have increased by more than 70% worldwide in the past nine months or so, the report says, adding that they pose an immediate and long-term [terrorist] threat.
The sudden rise, though possibly explained by better data, will raise concern about the apparently growing appeal of extremism. The geographic spread of states touched by the phenomenon has expanded, too.
The report notes continuing problems with understanding the processes of radicalisation, but says, despite a concentration on the internet, social networks in conflict zones and western cities play a key role.
Those who eat together and bond together can bomb together, the report says.
The report is the first from the UN to take a global view of the problem of foreign terrorist fighters, and includes those in Afghanistan , Africa and other theatres as well as Syria and Iraq.
Officials described the estimate of numbers as conservative and said the true total may be more than 30,000. The rate of flow is higher than ever and mainly focused on movement into the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq , with a growing problem also evident in Libya, the report says.
The security council is meeting on Friday to discuss the problem of foreign terrorist fighters and potential measures to combat the threat.
The report comes amid a fierce debate over western strategies to counter Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

In recent days, Isis has made significant advances in both countries despite months of air strikes, leading to criticism of the US president, Barack Obama, and decision-makers in the region.
The US senator John McCain attacked the president on Sunday for citing climate change as a threat to national security, suggesting that the Obama administrations focus on environmental issues was detracting from the fight against Isis.
Last week, the militant group seized the city of Ramadi, the capital of the predominantly Sunni Anbar province, its greatest victory in Iraq since its conquest of Mosul last summer and its declaration of a caliphate spanning swaths of Iraq and Syria.
The group also took control of the historic Syrian city of Palmyra and strategic gas fields nearby after a week-long siege that routed forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The victory has triggered a humanitarian crisis, due to the flight of thousands of residents.
A series of public statements by senior officials in Washington and the Middle East have highlighted disagreements between the US, Iraq and Iran.
Earlier this year, General James Clapper, the director of US national intelligence, told Congress that officials now believed that 3,400 citizens from western nations, including 150 from the US, had travelled to Iraq and Syria to join violent militant groups.
More than 700 British extremists are thought to have travelled to Syria  with about half returning to the UK.
The new report describes Iraq, Syria and Libya as a veritable finishing school for terrorists and mentions Tunisia, Morocco, France and the Russian federation as particularly vulnerable to future attacks due to the number of fighters from there.
Those that have returned or will return to their states of origin or to third countries may pose a continuing threat to national and international security, the report said.
Many may reintegrate, abandoning violence. Some have already gone on to organise further terrorist attacks and others will do so in the future.
In May 2014, a French veteran of the conflict in Syria launched an attack on a Jewish museum in Belgium.
The killer of four people in a Jewish supermarket in Paris in January claimed to be from Islamic State though he was not a veteran of the conflict there. His wife had fled to Syria days before the attack.
Isis has repeatedly called on Muslims living in the west to mount freelance or lone wolf operations.
Alexander Evans, lead UN expert on al-Qaida and Isis, said there was a danger that the international community was becoming too focused on Syria, Iraq and Libya.
The risk of people going and people returning is wider, Evans said.
Afghan security forces estimated in March 2015 that about 6,500 foreign terrorist fighters were active in Afghanistan, the report notes. Most were from groups based in neighbouring Pakistan, though 200 were with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and 150 with the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement which operates in south-west China.
There are fears of an upsurge in violence in Afghanistan as the US reduces its presence in the unstable state.
Volunteers have travelled to conflict zones where Islamic militants are active from countries including Chile , Finland and the Maldives .
We have spent a lot of time worrying about the countries which have generated hundreds or even thousands of fighters but [there are] countries which may have never faced a terrorist threat of this nature and which have law enforcement and security authorities which are grappling with what is a new problem for them, Evans said.

Vatican says Ireland gay marriage vote is 'defeat for humanity'
Vatican diplomat seen as second only to the Pope insists Saturdays referendum result shows the church must strengthen its commitment to evangelisation

A senior Vatican official has attacked the legalisation of gay marriage in Ireland . The referendum that overwhelmingly backed marriage equality last weekend was a defeat for humanity, he claimed.
I was deeply saddened by the result, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vaticans secretary of state, said at a conference in Rome on Tuesday night. The church must take account of this reality, but in the sense that it must strengthen its commitment to evangelisation. I think that you cannot just talk of a defeat for Christian principles, but of a defeat for humanity.
Related: Ireland might just have become a great little country in which to be gay
The remarks by the Vaticans top diplomat, who is seen as second only to the pope in the churchs hierarchy, represent the most damning assessment of the Irish vote by a senior church official to date.
It was a far more critical response than the circumspect reaction offered by archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin, who said: It is very clear that if this referendum is an affirmation of the views of young people  [then the church needs} a reality check.
Ireland became the first country to legalise gay marriage by popular vote after a referendum found that 62% of voters were in favour of changing the constitution to allow gay and lesbians to marry.
While the results were celebrated by advocates of gay rights in Ireland and around the world, it was also seen as a stark symbol of how wide the chasm has grown between young people in what has traditionally been a staunchly Catholic country and the church itself, which says that homosexual acts are a sin and vehemently opposes gay marriage.
Parolins comments are sure to revive the debate about the churchs attitude to gay rights and equality under the papacy of Pope Francis, who once famously said who am I to judge? when asked about the existence of a gay lobby within the Vatican . That remark spurred hope among progressive Catholics that the church was entering a new era of tolerance and acceptance of gays.
For some, that hope has been dashed by an ongoing controversy involving a French diplomat and practising Catholic named Laurent Stefanini, who is gay. The Vatican has refused to accept Stefaninis nomination as Frances ambassador to the Holy See because of his sexual orientation, according to media reports in France and Italy.
The Vatican has declined to comment on the matter, but there has been speculation in recent weeks that the pope could make an abrupt change and accept the nomination, after all. The Vatican recently told the Guardian that any news on the appointment would be made available on the Vaticans bulletin, where such appointments are usually publicised.
On Tuesday night, Parolin said the dialogue between the Vatican and France was continuing in regard to the controversial nomination, and that he hoped it would come to a conclusion in a positive manner.
Parolins remarks on the Irish vote are significant given the broader role Parolin plays in crafting the churchs message on major diplomatic and social issues.
At the time of his appointment in 2013, veteran Vatican reporter John Allen wrote in the National Catholic Reporter that Parolin had been on the front lines of shaping the Vaticans response to virtually every geopolitical challenge of the past two decades.
Among other issues, the Italian cardinal has been an outspoken advocate for action to combat global warming. In recent remarks, he denounced the globalisation of indifference and the economy of exclusion that has put the planet in peril.
He has also been the public face of Franciss diplomatic efforts, including the churchs role in helping Cuba and the US restore diplomatic ties.
But on Tuesday, with his choice of words, Parolin differed from the pope in one respect: the Argentinian pontiff has also used the phrase defeat for humanity , but he was talking about war, not the legalisation of gay marriage.

        <title>Cages, watchtower and 37 graves: inside an abandoned migrant camp in Malaysia</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/inside-abandoned-migrant-camp-malaysia</Link>

Deep in the jungles of northern Malaysia , a forensic team wearing masks chipped away at the brown soil before spotting an object wrapped in white cotton shrouds normally used in Muslim burial rites.
They dug deeper with shovels and found a body. Police had begun examining the site after finding a human jawbone with teeth hanging off nearby. Officials expect many more bodies to be unearthed.
It is the latest shocking development in Asias migrant crisis, which has exposed the plights of Rohingya Muslims from Burma who say they are fleeing persecution and of Bangladeshis escaping poverty, brought by boat to the dense forests of southern Thailand and northern Malaysia by people smugglers.
Almost 140 grave sites have been uncovered among a network of people-smuggling camps in and around Malaysias border town of Wang Kelian.
One hundred metres away from the forensic teams digging at Bukit Wang Burma was a camp that appeared to have been abandoned by smugglers only recently.

At the centre of the camp was a wooden platform that had fallen into disrepair and a crudely built wooden enclosure wrapped in barbed wire, more like pens for wild animals than a place suitable for humans.
A watchtower loomed over the jungle camp and, in one corner, there was a small, wire cage too small to stand in, hinting at the brutality meted out by the smugglers. Officials estimate that the camp  reached after a gruelling two-hour hike up a steep jungle path  could have held up to 500 people.

Clothes and mugs were spread around the camp. One pit appeared to be a cooking area littered with filthy dishes and utensils.
There were 37 suspected grave sites in and around this one camp alone, according to police. Forensic teams were investigating other suspected grave sites, which they said were marked by sticks and stones.
Activists have expressed shock at the scale and sophistication of the camps uncovered in Malaysia, which dwarf those uncovered on the Thai side of the border in early May.
The discovery of the Thai camps sparked a crackdown on people-smuggling and a regional crisis as thousands of migrants heading on boats to Thailand were abandoned, with thousands coming ashore in Indonesia or Malaysia instead.
Many Rohingya, a Muslim minority persecuted in Burma, and Bangladeshis, normally trying to escape grinding poverty in their homeland, reach the jungle camps after harrowing journeys on overcrowded boats.
They are dumped there by people-smugglers and held in pitiful conditions until their families can pay ransoms for their release, after which they normally seek work in Malaysia, where they are quietly welcomed as a cheap source of labour.

Police said 28 camps were discovered in Wang Kelian, apparently part of an extensive network of bases stretching over well-established routes into Thailand.
Journalists who visited the camp on Tuesday were escorted by M16-wielding police commandos, as authorities fear smugglers could still be hiding out in nearby jungles.
Officials in Thailand and Malaysia have rebuffed accusations of complicity in the people-smuggling trade but rights group have long raised concerns about camps in the area.
Migrant camps
After the discoveries in Malaysia, police insist they are making renewed efforts to tackle the problem. Local officers said they were trying to track down Malaysian agents involved in taking the migrants to the border town of Wang Kelian.
They are familiar with this forest and they are used to this track, said a local police official involved in the operation.
He said Malaysian agents were normally paid 50 ringgit (9) for each migrant they brought down from the jungle. The existence of the jungle camps had been known to the police for months but they could not pinpoint the exact jungle route, the official said.
In Wang Kelian, there has been a surge in the numbers of weak, injured migrants appearing on the streets begging for food and water as the clampdown began.
They would walk into my shop, with injuries covering their hands and feet. Some were just too weak to even speak properly, said Lyza Ibrahim, who runs a food stall. One asked me, [Is this] Malaysia? Then he pointed in the other direction, said Thailand and shook his head to signal that he was not wanted there.

Gunmen tried to assassinate Libyas internationally-recognised prime minister on his way to the airport in the eastern city of Tobruk on Tuesday.
Abdullah al-Thinni told pan-Arab news channel al-Arabiya that after he left parliament in Tobruk and drove off, gunmen in several cars followed his entourage and opened fire.
We were surprised by a lot of bullets  Thank God, we managed to escape, Thinni said, adding that one bodyguard had been wounded.
He did not elaborate but his cabinet said in a statement the gunmen had been paid criminals who had previously tried to storm parliament.
Arish Said, head of the governments media department, said armed men who had been protesting outside a session of the Tobruk governments house of representatives tried to storm the building before the attack on Thinni, firing shots and demanding the prime minister be removed from office.

They were threatening to kill the prime minister and force the house to sack him, Said said. He identified the men as being funded by corrupted political financiers linked to powerful Tobruk tribal leaders, without elaborating.
Nearly four years after the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi , Libya is consumed by civil war. The country is split between an elected parliament and weak government, and a rival government and parliament in Tripoli set up by the Islamist-linked militias who took control of the capital, forcing the government to relocate to the far eastern cities of Tobruk and Bayda.
The turmoil has enabled the rise of an active Islamic State branch, which now controls at least two cities along the countrys coastline.
Earlier on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch said civilians, including foreign nationals, were trapped in several neighbourhoods in Libyas eastern city of Benghazi, urging fighters there to let them leave.
In a statement, the US-based group says militias and army units surrounded the downtown areas, where several hundred people were reportedly trapped and not allowed to leave. Some of those trapped are thought to be Syrians and Palestinians.
Middle East and North Africa director Sarah Leah Whitson said that all forces involved must take all feasible precautions to minimise harm to civilians and civilian property and that the Libyan army and militias must allow civilians safe passage and facilitate access to badly needed aid.

        <title>France: judges clear way for Sarkozy to rename UMP party Les Républicains</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/france-sarkozy-les-republicains-ump-socialists</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Related: Nicolas Sarkozy announces return to politics in France
The choice of name had sparked furious criticism from the French left which accused Sarkozy of staging a hostile takeover of national heritage. Socialists argued that French people of all political persuasions call themselves republicans and support the values of liberty and freedom of the French republic.
They said it wasnt fair for the right to take the monopoly of the term. The leftwing daily Libration called the proposed name-change a semantic hold-up.
But an urgent court challenge brought by leftwing associations under the banner We are the Republicans, as well 140 individuals  including a family who have the surname Rpublicain  has been thrown out by a Paris court. Christophe Lguevaques, one of the lawyers who defended the legal challenge, said: We are all Republicans according to the first article of the French constitution ... which states that France is an indivisible republic. And here, two thirds of the population are being excluded. The groups may consider launching an appeal.
But Sarkozy, who returned from retirement last autumn to head the rightwing opposition after losing the presidency to Franois Hollande in 2012, will now plough ahead with his sweeping rebranding operation. The massive marketing exercise is key to Sarkozys drive to turn the party into his personal war machine for a bid to reconquer the Elyse in 2017. The name Les Rpublicains will be put to an electronic vote of party members this week before a party congress on 30 May.
But Sarkozy, 59, faces several hurdles in his quest for the presidency, including opposition from Alain Jupp, a former prime minister and seasoned politician, who will run against him in the partys primary race to choose its candidate next year.
More potentially damaging is the latest corruption investigation hanging over Sarkozys head. He is accused of conspiring with his lawyer to give a magistrate a lucrative job in Monaco in exchange for inside information on another corruption inquiry related to his campaign financing.
In July, Sarkozy was charged with corruption, influence peddling and violation of legal secrecy in the case  and became the first former head of state to be taken into police custody for questioning.
A French court recently confirmed that wiretapped recordings of Sarkozy talking to his lawyer could be used as evidence in the ongoing investigation. If the case were to come to criminal trial before the presidential vote, it could be seriously damaging. Sarkozy, who denies all allegations, faces a theoretical maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty, but legal experts say a custodial sentence is unlikely even in the event of a conviction.
Sarkozy, bolstered by an excellent showing for his party in recent local elections, mocked the left for challenging his partys new name and criticised Hollande, who despite low approval ratings is predicted to stand for re-election in 2017. Franois Hollande and the left have lost. They dont know where theyre going, theyre discredited, they have no line, Sarkozy said
Sarkozys recent policy proposals include banning the Muslim headscarf from universities and he has insisted people who receive certain social welfare benefits should have to work for them.
The party faithful is expected to vote in favour of the Les Rpublicains name change. But some commentators have complained the name sounds too American and similar to the US Republican party. Sarkozy, a fan of George W Bush, reportedly did not choose the name to copy the US, but rather because his pollsters advised him that acronyms had fallen from favour among voters who are increasingly distrustful of the political class.
His team reportedly felt voters preferred bold words such as Spains Podemos (we can), and Les Rpublicains could be presented as a kind of citizens movement rather than a plain political party. It is also marks an attempt to counter the rise of Marine Le Pen s far-right Front National and attack her as anti-republican.
However, a poll last week found that 68% of French people and 40% of UMP sympathisers thought a political party should not have the right to take ownership of the word Rpublicain.
The name change is also designed to draw a line under years of internal disputes in the UMP and ongoing funding scandals surrounding the party.

Chinese students in the west call for transparency over Tiananmen Square
Group of students at universities in UK, US and Australia issue letter urging Chinas government to stop covering up truth of 1989 protests

A group of Chinese students living in western countries have issued a rare public appeal for their government to end its secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre and hold those responsible to account.
The open letter from 11 students enrolled at universities in the US, UK and Australia is politically risky at a time of tightening government controls on activists and rights groups, from small charities and feminists to human rights lawyers who take on politically controversial cases.
It prompted an angry attack from the hardline nationalist paper The Global Times, which accused the authors of serving overseas hostile forces and trying to tear society apart.
The lead signatory to the letter, Gu Yi, said the group felt they had a moral duty to share the information they had stumbled upon after leaving their home country, about the extent of the Tiananmen protests in Beijing and the bloody government crackdown on 4 June 1989.
Gu, a chemistry student at the University of Georgia, said: I feel strongly as a Chinese citizen with full access to information outside China that I have a responsibility to tell my fellow citizens about this. We have been living in fear for a lot of years and what we are trying to do is fight this fear so we can live in freedom.

The lengthy discussion of what happened in May and June 1989 was mostly addressed to fellow students at home in China, trapped behind what the letter called the ever higher internet firewall, but pointedly criticised the government.
The letter said: Some say the Communist party of China has taken lessens from 4 June and we should not pursue it anymore, and yet the repression lingers on: the truth is still being covered up; the victims are still being humiliated.
It goes on to subvert the so-called China dream, a favourite slogan of the president, Xi Jinping, used by the government with a strict focus on economic progress.
We have a dream in our hearts, that in the near future, on the basis of accurate history and the implementation of justice, everyone could live in a world free of fear. As a group of Chinese students overseas, this is our China dream.
The letter has already drawn more than 50 new signatures since it was posted online, Gu said, including one from a high-school student in China whom he described as very brave. He had not told his own parents about the letter to prevent them worrying.
Its publication marked an unusual protest by students not connected to activist circles in China, and a generation below the activists who went into exile after 1989. The group are abroad for now, but choosing to post their open letter online so the message can reach China means its impact could follow them home as well.
Zhang Lifan, an independent historian and political commentator, said: They could face difficulties when they get back to China and when they try to find jobs back home. Even their families could get into trouble.
The events of 1989 are one of the biggest taboos in contemporary China, with the days bloodshed usually referred to simply as an incident in official media and government reports, and censors banning even indirect references.
How risky is this letter? Given the shifting sands of political sensitivity, answering such a question is difficult, but the climate for discussing the events of 1989 has become much worse since the run-up to the 25th anniversary last year, said Louisa Lim, the author of The Peoples Republic of Amnesia, an account of the protests, the crackdown and the aftermath.
In the past, private commemorations held behind closed doors had been tolerated; last year, these too were targeted ... The Chinese authorities seem determined to try to tamp down any discussion or commemoration of 4 June whatsoever using any means necessary.
The Global Times insisted that the events at Tiananmen Square have been largely excised from public debate by common agreement rather than a government coverup. It said Chinese citizens who want to can easily bypass controls to access sensitive information from overseas websites.
Chinese society has reached a consensus on not debating the 1989 incident, said the broadside, originally published in Chinese and English. When China is moving forward, some are trying to drag up history in an attempt to tear apart society. Its a meaningless attempt.
The Chinese government has been been extremely successful in controlling the awareness of events a quarter of a century ago, according to Lim.
Chinas sophisticated, complex internet censorship system deploys a range of tools to manage the information its citizens see, from a firewall that cuts off access to undesirable foreign websites to groups of paid online commentators who bolster the government line and censorship of sensitive terms on domestic search engines.
Lim said: The students who wrote this letter are correct to state that many of their contemporaries know very little about what happened on 4 June 1989. She pointed out that even the iconic picture of a row of tanks halted by an unarmed man, referred to as tank man, is virtually unknown in China.
She said: When I was writing my book, I asked 100 university students in Beijing to identify the picture of tank man. The vast majority, 85%, had no idea what it signified or where it was taken, asking questions like Is it from South Korea? and Is it in Kosovo?
This is the demographic who are most likely to be able to ... bypass internet censorship, so I believe that outside Beijing and outside university campuses, the level of ignorance surrounding the Tiananmen crackdown is even higher.
Despite the ferocity of the Global Times attack, Gu said he was grateful to the newspaper for drawing attention to a letter by 11 unknown students that might otherwise have languished in relative obscurity.
Originally posted online across a variety of state media, the Tuesday editorial drew attention to a petition that had previously gone unnoticed. The Chinese version was later stripped from all websites, but not before circulating widely enough that many stored versions can still be found.
Gu said: The Global Times attacking our letter was the best advertisement. We think the fast removal of the letter shows they were confused in their response and that we had some impact in mainland China.

Madagascan parliament votes to remove president from office
Constitutional court will decide whether decision to dismiss Hery Rajaonarimanpianina, who came to power in January 2014, can be carried out

Madagascars parliament voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to dismiss the president, Hery Rajaonarimanpianina, for alleged constitutional violations and general incompetence. The motion was backed by 121 of the 125 lawmakers who voted, easily clearing the two-thirds majority required.
The constitutional court will now decide whether the decision to dismiss Rajaonarimanpianina can be enacted.
The US embassy had pledged support for the president and called on parliament to put the stability of the country first, but the plea fell on deaf ears.
The parliamentary speaker, Jean Max Rakotomamonjy, said after the votes were counted: It is officially declared that everyone accepts that the request of dismissal can be submitted to the constitutional court.
The result was greeted with applause from many lawmakers, but some alleged the vote was riddled with irregularities. One who refused to take part, Lydia Raharimalala, claimed there were only about 70 lawmakers in parliament when they were called to vote. Theres something wrong, there was cheating, she said, and promised to take her claims to the constitutional court.
When Rajaonarimanpianina took power in January 2014  after the countrys first democratic elections since 2006  it was hoped that Madagascar would finally emerge from a deep political and economic crisis. The island had been plunged into chaos in 2009 when Rajaonarimanpianinas predecessor Marc Ravalomanana was ousted in a coup.
Rajaonarimanpianina, a trained accountant, promised a better life for the inhabitants of one of the worlds poorest countries. But his opponents say he has failed to deliver on his economic promises and accuse him of stalling on the establishment of a high court and the implementation of promised reforms.
Many of his political allies have turned their backs on him. Andry Rajoelina, who briefly served as the islands transitional president in 2009, helped to get the president elected two years ago. But on Tuesday, he joined forces with Ravalomananas camp to vote against him.
Lawmaker Tinoka Roberto, a Rajoelina supporter, said before the vote: I am sorry, but nothing works in this country at the moment. [Rajaonarimanpianina] might understand accountancy, but he doesnt know how to run a country. He is surrounded by amateurs.

Pasquale Scotti, a leader of the Camorra syndicate who is wanted for more than two dozen murders, was detained by police while taking his children to school in Recife.
Police believe his Brazilian family were unaware of his identity, which was exposed by Interpol through fingerprint examination.
He had been living under the false name Francisco de Castro Visconti. Reinventing himself as a businessman, he had local identity papers, registered as a voter and partly owned a nightclub and food import business.
Photographs of the 56-year-old suspect in handcuffs show a man very different from the figure seen on Italian wanted posters. The gangster in his twenties with thick hair and dark bushy brows is now a balding middle-aged man with a beard, glasses and a slight paunch.
Scotti is said to have arrived in Brazil in 1986, a couple years after being placed on Italys most wanted list. The following year he moved to Recife, a city of 1.5 million people on the north-east coast that is far less in the international spotlight than So Paulo or Rio de Janeiro.
In 1995, he married a Brazilian woman with whom he has two children. They live in the citys Sancho district.
He told us in a statement that his family was not aware of anything, said Giovani Santoro, the communications officer of the Pernambuco federal police force.
The arrest by four officers was carried out with the minimum of fuss. He was approached in the morning when he left home and the arrest was communicated. The officers allowed him to take his kids to school first, followed him, and then arrested him. There was no resistance, it was very discreet, he said.
Police said he had no reason to believe the detainee was involved in criminal activity in Brazil. He has a clean slate here, a spokesman said.
But Italian law enforcement officials will now begin extradition proceedings against a man who has been one of their countrys most wanted since 1984.
The alleged crime boss is accused of extortion, firearm offences and murder. In January 2005, he received a life sentence in abstentia for 26 killings.
He is believed to be very close to Raffaele Cutolo, the head of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata  the new Camorra  who is serving multiple life sentences for murder, according to Federico Varese, a mafia expert and criminologist at Oxford University.
Related: Roberto Saviano: My life under armed guard
Scotti was involved with Cutolo in the 1980s, Varese says, but after being nabbed by Italian authorities he escaped a local Neapolitan hospital, where a relative allegedly worked. Scotti has been the subject of intense speculation, with rumours circulating for years that he was either dead or working for the Ndrangheta mafia, which is based in Calabria .
Roberto Saviano, the journalist who exposed the Camorras crimes in his bestselling book, Gomorrah: Italys Other Mafia, and who has faced numerous death threats, told the Guardian in an email: I know well the story of Scotti. We all grew up with the myth of Pasquale Scotti!
Renato Natale, the anti-mafia mayor of Casal di Principe, which was once considered prime Camorra territory, told the Guardian: I thought he had completely disappeared from circulation, so this news surprised me  pleasantly. Justice runs its course and in the end they catch you
In the early 1980s [Scotti] was a big fish, but after that, when he became a fugitive, no one heard of him anymore, added Natale.
Scotti may have gone to Brazil because it was a country that was notoriously reluctant to approve extradition requests from Europe . In the 1980s, the UK train robber Ronnie Biggs lived openly in Rio de Janeiro despite being wanted by British police.
However, procedures have subsequently been eased so it is likely Scotti will be returned to Italy to face justice.

        <title>Texas flooding: at least four dead and 12 more missing</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/26/texas-storms-aftermath-flooding-power-outages</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Mondays storms followed on from a tornado which struck on Sunday, severely damaging an apartment complex in Houston. Two people were hospitalized after the building partially collapsed .
Many Houston schools were closed. CenterPoint Energy reported multiple electricity outages affecting about 55,000 customers.
The respite may only be temporary however: the forecast calls for more storms in the region this week, potentially heaping more rain on already-sodden ground.
After the Houston Rockets NBA conference final game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night, the team displayed a message on its big screens recommending that fans shelter at the Toyota Center arena rather than risk driving home during the storms. About 100 people were still in the arena on Tuesday morning, local news reported .
The storms also produced strong winds and hail in what was some of the worst weather to hit the region since Hurricane Ike in 2008. Data from the Harris County Flood Warning System, which covers Houston, showed rainfall in excess of 10in in some areas, most of which fell in the space of a couple hours on Monday night as storms moved east from central Texas.
That part of the state had already been severely affected over the weekend by flash floods, which Texas governor Greg Abbott described as having relentless, tsunami-type power.
Abbott has declared 37 counties as disaster areas . Downtown Austin saw flooding, and dozens of people required rescuing by emergency services in the Austin area.
But the most severe damage was in the small tourist town of Wimberley, part of Hill Country between Austin and San Antonio.
You cannot candy-coat it. Its absolutely massive, Abbott said after touring the destruction.
At least eight people from two families were reported missing in Wimberley, after the swollen Blanco river took a holiday home off its foundations and slammed it into a bridge. The river, considered to be at flood level at 13ft, rose to 40ft.
Julie Shields was on the phone with her sister, Laura, when the holiday home cabin was swept away, she told a local Texas news station .
We are floating in a house that is now floating down the river, Laura told Shields on the phone. Call mom and dad. I love you, and pray.
In Oklahoma, many major roads were closed in Oklahoma on Tuesday morning after the series of thunderstorms and tornadoes caused injuries and destroyed homes.
One of the dead in Texas, Alyssa Ramirez, was a homecoming queen driving home from prom in San Antonio. The 18-year-olds car stalled and was swept away by floodwater a couple of miles from her house, News 4 San Antonio reported . She did the right things, said her aunt, Roberta Ramirez. She called 911. She called her father, but it was just too much and too quick.
One man, who lived in a mobile home in Milam County, near Austin, was killed by a tornado on Monday afternoon, officials said. There were a handful of injuries.
Mickey White, a local resident, said the tornado lifted up his house. It actually picked the house up and moved the house over about four foot. Its off the blocks and four foot over. You can kind of feel the house shaking, he told KTWX news .
Parker said that about four hours of torrential overnight rain fell on ground that was saturated by heavy rainfall in recent weeks, causing localized street flooding. Were the Bayou City. The defining feature of Houston is the small rivers than run through the city and many of them went over their banks and began to flood neighborhoods, she said.
We had a lot of folks who had to abandon cars, we had a lot of high water rescues from vehicles ... There are a lot of homes along Brays bayou that are substantially under water.
A Houston fire department spokesman said that they had responded to 968 incidents since midnight, of which 531 were water-related rescues. The water was so deep in some parts of the city that rescues were undertaken by boat.
The tornado that ripped through Ciudad Acua in Mexico , just over the border from Del Ro, Texas, killed at least 13 people, including a baby and two toddlers. Another baby, who was inside a car when the twister hit at around 6am Monday, was still missing on Tuesday morning. Mondays tornado was reportedly the most potent to strike Mexico in the last 15 years.
The head of the countrys disaster services, Luis Felipe Puente, told Televisa TV that 34 people were still in hospital, though none were in life-threatening condition. Puente added that around 60 vehicles were thrown around during the six seconds the tornado took to rip through a working class district of Ciudad Acua, which caused the lions share of the damage to 750 homes. The twister, with gusts of up to 136mph, also pulled up electricity posts and blew off some roofs.
Beatriz Garca said she immediately grabbed her children from their bedroom and took shelter in the bathroom when the tornado struck.
The furniture was flying around like pieces of paper, Garcia told La Jornada newspaper. The doors, the beds, the fridge, everything was flying inside the house.
President Enrique Pea Nieto walked around the disaster area on Monday night and promised the tornados victims that they would receive government help.
The president spent the night in the area and went on another walkabout to supervise the clean-up operation on Tuesday morning.
Mexican authorities warned that further tornados could form in the north of Coahuila in coming days, as warm humid air coming from the Gulf of Mexico meets a cold front from the US.

Heavy gunfire and explosions echoed through an upmarket district of Afghanistans capital late on Tuesday night, as police surrounded the area.
The firefight in the Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood, which is home to several embassies, appeared to be focused on a guesthouse. It began just after 11pm (6.30pm GMT), with heavy explosions accompanying sporadic automatic weapon fire.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which comes amid intensified fighting across many parts of Afghanistan since the Taliban launched their warm weather offensive a month ago.
Taliban militants attacked another guesthouse earlier this month in Kabul, killing an American, a British citizen, an Italian, four Indian nationals, five Afghans and two Pakistanis. The United Nations already has documented a record high number of civilian casualties  974 killed and 1,963 injured  in the first four months of 2015, a 16% increase over the same period last year.
Afghan security forces have been struggling to fend off Taliban attacks since US and Nato forces formally concluded their combat mission at the end of last year.
Earlier on Tuesday, four militants launched an attack on the courthouse in the capital of Wardak province, some 25 miles from Kabul, said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor.
One of the attackers blew himself up as the other three exchanged fire with police before being killed, Khogyani said.
In Uruzgan province, officials said that military forces have been under attack by militants for the past two weeks. A high number of Taliban are attacking different checkpoints but we are not getting any response from senior officials in Kabul, district chief Abdul Karim Karimi said.
He added that since the fighting began, 12 soldiers have been killed and dozens wounded. Unless we get government help, we are going to lose the district, he said.
On Monday, militants killed at least 26 police officers and soldiers in ambushes in southern Helmand province. As police retreated, militants surrounded the police headquarters of Nawzad district and fired down on them from surrounding hills, district police chief Napas Khan said.

Prosecutors made the request during final arguments in the trial in Luanda of Marques, who was accused of defaming several generals in a 2011 book about violence and rights violations linked to Angolas lucrative diamond mining industry.
The request for a suspended sentence came as a surprise to lawyers after the generals last week agreed to drop the charges on condition that Marques would not re-release his book that accuses them of corruption and torture.
Despite the agreement reached between the parties, the prosecution has asked for a one-month suspended prison sentence, his lawyer David Mendes said.
He vowed to appeal against any sentence when the verdict was handed down, which is expected to happen on Thursday.
Marques said he felt tricked in the wake of the deal he had secured with the generals. After all this, the state asks that I be sentenced, saying that I had failed to give evidence, said Marques as he left the court room.
Following agreement between him and the generals, none of the witnesses, including Marques and a woman whose two sons were killed by security forces within a year of each other in the mining region, gave evidence during the trial.
The generals, including one of president Jos Eduardo dos Santos closest allies, had originally claimed $1.2m (780,000) in damages.

European markets close lower
As the Greek talks grind on and time runs out for a deal before a default, European markets ended the day on a downbeat note. Some were closed on Monday, and took the opportunity to catch up with a slump in the Athens market on that day, while in contrast Greek shares actually recovered some ground. Gains by Spanish anti-austerity parties in regional elections also added to the mood of uncertainty surrounding the eurozone.
Meanwhile a stronger dollar on talk of a US interest rate rise later this year, reinforced by some strong economic numbers, also hit sentiment. The final scores showed:
The FTSE 100 fell 82.73 points or 1.18% to 6948.99
Germanys Dax dropped 1.61% to 11,625.13
Frances Cac closed down 0.66% at 5083.54
Italys FTSE MIB edged up 0.18% to 23,326.95
Spains Ibex ended down 0.72% at 11,240.3
The Athens market added 1.05% to 822.61
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 177 points or nearly 1%.
On that note, its time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and well be back again tomorrow.
18:17
Earlier, European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker reportedly said Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis had become a hindrance to the attempts to broker a deal. Over in Athens the media is making much of this, as Helena Smith reports:
The banner headline in Ta Nea this evening says it all: Junker Varoufakis is not helping the negotiations.
He is not helping the process. Mr Varoufakis is the finance minister of a country that has to confront huge problems and he doesnt give the feeling that he knows that. These comments from the EC president to the MNI news agency have caused a stir with every major news outlet leading on Jean Claude Junkers indictment of the Greek finance minister.
Essentially, Mr Juncker with his response is accusing Mr Varoufakis as the reason why negotiations arent moving forward, the news portal newit.gr wrote this evening.
While insisting that he could trust Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, the EU chiefs description of his radical left Syriza party as abnormal has also sent tremors through the political scene.
Meanwhile, the Tsipras government issued a non-paper tonight saying today was spent reworking different issues so that precious time isnt lost.
Not many in the EU would agree with that.
One EU official recently said: if we go at the speed the Greeks are negotiating the process will conclude in April 2017.

US to press Europe over Greece when G7 finance ministers meet
The US is likely to press Europe to reach a deal on Greece , when G7 finance ministers meet in Germany on Thursday and Friday this week, Reuters reports.
Greece is not formally on the agenda, but is likely to be discussed on the sidelines of the gathering (a familiar pattern). An official told Reuters:
I would expect the Americans to put pressure on the Europeans in Dresden about Greece. The Americans are stressing the geopolitical risks and telling us we have to find a solution, that we cannot really put the euro area and Europe at risk because of Greece.
If Greece for some reason were to turn to Russia and Moscow would get involved more, they could get too much influence inside NATO and inside the EU when it comes to policies towards Russia.
15:13
More US data, with consumer confidence and new home sales both beating expectations.
According to Conference Board figures, the May consumer confidence index came in at 95.4, up from a revised 94.3 in April and better than the expected 94.9.
Meanwhile single family home sales jumped 6.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 517,000 units, above forecasts of 510,000. Marchs figure was revised up from 481,000 to 484,000.
But the strength of the dollar - currently around an eight year high against the yen - has put a dampener on the US stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 152 points or 0.84%. The US currency has been lifted by Fridays comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggesting that, while a rate rise is not imminent, it could happen later in the year if the economy improves as expected. The consumer confidence and homes data today seems to feed into that theory.
15:02
European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for one reckons there is a growing belief that a Greek default can be avoided. Juncker told the MNI news agency:
My impression after talking to a series of colleagues is that the feeling is growing that a default should be avoided.
On the other hand all those Ive spoken to are insisting on the involvement of the (International Monetary Fund). No deal without the agreement of the IMF.
14:49
Back in the US, and new figures show that service sector growth slowed for the third month in a row in May.
The Markit preliminary purchasing managers index for services came in at 56.4, down from 57.4 in April . The composite index - an average of manufacturing and services - fell to 56.1 from 57 in April. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said:
The rate of expansion remains below the buoyant rates seen throughout much of last year, as slower growth of service activity has been accompanied by a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, which has seen exporters hit by the stronger dollar.

The idea of Greece consolidating all the payments due to the IMF in June into one lump sum could be risky unless a deal is done with its creditors. Heres the full Reuters report on the idea:
Cash-strapped Greece could avoid paying back the IMF on June 5 and win more time to negotiate a funding deal without defaulting if it lumps together all IMF repayments due in June and pays them at the end of the month, officials said on Tuesday.
Greece has to repay the International Monetary Fund 300 million euros on June 5, the first of four instalments due in June that total 1.6 billion euros.
Cut off from markets, Athens has said it will not be able to make the June 5 payment without new loans from the euro zone, which insists it can only lend Greece more if the country agrees to reforms that would make its debt sustainable.
There is the possibility of putting together several payments that Greece would need to make to the IMF in the course of June and then just make one payment, a senior euro zone official close to the talks with Athens said.
A second official close to the talks also acknowledged that possibility.
Thats basically a technical treasury exercise and they could tell the IMF that this is how they want to do it and the IMF would probably have to be OK with that, the first official said.
But the officials noted that Greece could only use such a trick if there was a credible prospect of a funding deal that could be communicated to markets and its citizens. Otherwise, the missed payment could trigger market panic and a bank run in Greece.
So they would get a few extra weeks. But unless there is some perspective how they would deal with this full payment, it would be a risky thing for the Greeks to do. And the consequences would be unpredictable, said the first official.
People could want to withdraw their savings and who knows what Greece would have to do.

        <title>Jacob Zuma: Marikana mine massacre report to be released by end of June</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/jacob-zuma-marikana-mine-massacre-report-south-africa</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
An official investigation into the Marikana mine massacre will be released by the end of next month, South Africas president, Jacob Zuma, has announced.
The shootings by police in August 2012 left 34 mineworkers dead and more than 78 injured on what has been described as South Africas darkest day since the end of apartheid.
Zuma immediately announced a judicial commission of inquiry which sat for 293 days and heard evidence including claims police planted weapons on some of the dead bodies to fit a false narrative. The commission submitted its report to Zuma at the end of March and pressure for it to be made public has grown ever since.
Zuma told parliament on Tuesday : I know and appreciate the anxiety of those who are affected. However, it would be inappropriate for me to just release the report without applying my mind sufficiently. The report will be released before the end of next month.
Members of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters staged a silent protest in parliament by holding up pieces of paper that said Release Marikana report in bold red type.

Zumas governing African National Congress welcomed the announcement. It said: The ANC in parliament appreciates and shares the anxiety of the families and others affected by the tragic events at Marikana regarding the public release of the report. However, it would be inappropriate and a dereliction of duty on the part of the president to unduly act hastily in his consideration of the report.
We believe that the work that the commission conducted during the course of almost three years, which culminated in this report, was thorough, careful and meticulous. It is therefore important that the president does not unnecessarily rush in his engagement with it, but considers it comprehensively and carefully to ensure appropriate measures are taken to ensure that the tragic events at Marikana do not recur.
Despite Zumas pledge, a lawyer representing the injured and arrested victims of the police crackdown said some of them want to press ahead with a planned court action in a bid to force his hand.
Andries Nkome, who is also representing the Association of Mineworkers and Construction union, said: Our clients are taking credit that they were able to get the president to commit to release the report but he is still treating them with contempt, having ignored their request for a commitment by 2pm on Sunday and waiting to address parliament instead.
His clients remain concerned that they will not have time to prepare for civil claims due to the expiry on 16 August of the three-year period in which they can be lodged. He said: Some are saying we ought to proceed with the case ... some are saying we must push through and get a date.
Earlier, Nkome told South Africas Star newspaper his clients were also concerned by reports that lieutenant-general Zukiswa Mbombo, the North West province police commissioner, intends to retire at the end of the month. He said Mbombo was among those his clients held directly responsible for their physical and emotional scars.
He added: Our clients are of the firm view that her imminent departure is largely motivated, in whole or in part, by a deliberate desire to escape the obvious consequences of her criminal and or otherwise unlawful conduct in connection with the Marikana massacre  the failure to release the report is also calculated to let her off the hook.
Sabata Mokgwabone, a spokesman for North West police, rejected the claims. He said: The retirement of Zukiswa Mbombo has got nothing at all to do with the Marikana commission. Shes reached 60 years and is going on retirement.
He said he could not comment on the allegation that her conduct was criminal or unlawful and added: We will wait for the Marikana report to be released.
Related: Marikana survivors sue Zuma to force release of official report into massacre
During her testimony, Mbombo conceded that police intervention at the mine in 2012 was a failure. She said there were mistakes in the police communication systems used on the day of the shooting.
Nkome said his clients noted that the national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, had been offered a different posting by Zuma. He said: The feeling that my clients have [is that they] will not be able to hold them accountable because they will not be holding that office any more.
However, Zumas office has rejected Nkomes statements about Mbombo and Phiyega as false. Spokesperson Harold Maloka said : The president does not manage the careers of provincial police commissioners and as such has nothing to do with the reported retirement. Linking the president to this matter and insinuating that it could be linked to the processing of the Marikana report by the president is malicious and mischievous.
Mr Nkome also repeated the already refuted allegations that President Jacob Zuma has met the national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, and discussed an alternative deployment for her. Reports of the said meeting and alleged discussions are a complete fabrication and have been refuted by the presidency. Anyone who repeats these allegations is perpetuating a lie.
Among the questions raised by Marikana was the role of Zumas deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa , a director and shareholder of the mine owner Lonmin at the time, and whether he encouraged the police to go on the offensive.
The Marikana Support campaign, Right2Know campaign and the SA History Archive have also stepped up pressure for the immediate release of judge Ian Farlams report. They submitted a request under the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which gives the presidency 30 days to respond.
The groups said: It has been more than two and a half years since the Marikana massacre on 16 August 2012, and there have been no arrests made for the murder of the 34 miners who were killed while striking  the commission report and findings are crucial to determining the truth about what happened at Marikana, to hold those responsible for the massacre to account and ensure justice is served.

Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter imprisoned in Iran for nearly 10 months , is standing trial behind closed doors in Tehran on charges of espionage and at least three other major crimes.
The Iranian-American appeared before a revolutionary court presided over by Abolghassem Salavati, a hardline judge notorious for handing down heavy sentences to opposition activists and dissidents, local media reported.
Rezaians lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the semi-official Tasnim news agency: He has been charged with espionage for collecting information about the countrys domestic and foreign policy issues. She is not Rezaians lawyer of choice.
According to the indictment, he is also facing the charges of collecting confidential information, collaborating with hostile governments, spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and writing a letter to the US president [Barack] Obama, she added.
Rezaian, 39, who holds dual Iranian and American citizenship, was arrested at his home in Tehran in July 2014 along with his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist, and two friends, an Iranian-American couple. Salehi was released on bail in October and is facing a separate trial.

After a 90-minute meeting between Rezaian and his lawyer in April, the first such meeting between the two, it emerged that he has been charged with espionage. His family say the charges are baseless and unfounded.
The Washington Posts executive editor, Martin Baron, issued a statement before the start of Rezaians trial, condemning the shameful acts of injustice facing his Tehran correspondent.
No evidence has ever been produced by prosecutors or the court to support these absurd charges. The trial date was only disclosed to Jasons lawyer last week. And now, unsurprisingly but unforgivably, it turns out the trial will be closed, read the statement published on the Posts website.
Baron said efforts by his paper to secure a visa for a senior editor to travel to Iran had been blocked. Rezaians mother, Mary, however, has been in Tehran for the past two weeks, though she has not been allowed to attend the trial, and nor has Salehi.
Baron added: There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance. Iran is making a statement about its values in its disgraceful treatment of our colleague, and it can only horrify the world community.
In April, Obama met Rezaians brother , Ali, at the White House correspondents dinner, reassuring him that the American government would do all it could to bring him home.
The president said during a speech at the event: For nine months, Jason has been in prison for nothing more than writing about the hopes and fears of the Iranian people. I have told [Rezaians brother] personally that we will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound.

Before the trial opened, Ali Rezaian criticised the decision by the Iranian judiciary to hold it behind closed doors and said his brother had lost 18kg (40lb) while in jail.
I think the only reason you could possibly imagine that the trial would be closed would be to prevent people from seeing the lack of evidence, he said. Its unlike the Iranian court system, Iranian government, to keep things private when they can go out and use propaganda up against people.

It is not still clear why Iran is accusing Rezaian of espionage. Ali Rezaian said two pieces of evidence against him were a visa application he had lodged for his Iranian wife in order to be able to travel to the US and a letter he sent to Obamas 2008 White House transition team offering help to improve bilateral relations between Iran and the US.
Irans foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has described Rezaian as a fair reporter, said in April that Rezaian was accused of a very serious offence but he hoped he would be cleared of the charges against him.
Zarif said at the time: He is an Iranian citizen. It is unfortunate that some over-zealous, low-level operative tried to take advantage of him. And I dont go into further detail because its a pending case before the court. And I hope that he will be cleared of that charge.
In the past few months, a number of hardline Iranian media outlets have tried to build a cause against him. Unattributed accusations printed in the Iranian press allege that Rezaian worked undercover as a spy while reporting in the country for the Post. A Fars news agency report alleged that Rezaian provided economic and industrial data to the US government.
Ahsan said at the time in response to the accusations: Jason is a journalist, and it is in the nature of his profession to gain access to information and publish them. My client, however, has never had any direct or indirect access to classified information to share with anyone.
Iran does not recognise dual citizenship and treats Rezaian as solely Iranian . Iranian intelligence authorities have a deep suspicion of dual citizens and have arrested a number in recent years.
The country has a history of jailing journalists working for the foreign press. Those previously jailed in Iran include Maziar Bahari, whose ordeal in prison was the subject of Rosewater, a film by the US comedian Jon Stewart recently released in the UK.
Rezaians trial was adjourned after two hours. It was not clear when the next session would take place and what details were discussed in the court.

Muslims face dehumanisation when western countries apply double standards, the wife of the former emir of Qatar has warned in an unusual and critical public intervention from a senior royal in a wealthy Gulf state.
Sheikha Moza bint Nasser al-Missned, one of the most influential and high-profile women in the Arab world , also questioned distinctions between moderate or liberal and conservative Muslims and insisted that it was wrong to say that Islam was stuck in medieval times.
Why is it that world leaders gathered to march in defence of Charlie Hebdo, while the Chapel Hill murders were shrugged off as a parking dispute? she asked, in a reference to the killing of three Muslim students in North Carolina in February . She was speaking at St Antonys College, Oxford, on Tuesday.
At the same time we are confronted with double standards. Why is it that apologies are offered when Europeans are mistakenly killed by drones but only silence follows when innocent Yemeni and Pakistani children and civilians are killed by the same drones? Why do Muslim lives seem to matter less than the lives of others? If they matter at all. I believe this dehumanisation is cultivated through a process of Muslim-phobia.
Moza is the second of the three wives of the former emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the mother of the current emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad, and the head of the Qatar Foundation.
Alongside a genuine interest in Islamic civilisation, there existed a fear of real, living Muslims, Moza said: For example, a Muslim is first and foremost identified as a Muslim, rather than simply a human being. Whether they are Pakistani, Malaysian, Senegalese, or even British-born, their multiple identities are levelled under a constructed monolith of Islam .
Let me remind you, however, that Islam has never been monolithical, but has from the start been a vast container for diverse cultures and ethnicities. The homogenisation of Muslims into a fearful and unknowable other, separate from the beauty and nobility of Islam and its civilisation, is at the root of Muslim-phobia.
Islam had been used from all sides, she said. The radical militants put forth a version of Islam devoid of its spiritual content and subtlety of interpretation, nothing more than a violent political slogan, she said. But neo-orientalists and libertarians defame Islam, and the prophet, in particular.
It was wrong to use the word medieval to describe the actions of radicals, she said. But why do we insinuate that somehow those who are perpetuating certain acts of violence do not belong to our age? That somehow they are not modern? It is a nave refusal to accept our collective responsibility. Isis is as modern as Guantnamo and Abu Ghraib. They are all products of our age.
And she issued a stark warning about how activism can quickly change to militancy in the wake of failure to replace autocratic leaders in the Arab spring  an object of the Gulf states policy of supporting Islamist groups during her husbands reign. Debate is needed, she said. Violent repression is not.
Qatar, the worlds wealthiest country in per capita terms, has huge investments in Britain. It has also endowed two chairs at Oxford University: the chair of contemporary Islamic studies and the chair of Islamic art. Moza was speaking at the opening of the new Investcorp building at St Antonys College, designed by the Iraqi-born architect Dame Zaha Hadid.

Three more people have been put to death in Saudi Arabia , taking the number of executions carried out in the country this year to 88  surpassing the total for all of 2014.
The interior ministry on Tuesday identified the latest prisoners to be put to death as Saudis Awad al-Rowaili and Lafi al-Shammary, who had been convicted of smuggling amphetamines. They were executed in the northern region of Jawf, the ministry said in statements carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.
Another Saudi, Muhammad al-Shihri, was separately put to death in the south-western region of Asir for murder.
The escalation in the number of executions comes amid activists concerns that trials are not being conducted fairly. The conservative Islamic kingdom executed 87 people in 2014, according to an AFP tally.
Those beheaded this year include Siti Zainab, an Indonesian domestic worker convicted of murder despite concerns about her mental health . Jakarta summoned Riyadhs ambassador over her case; a rare diplomatic incident linked to Saudi Arabias executions, around half of which involve foreigners.
Also among this years dead are at least eight Yemenis, 10 Pakistanis, Syrians, Jordanians, and individuals from Burma, the Philippines, India, Chad, Eritrea and Sudan.
In 2014 Saudi Arabia ranked in the top five countries worldwide for the number of executions, according to Amnesty International . Amnesty said in a report that court proceedings in the country fell far short of global norms of fairness, while trials in death penalty cases were often held in secret. It said defendants were rarely allowed formal representation by lawyers and might be convicted solely on the basis of confessions.
Under the Gulf nations strict version of sharia law, drug trafficking, rape, murder, apostasy and armed robbery are all punishable by death. Executions are carried out in public, mostly by beheading with a sword.
Related: Saudi Arabia advertises for eight new executioners as beheading rate soars
A surge in executions began towards the end of the reign of King Abdullah, who died in January. The numbers have accelerated this year under his successor, King Salman , in what Amnesty has called an unprecedented macabre spike. With the number of beheadings soaring, the civil service this month advertised for eight new executors of retribution.
Activists have been unable to explain specific reasons for the surge, and officials have not commented. However, drug and murder convictions account for the bulk of executions in Saudi Arabia and Ali Adubisi, director of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, said poverty could be leading to a rise in drug crimes.
The number of executions will rise even higher if death sentences are carried out against nine people who activists say were convicted after demonstrations that began in 2011 by the minority Shia community. Among them is cleric Nimr al-Nimr , a driving force behind the protests.

The thaw in relations between the US and Cuba has led to a stunning 36% increase in visits by Americans to the island, including thousands who are flying into Cuba from third countries like Mexico in order to sidestep US restrictions on tourism.
Related: How to visit Cuba  without falling foul of US travel regulations
The dramatic rise was seen in the number of Americans with no family ties to Cuba who visited between 1 January and 9 May of this year compared to the same period in 2014, according to statistics provided to the Associated Press by a University of Havana professor.
In addition to the boom in American visitors, Cuba has seen a 14% jump in arrivals from around the world between January and early May compared to the same period last year.
From 1 January to 9 May, 51,458 Americans visited Cuba, compared to 37,459 over that period last year, according to new statistics provided exclusively to the Associated Press by Jose Luis Perello Cabrera, an economist in the University of Havanas tourism studies department with access to official figures. The figures also included revealing details on the thousands of Americans who are entering Cuba through third countries, many to sidestep US restrictions on tourism.
There were 38,476 visitors who flew directly from the US to Cuba, compared to 29,213 in the same period last year.
Another 12,982 Americans came in via third countries, a whopping 57% increase over the 8,246 Americans who flew to Cuba from elsewhere in the same period last year.
Mexico, the Bahamas, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands are the top choices for Americans entering Cuba from non-US points, Perello said.
David Perez, a New Yorker who works in public relations, traveled to Cuba in May through Cancun. I had just always wanted to go to Cuba and I decided now was the time, he said.
Cuba also has seen a 14% rise in overall tourism. Arrivals from 206 counties from 1 January to 9 May rose from 1,349,903 last year to 1,547,104 this year. Visitors from Germany were up 22%; France, 25%; the United Kingdom, 26% and Spain 16%.
Travel to Cuba for tourist activities continues to be prohibited, said Hagar Chemali, a spokesperson for the US Treasury Department, which publishes the rules on Cuba travel. But in January, after Barack Obama announced detente with Cubas communist government, we eased the travel regulations, Chemali said.
The new rules make it easier to get the necessary paperwork, and that has led some Americans to flout the restrictions. While many Americans still travel with expensive, organized people to people tours that are approved by the US government, its not uncommon to encounter Americans who have traveled to Cuba independently to drink mojitos and head to the beach.
Charter companies flying travelers from the US to Cuba say travelers now need only self-certify that their trip falls under a permitted category. The person calling us needs to tell me, Im going in support of the Cuban people, or professional research, or a family visit, or any one of the 12 allowed categories, said Tessie Aral of ABC Charters. After that, all they do is sign a certification.
The federal register states that travelers must retain specific records related to the authorized travel transactions for five years, but what those records consist of is not spelled out, and Aral said travel providers are not required to review travelers itineraries or receipts.
Bob Guild of Marazul Tours, another charter company, worries that some travelers may be viewing the process of planning a trip to Cuba too casually by claiming that theyre going for a sanctioned purpose when in fact they are going on vacation. But Guild acknowledges that theres a disconnect between whats on paper and whats happening. Its a foggy land right now, he said.
Attorney Robert Muse, an expert on the legal aspects of Cuba travel, says theres been almost no active enforcement of the tourism ban under the Obama administration. He added that the increase in US visitors to Cuba is what the Obama administration wants ... They favor engagement. Thats why they take this liberalized approach to travel.
The Cuban government did not respond to a request for comment, but tourism minister Manuel Marrero recently said visitors were up by 30% and that Cuba was willing to accept the increase.
As for those rushing to see Cuba before it changes, Muse said, they think that in the future there are going to be Burger Kings on every corner. Thats not going to happen, but people still want to see the end of revolutionary Cuba.

Related: Rout of Ramadi reawakens Iraq to 'brutal reality'
Iraqi state TV reported the start of the operation, in which troops will be backed by Shia and Sunni paramilitary forces, but did not provide further details.
A spokesman for Iraqs Shia militias said the operation will not last for a long time and that Iraqi forces have surrounded the provincial capital, Ramadi, from three sides.
Ahmed al-Assadi, who is also a member of parliament, told reporters that new weapons are being used in the battle that will surprise the enemy.
Isis began to seize large parts of Anbar from early 2014. The fall of Ramadi marked a major defeat for Iraqi forces, which had been making steady progress against the extremists over the past year with the help of US-led air strikes.
Related: US defense secretary says fall of Ramadi shows Iraqi forces lack will to fight Isis
Security forces and Sunni militiamen who had been battling the extremists in Ramadi for months collapsed as Isis fighters overran the city. The militants gained not only new territory 70 miles (115km) west of Baghdad, but large stocks of weapons abandoned by the government forces as they fled.
The capture of Ramadi was a major blow to the US-backed strategy against Isis.
Vice-President Joe Biden spoke on Monday to the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, to reassure him of US support, a day after controversial remarks by the defence secretary, Ash Carter, sparked a war of words over Isiss recent military successes.
Carter told CNN on Saturday Iraqi forces had shown  no will to fight  Isis and had fled in Ramadi despite outnumbering the militants. Isis also captured Palmyra , in Syria, last week.
A spokesman for Abadi subsequently told the Associated Press Carter had been given incorrect information, and said: We should not judge the whole army based on one incident.
A White House statement on Monday said Biden recognised the enormous sacrifice and bravery that Iraqi forces had displayed over the past 18 months in Ramadi and elsewhere, and welcomed an Iraqi decision to mobilise additional troops and prepare for counter-attack operations.
Nonetheless, rival powers and allies traded barbs and accusations over the recent successes of Islamic State , amid warnings that it may execute hundreds of hostages captured in its latest battles.
In Iran Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, the external operations arm of the Revolutionary Guards, said the US had no will to fight Isis.
Today, there is nobody in confrontation with [Isis] except the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as nations who are next to Iran or supported by Iran, Soleimani told a daily newspaper, Javan, on Monday.
Soleimani said US fighter jets had done nothing to halt the Isis advance on Ramadi, and said the US was complicit in the groups expansion.

It was standing room only in the darkened hall when Cyril Ramaphosa, a former miners union leader-turned- mining magnate and South African deputy president, walked to the podium at Durbans deluxe International Convention Centre. He was to address a National Sanitation Indaba, a conference dealing with the outrage that more than one in 10 of South African households still lack adequate sanitation in the 21st century.
It is a tale of daily humiliation for many of our people, Ramaphosa told delegates . The lack of adequate sanitation encourages the transmission of many infectious diseases, including cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, polio, cryptosporidiosis and ascariasis. Diarrhea  a disease directly related to poor sanitation  it is said, kills one child every 20 seconds. This is more than 4,000 children every day worldwide. This amounts to more deaths than Aids, malaria and measles combined. This is a tale of diseases that are easily spread and young lives that are needlessly lost.
Diarrhea kills more than 4,000 children every day worldwide .. more deaths than Aids, malaria and measles combined

It is the kind of health cause that Bill Gates relishes. In 2011, his foundation launched the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge , offering grants to the 2.5 billion people on the planet in need of sustainable sanitation. In the room next door to Ramaphosas audience, various organisations had set up stalls to display their prototypes. South Africas water research commission was showing off the Earth Auger, which does not flush or require connection to a sewage system, replaces toilet paper with sawdust and turns excrement into pathogen-free compost. It is due for testing by communities in the next three months.
Stuart Woolley, assistant research manager at the commission, said: Sanitation is a massive issue and its not just the health aspect, its dignity. You go to the rural areas and see toilets people have to use and its a stark contrast for those who live in suburbs with porcelain toilets. The fact that Gates put funding up front really did accelerate the programme and create a lot of innovation where there really wouldnt have been before.

The Gates Foundation awarded $1.6m (1m) to the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban to become a hub for sanitation researchers and product developers. Professor Chris Buckley has a business card with the universitys logo and the job title shit manager. Engaged in the field for more than 20 years, he explained cheerfully: Im known as the shit manager across Africa.
Buckley, 66, recalled that Gates had visited Durban  where a million people, nearly a third of the population, have no formal sanitation  to look at pit latrines and saw theres a better way of doing things. Buckley was then one of three researchers who sat down with the Microsoft co-founder at his foundation to convince him that toilets are a global health multiplier. His comment was, The data sucks. None of us could disagree.
The Gates Foundation is the best research organisation Ive ever worked for. Theyre completely goal driven and empathetic to the researchers. They believe in cooperation rather than competition. In my experience, money has never been the scarce resource. Bill Gates describes himself as an impatient optimist.
Reinventing the toilet could improve lives on an almost unimaginable scale, Buckley believes. The whole point of sanitation is public health. That is the reason for doing it. All the other things are nice-to-haves.
The Guardians Keep it in the Ground campaign is calling on the Gates Foundation to move its investments out of fossil fuel companies. Climate change is thought to be the biggest threat to global public health of the 21st century .
Asked if there was any contradiction between the Gates Foundations investments in fossil fuels and its world-class work on improving sanitation, Buckley paused before replying:
I wouldnt want to defend Gates Foundations investment policy. Considering all the other aspects  and Bill is a very engaged person  Im sure hes aware of it, theres a reason for it. Nutrition and sanitation and neglected tropical diseases are the major disease burden in the world. I dont know where fossil fuels fit on that scale. Since he is aware of burdens of disease, he wouldnt be doing something not logical.
Theres a certain pragmatism you have to have. You cant make an omelette without breaking eggs. You cant solve all the problems of the world so you have to choose which you want to.
Not everyone in Durban feels this way, however. A 15-minute drive south are the giant tanks and stacks of the biggest petrochemical complex in Africa . One of the main nodes is Shell and BP South African Petroleum Refineries, or Sapref. The Gates Foundation has a $372m stake in BP and $5.5m in Shell.
Is it any coincidence, ask local campaigners, that the cancer risk in this part of the city is so high that it has been dubbed cancer valley ?
A scientific link to cancer has never been proven, although a 2007 study led by the University of KwaZulu-Natal found an increased risk of the disease in certain areas.
Last week, beyond scenic palm trees, the entrance of Sapref was patrolled by G4S security guards as gardeners mowed lawns beside the boom gates. An inflatable archway, with a cartoon image of a tortoise wearing blue overalls, proclaimed: Its turnaround time. Lets delivery it safely. Last month a fuel line explosion here claimed the life of a worker and left two others seriously injured  one of many accidents over the years.
Within sniffing distance of the refinery in the Isipingo Beach suburb, widow Zakiya Kikia-Khan has asthma. I cant smell very well but I can feel it in my chest when Sapref is flaring. Its very scary: I feel choked up, I feel my lungs cant get air, I feel starved of oxygen. I get panic attacks. My husband died last July and I now feel even more vulnerable. I will not be able to shout for assistance. I fear I will die alone.

I know my asthma would be better if I wasnt exposed to it. I use my inhaler more often on days theyre flaring. They attack us at night: most of the flaring is under cover of darkness. There is also noise, almost like jet engines, that comes out of nowhere and goes on and on. I used to phone Saprefs PR person at 2am and I would say, If I cant sleep, why should you?
Kikia-Khan said her daughter Naadira, 18, suffers bad allergies and has had her sinuses drained twice. The 51-year-old is also worried about other children living in the area. When she visited a school close to Sapref, the first thing I noticed was how black the roof was. If thats the roof, what are the kids lungs like? What kind of future generations are we rearing?
Asked about the Gates Foundations links to Sapref, Kikia-Khan replied: I think, as much as a philanthropist, Gates is also a businessman. Hes a shrewd investor and refineries make money. Id like to tell him, Your investment in Sapref is undoing all the good work youve done and is associating you with a company that doesnt care.
Bill Gates is throwing money at the symptoms. Its no good mopping up constantly when you dont fix the tap.
Zakiya Kikia-Khan
Bill Gates is throwing money at the symptoms. Its no good mopping up constantly when you dont fix the tap thats leaking. Id like them to come here and see whats happening. This area has got gangsterism, crime, unemployment  surely that burden is enough without industry having to add to it.
A spokesperson for Bill Gates private office said: Bill and Melinda Gates wrote in their recent annual letter that the long-term threat [of climate change] is so serious that the world needs to move much more aggressively  right now  to develop energy sources that are cheaper, can deliver on demand, and emit zero carbon dioxide. Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in this effort and the breakthrough innovations needed and will continue to speak out about it. We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognize that there are many views on how best to address it.
Sapref did not respond to requests for comment.

In the suburb of Merebank, where paint is peeling off the walls of blocks of flats, Lutchmee Perumar, 52, and her husband Krish live within sight of both Sapref and a refinery owned by Engen. One of their four children has a chronic thyroid problem. It affects our breathing, Perumar reported. If its raining, the odours are very strong in the air. My husband is asthmatic so it affects him terribly.
Cancer has been very common in our community. My mother died from it and my sister has been diagnosed with it. I have half-siblings with it too. People are frustrated, but the companies just think were making a big noise. We are the ones living right in the midst and no one listens.
It would be such a good thing if Bill Gates himself came here to see what has happened to the people.
Lutchmee Perumar
She joined in the condemnation of the Gates Foundation. They should withdraw because these investments are creating major problems here ... It would be such a good thing if Bill Gates himself came here to see what has happened to the people.

Settlers primary school in Merebank is sandwiched between the Sapref and Engen refineries. A 2002 study found high levels of asthma among its pupils. Its principal, Inthirin Naidoo, arrived 17 years ago and says Sapref has been by far the more helpful of the two neighbours, for example outfitting a library. But he noted: When I first came here I got a sore throat that has never gone away. Theres no doubt the kids illnesses in terms of coughing are probably pollution related.
Lawrence Vartharajulu, 51, a teacher at the school, remarked: If you asked the children how many of them are asthmatic, youd be amazed how many of them would say yes, they do have pumps. Many residents have moved out of the area because of air pollution. They dont find it viable to stay here.
The area is uniquely vulnerable. The stacks at the refineries are said to have been built much lower than the industry norm to avoid aircraft from the city airport that, until recently, was nearby. South Durban sits in a bowl so that cloud cover traps pollution like a lid. Wind from the adjacent coastline is another contributory factor.

The University of KwaZulu-Natal sudy showed that children with pre-existing asthma were profoundly affected by their exposure to the pollution with more symptoms and lung function losses. Another study is currently under way to investigate whether the pollution is directly causing asthma.
Lead researcher Rajen Naidoo, associate professor of occupational medicine at the university, said: Sapref has been extraordinarily defensive about it. Rather than recognising this is a problem, theyve behaved in ways that try to undermine the report. If they accepted the findings, there could theoretically be a legal responsibility.
The communities in Durban and worldwide have rallied against Shell and I would have thought philanthropic organisations like the Gates Foundation would be more circumspect about who they invest in. They should pull out of Sapref. Its a question of perception around these things and you want these organisations to be seen as neutral.

Perhaps the most outspoken critic of Sapref is Desmond DSa, 58, coordinator of the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance and winner of last years Goldman Environmental prize . His office contains a map showing pollution incidents in the south Durban basin and a poster that declares: People united will never be defeated by Shell!!!
DSa describes Sapref, more than half a century old, as like a rusty bucket. He recalled a big explosion there in 1998  That opened our eyes to the dangers were facing,  and cited further accidents in 2001 and 2006.

At least 17 people have died in Mexico and the US after extreme weather lashed regions along the border over the weekend and into Monday.
A tornado that struck Ciudad Acua on the Mexican side of the border killed 13 as it destroyed homes and flung cars against buildings.
In the US at least four people were killed and 12 missing in flash floods. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, on Monday expanded the emergency disaster zone in the state, adding 24 counties to a list of 13 affected by storms and flooding. Oklahoma was also hit hard.
Abbott said the damage wreaked by floods in central Texas was absolutely devastating and had been caused by relentless, tsunami-type power.
Twelve people were reported missing from two families staying in a house in Wimberley Valley, Texas. Witnesses reported seeing the house pushed off its foundations by water surging from the Blanco river.

No more survivors were expected to be found in the flood debris along the river.
At least 2,000 Texans were forced from their homes on Monday. The centre of the state was worst affected, especially San Marcos and Wimberley, near the Blanco. The river swelled to 40ft, its highest since 2010.
Evacuations were also under way in Austin, Texas after another river overflowed its banks in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The National Weather Service said 6-10 inches of rain had fallen on south-east Texas on Monday night.

The Austin American-Statesman reported that teams had used boats and helicopters to rescue some residents and were conducting door-to-door searches.
High winds, thunderstorms and hail were forecast for parts of south-west Arkansas and north-west Louisiana into Monday night. North Texas, including Dallas and Fort Worth, was placed on tornado watch.
In Mexico, rescuers were digging through the rubble of damaged homes after a tornado hit a seven-block area of Ciudad Acua, a city of 125,000 across from Del Rio, Texas. Mayor Evaristo Perez Rivera said 300 people were being treated in hospital, and up to 200 homes had been destroyed. Three people were unaccounted for.
Theres nothing standing, not walls, not roofs, said Edgar Gonzalez, a spokesman for the city government, describing some of the destroyed homes in a square-mile area. By midday on Monday, 13 people were confirmed dead, including three children.

Photos from the scene showed cars with their bonnets torn off, resting upended against single-storey houses. One cars frame was bent around the gate of a house; a bus was flipped over and left crumpled on a roadside.
The tornado struck not long after daybreak on Monday, around the time buses were preparing to take children to school.

A French farmer has gone on trial for shooting dead a man he thought was stealing his truffles.
Laurent Rambaud, 37, had grown increasingly frustrated with a spate of thefts in the south-eastern region of Drme and, on the night of 20 December 2010, went into his fields armed with a shotgun.
He came across 43-year-old Ernest Pardo, known as a truffle hunter and with previous indictments for theft, who was walking with his dog.
Taking him for a thief and believing him to be armed, Rambaud fired two shots, killing Pardo almost immediately.
The charge against Rambaud has been reduced from murder to manslaughter after the court decided the killing was not premeditated, but the 37-year-old still faces 30 years in prison if convicted on Friday.
Rambaud, who was president of the young farmers association in the region and a volunteer fireman, had repeatedly complained about thefts.
Known as black diamonds, truffles are a delicacy in France and worth about 1,000 (707) per kilo during the holiday season.
This is a man who felt in danger that night. He was scared, said his lawyer Alain Fort in opening remarks, adding that local farmers had been confronted by armed thieves.
The trial continues, with judges due to give their verdict on Friday.

Air raid sirens sounded on Tuesday night after at least one rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed in southern Israel , Israeli television news reports said.
There were no reports of damage or injuries and the remnants of the device were found near the port city of Ashdod, about 20km north of the Gaza Strip, an Israeli ambulance service spokesman said.
No group in the Gaza Strip had immediately taken responsibility for the launch. Israeli media speculated that it may have been an errant rocket that was not intentionally aimed at Israeli territory.
A Hamas official later said unknown militants in the territory had fired a rocket at Israel.
The official said at least one rocket was fired and that it was not clear who fired it. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to brief journalists.
Hamas has fired thousands of rockets at Israel over the years, but rocket fire has mostly stopped since the end of last summers war between Gaza militants and Israel.
Other militant groups have fired rockets in the meantime, though Israel holds Hamas responsible for all attacks coming out of Gaza.

An increase in suicide bombings by girls and women used by Boko Haram means children are in danger of being seen as potential threats in north-east Nigeria, the UN childrens agency has said.
There were 27 reported suicide attacks in the first five months of this year, compared with 26 in the whole of last year, Unicef said.
Women and children carried out three-quarters of all such attacks, with girls aged between approximately seven and 17 blamed for nine suicide bombings since July, it said in a collation of reports.
Children are not instigating these suicide attacks; they are used intentionally by adults in the most horrific way, said Jean Gough, a Unicef representative in Nigeria . They are first and foremost victims, not perpetrators.
The agency is concerned that children will increasingly be perceived as potential threats, putting them in danger of retaliation and jeopardising their return home.
It is not known how many thousands of children and women have been kidnapped by Boko Haram, and new abductions are reported each week. Unicef estimates that 743,000 children have been uprooted by the nearly six-year-old Islamist uprising, with as many as 10,000 separated from their families in the chaos.
Nigerias military recently reported rescuing 700 women and children from Boko Haram during a weeks-long offensive to oust the extremists from camps in their Sambisa Forest stronghold.
Reporters have seen only 275 of those freed. They were taken to the safety of a refugee camp on 2 May and then reportedly flown to an unidentified military facility last week to undergo more trauma counselling.
Seventy percent of that group is children under five years old, and 63 were unable to identify relatives, the National Emergency Management Agency said.
Last week the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, expressed alarm at the horrific mental and physical scars inflicted by Boko Haram violence.
Whole communities have fled their villages and endured unimaginable suffering. Traumatised people, without homes, belongings, income and education for their children, he said.

Hong Kong pro-democracy student leader Joshua Wong has been refused entry to Malaysia because of fears he would threaten ties with China, the countrys police chief has said.
Wong was the teenage face of the umbrella movement , which brought parts of Hong Kong to a standstill for more than two months late last year with mass rallies calling for fully free leadership elections.
Wong had been planning to give talks on democracy in China , from the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Beijings Tiananmen Square in 1989 to Hong Kongs umbrella movement, according to the Scholarism student protest group he founded.
Malaysias police inspector general, Abu Bakar Khalid, said the purpose of Wongs visit was to explain how he had organised demonstrations in Hong Kong. We were afraid that what he was going to speak about would harm our security, he said. He was also going to speak about China. We know his anti-Chinese speeches. We do not want him to jeopardise our ties with China, Khalid said.
Democracy activists reject Beijings restrictions on a proposed public vote for Hong Kongs leader in 2017, which stipulate that candidates must be vetted by a loyalist committee.
Khalid said Malaysian police had asked the immigration department to stop Wong entering the country. We do not need him in Malaysia as Wong is an undesirable element, he said.
On his return to Hong Kong, Wong said customs officers in Malaysia had taken his passport and air ticket for half an hour before telling him he was being sent back immediately.

I asked whats the reason? Were there any documents? And the representative only said it was a government order, Wong told reporters. I asked if there was any detailed information about the government order and they didnt want to respond. They tried to grab my arms and take me away.
He added: I dont understand how there is any relation between the umbrella movement and Malaysias national security.

Wongs visit came less than two weeks before the 26th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre on 4 June. Hong Kong commemorates the anniversary each year with a candlelit vigil attended by thousands.
Wong called on the Hong Kong government to look into his case, saying it was an infringement of his right to travel freely.
Hong Kongs security bureau said in a statement it respects the right of other jurisdictions in exercising immigration control and making decisions in accordance with their laws.

Japanese historians have urged prime minister Shinzo Abe to offer an honest account of the countrys wartime use of sex slaves in the runup to the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war.
In a statement released this week that echoes a demand recently issued by overseas experts, 16 groups of academics, including the Japanese Society for Historical Studies, said the government must squarely confront Japans wartime conduct.
Despite signs of an improvement in Sino-Japanese ties, speculation is building that Abes conservative administration will not repeat an official apology to the comfort women  a euphemism for as many as 200,000 women, mostly from the Korean peninsula , who were forced to work in military brothels.
Early indications are that Abe will also make no reference to Japans colonial rule and aggression on mainland Asia in the first half of the 20th century, when it invaded the Korean peninsula and parts of China. The omissions would mark a clean break with apologies issued by his predecessors on previous war anniversaries, and risk raising tensions with South Korea and China.
The Japanese academics said in their statement that comfort women had been the victims of unspeakable violence as sex slaves.
They added: As recent historical studies have shown, victims were subjected not only to forced recruitment, but also to conditions of sexual slavery which violated their basic human rights. By continuing to take the irresponsible stance of denying the facts of wartime sexual slavery in the Japanese military, certain politicians and sections of the media are essentially conveying to the rest of the world that Japan does not respect human rights.
This kind of attitude tramples further upon the dignity of the victims, who have already borne terrible hardships.

While Abe has said he will not alter the wording of an apology to survivors of military sexual enslavement issued in 1993 by the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono , he has resisted pressure to repeat the apology, most recently during his address to a joint session of the US congress .
The Japanese historians urged all concerned politicians and media outlets to squarely face up to the damage that Japan inflicted in the past, as well as to the victims.
The demand comes soon after several hundred academics, mainly from the US and Europe, voiced alarm at attempts to rewrite Japans wartime history, and urged Abe to act boldly in addressing sensitive issues from the past.

In an open letter , more than 180 scholars called for as full and unbiased an accounting of past wrongs as possible. The number of academics who wish to add their names to the protest has since more than doubled to more than 450.
Rightwing revisionists associated with Abe have been emboldened by misreporting of the sex slave issue by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper . Last summer, the liberal daily admitted that it had run a series of articles stretching back to the 1980s that were based on testimony given by Seiji Yoshida, a former Japanese soldier, whose claims were later found to be false.
Abe was one of several conservative politicians who claimed the Asahis erroneous coverage had sullied Japans reputation abroad.
However, the academics said previous government apologies were not based on the Asahis reporting or Yoshidas testimony, adding: The existence of forcibly recruited comfort women has been verified by many historical records and extensive research.
Abe has previously questioned the widely held belief that Japanese military authorities coerced the women. He has also said that Japan has apologised enough for its actions during the war.

A Danish radio station has killed a nine-week old rabbit live on air, saying it intended to stimulate a debate around the widespread hypocrisy in our relationship to animals.
Presenters brought the rabbit, which they called Alan, into the studio on Sunday morning, where he was clubbed with a bicycle pump.
Asger Juhl, one of the presenters, later took the rabbits body home and skinned it, saying he planned a dinner of rabbit ragot for his children.
Radio24syv said Denmark has some of the worlds most industrialised agriculture. Its stunt provoked a strong backlash and calls for a boycott.
In a response to Radio24syvs Facebook post , Stan Kosjaks wrote: Dont try and justify it you heartless bastards, the only reason you killed a small, defenceless animal on air is to boost your ratings.
Maybe, somebody should hit you on the head with a fucking pump, see if that provokes a debate.
Julie Schmidt wrote: You could probably easily have had the debate on air without having to kill an animal.
The station invited an outspoken advocate for animal rights, Linse Kessler, into the studio for the debate. When she realised the plan, Kessler chased Juhl around the studio in an attempt to rescue the rabbit.
Kessler later posted a video to Facebook in which she said she understood the point Radio24syv was trying to make, but thought killing the rabbit went too far. I could see that the message is actually for the best of animals but I think it is wrong, she said, according to a translation by The Local .

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov is starring in two films  one a Hollywood thriller featuring the camouflage-clad hero firing a machine gun into the sky and the other a sombre documentary accusing him of human rights abuses.
The upcoming feature, which Kadyrov announced on his personal Instagram page today, is to be called Whoever Doesnt Understand Will Get It.
Its a hard-hitting piece in which, after lengthy negotiations, I have agreed to play the role of the main hero.  The director is the author of famous Hollywood films, Kadyrov wrote on Instagram. The trailer announces that the movie will be shown in cinemas across Russia .
A series of scandals in recent months have propelled Kadyrov to the forefront of Russian politics. The Chechen strongman appears to answer only to Vladimir Putin, to whom he frequently and publicly expresses his adoration.
He is being portrayed less flatteringly in a short documentary financed by former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky , which alleges widespread human rights violations in Chechnya and accuses Kadyrov of having a personal army of up to 80,000 fighters and skimming off huge quantities of federal funds.
The film, which Khodorkovsky said was the reason behind police raids on the offices of his Open Russia Foundation last month, catalogued abuses in Chechnya and featured interviews with prominent Russian journalists, NGO workers and political analysts.
Open Russias documentary
This is a person that has made Chechnya into his own feudal domain, Khodorkovsky said in the film, entitled Family.
The 26-minute documentary also catalogues beatings and murders reportedly linked to Chechen security forces and alleges that every Chechen is forced to make a contribution to a personal fund from which Kadyrov buys expensive presents and pays foreign celebrity visitors.
The movie shows old television interviews where Putin describes Kadyrov as a son and Kadyrov, with tears in his eyes, pledges his allegiance to the Russian president.

When it opened in 2001, the East Coast Road in southern India gave drivers a smooth, modern link to coastal resorts and an open stretch of highway to gun their engines on weekends.
The 685km road also is a glaring example of why, with just 1% of the worlds automobiles, India accounts for 15% of global traffic deaths, according to the World Bank. In 2013 there were 174 accidents on the East Coast Road, and 24 people died. So many men from villages flanking the road have been run over by speeding vehicles and drunk drivers in the past decade that their bereaved wives are called ECR widows.
India has some of worlds deadliest roads, with more than 200,000 fatalities every year, according to the World Health Organisation . The nations supreme court calls Indias roads  giant killers . Experts say that many of the accused go free because of weak and outdated motor vehicle regulations, corruption, lagging investigations and slow court trials.
Everybody is lobbying to dilute the law as much as possible. The government has buckled under pressure
Amid rising middle-class anger and activism, the government began overhauling road safety rules last year, adding stiff penalties such as a roughly $4,600 fine and seven years in prison for reckless driving that results in the death of a child.
But two months ago officials rewrote the proposed legislation to lower the penalties, saying India cannot imitate the developed world. The penalty for reckless driving involving the death of a child, for example, was lowered to a $780 fine and a one-year prison term. It is not possible to replicate 100% of the road safety laws of America, England or Canada in Indian conditions, Nitin Gadkari, Indias minister of road transport and highways, said in an interview. We have to look at our local conditions like density of population, road congestion, road quality, socioeconomic profile of our people. I do not want to impose such high penalties that it ruins poor peoples lives.
As a result, critics say a watered-down version of the road transport and safety bill , which probably will be introduced in parliament in July, will do little to improve safety. Punishments for speeding and drunken driving have been reduced, a limit has been set on compensation for accident victims, and the powers of the proposed road safety regulator were shrunk.
Recently, some workers unions even urged Gadkari to cancel the mandatory level of education required for getting a drivers license.
I want to cut the number of road accident deaths by half by 2019, but it is not easy, he said. Some say go, others say stop, some put up obstacles or pull you backward.
With rising affluence, owning a car in India has become easier. But bad driving habits, poor regulatory oversight and flawed road design are quite common. Speeding, running lights, drunken driving, riding motorcycles without helmets, and lane violations are rampant. According to officials, 25% of drivers licences in India are procured fraudulently.
What began as an effort to bring a strong road safety law has slowly turned into a farce, said Piyush Tewari, founder of Save Life Foundation , a public advocacy group that works on road safety. Everybody is lobbying to dilute the law as much as possible. The government has buckled under pressure.
The truckers union threatened to protest. Automobile manufacturers objected to new vehicle recall rules  even though the best-selling new Indian cars failed a global crash test last year.
If you keep the penalties high, then it opens the room for negotiations with policemen on the ground and will increase corruption, said Naveen Gupta, secretary general of All India Motor Transport Congress. You are opening up a Pandoras box.
Fearing long court cases and police harassment, bystanders often hesitate to help accident victims
In one of the most talked about cases, Indians were outraged earlier this month that a court granted bail to Bollywood star Salman Khan , who was convicted of driving over five homeless people sleeping on a sidewalk in Mumbai in 2002, killing one of them. Khan had originally been sentenced to five years in prison.
The seamstress wife of Kabali Saravanan, a rickshaw driver, was killed by a speeding car in January while on her morning stroll along the edge of the ECR road. There is one law for the poor people and another for the rich in this country, said Saravanan. The driver of the car, he said, was an 18-year-old son of a rich leather businessman who lives in a beach house nearby. What justice can I realistically expect in this country?
The accuseds family declined to give an interview. Police said they have applied for suspension of his drivers licence, but the trial has not begun.
The East Coast Road is dotted with weekend holiday hotspots such as amusement parks, crocodile preserves, ancient temples and beach resorts. On Sundays, biker gangs from the city turn the road into a dragstrip.
As India tried to bolster inadequate infrastructure by building new highways across rural areas in the past decade, very little money has been invested in driver education, road behaviour, emergency response and trauma care. Many new roads do not have medians or reflectors.
The city partygoers think the road belongs to them. They drive as if there are no villages and no people on either side of the road, said Sumati Ravichandran, 35, a widow in Vada Nemmeli village. Her husband lay without any help for more than an hour. Medical experts say that half of those who died in road accidents could have been saved if they were admitted to a hospital in the first hour. Fearing long court cases and police harassment, bystanders often hesitate to help accident victims. Last year the supreme court ordered the government to pass a law to protect those who rush accident victims to the hospital. But the government has not delivered.
Saravanan said the courts cannot bring his wife back. And he has little hope for justice. They will use every trick they know to keep their son out of jail. But what about my seven-year-old daughter who has been left motherless? Saravanan said, sitting by his wifes motionless sewing machine.

Al-Shabaab gunmen attacked Kenyan police vehicles near Somalias border, injuring at least five officers and burning five cars, police said on Tuesday
Two officers were critically injured and three others sustained minor injuries in the attack in Garissa County, national Police Chief JK Boinnet said in a statement.
Garissa police commander Shadrack Maithya said at least 13 police officers who went missing during the attack have been accounted for. Two of the attackers were killed, he said.
The interior ministry said no police officials were killed, dismissing earlier accounts by two officials that several missing colleagues were believed to have been killed.
Kenyas Daily Nation newspaper reported that at least 20 police officers were feared dead. Police later said that in the confusion of the attacks that the worst was feared.
The injured officers were part of team of more than 20 officers traveling in three pick-up trucks to recover a firearm lost by one officer whose car had hit a landmine.
Boinnet said there was a heavy exchange of gunfire with the Islamic militants. Al-Shabaab, a Somali extremist group with links to al-Qaida, said on its radio station that it carried out the attack.
Al-Shabaab has carried out several attacks in Kenya in retaliation for Kenyas military involvement in Somalia.
In a separate incident on Tuesday morning, suspected al-Shabaab militants ambushed a vehicle carrying four passengers in Lafey in the northern county of Mandera, wounding at least one person before seizing the vehicle and driving it toward Somalia, according to an official.
The Kenyan military said late on Monday that it had killed seven al-Shabaab members inside Somalia. The group claimed responsibility for an assault last month on a college in Garissa town in which 148 students were killed , as well as a 2013 attack on a mall in the capital, Nairobi, in which at least 67 people were killed.

Marikana survivors sue Zuma to force release of official report into massacre
South African president has refused to say when he will publish report of official inquiry into the 2012 shooting of striking mineworkers by police

Survivors of the Marikana mine massacre are taking the South African president, Jacob Zuma, to court in an attempt to force the release of an official investigation into the killings.
The shootings by police in August 2012 left 34 mineworkers dead and more than 78 injured on what has been described as South Africas darkest day since the end of apartheid.
Zuma immediately announced a judicial commission of inquiry which duly sat for 293 days, hearing evidence including that police planted weapons on some of the dead bodies to fit a false narrative. The commission submitted its report to Zuma at the end of March.
But nearly two months later, after stating that he is still processing the report and will release it publicly in due course, the president has offered no clue as to when the potentially explosive contents will be made public .

In an attempt to force Zumas hand, injured and arrested victims of the police crackdown are turning to the courts. Last week a letter was sent to the presidency giving Zuma a deadline of 2pm on Sunday to announce when he would release Judge Ian Farlams report.
Andries Nkome, a lawyer representing the injured miners and Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, told South Africas Star newspaper : We have not received a response. We will now proceed with court papers. We are finalising them on Monday morning and by this afternoon we will have a case number and date.
The application is expected to be made in the high court in Johannesburg.
Nkome said he feared that should the reports publication be delayed any further, his clients would not have time to prepare for civil claims which lapse on 16 August. He wrote to Zuma: Such civil claims will be extinguished on August  due to the expiry of the three-year period within which such claims have to be instituted.
Nkome said his clients were also concerned by reports that Lieutenant-general Zukiswa Mbombo, the north-west province police commissioner, intends to retire at the end of the month. Mbombo was among those his clients held directly responsible for their physical and emotional scars.
He added: Our clients are of the firm view that her imminent departure is largely motivated, in whole or in part, by a deliberate desire to escape the obvious consequences of her criminal and/or otherwise unlawful conduct in connection with the Marikana massacre  The failure to release the report is also calculated to let her off the hook.
During her testimony, Mbombo conceded that police intervention at the mine in 2012 was a failure. She said there were mistakes in the police communication systems used on the day of the shooting.
Nkome said his clients noted that the national police commissioner, Gen Riah Phiyega, had been offered a different posting by Zuma. The feeling that my clients have [is that they] will not be able to hold them accountable because they will not be holding that office any more.
Civil claims will be extinguished on August  due to the expiry of the three-year period for such claims
Andries Nkome, lawyer
But on Monday Zumas office rejected Nkomes statements about Mbombo and Phiyega as false. Spokesperson Harold Maloka said : The president does not manage the careers of provincial police commissioners and as such has nothing to do with the reported retirement. Linking the president to this matter and insinuating that it could be linked to the processing of the Marikana report by the
president is malicious and mischievous.
He added: Mr Nkome also repeated the already refuted allegations that President Jacob Zuma has met the national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, and discussed an alternative deployment for her. Reports of the said meeting and alleged discussions are a complete fabrication and have been refuted by the presidency. Anyone who repeats these allegations is perpetuating a lie.
Among the questions raised by Marikana was the role of Zumas deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa , a director and shareholder of mine owner Lonmin at the time, and whether he encouraged the police to go on the offensive.
The Marikana Support Campaign, Right2Know Campaign and the SA History Archive are also stepping up pressure for the immediate release of the report. They have submitted a request under the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which gives the presidency 30 days to respond.
The groups said: It has been more than two and a half years since the Marikana massacre on 16 August 2012, and there have been no arrests made for the murder of the 34 miners who were killed while striking  The commission report and findings are crucial to determining the truth about what happened at Marikana, to hold those responsible for the massacre to account and to ensure that justice is served.

China has outlined a strategy to boost its naval reach and held a groundbreaking ceremony for two lighthouses in disputed waters, developments likely to escalate tensions in a region already jittery about Beijings maritime ambitions.
In a policy document issued by the State Council, the countrys cabinet, China vowed to increase its open seas protection, switching from air defence to both offence and defence, and criticised neighbours who take provocative actions on its reefs and islands.
China has been taking an increasingly assertive posture over the disputed waters of the South China Sea, where Beijing has engaged in land reclamation in the Spratly archipelago. Last week it criticised Washington after a US spy plane flew over areas near the reefs.
It has overlapping claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei in the South China Sea, through which $5tn (3.25tn) in ship-borne trade passes every year.
The defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said Chinas reclamation in the Spratlys was comparable with construction of homes and roads on the mainland. From the perspective of sovereignty, there is absolutely no difference, he told reporters.
Some countries with ulterior motives had unfairly characterised Chinas military presence and sensationalised the issue, he said. Surveillance in the region was increasingly common and China would continue to take necessary measures to respond.
In a thinly veiled reference to the US, the strategy paper said: Some external countries are also busy meddling in South China Sea affairs. A tiny few maintain constant close-in air and sea surveillance and reconnaissance against China.
It said Chinas air force would shift its focus from territorial air defence to both offence and defence, and to building airspace defences with stronger military capabilities.
China held a groundbreaking ceremony for the building of two lighthouses in the South China Sea, state media said, defying calls from the US and the Philippines for a freeze on such activity.
The foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the construction was to help maritime search and rescue, disaster relief, environmental protection and navigational security.
The strategy paper said the Peoples Liberation Armys nuclear force, known as the Second Artillery Corps, would strengthen its capabilities for deterrence and nuclear counterattack as well as medium- and long-range precision strikes.
China faces many complex maritime security threats and challenges and requires a navy that can carry out multifaceted missions and protect its sovereignty, said Wang Jin, a senior colonel.
The paper cited grave threats to Chinas cyber infrastructure, adding that China would hasten development of a cyber-military force.
Self-ruled Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, called on all South China Sea claimants to shelve their disagreements to enable talks on sharing resources before a conflict breaks out.
Japan will join a US-Australian military exercise for the first time, in a sign of growing security links between the three countries as tensions fester over Chinas moves.
All three nations have said they are concerned about freedom of movement through the South China Sea and its airspace.

Japan is bracing for a severe butter shortage that threatens cake making across the country, echoing last years dairy disaster that left supermarket shelves empty.
The Japan Dairy Association is warning that demand for butter will outstrip supply by more than 7,000 tonnes, prompting the government to ready emergency imports.
Related: Japan's exhausted cows cause butter shortage ahead of Christmas
Butter shortages last year provoked anguish for shoppers , especially in the runup to the Christmas cake-baking season, with immediate rationing introduced at every store that had a delivery.
The government plans to have butter imports on a scale sufficient for stable supply, said farming minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on Tuesday, adding that details of the emergency measure would be announced this week.
At the root of the problem is a wider dairy deficit that sees farmers prioritising the raw material for sales of liquid milk. Herds have been cut over recent decades as demand has dropped as the Japanese population ages.
Last years butter imports  7,000 tonnes in May and a further 3,000 tonnes in September  were the first time in years that Tokyo had raided foreign dairy markets.

A husband and wife stranded for two weeks in southern Californias high desert ate oranges and a pie and drank rainwater they collected in cups, but the 79-year-old man died before they were found, authorities said on Monday.
Off-road drivers found Dianna Bedwell, 68, and the body of her husband, Cecil Knutson, on Sunday afternoon near a Boy Scout camp on the Los Coyotes Indian reservation about 65 miles north-east of San Diego, sheriffs Lieutenant Ken Nelson said.
Bedwell was not able to tell authorities when her husband had died but an autopsy was being arranged, he said.
Bedwell told authorities they tried to take a shortcut and got lost in the rugged area. Nelson said their 2014 white Hyundai Sonata was obscured by trees and surrounded by brush, making it invisible to helicopters conducting aerial searches.
Knutsons body was near the car and Bedwell was inside the vehicle, he said.
They were really off the beaten path. We were really surprised that the vehicle they were driving, a sedan, was even able to get out there, he said. It was so rural that it took two weeks for even off-roaders to find them.
The family asked for privacy in a statement posted on a Facebook page established to help with the search. Please continue to keep the family in your prayers, it read.

Mike Sutter describes finding the couple missing in desert for two weeks.
Bedwells son, Robert Acosta, spoke briefly to the Orange County Register. Im just so concerned with my mom right now, he told the newspaper. To be in the middle of nowhere for two weeks is a lot given her age.
Bedwell remained in hospital and had not spoken with authorities beyond an initial 10-minute interview.
The husband and wife, who were diabetic, had last been seen on surveillance footage as they left the Valley View Casino in Valley Center, about 25 miles west of the wilderness camp, on 10 May. Authorities said the two were planning on going to their sons home in the Palm Springs area for a Mothers Day dinner but didnt show up there or return to their Orange county home in Fullerton.
Knutson and Bedwell were both retired school bus drivers and had been married for more than 25 years, the Register reported.
One of the men who found them described how it happened. Mike Sutter told NBC7 TV he was out driving four-wheel vehicles with friends and spotted a sedan parked far from paved roads.
The driver of our lead vehicle came down and said, You will not believe whats down there, and then he said, Bring water, Sutter said.
He added: Had we been there two days earlier maybe the old guy would be alive. Had we been here two days later, maybe both of them would be dead.
Bedwell was in the passenger seat of the car and was talking, but dehydrated, he said. She was a little confused at the time, didnt know if he was dead or not, was asking us to check him.
Sutter told the San Diego TV station: Its sad all the way around. Im hoping shes going to make a full recovery - but shes going to do it alone.

A fire at a care home in central China has left 38 people dead and six injured, officials said on Tuesday.
The fire broke out on Monday evening in an apartment building at a privately owned care home for elderly people in Pingdingshan, the official news agency Xinhua said.
Two of the injured were in critical condition in hospital, the work safety bureau of the central province of Henan said.
Pictures posted online showed a thick column of black smoke rising from behind a petrol station near the facility.
Search and rescue operations were continuing, Xinhua said, and the cause of the fire remained unclear.
Industrial accidents and fires are common in China, where enforcement of safety standards can be lax, with some property and business owners paying off corrupt officials to look the other way.
A nine-year-old boy was detained in February after a shopping mall inferno killed 17 people in Huidong , in the southern province of Guangdong. Police said that blaze was caused by a boy playing with fire at the mall.

Here is a bit more from immigration minister Peter Dutton on how to decide who is a terrorist risk. He is responding to a question on Khaled Sharrouf on AM.
This is why its important for there to be a ministerial discretion as opposed to an operation of law, so that if there was a blackletter provision which said that every(one) coming back including children would face revocation of their citizenship, I think that would be something people would want to debate.
What we have said here and again it operates in the UK, there is the ability for ministers to assess individually the cases that come before them. I am not going to comment individually on this matter (Sharrouf family) but people face very serious consequences when they return to this country if they have broken Australian law and if theyre in prescribed areas and dont have a reason for being there. If theyve been involved in terrorist activities they will face the full force of the law when they return to Australia.

Next cab off the rank is the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015 via health minister Sussan Ley. She will be speaking to media at 1.30pm today to explain the the deal which governs 5,000 community pharmacies and how they dispense PBS medicines and deliver pharmacy programs and services.
Its worth $19bn.
The government has been negotiating with the Pharmacy Guild  one of Canberras most powerful lobby groups  over the shape of the next community pharmacy agreement.
The fifth such agreement, which expires at the end of June, was worth $15.7bn over five years. In March the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) warned of persistent shortcomings in the Department of Healths record keeping during negotiations on the fifth agreement signed in 2010, including a failure to keep formal records of its meetings with the Pharmacy Guild.

Greg Hunt comes to the contentious use of native wood waste, which has been included as an eligible energy source as a way to meet the renewable energy target.
He says the bill reinstates native forest wood waste on the same conditions as were previously in place under Labor. It contains safeguards to ensure wood waste is harvested in a responsible way.
Hunt says that provision has been made because theres no evidence the practice is unsustainable.
This is about use of wood waste, its not about cutting down biomass to burn.
Bill to cut the Renewable Energy Target introduced
Environment minister Greg Hunt is introducing the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015.
The bill adjusts the Renewable Energy Target from 41,000 gigawatt hours of energy to be delivered from renewable sources by 2020 to 33000 gigawatt hours in the same time.
It will be maintained at 33,000 per annum 2021-2030.
The new target is achievable.
Medical Research Future Fund comes to parliament
Joe Hockey has just introduced the Medical Research Future Fund Bill 2015 into the lower house.

Thats one of the things to come out of this legislation.
Labor on citizenship: We kinda like it but we might not
Shalailah Medhora
Opposition leader Bill Shorten agrees with the stripping of dual citizenship in principle, but wants to see the legislation.
I dont believe that if youre a dual citizen and youre fighting for a terrorist organisation you should automatically assume that you can have the rights of Australian citizenship. But lets work through the detail.
He was less forthcoming on the proposal to strip sole citizens of their Australian nationality where they can apply for other citizenship, saying there is an important role for courts in interpreting the laws.
Just so you know the nature of plate-spinning job here at #politicslive, we also have today:
A number of senate estimates committees on today, including George Brandis appearing for the government.
Small biz whiz, Bruce Billson will be at the National Press Club talking budget measures.
The house is about to sit. In five minutes.

The budget bills will continue to be debated.

Its all coming. Strap yourself in.

Marriage equality is also under discussion after Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek have brought forward a bill to use the momentum of the Irish referendum.
Shorten is asked why the sudden sense of urgency around the debate, given there have been private members bills coming through the parliament for the past few years.
I voted for the legislation back in 2012 and last year I advised the Australian Christian Lobby at their forum that I believe it was entirely possible for someone of Christian views to also support marriage equality. Theres no doubt, though, that the Irish referendum on the weekend has again renewed debate in Australia and my view is that we should grab the opportunity to have the parliament introduce marriage equality and legalise it in Australia.
The prime minister was also asked, including the call from Alan Jones for marriage equality. Abbott noted Jones was a friend, whom he had known for 30 years, but repeated his line about the ability of people to have different views. Like his own family, for example. But then swung off to his small business policy, which is developing into a habit.
Im sure at that time wed have a very full and frank and candid and decent debate inside the party room but I do have to say that my absolute priority, the governments absolute priority right now and for the next few weeks will be helping small business.

Abbott: You don't get off scot free because you say I've seen the error of my ways
Tony Abbott is asked about the possibility of allowing foreign fighters back into the country for de-radicalization programs.
Q: If theres an opportunity to use their experience for preventing others from following that path, though, isnt that something worth considering?
Im absolutely delighted when a criminal comes out of jail, reformed and rehabilitated for that criminal or former criminal to go and spread a message of obeying the law to others who might be tempted to disobey the law. But Im afraid you dont get off scot-free just because you say Ive seen the error of my ways. If you commit serious crimes you should face serious punishment and as far as Im concerned that will always be the case.
23:32
Tony Abbott was asked about the return of Khaled Sharroufs wife Tara Nettleton and their five children.
Weve seen the beheadings, the crucifixions, the mass executions, the sexual slavery and people who are involved in that are doing evil things,evil things and criminal things and if criminals come within the reach of our law, whether theyre male or female, they will face the full severity of our law. Thats what the Australian public expect. Crime will be punished.

(Its going to be one of those days.)
Abbott notes the mans point, delivering a neat combination on the importance of small business providing economic security, which is just as important as economic security.
And then finishes up the press conference without answering any more details about the citizenship laws.
I should say he answered a fair few questions before that while I was publishing. I will bring to you shortly.
23:15
Morning politics: No one will be left stateless, says Dutton
Its a difficult day when you cant get through the corridor to the office for a government minister and media scrum.
The keeper of the message this morning is Peter Dutton. There are many questions for the immigration minister about the proposed citizenship laws and remember, no details of the laws - like a bill - have been released.
As far as we know, the new laws involve stripping dual nationals of their Australian citizenship at the ministers discretion, if the government suspects the person has been involved in terrorism. The minister said given the difficulty of getting evidence in overseas war-torn countries, his decision would be informed by Asio. The Abbott government has committed to this measure.
A second element, reflecting the UK laws, involves stripping Australians of their citizenship if they have the option to a second citizenship. This measure, which caused uproar in the cabinet discussion, will be considered in the discussion paper. Philip Ruddock was appointed as captain of that discussion yesterday, with Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.
The key points from the government are these:
Peter Dutton has promised no one would be left stateless as a result of the laws.
Dutton says Australia would be compelled constitutionally to take back dual nationals if their second citizenship had been stripped by another country first. That is, if a UK-Australian citizen was suspected of terror and the UK government got in first, Australia would be compelled to take that person back.
Thanks to Shalailah Medhora for this little snippet from Dutton on AM:
Q: If the boot was on the other foot, would we take them back?
Yes we would if they were an Australian citizen. Thats the constitutional obligation.
They would be rendered stateless, which we are not going to allow.
Already, the example delivered for debate through The Age is the case of Khaled Sharrouf and his wife and five children. This is the case where one of the children was pictured holding a severed head in the national daily.
Marriage equality is also front and centre today. Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek have been out already. Tony Abbott is taking questions now. My head is spinning.
However I will try to stay calm and deliver all the political news. Join me @gabriellechan and @mpbowers for the parliamentary sitting day.

A civil rights group has asked the FBI to investigate a threatening letter sent to a Phoenix mosque that was once a place of worship for gunmen in a shooting three weeks ago at a Texas cartoon contest featuring cartoons of the prophet Muhammad.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations says one of its lawyers spoke with an FBI agent about the letter that was mailed over the weekend to the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, where the gunmen, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, worshipped.
An identical letter also was sent to the Islamic Community Center of Tempe, said Kristy Sabbah, operations coordinator for the advocacy groups Arizona chapter.
Simpson and Soofi opened fire on 3 May in a Dallas suburb on an unarmed security officer stationed outside the contest, authorities said. The security guard was wounded in the leg before the gunmen were killed.
Simpson regularly attended the Phoenix mosque for about 10 years, but he quit a few months before the shooting. Soofi infrequently attended the mosque but stopped altogether about a year ago.
The letter opens with a reference to the pairs connection to the Phoenix mosque, threatens the lives of the mosques president and his family, and makes a disparaging comment about the prophet Muhammad.
FBI spokesman Anthony Farinacci said the agency is following up on the information it was given.
Usama Shami, president of Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, said the mosque gets threats from time to time but that the letter addressed to him contains threats that were more violent in nature.
We are not educating people to do violent acts, so why are we being held responsible in the minds of some people? Shami said.

A retired experimental physicist has put his 1988 Nobel prize medal up for auction with a reserve price of $325,000 (211,000).
The prize has been sitting on a shelf somewhere for the last 20 years, said 92-year-old Leon Lederman, who lives in eastern Idaho. I made a decision to sell it. It seems like a logical thing to do.
The online auction being conducted by Nate D Sanders Auctions closes on Thursday evening, but only when the final bid has stood unchallenged for half an hour.
Lederman won the Nobel prize for physics with two other scientists for discovering a subatomic particle called the muon neutrino. He used the prize money to buy a log cabin near the tiny town of Driggs in eastern Idaho as a vacation retreat.
Lederman retired from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, near Chicago in June 2012 and moved to Idaho. No one is more respected in the Fermilab community than Leon Lederman, said Christopher T Hill, a theoretical physicist. He could easily have won three or four Nobel prizes .
The auction house has sold two other Nobel prize medals, both earlier this year: the Nobel prize for economics won by Simon Kuznets in 1971 and the Nobel prize for chemistry won by Heinrich Wieland in 1927. Both those medals were offered for auction by descendants and sold for almost $400,000.
Laura Yntema, auction manager for Nate D Sanders Auctions, said research by the company found Ledermans medal was only the second to be auctioned while the winner was still alive.
Yntema said: It would just be an honour to own it. What these people have accomplished, its mindboggling how they advanced society.
Ledermans wife, Ellen, said they had enjoyed having the medal. Its really a wonderful thing. But its not really anything we need in our log cabin, she said.
For Leon Lederman, at 92, the details of the work that went into discovering a subatomic particle have become hazy over the decades. I dont have any real stories to tell about it, he said. I sit on my deck and look at the mountains.

Mediterranean-style diet may halve womb cancer risk, study suggests
Italian researchers claim women with a diet comprised mainly of nine key elements and only moderate alcohol are at a lower risk of developing the disease

A Mediterranean-style diet , already associated with good health and prevention of heart disease or a stroke , could also significantly cut the risk of womb cancer, an Italian study suggests.
Researchers who looked at the eating habits of over 5,000 women report that those who adhered most closely to food groups within such a diet lowered their risk of developing the disease by more than half. There were benefits too for those who stuck only slightly less strictly to the diets components.
The results are reported in the British Journal of Cancer but the charity Cancer Research UK , which owns it, was cautious, partly because the study was based on the womens memories of what they had eaten.
There about 8,500 new cases of womb cancer in the UK each year and rates have increased in the last 20 years.
The Italian team broke the Mediterranean diet down into nine elements  lots of vegetables, fruits and nuts, pulses, cereals and potatoes, fish, and monounsaturated fats; little meat and milk or other dairy products; and only moderate alcohol.
Those women who followed between seven and nine of the diets elements lowered their risk of womb cancer by 57%, whereas those who stuck to six had a risk reduction of 46% and those on five 34%.
There was no significant benefit for women whose food consumption included fewer components, a finding the researchers suggest supports the hypothesis that the diet as a whole is a stronger factor in reducing womb cancer risk than any single element within it.
Cristina Bosetti, of the IRCCS-Instituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri in Milan , who was lead author of the study, said: Our research shows the impact a healthy balanced diet could have on a womans risk of developing womb cancer.
This adds more weight to our understanding of how our everyday choices, like what we eat and how active we are, affects our risk of cancer.
Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, said: While we know that getting older and being overweight both increase a womans risk of womb cancer, the idea that a Mediterranean diet could help reduce the risk needs more research.
This is partly because the study was based on people remembering what they had eaten in the past, Sharp said. Cancer risk is affected by our age and our genes but a healthy lifestyle can also play a part in reducing the risk of some cancers.
Not smoking, keeping a healthy weight, being active, eating healthily and cutting down on alcohol helps to stack the odds in your favour.

What's it like to be hated by the Russian internet?
As online space becomes increasingly toxic, Afisha talks to four prominent figures about managing torrents of personal abuse

Facing death threats and streams of abusive messages, some Russians are becoming increasingly targeted by rising levels of online vitriol.
Trolling and internet abuse is a global problem, but each of these stories reveals how for some people working in Russia the digital sphere has become increasingly pernicious, with some saying it has become particularly bad since the annexation of Crimea .
Russian magazine Afisha asked four prominent figures  a lawyer, a former US ambassador to Russia , an activist and a journalist  about how they deal with regular aggression and harassment online.
Karina Orlova, radio host, Echo of Moscow :
The threats started last January after I recorded a show with journalist Maxim Shevchenko about the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo . We discussed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrovs reaction to a tweet by opposition activist Mikhail Khodorkovsky, where he had called on journalists to reprint the Mohammed cartoons, to show terrorists that western society doesnt fear them.
Kadyrov had called Khodorkovsky his personal enemy, and had threatened him.
I asked Shevchenko how Kadyrov could threaten a public figure with violence, and he said that Kadyrov is one of the finest men around. But I didnt leave it at that, and I pressed him further.
The very next day, I got my first threat on Facebook . It was waiting in the folder marked Other. I opened the message, read it, and deleted it.
Then I started getting messages regularly  and not just Ill get you, bitch, but detailed, thought-out threats.
For two months I didnt dwell on it: I thought it was the cost of working at Echo of Moscow  its the liberal media, and theres such an atmosphere of hatred in Russia these days.
Then opposition activist Boris Nemtsov was murdered, and I got another three death threats in early March. Suddenly, I realised that my life could be in real danger.
Before Nemtsovs murder, I treated the threats like white noise.
I spent a month in the United States where people would ask what is was like in Russia and Id say Oh well, theyre accusing us of being a fifth column, traitors to the nation, and I get threats in the mail. People were astonished.
The police opened a case into the threats against me on 26 March, after I spent a week talking to investigators. In all that time, the authorities never even asked me for my Facebook password.
I left a week later and I have no plans to return anytime soon.
We were dead men walking
Oleg Khabibrakhmanov, lawyer, Committee Against Torture
When you work in Chechnya and the republics chief of police says openly: Guys, I can no longer guarantee your safety, this, it seems to me, is an outright threat.
Our joint mobile team started operating there in 2009, after the death of journalist Natalia Estemirova  we took on the cases she had been investigating.
But our colleagues in Chechnya immediately made it clear that we were dead men walking. They didnt want to speak to us publicly. It was a nervous time, to put it mildly.
Of course, we tried to minimise the risks but no amount of iron doors, armoured vehicles or bulletproof vests will help if they really want to get to you.
In December last year, everything came apart.
We had written a letter to the attorney general asking him to look into the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov for illegal activity.
Persecution followed: the arson of our office, and attacks in the media  even the local human rights activists whod called us their colleagues suddenly spoke out sharply against us.
The most insulting thing is when the locals dont support us.When our office was burned down in Grozny, our neighbours only berated us with demands that we pay them to back for the damage.
Or, people write to me on Facebook to say things like: withdraw your troops from independent Chechnya, and well deal with Ramzan ourselves!
How do I find the strength? I dont know. Im certain that what I am doing is truly important: refusing to let Russia slip into totalitarianism and waging a war against the violation of human rights.
So I can say that despite the abuse, I honestly do enjoy my work.
We did investigate threats when I was ambassador, we took it very seriously, as did the Russian government.
One of the people who follows me confessed that he is paid to say nasty things: he said in a direct message to me  just so you know I personally admire you, but this is what I am paid to do. I took a photo of the message, and will release it someday.
There is no doubt that these attacks induce self-censorship. They want to chase me away from debates on Twitter . They are succeeding.
Occasionally they threaten my children

Michael McFaul, professor of political science, former US ambassador to Russia:
Online abuse has got much worse since the annexation of Crimea : the Russian-language debates on Twitter are much more personal.
Sometimes its just a few very unpleasant tweets. Sometimes its hundreds of Twitter messages saying the same thing, as if they are coordinated.
Occasionally people send threatening tweets to me about my physical security, they even threaten my children.
Ive moved back to the US to teach at Stanford University and its only got worse.
Now I have a policy that if someone insults me personally, I block them. If they say youre against free speech my response is you have the right to say whatever you want, but I have the right to read whatever I want.
If the Russian president wanted to reduce the hatred on Twitter, it would take him five minutes. I believe if he said something critical about this kind of activity it would have a giant effect.
The hatred and pain will pass
Rights activist Lena Klimova. Photograph: Screenshot/Facebook
Lena Klimova, LGBT activist, Children-404 :
I cant remember the first time someone wrote to insult me. It was probably in early 2013, when I was writing for [the news agency] Rosbalt. Readers commented beneath the article, or they found me on social networks: they told me I was a smart girl or dumb whore  I remember feeling hurt and confused.
But after I started running Children-404, an LGBT campaign group, I had to get used to it. After hearing the same words over and over for several years, they lose their meaning. Right now, Im attacked up to three times a day.
Ive been attacked by my own people too.
A lesbian once approached me and claimed that the authorities approved the anti-gay law (in 2013) because of my awareness-raising project Children-404. She said it used to be OK before, but now she cant even hold her girlfriends hand while walking down the street  and she blames me and other activists for this.
Recently I created a photo album  beautiful people and what they say about me  collecting threats I received online.
I would look at the photos of the people who had written terrible things about me, marvelling at the disparity between their appearance and their words. I made the album so others could enjoy the contrast.
If you find yourself confronted by hatred and in pain, its vital to remember that it will pass. It hurts at first, but then you move on. The main thing is not to become too cold. Just take the abuse and the praise as it comes. Do your thing and dont listen to anyone.

        <title>The forgotten land of colours: a trip through Iran's Persian Gulf</title>

This rock is a dragon, left here before the last great war.
Look at the top of the cliff. We call that rock Ferdowsi, as it looks from afar like the great poet.
Locals have stories for the rocks and cliffs that resemble birds, animals or mythical creatures. We grew up with our grandparents taking us on long walks and telling us about the rocks, says Ali Hormuzi, a 44-year-old resident.
Colourful mountains in shades of pink, red, purple and yellow overlook shorelines where turtles and flamingos roam or sunbathe.
This is Hormuz island in the Persian Gulf , the mostly forgotten land of colours in the Strait of Hormuz, 5km from the mainland, and southeast of Bandar Abbas, major port and capital of the province of Hormuzgan. The island was visited among others by Marco Polo. Ibn Battuta who came twice between 1330 and 1340, wrote that the islands city was fine and large...with magnificent bazaars.

The island was once settled by tens of thousands but its population has fallen below 10,000. Many have been unemployed since relations with Oman , an important trading partner, soured during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013).
Before, most men on the island were involved in trade with Khasab, a coastal city in Oman, says Ali. We would go in the morning and come back at night, never leaving the special reserved area for Iranians. I never saw the rest of Khasab despite going there for years. We just werent allowed in.

Locals would bring goods back to Hormuz, and then sell to traders in Bandar Abbas and Qeshm, a neighbouring Iranian island. Technically, it was smuggling, since it was all done under the rug, Ali explains.
Ali has worked hard to make ends meet since trading with Oman declined. Smuggling, qhachagh, is a word you hear all over the Persian Gulf islands, including Qeshm, from where I have travelled the 60km to Hormuz.
In some ways the islands are distinct from the rest of Iran . The wind-catchers  long, rectangular structures that cause airflow from the cooler undergrounds to the main rooms  in old homes are even more intricate than those found in Yazd, in the central desert. The cats resemble Siamese cats more than any feline you will find in Tehran, Isfahan or other mainland cities: one can only imagine they arrived on trade ships.
Unlike many parts of the country where women have shed traditional regional attire, the women of Qeshm and Hormuz mostly wear the colourful bandari pants, loose at the top and tight at the bottom with vibrant embroidery. A loose cotton chador with rich, bright flower patterns covers their heads.

But despite deep trade and cultural ties to India and Pakistan, locals know themselves to be Iranian first and foremost. Rice is cooked the particular Iranian way, steamed and then crisped at the bottom and along the edges - tahdig.
Local cuisine, especially on Qeshm, which sees most tourists, is plentiful and delicious, with seafood offered once the sun sets and residents get out by the water. Octopus, fish and shrimps are sauted with onions, tomatoes and local spices, and put into a sandwich with pickled cucumbers and cabbage. A local mix of ten spices and herbs including turmeric, cloves, dried rose petals and cinnamon makes meals exemplary.
In recent years, with the absence of hotels across the islands, people have begun turning their homes into restaurants and hostels. The most famous is nakhoda (captain) Amini, a sailor turned restaurateur in Tabl village , on Qeshm island. He has a dozen rooms, and theirs is a family business: his wife cooks, he manages, the children and grandchildren take care of affairs.
Guests are given a notebook to sign, and captain Amini says he now has a sack full of them, and plans to publish a book on his 20 years in the business. There are notes by people from as far away as Australia and Germany, and there is a family from Spain staying in the room next to me.
Traditionally, homes on the islands were all built with wind-catchers. But today, on Qeshm, Loft village is the only place where they can be found. Following an earthquake in 2005, the houses were rebuilt with cement and air-conditioning. Its an archaeological artefact, a woman tells me, pointing to her wind-catcher.
Lotf village is also known for its view of the Persian Gulf, and as we walk the village in the late afternoon, at least a dozen European tourists are waiting on a hill to watch the sunset. Where are the Iranians? I ask a resident. In the shopping malls, he answers.
With sanctions against Iran , smuggling has supplied the Dubai-style malls sprouting up. Most of the merchandise came that way, a storeowner in Qeshm city centre tells me.
Qeshm was declared a free trade zone under the presidency of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-1997), following a boom in Kish, another island in the province. The quest to create a business-friendly environment around glitzy island resorts in the Persian Gulf began under the Shah. After he built a villa on Kish, his regular trips were well publicised and led to the establishment of the Development Organisation of Kish.
Whole villages were razed to make way for large-scale projects. Following the 1979 Revolution and end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, the vision was carried forward despite tight economic sanctions. There are now many Iranian free trade zones including not just Kish and Qeshm but Chabahar in Sistan-Baluchistan province and most recently Arvand in Khuzestan.
What makes Qeshm different from Kish, known throughout Iran as a shoppers haven, is that many locals own stores and malls. But while locals that are savvy enough to jump ship can prosper, those wedded to the traditional pastoral life are pushed into deep poverty. In Kish, locals live in almost slum-like conditions beyond the high rises and shopping malls.
Naeem, an acquaintance in Qeshm, has been smuggling fuels like petrol to Dubai since he was 14. Its been lucrative, he tells me. I have a house, a car, and will be fully paying for my own wedding next week. Weddings on the island are seven-day affairs where the entire village is fed many times, so paying for ones own at 25 years of age is an achievement.
From 2014 to 2015, the number of petrol smugglers has dwindled. The profit used to be threefold, says Naeem, who is trying to get into tourism, while still transporting cargoes of clothing and foodstuffs from time to time. In summer of 2014, Naeem counted more than 100 petrol smugglers in one day. In 2015, I see less than half a dozen on the same road. The guards have cracked down hard, he says.
Toyota Hilux pickup trucks are invariably used, and as we drive along the coast, Naeem points out one after another: smuggling clothes, gas. On Naz island, off the coast of Qeshm, he takes a childs shirt from the water and puts it in the back of his pickup. Its brand new, thats alarming. Sometimes smuggling ships have to dump their load if they notice guards coming close. Ill take it to show the rest of the boys in the village, they have to be careful these days.

The origin of the Tuaregs trademark blue allichu veil is open to debate. In addition to giving protection from dust whipped up by desert winds, the veils are believed to prevent bad spirits from entering the body. The dye bleeds freely onto the skin, giving the wearer a blue-grey complexion

Both the cloth and the dye for the allichu veil come from Nigeria, and merchants in camel caravans travel a thousand miles south to the Nigerian towns of Tano and Sokoto to trade. A round trip can take six months, and for accompanying boys  some as young as ten  this is an important rite of passage. In times of peak trade in the 1920s and 1930s, the caravans had up to 20,000 camels

        <title>'Sorry mum, I’m still gay': Russian club helps parents accept sexual preference</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/russia-gay-rights-parents-group-lgbt</Link>

The parents club has a few rules: you can only speak if youre holding the navy dragon, a soft toy that has grown shabby in the clubs four-year existence; no interrupting is allowed; and phones must be switched off.
In an unassuming building in the centre of St Petersburg, families of Russian gay men and women gather each month, hoping for understanding and reconciliation.
Although the group is ostensibly for parents, they are far outnumbered by sons and daughters who have faced the difficulties of coming out in a homophobic country. Not one father is present.
Mum fell seriously ill recently and she allowed me to care for her, says Sergei. At least she didnt yell at me, like before: Stop that, [you] gay, get away from me, dont touch my things!
Seventeen people sit in the circle listening to him, wearing badges with handwritten names. Now that mum is no longer rejecting me, it means that she [has started to] care again, Sergei continues. For now though, he doesnt speak to his mother often.
Nina, a club veteran, asks for the dragon. She believes that, whatever the circumstances, talking helps: You have to explain to [your parents] that homosexuals are not the people they [are made out to be] on television. It will take them a long time to grasp what is going on. Everyone loves their kids, they will all understand.
Others immediately pipe up, recounting stories of parents who drove their children out of the house and sent them to be cured of their sexuality. Ok, not all, most, Nina corrects herself.
At these meetings, parents are encouraged to ask questions. A few people recommend films on LGBT themes, others yet to come out to their families ask the mothers in the group how best to go about it, and whether, in fact, it is worth it.
Related: Russian LGBT activists describe victimisation, repression  and hope
Only towards the end of the meeting does the toy dragon arrive in the hands of Sasha, a new arrival in St Petersburg.
I lived for a long time in a small village. There, the word gay is horrific, you can be grabbed on the street and killed for it, he said. All my relatives are old-fashioned types. I fear that if I tell my mum, she will blame herself. Did you go through this?
The group tells him that coming out in a small town is often more difficult.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993 after the fall of the Soviet Union, but rights groups say the situation for Russias gay population has become more dangerous.
In 2014 Human Rights Watch released a report documenting a rise in homophobic rhetoric and violence in Russia. It blamed a law passed in 2013 banning the promotion of non-traditional lifestyles among minors.
Its in this climate of fear that the mothers and their children meet. After two-and-a-half hours, they wrap up. One woman looks out of the window onto the street and says quietly: I dont want to go back out there.

Elena: Its not a death sentence
Elena became an activist out of the belief that the parents of LGBT children can find it helpful to talk to people who have been in the same boat.
Five years ago her son Dmitry came back from Japan, where he had been living for the past decade. She sensed instantly that he was troubled, but put it down to the difficulties of adapting to life back in Russia .
When Dmitry began his coming out talk with the words I want you to listen to me but this might frighten you, she says the possibility that her son might be gay had never occurred to her.
After our conversation, it was horrible, recalls Elena. It seemed that I was the only mother this had happened to. I tried not to show him how upset I was.
But I was brought to my senses and comforted by something Dmitry said: Now I feel much happier than when I was pretending.
Dmitry took her to a meeting of the parents club a year after coming out. She expected her son to lead her into a basement where gays live, she says, and when I saw that no one was dancing in tights, just decent people sitting around, I was quite surprised, she adds. Elena quickly became a club activist and she now helps other parents to accept their LGBT children.
They usually come to us with horror in their eyes. They look as if a tragedy has befallen their family. We ask them to relax and take a look at us: do we look downtrodden? Being a parent of an LGBT child  its not a death sentence, you can live with it quite happily.
Acceptance can take months, if not years, she says. But if parents keep coming to the club, they always make progress. You see mothers picking themselves up, smiling, being prepared to discuss the situation  that is already a good sign.
The mothers from the club believe that the problems with acceptance lie not with them, but with Russian society as a whole: if gay people are constantly being abused on television, why should someone suddenly believe a handful of people who take a different view?
Marina: The shock lasted 10 days
After the coming out blows your mind, the world as it was crumbles away, together with your plans for your childs future, says Marina Melnik, the founder of parents club: her son Roman told her he was gay six years ago. Every parent in that position goes through five stages of acceptance, she explains. In her case the shock lasted 10 days. Then came denial. Thats when you try to change their mind and prove that its all in their head.
She says it was painful process: I blamed myself for a long time. Did I not love him enough or did I love him too much? When he was a kid, maybe I bought him the wrong toy, an animal, not a car.
I was scared to tell the people around me that my son was gay. It was like that for almost a year
Marina
Six months after her sons admission, Marina became an activist. She founded the club with other mothers she met at an LGBT film festival, Side by Side . Four people came to the first meeting, she remembers, and none of them knew how to deal with their feelings of guilt.
After talking to other mothers, it finally came to me, Marina says. Thats when she went through the last stage, acceptance, followed by her own coming out of sorts: I was scared to tell the people around me [that my son was gay], she remembers. It was like that for almost a year.

Igor: No one talked about gay people
Igor finally managed to bring his mother to the club two years after coming out. Until then, talking to her about anything LGBT-related was difficult, he says.
No one talked about gay people in our family. Mum used the word blues (Russian slang for homosexual) and dad, fags, Igor recalls. He describes his parents as people with differing views: his dad is an orthodox patriot whose favourite political writer is Gregory Klimov , author of the aphorism: If all is not right between the legs, all is not right between the ears. His mother, on the other hand, isuninterested in politics and more liberal, in a cultural sense, he says.
When I was little, I asked my mum what sexual orientation was. Whos blue and whos not, she replied. At 11, he picked up from family conversations that gays were perverts who practise anal sex.
In September 2007, Igor left his native village in the Pskov region to go and study in St Petersburg and in October, he returned to visit his parents. Youre nervous about something, have you fallen in love? his mother asked him. Yes Igor answered, truthfully. With a man or a woman? she probed. With a man, as it turned out. Both of them cried but they soon calmed down and a week later, Igor went back to St Petersburg. It was not long before his father heard the news.
Dad was breaking dishes, slamming doors, Igor says.
Igor told a priest in confession that he was in love with a young man and was advised to cure the sickness in his soul and repent: but Igor argued back. Officially, he absolved me of my sins but we were both clearly dissatisfied with the outcome. It was after this I lost faith in the church. That was my last communion and confession and I am feeling all right, he laughs.
Igor is convinced that if his mother watched less television, lived with him in St Petersburg and talked to other parents from the club, she would soon accept him fully. No precise statistics exist, but the clubs activists believe that for every LGBT person accepted by their family, another five are rejected.
Dmitry: Sorry mum, but Im still gay
Dmitry is one of these five. He first came out when he was 18. Assuming that everything would go smoothly, he didnt prepare for the conversation. At first, his mother reacted calmly but a few hours later, she started to cry.
She shouted about HIV and how I would never have children, he remembers. From then on, Dmitry decided not to talk to his mother about his personal life. Gradually, she seemed to forget about her sons sexuality and their relationship improved.
But Dmitry couldnt rid himself of the feeling that his mother didnt understand him. So three years later, he decided to try again. He prepared better this time, taking brochures from the LGBT group. But his opening gambit  Sorry mum, but Im still gay  set off another argument.

Unsure of what to do next, he went to the parents club, where he was advised to show his mother the film Prayers for Bobby , about a gay man who kills himself because his religious parents refused to accept him.
I watched it myself first and cried, it was so painful, Dmitry says. Then I watched it with mum but I didnt understand her reaction. The parents lost their son, she said, because they didnt believe in God or pray enough.
Religious icons soon started appearing in their flat, together with images of the Virgin Mary, Orthodox magazines and brochures about monasteries. They hadnt spoken to each other for a long time, Dmitry says, and it was clear his mother had decided the Church was the only way to save him.
I arrived home one day and could already smell burning incense from the hallway, he says. What was the point, I asked her. In reply, she talked of evil influences, clouding of souls and false paths. Our flat started to resemble a church gift shop. The arguments grew more frequent and after one such bust-up, his mother decided to move to a friends.

Dmitry will not try his luck a third time. He tells his mother that he has a girlfriend, despite seeing his partner Grigory for over two years now.
It takes a lot of energy to live a double life: when Dmitrys mother calls him and asks him about his personal life, he answers truthfully  but substitutes the name Grigory with Irina.
Parents club dont approve of stories like mine. They suggested I bring my mother along but Im scared of what her reaction would be, says Dmitry. If she believes that religion helped me, so be it. The main thing is that mum is happy.

Why did the Taliban go to Tehran?
In the fight against Isis, the Taliban has softened its approach toward Iran and Shia groups, says veteran Afghan journalist

Reports of an official Taliban delegations clandestine visit to Iran this week raised eyebrows in both Kabul and Tehran: why would Iran, a Shia powerhouse involved in proxy wars with several Sunni states and sectarian groups in the Middle East, host a radical Sunni militant group on its soil?
The two erstwhile foes once came to the brink of a full-blown war against each other. However, when it comes to regional politicking the two have found much in common, including their fear of the spread of the Islamic State influence in the region.
In 1998, Tehran deployed more than 70,000 forces along the Afghan border in a clear show of military might and threatened to invade Afghanistan and avenge the deaths of at least eight Iranian diplomats at the hands of Taliban in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif that year. Iranian generals predicted they would topple the Taliban regime within 24 hours, but the situation was defused when the United Nations interfered.
Then, when the US-led coalition forces ousted the Taliban in late 2001 for harboring Osama bin Laden , the mastermind of attacks on 11 September 2001, Iran tacitly supported the operation.
However, more than a decade later, the two archrivals seem to be willing to coexist in the face of the growing threat posed by Isis. This dovetails with another shared goal: pushing the United States and its western allies out of Afghanistan.
While Tehran may not wish to see a return of a Taliban government on its eastern border, Iranian officials would not have a problem seeing the Taliban becoming part of the current western-backed Kabul administration through a much-awaited reconciliation.
Related: The price of an education for Afghan refugees in Iran
It is for this reason that a delegation of Taliban, led by Mohammad Tayyab Agha, visited Iran on Monday and held talks with Iranian leaders. While officials in Tehran denied the visit , Iranian newspapers and Taliban confirmed that the delegation was comprised of Taliban members from their political bureau in Qatar. A Taliban statement said that the delegation discussed a number of issues with Iranian officials, including the current situation in Afghanistan, regional and Islamic world issues, and the condition of Afghan refugees in Iran.
Mondays visit was not the first time a Taliban delegation has visited Iran. They have already been to the country twice. Two years ago, they even attended an Islamic vigilance conference hosted by Iran , according to state media reports.
Given the ideological differences between the two, this tepid friendship between Iran and the Taliban can be explained through regional rivalries and the emergence of Isis in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Isis leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi has proclaimed himself as a Caliph of all Muslims, the same title that the one-eyed Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, claimed nearly two decades ago.
Since last fall, the Taliban and a small number of militants have pledged their allegiance to al Baghdadi and raised black Isis flags during several armed skirmishes inside Afghanistan. Although the Taliban themselves repeatedly targeted civilians in the past, its spokesmen have condemned Isis for carrying out a deadly attack in eastern Afghanistan last month that left at least 35 people dead.
Although both groups rival one another in brutal attacks, the Taliban has called on Isis to avoid extremism in their war in the Middle East, a plea that al Baghdadi mocked. He reportedly called Mullah Omar a fool and illiterate warlord undeserving of a religious title.
Similarly, Iran has been fighting Isis forces through its militia groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen . Tehran has reportedly sent more than 1,000 military advisers to Iraq, conducted airstrikes against Isis targets, and has spent more than $1b dollars in military aid to Iraq. The last thing Tehran wants is an Isis presence inside Afghanistan, from where the militants could attack targets inside Iran.

An Iran-Taliban alliance would not only serve as deterrence vis--vis Isis, it could also act as a bargaining chip in Tehrans relations with the new government in Kabul, whose recent signals of support for Saudi Arabias military strikes against Shia factions in Yemen did not go unnoticed. Supporting a fundamental Sunni group could also show that Tehran is not in an all-out-war against Sunni Muslims.
Sectarian violence
During the Taliban regime in the late 1990s, they were accused of ethnic cleansing by massacring Hazaras, a Shia minority ethnic group in Afghanistan, and of burning their villages as they advanced towards northern regions of the country. However, since its ouster, the Taliban has largely avoided sectarian and ethnic undertones in their narratives.
In fact, the Taliban have recently publicly condemned sectarian violence against Shia. When five civilians were reportedly kidnapped and killed in a central region of the country on 17 April, the local officials blamed the Taliban for the killing. However, a Taliban statement rejected the claim a day later, saying the Kabul administration and certain media were stoking sectarian violence. It said the Taliban militants on the ground had tried to find and rescue our Hazara countrymen, but they were killed before they succeeded.
Additionally, when 31 Hazara passengers were kidnapped on Kabul-Kandahar highway earlier this year (19 were released in an apparent prisoner swap later) the Taliban vehemently denied being behind the abduction. A Taliban statement last month even said that their militants diverted a convoy of Hazaras to protect them from crossfire between their fighters and government forces in the southern region.
Although it is difficult to prove that the recent spate of attacks against Hazaras and Shia are the work of Isis associates or Taliban splinter groups operating without the orders of their leadership, the Talibans public positions on the events are noteworthy.
In past months, the Taliban appears to be softening its formerly hostile position towards both Iran and Shia minorities.
When a Saudi Arabia-led coalition began airstrikes against the Houthis, an Iran-backed Shia group in Yemen, in late March, most Sunni Islamic states, including the Afghan government , supported the operation. Hezi Islami, an insurgent group led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar that has separately waged war against the Kabul administration, not only supported intervention, but showed readiness to send fighters in support of the Saudi-led operation. However, despite Saudi Arabia being one of the three countries that formally recognized the Taliban regime in 1990s, the Taliban has yet to declare its official position regarding the war in Yemen.
While a public show of cooperation is new for Iran and the Taliban, the two have covertly cooperated in the past. In 2007, Afghan border police officials in the western province of Herat showed this reporter confiscated land mines with clear Iranian trademarks intended for the Taliban in Afghanistan. They blamed Iran for training Taliban near the Iranian holy city of Mashhad .
The same year, Nato officials accused Iran of supplying Taliban with armor-piercing bombs, or explosively formed projectiles, the same weapons that Iran was accused of providing to Iraqi insurgents fighting against US forces. Both sides denied the allegations.
The public rapprochements concerning Iran-Taliban relations proves one thing: when faced with a common enemy  in this case Isis  even archrivals like Iran and the Taliban, which ascribe to opposing radical ideologies, can put aside their sectarian differences for the sake of national and group interests.

The little-seen older brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has surfaced in London, attending concerts by Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall.
A man identified as Kim Jong-chul was filmed by Japanese TV crews at the guitarists concert on Thursday evening.
Broadcaster TBS filmed Kim , wearing dark sunglasses and clad in a leather jacket, getting out of a people carrier outside the central London venue, flanked by suited men who appeared to be North Korean officials.
More TBS footage shows the 33-year-old applauding in the crowd and then leaving the venue via a corridor. How was the concert? asked the TBS reporter, in response to which one of Kims entourage places a hand over the camera lens.
The NK News website cited an anonymous source who said Kim saw Clapton play on both Wednesday and Thursday, sitting near the stage.
He wasnt so distinctive, NK News quoted the source as saying. But the obviously older guy next to him was clearly neither a typical Clapton fan or dressed for a gig.
According to NK News, Japanese and South Korean media learned of Kims appearance at the Wednesday concert and so arrived in force the next day.
South Korean diplomats in London confirmed that the concert-goer was indeed Kim Jong-chul, and that the fervent Clapton fan had attended the concert on both nights.
The diplomats said he had been given substantial support by the North Korean embassy in London, who organised transport to and from the Royal Albert Hall, but the leaders brother had stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, rather than at the embassy in a semi-detached house in Ealing .
Kim Jong-chul is the middle of the three sons of North Koreas late leader, Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011. The eldest of the trio, Kim Jong-nam, 44, who has a different mother to the other siblings, was seen as most likely to succeed as leader before an incident in 2001 when he tried to enter Japan on a false passport, supposedly to visit Disneyland.
While Kim Jong-chul has previously held some mid-level official positions, he has kept a low profile under the rule of his younger brother.
North Korea is officially run on a highly nationalistic and insular philosophy of self-reliance, known as juche. But top-ranking citizens have previously shown a taste for foreign culture. Kim Jong-il was well know for his love of foreign cuisine and US cinema, while his youngest son is a basketball fan who has repeatedly met former NBA star Dennis Rodman .
According to the Financial Times in 2008 , North Korea had formally invited Clapton to play in the country. The overtures reportedly followed a concert in Pyongyang by the New York Philharmonic.

At least 100 women were brutally attacked in the South Kivu province of Congo last week  yet another atrocity amid more than a decade of sexual violence that has earned the region the title rape capital of the world.
Many of the victims are being treated at a free hospital run by Denis Mukwege, a leading Congolese gynaecologist and rights activist who has been working in the region for the past 18 years. His Panzi hospital is in Bukavu, the epicentre of the ongoing conflict .
This type of violence has little to do with sex and much more with power through a sort of terrorism
Denis Mukwege
In a region critically lacking basic healthcare, Mukwege, an expert in reconstructive surgeries for rape victims, has saved the lives of more than 40,000 women  the majority of them victims of brutal gang rapes by soldiers and militias that started during the second Congo war in 1998, and have continued to the present day.
In 2014 Mukwege was the recipient of the EUs highest human rights award, the Sakharov Prize .
Having treated women at different thresholds of psychological and physical suffering, Mukwege has been a prime witness to rape used as a weapon of war.
It is a method of torture. It is a way to terrorise the population. When I see some of the injuries on the women and children, I realise this type of violence has little to do with sex and much more with power through a sort of terrorism, says Mukwege.
According to a report, 48 women were raped every hour in Congo during the height of the conflict in 2006-7. Recent reports from local health centres in South Kivu claim that an estimated 40 women continue to experience sexual violence every day.

Broken promises
The most difficult reality for us is when we help a woman give birth to a daughter, born as a result of rape, and then years later we have to treat the daughter who is also raped. These are very difficult and painful moments for the whole medical team, explains Mukwege.
This year on 8 March, the UN commemorated 20 years of the Beijing Declaration, still deemed the most progressive blueprint for advancing womens rights across the world. The event also marked the beginning of a new platform for action, called Beijing +20. However, despite politicians reconvening to renew commitments to gender equality, most states have fallen woefully short of promises made in 1995.
The International Federation of Human Rights reports that due to ineffective domestic laws and weak international conventions, rape and other crimes of sexual violence continue to be committed on a massive scale, particularly in conflict situations. The report cites Congo as a prime example of colossal and continued failure to protect.
For most Congolese women, reporting rape is unthinkable. Aside from social stigmatisation of victims, going to a police station could put them at greater danger. Perpetual violence against women has eroded whole communities, with no effective social or legal remedies.
Mukwege insists that the domestic laws are present, they are simply not used. Many of the perpetrators occupy high-ranking positions in the government and armed forces. Not bringing them to justice has institutionalised rape.
He believes that ignorance and desensitisation have created a deep divide between the genders.
The concept of equality begins in childrens minds with the very first contact. We usually tell girls to dress a certain way and instill fear in them that if they dont, they might be attacked. But we dont tell boys about how to behave and consequences of bad behavior, he says.

Educating men
It is this dearth of medical infrastructure and collective social responsibility for the safety of women that compelled Mukwege to fight for change. An obstetrician by training, he entered the medical profession with the desire to aid the formation of life. But witnessing his first gang rape victim made him realise that there were existing lives that needed to be saved and sustained.
Alongside his medical work, he has campaigned for Congolese womens rights at national and international levels. But he believes change does not simply mean protecting women.
Movements geared towards educating men about sexual violence have emerged in recent years in Congo. Along with psycho-social support for victims of rape, Mukwege advocates help for those men who have left the armed forces, helping to reintegrate them into their communities.
Demobilisation is a psychological process that requires long-term counselling, he says.

It is obvious that when a young boy is recruited and learns to rape, kill and destroy women, we need to integrate him. Shedding the uniform does not mean that this ingrained mentality has changed, says Mukwege.
Peace in Congo, Mukwege contends, will require rehabilitating the men and reinforcing the voices of women. He has organised groups where men and boys discuss the violence that has pervaded their societies, while women gather to demand justice and reparations.
If you destroy wombs, there will be no children and no future, he says.
For Mukwege, it is simply a matter of saving the common humanity of Congo.

Ukraine fears spread of separatist conflict amid hostility towards Kiev
Attacks in Odessa and Kharkiv suggest instability is extending across the country, fuelled by rising inflation and rocketing utility prices

On a bright Sunday morning in February, Ihor Rassokha was at a pro-Ukraine rally in Kharkhiv with a friend, the local scientist Igor Tolmachov.
Suddenly there was an explosion , Rossokha recalled, sounding like a firecracker at a football match. Everyone dropped to the ground but a splinter hit Tolmachov in the heart. He managed to run a few metres before falling over.
I tried to resuscitate him although I could see the splinter sticking out of his chest, said Rassokha, who only realised his friend was dead when the ambulance crews refused to load the body. Tolmachov was one of four people, including a police officer and a 15-year-old boy, killed that day. Dozens of others were injured.

The attack, which took place on the day marked by Orthodox believers as Forgiveness Sunday, was the most deadly of dozens of similar explosions in the Ukrainian cities of Kharkhiv and Odessa in recent months.
The violence has raised fears that the instability of the separatist war, largely contained to a pocket of eastern Ukraine , is spreading across the country.
Both Odessa and Kharkhiv are deeply divided along political lines, with large numbers opposed to the government in Kiev and in favour of closer ties with Moscow. Kharkhiv has seen an influx of at least 150,000 refugees from fighting in the east and is just a few miles from the Russian border. The Black Sea port of Odessa, which has deep historical and cultural ties with its neighbour, saw over 40 pro-Moscow activists killed during street battles last May.
Attacks in the two big cities have been directed at pro-Ukraine groups and the military, with targets including the premises of volunteer organisations, bars frequented by activists, military bases, banks, railway lines and even a flagpole.
Though there have been more than 40 blasts since last autumn, only five deaths have been confirmed. The bombers, who use crude explosive devices, seem to want to avoid large loss of life. Instead, they appear intent on destabilising the fragile political situation, intimidating pro-Ukraine groups and creating an atmosphere of fear.
The frequency of attacks has fallen recently after a recent wave of arrests by Ukrainian security services. But on 13 May a bomb exploded on a railway line on the outskirts of Odessa, narrowly missing an approaching passenger train.
Sometimes you can sense the fear in the air  sometimes you feel something is coming; you feel the danger, said Kateryna Roshchyna, who works for an NGO in Kharkhiv.
Responsibility for some of the blasts has been claimed by a shadowy group calling itself the Kharkhiv Partisans, which issues statements on YouTube and appears to be based in Russia. But the identity of those behind most of the attacks is unclear.
Ukrainian security services claim to have arrested attackers and seized weapons and bomb-making equipment. They have also released videos of confessions by alleged terrorists, who say they were paid for their services.
The countrys interior minister, Arsen Avakov, has published a diary purportedly kept by a bomber in Odessa. The long and rambling text catalogues the amateur efforts of one terrorist cell, and openly discusses payments.
A 3 March entry describes the moments after one bomb was planted: Igor is nervous and talking more than usual. Zhenya is also nervous and farting. I am shaking and munching on chocolate Every second we expect the explosion and every second our hopes are fading and then: Bo-Boom. Hooray! We can relax. We havent caused significant damage, but we have shown there are people who care about the fate of Odessa.
Odessans joke that the person used to carry this bomb was given a device set to Moscow time  an hour ahead
Pro-Ukraine activists believe the terrorists are financed and organised by Moscows security services, which run training camps in Russia and the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering western Ukraine. They say attacks are orchestrated from the Kremlin-backed self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.
They want to destabilise the region and show that the authorities cannot maintain security  we are fighting with Putin and the Kremlin, said Dmitry Gumenyuk head of Odessas Maidan self-defence group. He retold a local joke about a man who is believed to have been killed when a bomb he was planting went off: Odessans joke that the person used to carry this bomb was given a device set to Moscow time  an hour ahead!

An organisation known as Oberig, has been established in Odessa to collect information on terrorists and pressure the local security services to act. Members claim that the going rate to plant a bomb is $2,000, and that 90% of pro-Russia activists work for cash.
Pro-Russia political groups have been pushed out of public life with many activists fleeing Ukraine
Instability is not only linked to the explosions. Activists also point to political initiatives apparently sponsored from Russia. A group calling itself the Bessarabian Rada , claiming to represent a historical territory encompassing much of south-west Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova, held a founding meeting in Odessa recently. Their website was registered in Russia.
Three weeks later, Ukrainian security forces arrested 20 people allegedly planning to announce the formation of a Bessarabian Republic as a political entity.
Whatever Russias role, few deny that hostility towards the government in Kiev is growing in both Odessa and Kharkhiv, fuelled by a sharp economic downturn, rising inflation and rocketing utility prices. Pro-Russia political groups have been pushed out of public life with many activists fleeing Ukraine out of fear of arrest, or assault. Posters calling on people to turn in separatists hang prominently in cities in southern and eastern Ukraine.
When people with radical opinions are not allowed to speak of course they go underground, said Artyom Buzila, a pro-Russia journalist in Odessa who was briefly detained by Ukrainian security forces last month.
No one in either Kharkhiv or Odessa think the explosions are likely to cease any time soon, pointing out that the relatively small death toll is only down to good fortune: bombs have been placed in residential areas and near gas pipes, and several were detonated in the early evening. Many draw comparisons with the sort of day-to-day terrorism associated with living in Israel.
Ukrainian poet Boris Khersonsky, whose own flat has been bombed, recounted a recent dinner with friends in Odessa. The restaurant was full when suddenly there was the sound of what was obviously an explosion two blocks away. People raised their eyes, looked around and then went back to their food. Nobody ran away, there was no panic. We have already got used to it, he said.

It appears that Pyongyang has been periscoped for the first time.
Coleen Baik, a designer who previously worked at Twitter, has been using the live video streaming tool during a trip to North Korea as part of the Women Cross DMZ peace movement .
The group of 30 women, including leading rights activist Gloria Steinem and nobel laureates Leymah Gbowe and Mairead Maguire, plan to cross from North Korea to South Korea at the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ).

But their plans appear to have hit a stumbling block as theyre yet to have formal approval from Seoul to cross back in to the South at Panmunjom  one of the most fortified borders in the world due to ongoing hostilities between the two countries .
Speaking from Pyongyang on Tuesday organiser Christine Ahn said the group may have to change the route so they cross at Kaesong, a border used by business and civilians.
We have approval from both governments to cross the DMZ, but we dont know precisely where, she said.
Korean-American peace activist Ahn says that border crossing has a symbolic value for the group who hope their march will help break the impasse and stalemate between the two countries whove technically been at war since 1953.

Baik told North Korea Tech that she was streaming via the Koryolink 3G cellular service. She paid $250 (160) for the basic service and $450 for 2GB of data. Its expensive but actually not as much as I expected, she said.
The ability to live stream from Pyongyang has been available since the mobile internet arrived in 2013 , but the recent launch of apps like Periscope and competitor Meerkat have made it much easier.
It raises interesting questions for the guides that escort tourists around the city. Typically, almost everything on a guided tour can be photographed, but tourists are sometimes requested to delete sensitive images .
With live streaming, the image is immediately broadcast out of the country and cant be edited  its too late to take it back.

How Nigeria turned a corner against Boko Haram
After five years of insurgency, the military has made significant gains on the battlefield. But now the battle for peace must begin, says Max Siollun

The Nigerian army has recaptured all of the major towns occupied by Boko Haram in recent months, and rescued nearly 1,000 kidnapped women and children. It claims to have destroyed several of the militants camps , pursued the group into the Sambisa forest and arrested those suspected of supplying them with food and fuel .
Isolated attacks have continued, but after more than five years of torment, the insurgents seem to have been transformed from the hunters to the hunted. It is now Boko Haram fighters who are fleeing, with the army in pursuit. Recently released footage shows militants running away in disarray from aerial bombardments by the Nigerian air force.
Only five months ago Boko Haram was wreaking havoc in the north east, seemingly able to launch attacks at will after having captured an area about the same size as Belgium.
A failure to stop militants played a part in the political downfall of Goodluck Jonathan, the first Nigerian president to lose an election, amid promises by his challenger Muhammadu Buhari to crush the insurgency.
Relations between the previous commander and his men were so poor that enraged troops opened fire on him
Yet even before Buharis inauguration, the military seems to have turned a corner in its fight against Boko Haram .
The recent rescue of hundreds of women and children was a watershed. Although hostages have escaped from Boko Haram captivity before, they did so of their own volition. This was the first time that the army had rescued hostages in significant numbers. Some of the women claimed that their former captors had complained of battle fatigue and of being under-equipped  complaints formerly heard from soldiers.
Also it seems Boko Harams leader Abubakar Shekau has been uncharacteristically quiet of late  not having released any of his customary propaganda videos since March.
After failing for so long, how has the army managed this turnaround? Although many factors played a part, perhaps the most obvious has been a ruthless crackdown on dissent within the military itself.
After being stung by reports that some soldiers had refused to fight Boko Haram or had tactically retreated from battle, chief of army staff Lt-General Kenneth Minimah ordered that deserters be court-martialled. More than 60 were sentenced to death . He rejected complaints about being poorly equipped, arguing that  It is the soldier that fights, not the equipment .

His tough tactics appear to have worked. Soldiers now say they would rather fight Boko Haram, that confront  that mad man [Minimah] .
A change of command also helped. Since taking charge of the division in charge of combatting Boko Haram less than five months ago, Major-General Lamidi Adeosun has provided charismatic leadership and is respected by his men  unlike his predecessors.
Relations between the former commander and his men were so poor that enraged troops opened fire on him last May, blaming him for a botched night-time operation that led to several of their colleagues being killed.
In contrast, Adeosun personally led his men into battle in a recent operation . The new commander has quietly got on with the job with little fanfare, implementing more aggressive tactics to take the fight to the enemy.
But the armys gains on the battlefield have inadvertently exposed the magnitude of the task still ahead. The fact that the military rescued nearly 1,000 women and children and yet not one of the nearly 300 kidnapped Chibok teenagers was among them demonstrates just how many people are being held.
The rescued hostages, including children fathered by Boko Haram insurgents, may struggle to be accepted
An intermediary who entered Boko Harams camp last year to negotiate the Chibok girls release was shocked to find their presence dwarfed by other captives . The teenagers may represent less than 10% of the total number of hostages held by the militants, amid estimates that more than 3,000 other teenagers have been kidnapped.
Boko Haram kidnaps, rapes, and impregnates female abductees not just to sow terror but also to replenish its ranks . More than 200 of the women recently rescued are pregnant , and several of the rescued children were born and raised in Boko Harams stronghold in the Sambisa forest.
It is clear that the Islamic militants will not just disappear, no matter how successful the army is militarily. There is no magic bullet that will end the insurgency and nothing short of a comprehensive armistice deal will neutralise its ability to give the army a bloody nose from time to time.
Military force is the means, but not the end. All it can do is buy enough breathing room for the government to devise comprehensive solutions. For that, eyes will turn to Buharis new government taking office on 29 May.
The last time the army inflicted heavy losses on Boko Haram, in 2009, the government relaxed and thought the conflict was over. The militants laid low, re-armed, regrouped, and returned more deadly than before. The government must learn from this missed opportunity.
The conflict is entering a phase where it needs to be fought not just with bombs and guns, but also by addressing the consequences of the insurgency. Those raped or rendered refugees or orphans by Boko Haram need rehabilitation and support. The rescued hostages, including children fathered by insurgents, may not be accepted back in their communities. The groups indoctrination was so effective that some of the women captives opened fire on the soldiers who came to free them . Some who escaped captivity in the past were sent away by their families in order to escape stigmatisation.
Also, even if Boko Haram agrees to lay down its weapons, the level of hostility towards the group means that security forces may have to protect former insurgents from score-settling attacks by their victims.
Nigeria may win the war, but could find that winning the peace will require different tactics.

Herds of one of Central Asias most symbolic animals, the saiga antelope, are declining rapidly  and no one knows why.
The Kazakh department for emergency situations says more than 19,000 saiga carcasses have now been buried in the countrys Qostanai region, though unofficial reports on 20 May suggested the number of dead animals may already exceed 30,000.
Its shaping up to be a complete catastrophe, says EJ Milner-Gulland, a UK-based academic who heads the Saiga Conservation Alliance , a network of conservationists working to protect the antelope.
Im afraid the animals are still dying and we are not actually getting a final number yet, she added. Im expecting that number to go up quite substantially in the coming days.
The saiga, with its distinctive bulging eyes, tubular snout and spiralled horns, is as distinctive as it is endangered. Conservationists estimate there are 260,000 saigas in Central Asia, including 200,000 in west-central Kazakhstan .
The recent animal deaths already represents the biggest decline of the species in recent history.
Bacteria
Senior officials from Kazakhstans agriculture ministry and the regional governor visited the area this week to coordinate a response. So far, theyre baffled by whats causing the deaths.
Officials say the carcasses bear no wounds or other signs of trauma that would indicate mass poaching  a problem in past efforts to maintain healthy saiga populations. Instead, they say the culprit is likely the Pasteurella bacteria  a naturally occurring bacteria that is carried in animals mouths and nasal passages.
Milner-Gulland says that while guess the cause of death may indeed be Pasteurella, its probably not the whole story. Pasteurella normally kills only weaker animals that have already been stressed or sickened by something else.
The fact that were getting positive reports of Pasteurella doesnt mean the bacterium is the underlying reason the animals are dying, she says. [The bacteria] is there naturally.
Milner-Gulland is reluctant to speculate on the cause of death but says current evidence points to a highly infectious disease.

Russian rockets
This explanation is not likely to satisfy activists like Musaghali Duambekov of the Kazakh-based environmental movement Anti-Heptyl , a name that references compounds used in rocket fuel.
His group traces many of the countrys environmental problems to the highly toxic fuels used by Russian rockets launched from Kazakhstans Baikonur Cosmodrome .
I think the authorities [in Kazakhstan] are hiding the real causes of the loss of the large numbers of saiga antelope every year, he says.
As an active member of the Anti-Heptyl movement, which has been against the [Russian] Proton rocket launches, I think the situation, among other things, is connected to the rockets, as large parts of Kazakhstan are being affected by poisonous elements on a regular basis, Duambekov says.
Several Russian Proton-M rockets in recent years have exploded over Kazakhstan after lifting off from Baikonur, sparking concerns among local residents and environmental activists.
While its unclear to what extent environmental poisons like heptyl compounds might be harming animal populations, international experts say thats probably not whats killing off the saiga.
I think there is no evidence to that at all, says Milner-Gulland. Well get toxicology reports from the environmental sampling thats being taken, and that will help us to understand one way or the other. She points out that if antelope mortality continues to spread, it will make the environmental-poisoning theory that much more untenable.
The saiga has been the victim of several mass declines over the years, reaching near-extinction in the 1920s and again in 2003 due to poaching and over-hunting. At one point in 2003, the number of live animals fell to just 21,000.
One source of hope is that the saiga has the capacity to rebound quickly from mass-mortality events. The females give birth fairly rapidly and are fertile from one year of age.
Its an extraordinary species, Milner-Gulland says. Because it lives in a really harsh environment, where you have really cold winters and drought condition, it has a natural ability to rebound.
While Kazakhstan has the largest surviving saiga population, other significant populations are found in Mongolia and Russias Kalmykia Republic.

Conservative politicians in Uganda say that a music video by singer Jemimah Kansiime has broken the countrys tough new anti-pornography laws .
The 21-year-old has already spent five weeks in jail for appearing in a foam-covered bikini in the video , promoting her single, Ensolo Yange.
Under the new law, which took effect in February, Kansiime faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of wilfully and unlawfully producing, trafficking, importing, selling and abetting pornography.
But critics say the ruling is part of a growing anti-liberal movement that includes tough laws against homosexuals in a country where religiously-driven conservatism appears to be on the rise.
Human Rights Watch argue that the new law so loosely defines pornography that it has encouraged public attacks on women wearing skimpy clothing , while Amnesty International has called for it to be repealed.
Sex sells
I was aware that there are some sections of society that are conservative, said Kansiime, but she never dreamt her new video  played over 190,000 times on YouTube  was breaking the law.
One thing she says she learnt from her idols  including Rihanna and Nicki Minaj  is that sex sells.
I was just experimenting to see if I put on a short dress, will the audience like it? said the singer.
She was arrested in November along with her then manager, Didi Muchwa Mugisha.
Mugisha pleaded guilty and was fined 200, 000 Ugandan shillings (43), but Kansiime pleaded not guilty, and was detained for five weeks before raising money for bail.
My rights have been trampled upon, my freedom of expression has been trampled upon, she said at her home in Kampala.
Kansiimes lawyer, Isaac Semakadde, argues the case is a test for the right of Ugandan performers to express themselves.
That right to erotic entertainment, there has to be a space for it in an open and free society, hesaid, arguing divisions must be made between clearly criminal offences and entertainment.
To ban all forms of pornography, all forms of nudity, is outrageous, he said.

Obscene and vulgar
Kansiime was tracked down and arrested after Ugandas ethics minister Simon Lokodo was apparently shocked by the video .
He described Kansiimes videos as very obscene and vulgar, and warned of further arrests.
Under his continued crackdown on pornography, Lokodo has this year ordered police to arrest men who procure prostitutes , and described a popular local television dating show as prostitution.
Local media reported that he also confronted Ugandas youngest MP when she walked into parliament in a short skirt.
The law has also become known as the mini skirt ban after some Ugandans misinterpreted the ruling and targeted people they considered to be improperly dressed, in some cases stripping women in the street .
Semakadde accuses the government of ignoring more pressing issues.
The decadence in society does not start and stop with prostitution, he said. Theres corruption  but they have no answers to that, so they go for the most vulnerable.

Kansiime is due in court later this month. But Semakadde said he will request the case is halted while the constitutional court deals with a separate petition brought by activists against the law, arguing it is over broad and vague.
As she awaits her next court appearance, Kansiime insisted that she had the right to film whatever I want, but conceded she may need to cater for more conservative tastes if she is to continue to make a living from her music.
I have to do something that people like, I have not benefitted from that video, she admitted.

Tinder, the dating app phenomena that since its 2012 inception has made more than six billion matches across the globe, like me has Iranian roots. After several months of matching, messaging and arranging meet-ups through Tinder, I was surprised to learn that two of its Los Angeles-based founders, Sean Rad and Justin Mateen, are both of Iranian descent . But back in Iran, a country that is considered the worlds most internet censored nation, let alone a place that restricts interactions between unrelated women and men, is such an app accessible?
I recently returned to Tehran after two years, defying incessant and increasing calls from my family to marry, and had the opportunity to find out firsthand. During my time in Irans capital, I noticed that dating had evolved from being a covert operation to something quite commonplace. Even though on several occasions Id been stopped by the patrolling moral guidance authorities who questioned my relationship with the woman Id been walking with, in many other ways dating is no longer as complicated as it once was.
Aside from illicit parties while mum and dad are out of town (or even illicit parties while mum and dad are in the house), an increasing number of cafs, restaurants and parks are popping up, making meeting and subsequently dating so much easier. But I wondered how much easier things might get for Irans young hopefuls with the introduction of dating apps. Having just arrived from London, staring down at Tinders familiar red flamed icon on my mobile, I was excited to find out if the app would work in Iran , and if so, how many here would be using it.
Even before mobiles got smart, their increasing presence in the socially conservative Islamic republic seemed to bring about a profound cultural shift . For the nations bulging post-1979 Revolution baby boomers  the under thirty-fives that still account for nearly half the nation  mobile phones allowed individuals to interact with one another with less interception from moral authorities , be it the paramilitary militia known as the Basij, the Moral Guidance authorities or parents. But with my recent visit I noticed that things had shifted up a gear, with the nations largest network operator offering cheap and widely available 3G and its closest competitor advertising a new 4G service. It is with the introduction of services like these that Iranians can more freely access app-based, location-sensitive dating services.

With Tinder, Facebook details are selectively displayed for others to swipe right to show interest or left to reject  mutual interest gets a match, allowing for messaging and then more. Tinder has shaken off its reputation as a hook-up (read casual sex) app since going worldwide, representing itself more as a game for which users are asked if they want to continue playing or chat after each match is made.
For this player, Tehrans Tinder total availability tallied at 20 throughout my two-week visit. My preset London settings had only allowed me two swipes to the left before a message popped up below my profile picture telling me that there was nobody new nearby. Realising that two kilometres  my default distance setting  doesnt cover much of Tehrans ever-expanding metropolitan area of nearly 9 million residents, I slid my profile settings wide open, 50 kilometres and 18-50 age range. With this change, I saw my profile quickly linked with, among others, Sara, 22, not her real name, which goes for others in this article. (Publication was also delayed to protect the privacy of those who may have been active.)

Saras first profile picture showed her casually dressed, wearing a loose, white V-neck top and without a headscarf. I swiped right indicating to Tinder that Im interested. Later that night it appeared shed done the same as a message flashes up on my mobile informing me that wed made a match. Following a brief exchange of messages and numbers, we made vague plans to meet.
To set up Tinder, you need to be on Facebook, but unsurprisingly social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are blocked in Iran. Even with these blocks at least 4m Iranians use Facebook , according to the governments own statistics, with the Supreme Leader  or at least his office  being an avid tweeter , boasting 122,000 Twitter followers.
A site can be blocked outright, like the BBC, or filtered for containing a suspicious word in its name, like the Sussex police website. Despite such restrictions many Iranians continue to access these sites.
Within a day of arriving in Iran, a tech-savvy friend kindly set me up with one of the more common methods used by Iranians to evade the blocking, a virtual private network, or VPN. With his local bank card hed pulled up a local site, made a payment of about one pound for a months access, tapped in a few setting changes on my mobile, and as far as any server is concerned, Im back accessing the digital world from the United Kingdom. My mobiles GPS however, still recognising me as a local to Iran, lets the active Tehran-based Tinder users know Im in the same city.
Hey Sara, hows your weekend going so far? I begin in English, confident that she can speak the language based on her profile warning me that she doesnt reply to boring clichd messages, in case you are wondering.
Fluency in English in Iran can suggest a certain status, but I use it just as much for practicality, what with my Persian being on a par with any Iranian pre-schooler. Well so far everyday has been a weekend for me since i came back, she responds, reassuring me that she does at least respond to clichd if not boring messages. Hows yours?
We shoot a few messages back and forth before I invite her to meet me at a caf. Im actually dying to find some decent coffee here, she somewhat snobbishly answers, re-establishing her transient association with Iran and playing the foreign-thus-better card right back at me. I suggest a fancy new joint in a wealthy neighbourhood in the north of Tehran, a place that boasts urban-industrial chic interior design and more than 22,500 Instagram followers. She agrees, and we both round up by pretending to be busy over the coming days, leaving a vague timeframe by which wed meet.
Tehrans upscale Sam Cafe.
Then it was over to Leila, my second match, a young woman proudly wearing the Bayern Munich strip in her third profile picture. Leila seemed to be different from the average girl in Iran who likes to make an ostentatious display of herself. Leila wore little make-up and her hair seemed to be a natural colour.
So tell me about yourself? In either language ;)
I pick up.
A red bubble eventually pops out beside her smiling profile icon, 27, female.
27 and female! I respond, not typing out how Im figuratively ROFLing - rolling on the floor laughing.
I remind myself that she Is female by looking once again at her profile pictures and notice that shes made a little update between my exchanges with Sara. I like the new pictures, I tell her, referencing her cute smile. Thanks fer the compliment, she says. U have great headshape.
I tell her that Ive not had that one before. I had to come up with st, she says.
Leila tells me she Is between jobs. So you have time to meet during the day to go for coffee? I ask.
Im hesitant, she says. I ask why.
Bad memoriesBad experiences with tourists slash visitors.
In an attempt to reassure her I send a link to some of my writing online, to which she types out a smiling smiley and adds, trust building?
After some additional reassurance from me she writes, then no superior gaze?
Haha! Thats funny, I respond.
To you maybe :D she writes back, before feeling comfortable enough to suggest we go for a stroll in the park in the coming days. And with that, like Sara before her, she leaves the specifics for later.
Several other unspecified plans chop and change during an afternoon as I take myself to Tehrans newly developed and hugely popular recreational area, known as the Park of Water and Fire. The park displays both of the elements, and also provides a massive dose of polluted air up top the adjoining double decker bridge that oversees the city, as well as a hideous highway. I take myself to the large skate park at the far end hoping to take shots of the skater girls and biker boys flipping their inline skates, skateboards, and adapted mountain bikes.

As the sun sets and the temperature drops from cold to unbearable, I pick up the conversation with Sara in a WhatsApp message and ask her to join me at a nearby popular food court named Wooden Road  a series of international restaurants separated by little bridges arching over synthetic waterways. She agrees to join me there instead of our previously planned location, but lets it be known that I apparently now have terrible taste in venues.
We meet, take a seat, order and get straight to business. She tells me about her digital startup and her hopes for it. We discuss facts and figures about Iran and its evolving online market, noting a buzz based on a rumoured $200m budget for digital startups in Iran by a South African company. Sara is frank and direct, questioning the details as I talk about my experiences of working in Iran, reconfirming my suspicion that were having a business meeting rather than a date. She drops authors names and book titles before stating that she believes everything, absolutely everything, should be commodified and commercialised.
I believe that capitalism is the answer to our problems, she confidently asserts. I accept the challenge and question her about functions of the state, more specifically about how street lighting should be paid for. She doesnt up-and-leave, but the conversation intensifies as I notice the coffee kicking in  dating is easier with an alcoholic drink or threewhen a nations laws allow it, of course.
My meet-up with Leila, date number two, took place at another nearby park, probably Tehrans strangest. It is sunk into the ground and hosts a variety of odd animals - mostly exotic birds - caged up and taunted by a frightening number of street cats. The park is situated half-way up Tehrans longest street, Vali Asr, which once bridged two of the former Shahs palaces.
This was the street where I met Leila, shook her hand and stood silenced by how tall she was. Thankfully she was stumped too.
Hi, I dont know how to do this. What do I say now? she asks me, avoiding eye contact.
How are you? I both ask and answer. She answers with another question. Where should we go?
I continue the game and awkwardly ask, Howd you get so tall? before taking the lead and guiding us through the entrance.
She continues to avoid looking in my direction, made easier by us walking beside one another, but she puts an end to the question game, and begins to open up: My parents are doctors, quite religious I guess, but I have nothing in common with them. They find me odd.
She doesnt see my lack of surprise and continues to tell me about how shed studied engineering and was now between jobs. Im reminded that although Iran has the largest student gender ratio difference across the world  with more females than males studying at university  finding work thereafter is hard for women, even before international sanctions were imposed. She asks herself a few more questions and helpfully answers them too before asking me why Im in Iran, what I do for a living as well as general questions about my confusing background.
We meander through the park, aimlessly choosing from the many paths separating banks of grass and trees, each with an adjoining bench and on each, a single cat shifting for the breaks of sunlight beaming through the trees that towered above. Our conversation was as fractured as the park layout, with mostly Leila feeding me parts of her life in patchwork. We passed a bench where an old woman sat feeding a large congress of cats, undeterred by the four men loudly commentating while playing on one of the parks fixed football tables. Crazy cat lady, says Leila, humorously in English, causing the cats to turn to see why Im laughing.
I ask about her experiences on Tinder in Tehran and more specifically about the superior gaze. She tells me about her last date, also with an English man, but unlike me, fully so. I didnt fully understand what had happened, mostly due to my poor Persian, but it sounded like she had a good case for sexual harassment. She continued, telling me that shes not a prude but should her parents learn about her sexual activities shed likely be kicked out of the house. On the other hand, she was clear that she doesnt take kindly to being treated like a sex object.
Both of my dates concluded with a simple handshake, followed by a slightly insincere see you later, although in the case of Sara, this still remains my hope. There was however one last Tehran Tinder encounter, but upon my return to London, which can occasionally happen when jumping between locations. I matched with Mena, 27, and after a brief exchange she asked me, Is this a business trip?
I then realised what had happened.
Tinder thinks Im still in Iran. I was there on business, pleasure and seeing family, I respond to which she quickly replies, So youre back home :)
Returning to London and seeing profile pictures of girls in bars, drinks-in-hand or leaping into the air, star-shaped, in a bikini before a sunset, reminded me that yes, I was indeed back. Her message however, sent another reminder to me: I slide my settings back down to a more narrow two kilometre range and 26-36 and continue playing.
Both of my Tinder dates in Tehran  although destined to be nothing more than just one-offs  were probably more successful than several of my London attempts. Tinder can be quick and callous, but this is how dating is in Iran, where the classic method of cruising here can display girls left and right, before a brief exchange that hopefully leads to a further exchange of numbers.
Although there arent many users at the moment, I believe that Tinder is set to take off in Iran, not only because of the nations quick adoption of most things digital but also because of the further empowerment that this type of technology enables the youth  allowing them to quite literally take things into their own hands for a change.

A video showing the interrogation of alleged Russian servicemen captured in Ukraine has sparked concerns about the treatment of prisoners of war in the conflict.
The footage of one of the two men captured in eastern Ukraine on Saturday appears to show him lying on a hospital bed identifying himself as serviceman Aleksandr Aleksandrov, who says he was part of a Russian special forces group.
We were discovered. I was wounded in the leg as I tried to get away... Weve been here four to five days, he says to the camera.
First shared on the Facebook page of Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashchenko , the release of the footage has been criticised amid claims it violates the Geneva conventions .
The conventions ban exposing POWs to public curiosity.
The treatment of prisoners of war in the Ukraine conflict has repeatedly sparked concerns since fighting between army forces and Russian-backed separatists erupted last year.

In the past months, rebels have paraded Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) before an angry crowd on the streets of Donetsk, Ukraine has released videos showing apparent forced confessions of captured Russian paratroopers, and several videos posted online appear to show brutal treatment of Ukrainian soldiers at the hands separatist groups.
This week, Kievs capture of the two alleged Russian servicemen has once again raised concerns about whether Ukraine is abiding by international law in its handling of POWs.
Its in violation of Geneva rules on treatment of POWs, Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, said on Twitter of the video .

Conflict between states
At the heart of the debate over whether the release of the video constitutes a violation of international law is the question: is Ukraine at war with Russia ?
The Geneva conventions ban on subjecting POWs to insults and public curiosity applies specifically to armed conflicts between states, which Russia steadfastly insists the Ukraine conflict is not, portraying it instead as a civil war.
Kiev, Nato and western governments say there is evidence that Moscow is backing separatist rebels with personnel, weapons and training, allegations that the Kremlin has repeatedly rejected while conceding that Russian volunteers and soldiers no longer in active duty have fought with separatists.
Some Ukrainians argue the video shows that Moscow is indeed involved in military conflict, despite its denials
The Russian Defence Ministry said on 18 May that Aleksandrov and the other captured man, Yevgeny Yerofeyev, indeed served in the military but were not active servicemen at the time they were detained.
Either these are POWs and Russia is involved, or they are illegal trespassers, and Geneva Conventions do not apply. You decide. Regardless, they are treated humanely by all accounts, the Ukrainian embassy in the Netherlands claimed in a Twitter discussion about the ethics of releasing the video .
The International Committee of the Red Cross, the guardian of the Geneva Conventions, has called the war in Ukraine a  non-international armed conflict .
Under this status, public curiosity does not constitute a war crime. Instead, there must be evidence of outrages upon personal dignity and  humiliating and degrading treatment .
But Ukraine claims the video is proof of Russias involvement in the conflict. For us, it is very important to present to the entire world Russian soldiers who supposedly do not exist on our land, Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov told news agencies.
But the footage presents an interesting catch-22: by gaining recognition from the international community  and the Red Cross  that it is at war with Russia, Kiev would bind itself to the Geneva conventions ban on subjecting POWs to public curiosity, making it liable to charges for sharing the video footage.

A violation of international law?
Experts differ on whether the release of the video constitutes a Ukrainian violation of the conventions.
Gary Solis, a former US military judge, says that even if the Red Cross has not classified the Ukraine conflict as a war between states, that doesnt mean that you can do anything you want.
There are still rules and theres still customary international law that applies, Solis says. He adds that under the Geneva conventions criteria for international conflicts, the video absolutely violates the statute barring insults and public curiosity.
You dont show someone in any circumstance, whether theyre in a hospital bed or standing upright, for purposes of satisfying public curiosity, Solis says.

David Glazier, a former surface-warfare officer in the US Navy who now teaches national international law, disagrees.
Glazier says the video is the sort of the minimal and respectful amount of exposure necessary for them [Ukraine] to make the case to the world that there are in fact Russian soldiers involved in hostilities in their conflict.
It has since been reported that the Ukrainian Armys chief of staff, Viktor Muzhenko, vowed to put the two prisoners on display for the international media, a move that Glazier says probably would cross the line.

Gulnara Suleymanova and her family of five live in a wagon behind Bakus prestigious new sports stadium, built especially for next months European Games.
On your way here, you might have seen piles of sand, thats where my husband sieves when theres no work, says Suleymanova, who is a cleaner.
The familys income is about 300 Azerbaijani manats (184) a month  which is barely enough for food, she says.
Theirs is the story of a family subsisting alongside the ambitious venues constructed for Azerbaijans inaugural Games and generously funded by the state oil company Socar. The authoritarian president, Ilham Alyev, a keen enthusiast of the Games, is said to have invested a total of 6.5bn in sports venues and infrastructure .
Organisers are also paying the travel and accommodation expenses of all 6,000 athletes competing in the event, a move condemned by human rights groups as an attempt to whitewash the countrys poor human rights record and endemic corruption.
Last week the government extended the detention of award-winning investigative journalist who had written articles exposing state corruption.
Life in the oilfields
For Suleymanova, the glaring disparity between the luxury stadiums and her familys daily struggle raises important questions about who the Games will actually benefit.
Its cold in the winter, and it doesnt matter how much you use the heater, Suleymanova says. In the summer, its terribly hot. We take water from the neighbour. Water, gas, electricity are all one big problem. When it comes to living, you have to experience it yourself in order to understand. Its hard to describe.
After 10 years of renting, the family settled in their oilfield wagon behind the stadium. The smell of oil is ubiquitous, but its not their biggest problem: they are hungry, thirsty and the health of two of her children is deteriorating.

Suleymanovas son has a hearing impairment and her daughter has problems with her vision. Each time she sees the stadium she wonders how many children could access medical treatment with the money it cost to build.
Only 100th of those four billion manats would be enough to treat my child, she says. But they didnt give it to me. Wherever I went, I got nothing.
Everything I have is inside this room
Suleymanovas family live in one dim, narrow, room scant with furniture.
I dont have a table. I cant offer you a chair, because I dont have it, Suleymanova says. This is both my living room and bedroom. I dont have proper curtains. If you ask for a bathroom, we dont have it either, we shower at the neighbours place.
I dont have a kitchen. Everything I have is inside this room, she adds.

Her requests for government help have fallen on deaf ears. She applied for targeted social assistance but didnt qualify. They told me your husband must have a job in a state-funded entity. You need to bring a paper proving that. If I had a job in a public company why would I ever need your social assistance? she asks.

They build sports complexes, construct roads, but who benefits from them? Why dont they help children? Why dont they think that there are small children, sick and poor people living in this country? Why dont they help them? she asks.

Ban Ki-moon to visit North Korea in effort to improve ties with South
Ban, who will visit two countries Kaesong industrial park, becomes first head of UN to visit North since 1993 but talks on nuclear weapons considered unlikely

Ban would be the first UN chief to visit the factory park, which opened in 2004 in the town of Kaesong as the last major cooperation project between the Koreas. He would also be the first head of the UN to visit North Korea since Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1993.
Bans trip, on Thursday, comes as relations between the Koreas remain strained following the Norths continuation of missile and other weapons tests that South Korea views as provocation.
There have also been concerns about an escalation of violence in the North after South Koreas spy agency said last week that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had his defence chief executed in late April. Kim reportedly used an anti-aircraft gun to execute his minister for disrespectful behaviour, including napping during a military rally attended by the leader.
Ban told reporters on Tuesday during his trip to South Korea that he would spare no efforts in trying to help improve ties between the Koreas.
The Kaesong project is a win-win model for both Koreas. It symbolises a good aim to tap the advantage of South and North Korea in a complementary manner, said Ban, who visited the factory park in 2006, when he was South Koreas foreign minister. I hope my visit will provide positive impetus to further develop it and expand to other areas.
Ban said that he would visit factories and meet North Korean workers, but that it had not been decided which North Korean officials he would meet.
Chang Yong-seok, an analyst at Seoul National Universitys Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, said he was sceptical about whether Bans trip would bring any major breakthrough in relations between the rivals.
Chang said North Korea accepted Bans visit to the Kaesong complex because it could help lure foreign investment and revive its troubled economy. But, he said, North Korea wont welcome Ban coming to [the capital] Pyongyang with talks on its nuclear programme.
Kaesong park opened during a period of warming ties between the Koreas and has been considered a test case for unification, pairing cheap local labour with South Korean knowhow and technology.
It has survived periods of animosity, including the Norths artillery bombardment of a South Korean island in 2010, while other cross-border projects, such as tours to a scenic North Korean mountain, remain deadlocked.
In 2013, however, the parks operations were halted for five months after North Korea withdrew its 53,000 workers amid tension over the Norths torrent of threats to launch nuclear attacks on Seoul and Washington.
The complexs future has been put into doubt again recently, with the two Koreas wrangling over Pyongyangs push to raise the wages for North Koreans employed by South Korean companies there without consulting South Korea. The Kaesong complex is a rare, legitimate source of foreign currency for the impoverished North.
The Korean peninsula technically remains in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

        <title>New documents claim to prove Mugabe ordered Gukurahundi killings</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/mugabe-zimbabwe-gukurahundi-massacre-matabeleland</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>From January 1983, a campaign of terror was waged against the Ndebele people in Matabeleland in western Zimbabwe. The so-called Gukurahundi massacres remain the darkest period in the countrys post-independence history, when more than 20,000 civilians were killed by Robert Mugabes feared Fifth Brigade .
No one has accepted the blame for the violence, but the recent release of historical documents has shed new light on those responsible.
The wide-ranging reports include diplomatic correspondence, intelligence assessments and raw intelligence garnered by spies recruited from within the Zimbabwean government.
These papers  augmented by my investigations and the testimony of Zimbabwean witnesses  appear to substantiate what survivors and scholars have always suspected: Mugabe, then prime minister, was the prime architect of well-planned and systematically executed mass killings.
The documents, which include recently declassified cables from the Australian high commission , reinforce the view that Gukurahundi  a Shona word for the spring rains that sweep away dry season chaff - was closely associated with Mugabes Zanu-PF partys efforts to eliminate opposition groups after independence in 1980.

Zapu, a party led by nationalist rival Joshua Nkomo, represented the main obstacle . Zapu enjoyed overwhelming support among the Ndebele and was seen as an impediment by the leadership of Zanu-PF. In the words of Mugabe, the people of Matabeleland needed to be re-educated.
Mugabes explicit orders
The little that Mugabe has said since the 1980s has been a mixture of obfuscation and denial. The closest he has come to admitting official responsibility was after the death of Nkomo in 1999, when he described the early 1980s as a moment of madness  an ambivalent statement not since repeated.
In a recent interview with South African talk-show host Dali Tambo, he blamed the Gukurahundi killings on armed bandits coordinated by Zapu and a few subordinate, North Korean trained, Fifth Brigade soldiers. But recorded correspondence from his colleagues tells a different story.
By March 1983 news of the atrocities had leaked, prompting western ambassadors to ask questions of government ministers. Some, said to include defence minister of defence Sydney Sekeramayi, quickly pointed to Mugabe.
In a conversation with Cephas Msipa, one of the few remaining Zapu ministers of what had been a government of national unity, Sekeramayi reportedly said that not only was Mugabe fully aware of what was going on but the Fifth Brigade was operating under Mugabes explicit orders. Msipa later relayed this discussion to the Australian high commission, who reported back to its headquarters in Canberra.
Msipas credibility as a witness is strengthened by his amicable relationship with Mugabe. The pair had shared a room for two years during their earlier career as teachers and Msipa had welcomed Mugabe into his home when he returned from Ghana in 1960 to join the struggle against white rule .

Within Zapu, Msipa, a Shona-speaker, had consistently advocated amalgamation with Zanu-PF  earning him the ire of Ndebele-speaking colleagues  and was considerably more sympathetic to Zanu-PF and its leader than others in his party.
Crisis of conscience
Between 1980 and 1982, when tensions were rising between Zapu and Zanu-PF, Msipa had been in regular contact with Mugabe. This continued during the killings.
But yet, after speaking to Sekeramayi and others in Zanu-PF, he was convinced  as he told the Australians  that the prime minister was right behind what had been happening in Matabeleland. Never before had he had such a crisis of my conscience about remaining in government, he said.
Sekeramayi was more circumspect in direct diplomatic discussions but made it clear that the massacres were no accident. The army had had to act hard, he told the British defence attach, but  the situation was now under control. He later admitted to the British high commissioner that there had been atrocities.
Orchestrated killings
The documents also show that Msipa talked to other members of Zanu-PF, who claimed the killings were the result of a formal, broad-based decision by the leadership.
Eddison Zvobgo, a member of the partys 20-member policy-making group, spoke of a decision of the central committee that there had to be a massacre of Ndebeles.
Army commanders who directed the killings, many of whom still retain key positions in government, are shown in the documents to have been eager accomplices.
Zvobgo claimed that the first, Fifth Brigade commander , Perence Shiri, had said the politicians should leave it to us with regard to settling things in Matabeleland.

20,000 dead
The first six weeks of Fifth Brigades attacks were massive in their intensity but, as the documents show, an order was given for them to be curtailed after news had leaked to the outside world.
The breadth of the violence, along with the extent of official involvement, was significantly underestimated
The killing did not end but was scaled back and conducted more covertly.
Estimates of the death toll are frequently put at 20,000, a figure first mooted by Nkomo at the time, but on-the-ground surveys were piecemeal and vast areas of Matabeleland remain under-researched. Ongoing fear and the death of witnesses provide further challenges.
Whilst a forensically accurate number will never be possible, evidence suggests that the standard estimate is conservative.
Oral testimony from Zimbabweans in key government positions during the 1980s disinters a host of killings that were previously unknown. Cumulatively, it suggests that the breadth of the violence, along with the extent of official involvement, was significantly underestimated.
Western intervention
Survivors, scholars and other Zimbabweans have always questioned the extent of western governments knowledge. Evidence suggests that they knew a great deal and that diplomatic interventions were pivotal to the Zimbabwean decision to reduce the violence.
Nevertheless, western governments did little once the scale of massacres were dialled down to a lower, but still savage, intensity. The campaign continued in the north of Matabeleland during the remainder of 1983 with Fifth Brigade troops re-deployed to the south in 1984 .
The western response to violence against black countrymen in the 1980s was a pale shadow of the reaction to attacks on white farmers in 2000 . Many Ndebele remain bitter about this inconsistency.

At the same time, to put too much emphasis on the international dimension of the Matabeleland massacres would be to miss the point. Mugabe has repeatedly used the charge of neo-colonialism to cover his misdemeanours in the hope of garnering support from fellow African leaders.
Zimbabwes second vice-president Phelekezela Mphoko recently claimed that the Matabeleland massacres were a  conspiracy of the west , with nothing to do with Mugabe. Yet the evidence appears to suggest otherwise.
One-party state
The documents point to internal killings neither provoked nor sustained by outsiders, suggesting that the atrocities were driven from the top by Zanu-PF in pursuit of specific political objectives.
Viewed across a period of several years, the documents appear to provide evidence that the massacres were but one component of a sustained and strategic effort to remove all political opposition within five years of independence. Zanu-PF leaders were determined to secure a victory against a non-existent opposition in elections scheduled for 1985, after which there would be a mandate from the people to impose a one-party state.

The bride, named locally as Kheda (Luiza) Goylabiyeva, was married to Nazhud Guchigov, in Grozny on Saturday in a ceremony attended by the leader of the Chechen republic, Ramzan Kadyrov .
Guchigov, the groom, was initially said to be 57 but later claimed he was 46. Neither forced, nor under-age nor polygamous marriages are permitted under Russian law.
The marriage has caused a stir in the Russian press, prompting Kadyrov to call on journalists to stop meddling in the couples private lives.
The scandal emerged late last month after investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that Guchigov had launched an intimidation campaign against Goylabiyevas parents, giving them an ultimatum to surrender their daughter to avoid unfortunate consequences. The journalist who reported the story has since fled Chechnya, fearing for her safety .
Guchigov initially denied the claims, insisting that he was not planning to take a second wife.
Kadyrov said earlier this month he was upset that the story had been picked up by national media outlets, dismissing the republics media and information minister for mismanaging the scandal.
I am sure those who unceremoniously interfered for a long time in the private lives of Nazhud and Luiza will answer [for their actions] in court, Kadyrov wrote on Instagram on Friday. The appropriate actions are already being prepared.
Kadyrov posted a video of himself dancing at the wedding on Saturday. The Chechen leader wrote that he had seen the stamps placed in the newlyweds passports, a formality for married Russian couples. Yet under Russian federal law, second marriages  which are permissible in traditional practice for Chechen men  cannot be registered as official partnerships.
The head of Kadyrovs administration, former Chechen militant Magomed Daurov, was seen escorting the bride to the ceremony and was present during proceedings.

Kadyrov, who had taken to Instagram to invite his one million followers on the popular photo-sharing site to attend the wedding, insisted that all legal norms, religious practices and local traditions had been respected.
The Russian Civil Code states that 18 is the minimum age for marriage but contains clauses that allow for marriage at 16 in certain cases.

Russias childrens rights ombudsman Pavel Astakhov caused a scanda l last week by coming out in favour of the right of older men to marry teen brides.
Emancipation and sexual maturity come earlier in the Caucasus, lets not be hypocritical, he told Russian News Service radio on Thursday, adding: There are places where women are already shriveled by the age of 27, and look about 50 to us.
He later apologised in an Instagram post, saying that women of any age were wonderful and delightful.

Mofolos first novel is a travel story made alluring and exotic with the intensity of poetry and myth.
2. My Life in the Bush of Ghosts  Amos Tutuola
Who wouldnt want to get enveloped in a fog of magical delight? Tutuolas second novel is what Alice in Wonderland could have been if Lewis Carroll had imagined a world haunted by outrageous beasts and ghouls.

Worried that his eyes and urine were turning a deep yellow, Gednezar Dladla made his way to a local clinic and was referred to a district hospital, where he was x-rayed, diagnosed with gallstones, and admitted for the night. Both institutions receive funding from the Wellcome Trust and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.
A day later, Dladla set off through the hills and valleys of rural Zululand to a village near his childhood home, where a group of men played cards in the shade of a tree. The environmental activist listened to their grievances about dust pollution, water shortages and lack of assistance from a local mine owned by Rio Tinto  whose investors include the Wellcome Trust and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation .

Two of the greatest philanthropic organisations in the world, responsible for saving countless lives through scientific research and healthcare programmes, are heavily invested in fossil fuel industries that have profound impacts on the health of local communities and cause climate change . Nowhere is this paradox more acute than in South Africa, a country with the biggest HIV caseload in the world and an economy founded on mining.

I would absolutely recognise that its a very difficult decision for big funders like the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation: they need to manage their investments in the best way possible to maximise funding for research, said Marie-Louise Newell, former director of the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies , which receives money from both to combat HIV. But if you think back to apartheid days, there are times when you need to make big statements, and the climate change issue is very worrying.
The Africa Centre is located in the beautiful KwaZulu-Natal province, where one in three people have HIV and  around the town of Mtubatuba, 173 miles north of Durban  a 15-year-old girl has an 80% chance of contracting it in her lifetime. Inside its modern building, which has won architecture prizes, are staff in T-shirts and jeans processing data on laptops.

In a poverty-stricken area where joblessness is estimated at 70%, the Africa Centre is one of the three biggest employers. It does vital work supporting healthcare for local people and receives up to 4m a year from the Wellcome Trust and contributions from donors including the Gates Foundation for world-class HIV and tuberculosis research. The list of papers published by the centres researchers in scientific journals numbered 99 last year alone . The centre works in lockstep with the South African government and provides advice, expertise and training to Hlabisa district hospital and 17 associated primary care clinics.
At the hospital earlier this month, half a dozen patients wearing face masks sat on plastic chairs outside a prefab structure, awaiting the free TB medication that keeps them alive. Among them was Zanele Zungu, 43, who was diagnosed with TB and HIV in 2003, the same year her 34-year-old husband, Sipho, died of Aids. The passing of my husband was shocking to me, the mother of five recalled through a Zulu interpreter, a tear on her cheek.
I was very scared because I had the same symptoms my husband died of. He had sores on the mouth and all over the body. He used to scream a lot in his last days. He was feeling a lot of pain, and thats why I took him to hospital. There was no treatment at that time and he passed away.
Zungu, who walks for an hour from her mudbrick home to reach the hospital, was unaware that it is supported by the Africa Centre  or that its benefactor, the Wellcome Trust, invests in the mining industry. I would like to say thank-you because they provide life to us. Thats why we are alive. But investing in a mine is not right  They must only give to the hospitals, because people are dying every day.
Newells successor, Prof Deenan Pillay , said: The aim of the Africa Centre is to do world-class science and the Wellcome Trust is one of the major and most prestigious funders of science. As such Im very happy to receive Wellcome Trust resources for that because it brings a reputation for high quality of research.
On the Wellcome Trusts investment policies, he added: Climate change and energy use are some of the most pressing global issues, and I welcome the debate on the impact of investment policies. I recognise the variety of views within this debate.

South Africa has the deepest mines in the world and the industry employs half a million people. But natures blessing of coal, diamonds, gold and platinum has also been a curse over the past century and a half. Thousands of workers have died in accidents. Continual exposure to mineral dust in mine shafts has resulted in high rates of silicosis. That, and the proximity of mineworkers underground, contributes to the spread of TB. In South Africas mines the disease is up to six times more common than in the general population. Men in a mining area tend to attract commercial sex workers, leading to the spread of HIV. Scientists are studying the potential dangers of acid draining from disused mines into water supplies.
Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels and soot and dust emissions from coal burning are, along with diesel engines, the biggest contributors to microscopic particulate pollution that penetrates deep into the lungs. This causes heart attacks and lung cancer as well as increasing asthma attacks and other respiratory problems. A 2013 study found that air pollution from Europes 300 largest coal power stations causes 22,300 premature deaths a year and costs companies and governments billions of pounds in treatment and lost working days.
Dladla, a retired cattle herder who is married and has three sons, wears a faded T-shirt that reads: Remember the slain of Marikana,  a reference to the 2012 police massacre of 34 striking mineworkers . He sits on the steering committee of the Mining and Environmental Justice Community Network of South Africa .
Looking out from a car as it bumped slowly towards the Zululand Anthracite Colliery (ZAC) near the town of Ulundi  about 25 miles (40km) from the Africa Centre  Dladla sighed. The trees are full of dust, the grass is full of dust. It will have to rain a lot for the grass to be washed, for the leaves to be washed. It has become the life people are living here: they are living in dust every day. A billboard proclaims the town to be the core of the Zulu heritage.
Soon a giant discarded dump emerged into view from the countryside, along with the vast cranes and machinery of a processing plant where cows grazed nearby. It produces anthracite, a relatively clean coal, which the mines owner, Rio Tinto, sends to provide raw material for its Richards Bay mine on the coast.
Campaign sign up
Inside, a poster announced:  Rio Tinto . Speak out. Doing whats right. Rio Tinto is a leading international mining giant in which the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation have invested $157m (100m) and $10m respectively. The Guardians Keep it in the Ground campaign is calling for both charities to move their investments out of fossil fuel companies, including Rio Tinto.
The company bought the ZAC in 2011, inheriting a troubled history that included the digging of three mine shafts without environmental authorisation, for which Rio Tinto last year paid a cursory fine .
People in the village of Okhukho, which is virtually surrounded by the mine, are critical of its side effects. Sitting under a tree with a group of jobless men playing cards, Thembinkosi Zulu, 20, a student, said: There are a lot of trucks and they are never sealed. Ive got sinus problems from inhaling the dust. My nose gets blocked and painful. The mine must cover the trucks and water the roads. The mine does create jobs, but they dont attend to the communitys needs adequately.
Xolani Majola, 23, who lives next to the road used by trucks around the clock, said his brothers, aged 10 and nine, were constantly coughing and complaining about chest pains. When your clothes are on the washing line, by the time you come back, theyll be all dusty. If you sleep with your window open, youll be dusty yourself. With the noise, you find it hard to sleep.
Lindekile Mncube, 26, added: There is dust when they havent watered the roads. The dust makes it difficult for us to breathe and it falls on our curtains. Im worried about the effect on our lives here, but theres nothing I can do.
Mining consumes huge quantities of water and the ZAC draws it from the local Umfolozi river, a vital source for the community and its livestock. Mncube said: Weve been complaining about water, but the mine has done nothing. When the mine came, we thought we would get everything we need.
Lungile Ngqulunga, 54, also mentioned a lack of water as she leaned against her front step with her 15-month-old grandson, Kusile. A nearby bowl crawled with flies as goats wandered by and cockerels sang cock-a-doodle-doo. Her husband was away, she explained, receiving treatment for TB that he contracted a decade ago while working at the ZAC.
We dont have water, Ngqulunga complained. The river has been suffering ever since the mine started working. One of the pipes from the mine burst and now were scared of going to the river. There are no taps in this area and we struggle for drinking water. We ask the mine for water and they say we must go to the government. We go to steal it inside the mine, but if the security guards catch you, you will be locked up.
The ZAC denies polluting the river or the air and says it is helping local villages. David Outhwaite, a London-based spokesman for Rio Tinto, said: The Zululand region as a whole, and Okhuko community in particular, has been adversely affected by a severe drought being the worst in many decades. ZAC supplies in excess of 40m litres of potable water free of charge at various strategic water points in the community close to our operations. ZAC is not in a position to supply water to every one of the 80,000 people living in the rural community surrounding the mine.

Responding to complaints about dust, he said: All trucks transporting final product from the plant area to the siding are covered with tarpaulins. The coarse size of the run-of-mine product from the shafts to the plant does not necessitate the covering of those trucks. Dust generated by vehicles, both our own and others, on the public gravel roads is actively managed by ZAC on a daily basis through an extensive dust suppressing programme. Rio Tinto did not respond to questions about TB.
A Wellcome Trust spokesperson said: When managing the investment
portfolio that funds our mission, we consider companies social and
environmental responsibilities carefully and engage to encourage them
to take these seriously. We do not comment on individual companies.
A spokesperson for Bill Gatess private office said: Bill and Melinda Gates wrote in their recent annual letter that the long-term threat [of climate change] is so serious that the world needs to move much more aggressively  right now  to develop energy sources that are cheaper, can deliver on demand, and emit zero carbon dioxide. Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in this effort and the breakthrough innovations needed and will continue to speak out about it. We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognise that there are many views on how best to address it.
But setting off for home, Dladla was convinced he had experienced the sharp end of a contradiction involving two of the worlds leading givers. It did not add up. He demanded: [They] must stop investing in these mines because the mines are making people suffer while the management enrich themselves ... They should divest.

South China Sea tensions escalate as China unveils plans for lighthouses
China to project naval power further from its shores, as construction increases on reefs in waters also claimed by nations including Vietnam and the Philippines

China unveiled a military strategy on Tuesday to project naval power further from its own shores and announced plans for two lighthouses on reefs in the South China Sea, moves likely to increase tensions with Washington and regional powers over the disputed waters.
A white paper issued by Chinas state council, or cabinet, said the navy will shift from a policy of defending offshore waters to a combined goal of offshore waters defence and open seas protection.

Several regional powers including the Philippines and Vietnam have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, one of the worlds busiest shipping routes.
The high seas were one of four critical security domains highlighted in the paper, the others being outer space, cyberspace and nuclear force, although the white paper underlined that China wants to avoid a nuclear arms race or the weaponisation of space.
In the more immediate naval sphere, however, Beijing appears more assertive. The paper also warned distant powers against provocative actions and interference in South China Sea affairs, an apparent reference to Washingtons very publicly-aired concerns about a large-scale Chinese land reclamation project around mostly uninhabited reefs and atolls in the disputed waters.
The Chinese works are turning submerged reefs into airstrips, and creating thousands of hectares of dry land on artificial islands, with the pace of construction speeding up in recent months.

One of the biggest US concerns is land reclamation on reef formations that would not otherwise allow China to claim territorial waters because they are submerged at high tide and not capable of supporting independent life.
Xinhua on Tuesday published pictures of lighthouse construction on two coral reefs, Chigua and Huayang, showing a groundbreaking ceremony that was perhaps more likely to involve ground creation.
The ministry of transport plans to construct two multi-functional lighthouses, which will provide efficient navigation service to the passing vessels and immensely improve the navigation safety in the South China Sea, Xinhua said in a report.
Plans to ramp up the US military presence in the area would probably involve flying over and sailing close to artificial islands that were only reefs before the latest building project, and China last week issued multiple warnings to a US plane flying above Fiery Cross reef, where China has built an early-warning radar station and airstrip.
Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said that the countrys reclamation activities were comparable with development of homes, roads and other infrastructure on the mainland.

From the perspective of sovereignty, there is absolutely no difference, Yan told a news conference to launch the new military white paper. Some countries with ulterior motives had unfairly characterized Chinas military presence and sensationalised the issue, Reuters reported.
The dispute has pushed together regional powers who a few years ago might have been as wary of neighbours with claims on the islands as they were of Beijing.
The Philippines have backed the US, and President Benigno Aquinosaid this week that they will continue to fly over the disputed areas despite Chinese warnings.
We will still fly the routes that we fly based on the international law from the various conventions we entered into, the AFP news agency quoted him saying.
The countrys defence minister also said he would ask for more defence equipment from Tokyo, the same day that Japan also agreed to bolster security and maritime safety ties with Malaysia and start talks on transfers of defence equipment and technology.

An umbrella group for mostly Shia militia and volunteer fighters, Hashed al-Shaabi, said it had dubbed a military campaign to cut off the Islamic State group in Anbar province as Operation Labaik ya Hussein, which roughly translates as We are at your service, Hussein.
The name refers to one of the most revered imams in Shia Islam.
I think its unhelpful, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said.
Weve long said ... the key to victory, the key to expelling Isil from Iraq is a unified Iraq , Warren said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State.
That required a unified Iraq that separates itself from sectarian divides, coalesces around this common threat and works to expel Isil from Iraq, he said.
The solution is a unified Iraqi government, he added.
Iraqi officials said about 4,000 fighters from the militia group were heading to the northern edge of Ramadi as a first step to eventually rolling back the Islamic State jihadists from the city, which fell to the extremists on 17 May.
The Iraqi government and its American allies had been reluctant to send in Iran-backed Shia militia in Anbar  a predominantly Sunni province. But the Isis advance in Ramadi  a major blow for both Baghdad and the US-led coalition  prompted Iraq to approve the deployment of the militias.
Washington is wary of the militias with ties to Iran but has said it would support a role for all forces that remain under the authority of the Iraqi government.
Many of them (militias in the Anbar area) are under the control of the central government, Warren said.
But he added: I dont know whether if any that are there are not under the control of the government.

That UK citizens not currently resident in the UK will not be eligible to vote in a referendum on British membership of the EU if they have lived outside the UK for more than 15 years seems absurd ( Report , 25 May). I am on that borderline and will miss out. The UK decided to be part of the EU and, like hundreds of thousands of other UK citizens, I took the opportunity that that decision offered to live and work elsewhere in the EU as soon as I finished studying. As a classic economic migrant, I found better job opportunities for my specific skills in a different part of the bloc, in my case Austria. WeBrits in Europe surely understand as much as any other UK citizen what EU membership means. We understand the complexities of the relationship and have a greater stake than any other British citizen in the outcome.
An out vote would severely disrupt our lives, in an economic sense and a private sense. If it was a question of deciding what should happen only inside the UK  a referendum, for example, on wind power  then maybe you could argue that a 15-year time barrier would make sense. You could argue that I might have lost touch with domestic UK politics. But this is about Britains relationship with the EU. There is absolutely no reason to exclude me. Downing Street says: No Briton under the age of 58 has had their say on the UKs membership of the European Union . Im 35. Cameron must give me and fellow Brits living in other parts of the EU a say in our own future. Anything else would be an absolute mockery of democracy.

 I am a Danish citizen but have lived in the UK for 40 years. When I arrived, there were restrictions on British citizens still in force or within recent memory. You could, for instance, not hold a bank account abroad, so I decided to keep my Danish citizenship. To change allegiance now would feel like a betrayal of my heritage.

Anders Ditlev Clausager
Thanks to Britains EU membership I have and enjoy the same rights, duties and privileges as other UK residents. The main exception is that I cannot vote in parliamentary elections. This has never bothered me, as I have little empathy with the first-past-the-post system, which in Denmark we replaced with a PR system in 1920. However, I can and do vote in local and European elections.
I am disappointed, if not greatly surprised, by the news that I and 1.5 million people like me will be denied a vote in the referendum on Britains membership of the EU. Clearly I, and my fellow Europeans who live here, have a vested interest, as do those UK citizens who live in other EU countries.
I imagine that many, or most, in both categories would vote in favour of Britain staying in Europe, and the Euro-secessionists are obviously worried that we might swing the outcome. I hope that Angus Robertsons views ( Opinion , 25 May) will be supported by other opposition leaders, if not by Nigel Farage  does Mrs Farage get to vote, or is she still a German citizen?
It should be a simple matter to extend the franchise in the referendum to all voters registered to vote in European elections. Surely this would be a fairer and more respectful approach.

 Angus Robertson of the SNP makes a good case when he argues that EU nationals living in the UK should be allowed to vote in a referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU. As he rightly says, If a vote for the UK to leave the EU was successful, it could have deeply damaging consequences on the lives of those people who have chosen to live and work here, and on their families. Will he do his best to ensure that the same logic is applied to any future referendum on Scottish independence? It is surely the case that there would be particularly damaging consequences for native-born Scots who have chosen to work and live elsewhere in the UK if there was a vote for Scotland to leave the union.
Dr David Mervin
Emeritus reader in politics, UniversityofWarwick
 Angus Robertson argues that, among other things, 16-year-olds being able to marry and join the armed forces are reasons to let 16- and 17-year-olds vote. In fact, marrying or joining the forces below the age of 18 requires parental consent, which is not a sign of great maturity and autonomy. Moreover, Mr Robertson fails to note that those who will be 16 or 17 during the EU referendum will also be obliged to stay in school or training until they are 18. In effect, they will not be fully exposed to the working world. Finally, his argument that we should enfranchise 16- and 17-year-olds to ensure that everyone has a fair say on our future would, by the same logic, be a reason to allow 11-year-olds to vote as well.
Having just turned 18 this month (and having voted in the general election), I hope my critique will not be seen as a product of any self-interest in preventing the enfranchisement of those younger than me.

 I am irritated, but not surprised, by the announcement that my French wife of more than 50 years will not be able to vote in the EU referendum. What shocks me more is the disenfranchisement of British subjects who have lived abroad for over 15 years, a category that includes my son. In fact, he lost his right to vote as soon as his name no longer appeared on our local electoral roll.
This situation contrasts with what happens to French citizens. Even if they have no property in France, they can still vote for 12 senators and 11 members of the national assembly. Though the French two-round electoral system can go wrong, as in 2002 when the far-right came ahead of the socialists in the first round, at least it shows that no French government can rule through a single first-past-the-post system which only gives them 37% of the votes cast. There are dangers of course in any system, especially if proportionality is carried too far  as shown notably in Israel  but this weeks announcement merely underscores the increasing democratic deficit in the UK.
Christopher Todd
Emeritus professor of French, University of Leeds
 Angus Robertson is entirely right to say that young voters need a say on their EU future. He cites the case of the Scottish independence referendum, in which 16- and 17-year-olds took a full, effective and responsible part. That reflects my experience across England and Wales of speaking to many groups of 16- and 17-year-olds, who are at least as well informed about political choices as any other age group. And this is a critical decision about their future, with a potential impact stretching for decades, which greatly enhances the case.
It is therefore extremely disappointing that David Cameron has ruled out their participation, together with saying that his referendum bill will exclude the 1 million EU citizens who have made their lives in the UK.
I urge your readers to sign the Young Greens petition , launched last week, for votes at 16 in this referendum. And I suggest they write to their MP to present the obvious case for allowing all members of our community, who have made their lives here and contribute in a myriad of ways, to have their say in this momentous decision.
This bill will be coming before a Commons in which Cameron has a wafer-thin majority, one that already looks to be dissolving over the Human Rights Act. The strength of the case for a fair vote needs to be made, and could win out with a strong campaign.

Christopher Clark and Kristina Spohr say correctly ( Moscows false memory syndrome , 25 May) that no written or oral assurances about Nato enlargement were given during the negotiations for German reunification in 1990. Touching that hot potato could indeed have derailed the talks entirely.
But that was far from all. After Germany reunited, Vclav Havel, the Czech president, called for Czechoslovakia , Poland and Hungary to enter Nato. The British prime minister and foreign secretary assured Soviet ministers that there was no such intention. Natos secretary general added that enlargement would damage relations with the Soviet Union. All that was true at the time. But then the intentions changed.
Russian officials lament that Mikhail Gorbachev , then Soviet president, failed to get these oral assurances in writing. Not surprisingly, the Russians nevertheless believe that they were misled: imagine our reaction if the position were reversed. Historians will argue for generations how far that accounts for the subsequent deterioration in Russias relations with the west.
The authors cite Russias defeat by Japan in 1905 to claim that Russian foreign policy is coloured by what they imply is a peculiarly Russian tendency to remember past debacles as humiliations. But past debacles have badly affected other countries too. Downplaying Russians genuine sense of humiliation after the Soviet collapse merely makes it harder to understand Russia today. And no, understanding Russia does not mean condoning present Russian policies.
Rodric Braithwaite
London
 The claim that the west gave no guarantees against Nato expanding eastwards may be literally true but is nevertheless misleading. As Clark and Spohr write, these developments belonged to a future that was not yet in sight.
Having freed eastern Europe and dissolved the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet leadership trusted that the west would reciprocate by respecting Russian interests, and was repeatedly reassured by western leaders in this respect.
As a member of the European parliament delegation to the Supreme Soviet in 1989, I witnessed this trust and later the increasing bewilderment of the Soviet/Russian participants in various conferences at the arrogant triumphalism of Nato and even EU speakers. But I thought communism had lost and we had all won? complained one.
Many Soviet leaders responsible for the miracle of 1990  like the former Soviet ambassador to Bonn, Valentin Falin  have complained bitterly that Mikhail Gorbachev naively trusted the west and gave away so much for so little.
So the attitude of the revived Russia of today should not come as a surprise.

At least 108 people were shot across three of Americas most crime-plagued cities during the holiday weekend, as violent new highs from a nationwide gun epidemic intersected with outcries over police violence in Chicago, Baltimore and New York.
Chicago, which tends to see a dramatic annual increase in firearm-related homicides beginning with warm weather at the Memorial Day holiday, experienced the worst violence. At least 56 people, including a four-year-old girl and three teenagers, were shot between Friday afternoon and early Tuesday morning, according to the Chicago Tribune . Twelve people were killed over the three-day weekend, twice as many as during the same period last year.
In Baltimore, a city still reeling from the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who suffered a spinal injury while in police custody just six weeks ago, Baltimore police said 28 people were shot, nine fatally, over the weekend. The latest spate of shootings makes May the citys deadliest month since 1999, according to the Baltimore Sun . Since late Sunday, two people were killed and eight injured in shootings across the city.
Its deplorable, city councilman William Pete Welch was quoted as saying in the Sun. The shootings and killings are all over the city. I dont think any part of the city is immune to this. Ive never seen anything like it.
The city erupted in protests over Grays death, which was the latest in a spate of shootings involving the death of a black resident at the hand of police. Six police officers have been indicted in the incident.

In New York City, 23 people were killed or injured in 16 separate shooting incidents across the city over the long weekend, according to the New York police department. There were five reported homicides over the holiday, including one stabbing. The number of shootings had mostly stayed the same year over year, dipping slightly from 17 incidents reported over the weekend in 2014.
Last year, Memorial Day weekend in the US was marred by a mass killing in Isla Vista, California, when 22-year-old Elliot Rodger stabbed his two roommates and one of their friends to death; shot and killed three people on the University of California, Santa Barbara campus; and injured 14 more before killing himself.
According to the Gun Violence Archive , 9,366 people have been injured by gun violence in America since 1 January 2015, up from 7,145 last year. A total of 4,868 people have been killed since the first of the year, up from 4,123 last year.
That number includes 1,155 children and teens injured or killed and 486 instances of defensive gun use.
In total, there have been 18,935 incidents of gun violence reported in 2015; among them, according to the gun-violence site, 1,705 were officer-involved shootings.

A G4S guard has been accused of smuggling refugees through security checks and on to flights to the United States and Britain.
Austrian prosecutors said the employee was one of 13 private security staff working at Vienna airport who were being investigated over suspicions they used their security access to allow refugees to board flights.
G4S, which claims to be the worlds biggest security company and runs security at several UK airports, said one of those arrested had been an employee and he had been sacked in line with Austrian law.
Graham Levinsohn, G4S regional CEO for Europe , said: I can confirm that in compliance with Austrian labour law, an employee responsible for checking visa documentation at Vienna airport on a contract with Austrian Airlines was dismissed in March following his arrest. A trial is ongoing and we are unable to comment further.
It is understood that the G4S employee accused in this case was employed by one of the airlines to check the size of passengers bags and their visas. G4S said it did not employ any of the others accused of involvement.
A spokesman for Austrian prosecutors said the authorities knew of 10 trafficking trips between last autumn and February. He declined to name any companies involved and said it was not yet clear how many people had been smuggled through security checks. The traffickers collected between 7,000 to 9,000 (5,000-6,500) per person, he added.
According to the Austrian authorities, the trafficking scheme came to light after the suspects tried to recruit a new accomplice, who then contacted the police.
One person who allegedly paid the suspects was subsequently refused entry into the US. The Austrian spokesman said one man from Poland and another from Sri Lanka had been placed in custody pending an investigation.

If theres a universal truth about people who dont own a television, its that theyll eventually tell you that they dont own a television. Even Pope Francis is at it. Hes just told an Argentinian newspaper that he hasnt watched a single television programme since 1990 .
Clearly, making this admission was a huge mistake on his part. It has made him look smug and out of touch  like everyone who doesnt watch TV. There are certain things that a pope can get away with. Being Gods representative on Earth who lives in a gilded palace within his own independent city-state is one of them. But not knowing how Breaking Bad ends? Unforgivable.
So to help Pope Francis seem like a man of the people again, heres a digest of everything thats happened on television in the past 25 years. Your holiness, if youre reading, please address the sainthood to the Guardian, London.

1990-1995  The Simpsons , a show you probably saw right before you stopped watching TV, has just got really funny. Where possible, show people that youve been watching by sporadically feeding the terms Doh, Ay caramba and Okily-dokily into your sermons.
1996-2000  By this point, The X-Files is in full swing. Its a series about conspiracies and cover-ups and the bald denial of science. Youd probably get on quite well with it. By the end of 2000, the hot new sensation of the day is Weakest Link , a gameshow much like the ones you probably grew up with, but presented by a woman who appears to hate her own audience. Think Pope Benedict and you wont be too far off.
2001-2005  This era saw the debut of The Office, a sitcom set in a workplace much like yours, but with fewer lavish staircases and ceilings that are made of actual gold. Also, theres a great new show called Lost . Its bold, its mysterious, it looks like it could be a winner.
2006-2010  Bailando por un Sueo debuts on Argentinian television, the latest in a wave of celebrity dancing shows to sweep the world following Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing With the Stars . However, Bailando por un Sueo stands out because most episodes tend to descend into outright nudity. Your holiness should probably avoid this. And, by the way, dont bother with Lost. The ending makes absolutely no sense.
2011-2015  The show everyone is talking about now is Game of Thrones , which is basically Bailando por un Sueo, but with dragons. There was also a show called Sex Box , which probably isnt worth going into in any meaningful level of detail. And, for the love of God, you have to stop saying, Ay caramba in your sermons. The Simpsons has been rubbish for about 15 years. You just look foolish. Try to keep up.

National Gallery hints that disputed art collection belongs to Ireland
Director Nicholas Pennys remarks seized on as acknowledgement of Dublins moral right to impressionist paintings bequeathed by Sir Hugh Lane

The National Gallery in London has given its clearest indication that Ireland has a moral, if not legal, right to a priceless collection of impressionist paintings that have been a cause clbre of Irish nationalism since the 1920s.
The 39 paintings, including some of the most celebrated works of the French artists Renoir, Monet and Manet, were left to the gallery by the art collector Sir Hugh Lane, who was killed on the Lusitania when it was hit by a German torpedo 100 years ago this month.
In a codicil to his will, Lane made it clear that he wanted the paintings to go to Dublin, but because the amendment was unwitnessed the collection stayed in London .
Since then, the works have been regarded by many in Ireland , including the poet WB Yeats, as a symbol of British colonial plunder. Now the National Gallery has expressed some sympathy for that view, in a concession welcomed by Dublin.

After years of campaigning the National Gallery has agreed to a series of compromise deals involving sharing the paintings, while ownership of the best of them, including Renoirs Les Parapluies, Manets Music in the Tuileries Gardens and Monets Lavacourt Under Snow, remained vested in London. But now the gallery has admitted this may not go far enough, a concession that could open the way for Ireland gaining a greater stake in the paintings when the sharing arrangement ends in 2019.
In a lecture to mark the centenary of Lanes death delivered at both the National Gallery and Dublin City Gallery the Hugh Lane , Roy Foster, professor of Irish history at Oxford University, called for ownership of the paintings to be transferred to Dublin as a way of righting a long-standing historical injustice.
Introducing the lecture, Nicholas Penny, the National Gallery director, publicly acknowledged Dublins moral claim to the pictures.
The National Gallery claims legal ownership of the paintings bequeathed by Sir Hugh Lane, but has long conceded that Dublin has some moral claim to them, he said.
Penny added that it was a difficult but important topic because there are so many cultural institutions which should, even if they dont, acknowledge that some other institution or some other country, has some sort of moral claim on the works of art in their possession.
He went on: To have reached a compromise of the kind we have is something that Im very pleased that we can advertise. We must always welcome people who feel we havent gone far enough in the type of acknowledgement we have made.
Penny has refused requests by the Guardian to elaborate on his remarks, but they are being seen as an acknowledgement of the gallerys tenuous ownership of the paintings.
Barbara Dawson, director of Dublin City Gallery the Hugh Lane, said: Nicholas Pennys remarks are the clearest public acknowledgement of Dublins right to these paintings and are very welcome.
Pennys remarks are the clearest public acknowledgement of Dublins right to these paintings and are very welcome
She added: They build on the legal agreement between the two institutions which allows the paintings to be shared between the two institutions and which acknowledges Dublins right to these works. However, as Hugh Lane bought these works with the specific purpose of building a gallery of modern art for Dublin, the Hugh Lane gallery continues to seek return of ownership.
As Dr Penny is aware, prestigious works such as those in the Sir Hugh Lane Bequest greatly benefit the institution which holds the ownership and assist in numerous ways in building and sustaining the profile of that public institution. It would be very desirable for the Hugh Lane gallery to have ownership returned so as to benefit the Hugh Lane gallery and Dublin as Hugh Lane intended.
Foster said Pennys comments were a welcome admission and said he thought he was implicitly admitting that Dublin had a moral right to the paintings. The historian said no one from the gallery had previously gone as far as Penny in expressing such an understanding line.
In his lecture, Foster described his righteous rage at seeing that the pictures continue to be labelled as the property of the National Gallery, London.

He said returning all of the works to Dublin would be an opportunity to right a historical wrong. The lecture concluded with a plea from Foster: By acknowledging true ownership of the Hugh Lane pictures, however belated, a long-standing injustice might actually be righted  which is a very rare thing to be able to do, and thus in time forgotten, which is surely the best way to commemorate history.
Dawson echoed these sentiments. As Prof Foster has pointed out not many historical injustices can be righted but this injustice can, she said.
Lucy McDiarmid, author of the Irish Art of Controversy and professor of English at Montclair State University, New Jersey, said Pennys remarks would be significant if they led to a change of ownership.
The lending agreements are evidence of the National Gallerys acceptance of [Irelands] moral claim. All thats new is Pennys wording. The situation  the division of the collection and trading paintings back and forth  remains the same. What would be new and without precedent in the post-1961 history of the paintings would be their actual return [to Ireland].

David Cameron and Vladimir Putin have agreed to resume talks to find a solution to the civil war in Syria .
The prime minister and the Russian president spoke on the phone for half an hour on Monday afternoon, with Putin congratulating Cameron on his election win.
A Downing Street spokesperson said the two leaders agreed their national security advisers should meet to restart talks on the Syrian conflict, which has raged for more years four years and killed an estimated 310,000 people .
On Syria, both leaders agreed that it is in the interest of both the UK and Russia to help find a solution to the civil war in Syria and particularly to stop the rise of [Isis], the spokesperson said.
Previous talks between Britain and Russia seeking to find a solution to the conflict broke down due to Putins continued support of the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad.
The spokesperson said the prime minister reiterated his belief that Assad could not be part of the solution in Syria, and the two leaders agreed that both countries should continue talks with the moderate Syrian opposition as part of this effort.
Cameron and Putin also spoke about the crisis in Ukraine. The spokesperson said the pair would continue to have deep differences, but: The priority now must be to deliver full implementation of the Minsk agreement. The prime minister emphasised the need for the trilateral contact group to continue to meet and to work through the outstanding issues.
The spokesperson added that Cameron concluded the call by noting that the UK and Russia had worked successfully together on the Iranian nuclear issue and that he hoped that in the years ahead [they] could find other issues where the UK and Russia could work together on matters of mutual interest.

How Curitiba's BRT stations sparked a transport revolution  a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 43
When Curitibas bus rapid transit stations were revamped in 1991, the futuristic glass-tube stops became a new symbol for the Brazilian city

Rua Padre Anchieta, as one of the main thoroughfares in Curitiba, Brazil, is a logical focal point for the citys bus network. But whereas bus stops in many other cities consist of little more than a sign and perhaps a bench , the ones on Rua Padre Anchieta are a bit different. In the middle of the street sit two tube-shaped stations, raised from ground level and protected from the elements, that open on to two-way express lanes. These lanes are reserved for long orange buses, which zip past slower car traffic and quickly shuttle passengers on and off at the stations on outward-folding ramps. Stations like this now exist throughout the city and metropolitan area.
Though difficult to imagine, these distinctive stations that are now the symbol of the city were originally a cost-cutting measure. Implemented as a practical way for the city to create faster mass transit without breaking the bank, they would go on to revolutionise transport, not just in Curitiba but in cities around the world.
For much of its existence, Curitiba was a sleepy town eclipsed by So Paulo, its much larger neighbour to the north-east. But by 1960, the citys population was beginning to grow significantly and within 20 years it had surged from 120,000 people to 361,000. Planners began wondering how to cope with this growth, and initially, there were plans to make the city more like Brasilia, the nations newly built capital. Avenues were to be widened and the city centre was to be adapted so that cars could become the primary mode of transport.

However, these plans would be cut short when Curitiban architect Jaime Lerner, then in his early thirties, took office as mayor in 1971. Under the dictatorship ruling Brazil in the late 1960s, the local governor selected Lerner as mayor, confident that the young architect wouldnt challenge his political order.
Lerner immediately began to shake things up. His vision for Curitiba turned the conventional urban planning at play in Brasilia on its head. Instead of widening avenues, he created a pedestrian mall in the city centre. And rather than turning frequently flooding arroyos into concrete drainage canals, he dammed the small streams to create parks, which would close during floods. But his most memorable contribution came in his ideas for the citys bus network.
Realising the importance of mass transit, planners called for the creation of subway lines, as well as widened streets for cars  but construction would be costly and could take decades to complete.
Instead, Lerner saw an opportunity in the one form of transport that many considered a lost cause: the bus. His idea was to devise a system that gave buses as many of the functional advantages of urban train systems as possible. He proposed to integrate dedicated bus lanes along the citys main arteries, with stations placed on medians along the routes. This would allow buses to run at speeds comparable to light rail, while dramatically reducing the cost.
A savvy deal-maker, Lerner made a bargain with private bus operators to pay for the creation of the new infrastructure, while they would provide the vehicles in exchange. With this trade-off in place, the first rapid bus lanes of Curitiba ended up costing 50 times less than rail.

Though the system wasnt an instant success after the opening of the first line in 1974, it gradually worked its way into the livelihoods of residents. In 1979, Lerner created the Rede Integrada de Transporte (Integrated Transport Network) to better manage the system and, as new routes were added, it began to show its full potential. By 1993, it was carrying 1.5 million passengers a day.
But high ridership created a problem. Buses in the system still used conventional boarding systems, where passengers entered through the front of the bus and paid fares on board. Lerner, who was back in office for his third term as mayor, came up with an elegant solution.
He called for a revamped station design that enabled faster boarding through multiple doors, and fares would be exchanged before entering the station  similar to subway or light-rail systems. Offboard payment would also allow for the creation of transfer stations, meaning one fare would cover the entire system. To top it off, Lerner gave the stations a distinctive look by placing them in futuristic glass tubes. These new tube stations debuted in October 1991 as part of the first Ligeirinho express line. Today there are 357 tube stations throughout the city.
With this important addition, the citys system became the worlds first bus rapid transit (BRT) network . Curitiba was the first to include the essential elements necessary for a BRT system to function effectively, says Andrs Fingeret, director of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy in Buenos Aires.

The success of Curitibas BRT, which had mostly gone unnoticed elsewhere, began to attract attention from other cities in Latin America. BRT would be soon be given the chance to prove itself on a much larger scale in Bogot, Colombia, a city of 8 million people. There, mayor Enrique Pealosa seized on the concept as a way to solve the crippling traffic problems of his city. After taking office in 1998 he borrowed and added to many of the systems concepts to build a viable BRT network, the Transmilenio. The stations, which feature many of the key functional elements of Curitibas, contributed to its success.
From there, BRTs success continued to grow, spreading as far as the United States, South Africa and China. However, Latin America continues to have a special relationship with BRT, where the systems carry more people than in any other region in the world . Due to the similar language and cultural context, it was easier for the success of BRT in Curitiba to be replicated elsewhere in Latin America, says Fingeret.
But as BRT took off internationally, it began to face problems back in Curitiba. Though ridership remained among the highest in the world for BRT, a 2012 article in CityLab reported that it was declining with respect to previous years , while car usage climbed.Curitiba newspaper Gazeta do Povo has noted that the stations did a poor job protecting passengers from extreme temperatures, and in some cases were inefficient at keeping out rainwater.

In addition, Curitibas population has now swelled to over 1.8 million people  more than four times what it was when the BRT system first opened. Mobility remains an issue in the city and, despite BRTs success, the city has made initial plans for the creation of a subway system  a form of transport Lerner called a thing of the past and did his best to avoid.
One other potential solution now being considered in Curitiba is the bicycle. Unlike other cities known for sustainability, Curitiba is only recently beginning to take cycling seriously. After two decades of hardly any new plans for cycling, a 2012 bicycle masterplan called for the creation of 400km of new lanes.
Fortunately, the bus system may be an asset toward these efforts. The BRT system and cycling can and should work together to provide better mobility options for the city, says Alexandre Costa Nascimento, editor of the Curitiba cycling blog Ir e Vir de Bike . Though critical of the implementation of the citys current bike masterplan, he notes: Planners should consider integration programmes such as bike racks, bike parking and fare incentives.
Despite these lingering issues, BRT in Curitiba has become a cultural touchstone, the citys answer to the freewheeling carnival spirit of Rio and the fast-paced, business-dominated lifestyle in So Paulo. The citys ministry of culture has set up the Tuboteca , a book exchange programme, in the citys bus stations. And, as if to remove any doubt as to their status as this citys symbol, Curitibas airport gift shop is built in the shape of a life-size BRT station.

This weeks roundup of the best city stories from the web takes a look at plans for an elevated park in the South Korean capital, the issue of heritage preservation in Calcutta and the death-defying leaps of urban explorers on the rooftops of Paris.
Wed love to hear your responses to these stories and any others youve read recently, both at Guardian Cities and elsewhere. Share your thoughts in the comments below.
Seoul aims high
An abandoned elevated highway in the middle of Seoul is being transformed into something call the Skygarden . Similar to New Yorks regeneration of a derelict elevated railway to make the High Line park, Seouls new grand urban project (designed by MVRDV ) aims to create a raised public space full of local plants and flowers, as well as cafes, street markets, libraries and greenhouses.
London v Houston
Some eye-catching maps over at City Metric lay the outline of Houston over cities around the world, from London to Lagos, highlighting just how sprawling that American city is. Placed over London, Houstons outline almost reaches the south coast, and encompasses Stevenage, Guildford and Tunbridge Wells  with a population just over half that of the UK capitals.
Barbara Speed writes: The urban sprawl which has resulted from the citys liberal approach to development brings its own problems: poor health outcomes (Houston is Americas fattest city), long commuting distances, congestion and poor public transport.
Calcuttas heritage
In Calcutta, a lack of guidelines for building demolition means houses are being indiscriminately torn down  and rapidly, too. As Amit Chaudhuri explains in Scroll , many people in the city are concerned that local architectural heritage is under threat because of real estate development.
Measures protecting not just heritage but both the cultural individuality and the multifariousness of the city as represented by its architecture are now long overdue in Calcutta, Chaudhuri writes. He calls for the declaration of heritage zones in the city. Their introduction would show an unprecedented commitment to re-engage with this great citys identity and history.
Parkour in Paris
Buildering, parkour, rooftopping : whatever the term, there are urban explorers who take serious risks to venture where others dont. CityLab shares this video of two such cityscape-scalers in Paris, climbing and leaping over the rooftops with great views over the City of Light.

Heard of New York?
Ann Friedmans tongue-in-cheek article in the LA Times aims to respond to the growing number of pieces  including from New York publications  that marvel at the so-called liveability of Los Angeles, a city known for its dominant car infrastructure . New York is a liveable place  who knew?, reads the title of Friedmans piece, which goes on to paint a picture of Angelenos discovering the apparent wonders of the Big Apple.
Southern Californians are overcoming their fears of subway germs, and reversing the American directive to go west, Friedman writes. Theyre finding that New York is more than a capitalist prison that runs on the fumes of the finance industry and nostalgia for CBGB. It now offers many of the lifestyle amenities that their hometown has boasted for decades.
Cycling in Byzantium
Istanbul suffers from traffic congestion, poor air quality and inadequate cycling infrastructure. This may change, however, as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) has pledged to build 1,050km of cycle lanes by 2023.
Embarq Turkeys Safe Cycling Design Manual for Istanbul provides guidelines for improving the citys cycling infrastructure. The report includes surveys with Istanbuls cyclists: 90% percent of respondents believed that there are major problems with cycling infrastructure in Istanbul; 35% thought there is a lack of signs on the road for safe navigation.
Bike lanes should be designed with this data in mind, writes Cigdem Crek zta in the City Fix . They should both serve neighbourhood life and integrate with public transit systems. Local decision makers need to raise awareness about cycling as a viable transport option and implement accessible infrastructure across Istanbul.

In 2012, as the Russian government announced the formation of a new greater Moscow, Marat Khusnullin, the deputy mayor, headed up an international competition that invited plans for the newly expanded city region. There is talk of a grand urban vision: new jobs, homes, infrastructure and city-wide improvements.
In the meantime, Moscow is already transforming. From plans for Zaryadye Park  Moscows first new park in 50 years  to burgeoning creative industries, rapid gentrification and a food revolution, the fabric of the city is being reworked. Plans involve pedestrianised embankments along a transformed riverfront , high-speed water transport and brand-new cycling infrastructure.
But how much has life really changed for Moscows residents? Has the transformation been for the benefit of everyone or just a select few? And what of the future of this new Moscow?
Starting 8 June, the Guardian will spend a week focusing on what life is really like in Moscow. From the city centre to the suburbs, from women to migrant workers to prisoners, from cycling to food to religion, we hope to get under the skin of this remarkable city  and we want Moscows residents to help shape our coverage.
Share your stories
Do you love the transforming Moscow or has your city got worse? How has life changed over the last decade  is it easier or more difficult? Do you consider the urban regeneration programme a success or is it doomed to failure, and will things get better or worse?

Yamoussoukro's Notre-Dame de la Paix, the world's largest basilica - a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 37
In the Ivory Coasts small and remote capital city stands a church as tall as St Peters in Rome, with personal air-conditioning for every seat. It is a bewildering legacy of the countrys founding father, Flix Houphout-Boigny

Notre-Dame de la Paix, built in Ivory Coasts administrative capital Yamoussoukro between 1985 and 1989, is a church of such national pride that, during the countrys decade of periodic civil conflict , citizens often sought refuge within its walls, knowing it would never be attacked.
Bishop Simon Ahouna recalls one visitor in particular, General Gu  who fronted the west African countrys first coup in 1999 and then ruled for 10 months  turning up at the basilica late one night. It was in 2000, and he came to pray. My advice to him was not to cling to power, says Ahouna, who heads the foundation charged with looking after the worlds largest basilica . It wasnt just him, either; whenever there were political crises, people would come and shelter because nobody would ransack here.
Gus assassination two years later plunged the country into a decade of civil turmoil, the seeds of which had been sown by ageing former president Flix Houphout-Boigny , Ivory Coasts founding father and the man who built Notre-Dame de la Paix.
As the 1980s drew to a close, Houphout-Boigny was nearing the end of three decades in power. Under his regime, Ivory Coast had grown rich on the back of cocoa exports and soaring world commodity prices. Not one to do things by halves, the leader affectionately known as The Old Man lavished much of that money on monuments  mostly in honour of himself.

In the economic capital, Abidjan, he built the towering Htel Ivoire, a favourite for French expatriates which for a time possessed the only ice-skating rink in west Africa. His birthplace, Yamoussoukro  formerly a small agricultural village  became home to a palace surrounded by a crocodile-filled lake; a visit there inspired VS Naipauls celebrated essay The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro , in which the writer suggested the reptiles symbolised Houphout-Boignys mystique over his people.
Elsewhere in Africa, other strongmen whose coffers were swelling on the commodity boom were doing similar things. Ivory Coasts 3,000-metre airport runway was one of only two on the whole continent that was long enough to land a Concorde; the other was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire), where President Mobutu Sese Seko built the Versailles in the Jungle in his birthplace of Gbadolite .
In 1983, Houphout-Boigny rechristened Yamoussoukro as his countrys new capital. Another crop of grand monuments followed, including the five-star Htel Prsident and a marble-floored, rarely-used convention centre. But neither embassies nor ministries ever relocated from Abidjan, so Notre-Dame de la Paixs chosen location was a near-deserted, forest-surrounded town of empty six-lane highways that led nowhere.
The resulting building was  and still is  staggering, nonetheless. A sudden mirage rises on a stretch of lonely scrubland; kaleidoscopic stained-glass windows and ivory-white columns are topped with a giant pearl dome that rises 158 metres above the bush. Inside there is standing room for 11,000, while each of the 7,000 seats in the nave has its own personal (Italian-built) air-conditioning system. Five-thousand shades of stained glass make up the windows, including one depicting Houphout-Boigny kneeling in front of Jesus.
Inside there is standing room for 11,000 people, yet attendances usually only number in the few hundreds

The history behind Notre-Dame de la Paixs construction is no less dramatic; negotiations with Rome were apparently fraught. Loosely modelled after St Peters basilica in the Vatican, Pope John Paul II requested the cupola be slightly lower so as not to surpass the papal one. Houphout-Boigny complied, but instead topped it with a giant golden cross, making this the worlds tallest church.
Pierre Fakhoury , the celebrated LebaneseIvorian architect behind the monument, frequently batted away claims that the basilica was intended to be the worlds largest. This project from Houphout was fundamentally driven by his faith. He had a deal with Ivory Coast, but most of all he had a deal with God, Fakhoury said in an interview on the basilicas 20th anniversary. The intention was never to surpass [St Peters in] Rome. But we surpassed it because evolutions in architecture  allowed us to go much further than previously possible.
In light of the basilicas brash imitation of the Vaticans holy shrine, a reluctant John Paul II consecrated the building in 1990 only on the condition that a hospital be constructed near the church. To date, that hospital remains unfinished .

Controversy also surrounded the financing of Notre-Dame de la Paix. By the time the basilica was finished, the Ivorian economy was reeling from a crash in world commodity prices, and so its estimated US $300 million tag raised eyebrows. The cost of the churchs construction had doubled the countrys debt.
Maintenance today costs around $1.5m annually, paid for by the foundation set up by the former president. He thought about everything, because this was inspired by God, says Bishop Ahouna.
With less than one-third of the nations population Christian, attendances at the basilicas services are low  usually numbering in the few hundreds, according to 63-year-old businessman Jean Baptiste Golly, a regular attendee. But you know what? I remember when this site was just farmland and yam plantations. Its incredible to think that today, it is a place which inspires prayer and soothes the soul.

Celebrate the Moscow metro's 80th birthday with a journey through the city's history - in pictures
When it opened on 15 May 1935, the Moscow metro was a subterranean Communist paradise: its chandeliers, marble, intricate mosaics and heroic statues created an opulent space that was accessible for the citys workers. Eighty years on, it transports up to nine million people a day, with expansion plans set to make it the worlds fourth largest subway system by 2020

The first designs for Moscows metro were submitted to city authorities under the reign of Tsar Nicholas II in 1902. Moscow wanted to rival earlier systems in London, Paris and Berlin (New Yorks opened in 1904)  but the Russian citys plans were repeatedly derailed: by the uprising of 1905, the first world war and the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. Metro plans were finally approved under Joseph Stalin in 1931 and construction work is pictured here two years later

The first line ran from Sokolniki () to Dvorets Sovetov. Soviet workers carried out the construction under Iron Commissar Lazar Kaganovich  at the cost of many lives  but the engineers were from the London Underground. Stalins secret police arrested many on espionage charges  apparently they had gained a dangerous knowledge of the subway and the citys layout  and they were deported in 1933 after a show trial. Architect Charles Holden was one of the advisers, and the barrel-vaulted hall he built at Gants Hill on the Central Line echoes the standard Moscow station design

An estimated 285,000 people rode the Moscow metro on the day it opened, 15 May 1935. Its construction was hailed as a technological and ideological triumph for socialism and Stalinism. After witnessing its first days, the German poet and playwright Bertholt Brecht wrote : Now that the railway was built in accordance with the most perfect plans/ And the owners came to view it and/ To ride on it, they were the selfsame people/ Who had built it.

Dvorets Sovetov, another in the first batch of stations, was named after Stalins planned Palace of the Soviets. The building  on the site of the demolished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour  was to be the tallest structure in the world and topped with a 100-metre statue of Lenin. The station was decorated with marble from the cathedral, but plans for the palace were scuppered by the second world war and it was never built. The station was renamed Kropotkinskaya in the 1950s after anarchist Peter Kropotkin, who was born nearby. The cathedral was rebuilt after the collapse of the Soviet Union

Habitat 67, Montreal's 'failed dream'  a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 35
The pilot project of Moshe Safdies mission to reinvent apartment living became mired in controversy  yet it remains a functioning icon of 1960s utopianism, and one of that periods most important buildings

Of the 90 pavilions built for Expo 67, Montreals 1967 worlds fair , only two still stand more-or-less intact. One is Buckminster Fuller s famed geodesic dome: though the acrylic cover burned off in a fire in 1976, the former United States pavilion is now the Montreal Biosphere , a museum devoted to the environment. The other pavilion to live on is Habitat 67  the young Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie s wildly ambitious, government-sponsored attempt at reimagining apartment living, and one of the most important buildings of the 1960s.
Part of Canadas centenary celebrations, Expo 67 was a point of pride for a city that was alive with newness  a new metro system, new downtown skyscrapers and a burgeoning Qubcois nationalist movement (it was on a visit to Expo that Charles de Gaulle made his famous  Vive le Qubec libre!  speech).
The event drew 50 million visitors (still an Expo world record) to what was then a country of 20 million and a city of under three million. And amid the various nations trumpeting and boasting, the snaking monorail system , the snack bars and souvenir stands, stood a modular jumble of prefabricated concrete housing cubes which have since drawn comparisons to everything from Lego to a Cubist painting or the pueblos built by native tribes in the southwestern US.

Habitat 67 echoes a little known post-war Japanese architectural movement called Metabolism, whose proponents believed buildings should be designed as living, organic, interconnected webs of prefabricated cells. Perhaps the most famous Metabolist incarnation is Tokyos Nakagin Capsule Tower , another pile of concrete cubes dotted with porthole-like windows, erected in 1972. The influence of Le Corbusier, especially the French masters love affair with concrete, on Habitat 67 is also clear. But Safdie set his own course, attempting to balance cold geometry against living, breathing nature.
It was while travelling across North America as a student that Safdie surveyed grim apartment high-rises and unsustainable suburban sprawl. He returned home to Montreal with a mission: to reinvent the apartment building. He longed to create, as he put it in a 2014 Ted Talk, a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit  Habitat would be all about gardens, contact with nature, streets instead of corridors (each cube has access to a roof garden built atop an adjacent cube).
Moshe Safdies 2014 Ted Talk
Habitat 67 was a pilot project, intended as just the first application of a salve for urban ills that would spread across the world. Only it didnt quite work out that way. The Walrus, Canadas answer to the Atlantic magazine, called Habitat 67 a  failed dream .
From the beginning, the finances were a mess. The budget  it was funded by the federal governments Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation  spiralled out of control, despite the assembly line-style production, which was carried out at a specially built, on-site prefabrication plant. To recoup costs, the government set rents so high that no one could afford them. Then, as the 1960s began to fizzle out, modern utopian architecture did, too.
By the early 70s you have a global economic downturn, the oil crisis, Nixon de-links the dollar from the gold standard, and the Vietnam war is raging ... the money for these types of projects simply dries up, says Indebir Singh Riar , assistant professor of architecture at Carlton University in Ottawa.
The concrete needed frequent repair. One former resident, who lived there more than a decade ago for three years (and stilll prefers to remain anonymous, lest he offend the buildings diehard cheerleaders), says he fled after developing asthma and finding his cat dead. From an architectural point of view, its spectacular, but water got into that concrete, and mould seeped into the ventilation system. It blew the spores around. By the mid-1980s, the building was in private hands.

Though there may be some truth in the pronouncement of Habitat 67s failure, it doesnt tell the whole story. Too much has been made of the socialist ideals the building supposedly embodied. Though Safdie has a history of kibbutz living, Habitat was never meant to be public housing; it was built for middle-class city-dwellers, the kind who flee to the green suburbs once they start a family.
Safdie himself still maintains a pied--terre in the 13-storey building, which stands on a narrow, man-made peninsula just south of the Old Port section of Montreal. Today Habitat apartments  many of them linking two or three cubes, luxuriously renovated and connected into sprawling residences with multiple terraces and views over the water  are often listed by Sothebys. Longtime resident Jeannie Saunders, whose home is a four-cube penthouse, says that Habitat will always be a a community, where people have a feeling of friendship with neighbours, a special place to live.

It may never have achieved affordability but the building, just two years shy of its 50th birthday, remains a potent symbol. In 2009, the Quebec government gave it heritage status, recognising that despite the controversies and maintenance issues, Habitat represents much more than a yuppified ghost of 1960s idealism.
Safdies expression For everyone a garden is still an incredible idea, says Riar. At such a young age, he realised that suburbs are not necessarily bad, but city living is important. He asked: if people had more space and light, would they stay in the city? Its a very noble idea.

A four-storey high rug of twinkling LEDs proclaims the glories of Turkmenistans textile traditions above a rain-soaked scene, casting a pinkish glow across the golden arches of the neighbouring McDonalds. Across the way, a half-finished Nepalese pagoda towers over a faceted glass dome of Belgian produce, while Russia thrusts a gargantuan mirrored canopy into the air, aggressively cocked like a missile next to Estonias wooden shed. A bugle call is the signal for a Korean marching band to strike up, trumpeting the arrival of the countrys futuristic white space-blob, just as an Argentinian drumming troop thunders into action next door.
Sprawling across 110 hectares on the outskirts of Milan , this crazed collage of undulating tents, tilting green walls and parametrically-contorted lumps can mean only one thing: Expo 2015, latest in a long and controversial tradition of worlds fairs, has landed.
Weve tried to build a stage where all the actors can make their voices heard, says its design director Matteo Gatto, fresh from touring the Italian prime minister and the pope (who has his own, relatively restrained, pavilion ) around the frenzied fairground. And Gatto appears to have achieved his aim: the 140 participating countries and brand sponsors are screaming their presence at full volume.
In the centre of Milan, however, others have been making their voices heard in a different way. As the fair opened on May Day, thousands took to the streets to protest , while violent splinter groups smashed shopfronts and torched cars. The Expo is a machine for burning public money, said one protester, carrying a No Expo banner. It promised to bring jobs and boost the economy, but its being run by voluntary labour and has wasted billions on pointless infrastructure.

It claims to be a celebration of slow food, local agriculture and healthy eating, added another activist, carrying an anti-globalisation placard. Its official motto is Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life , but it is sponsored by corporate giants like Coca-Cola and McDonalds. The whole thing is beyond a joke.
Expo 2015 has been one of the most controversial worlds fairs ever staged in Europe. It has been plagued by escalating budgets , seeing total expenditure balloon to around 13bn, including the costs of building new transport infrastructure to service the site, 10 miles from the centre of town. It has suffered interminable construction delays, meaning 1m has had to be spent on building camouflage structures to hide the unfinished pavilions for the opening. And, while being touted as a model of a cleaner, post-Berlusconi Italy, it has been damned by charges of corruption and bribery, seeing seven senior managers and former members of parliament arrested last year , and more indicted for bid rigging a few months later. So what does the city have to show for its seven-year struggle?
Traipsing the kilometre-long gauntlet of novelty structures, past Daniel Libeskinds twisted totem poles for Siemens and Norman Fosters 60m rippling pink concrete walls for the United Arab Emirates , its hard not to see the whole endeavour as a monumentally misplaced allocation of resources. The exhibition content is, in the main, as vapid as the architecture is extravagant. Visitors roam like herds of lobotomised oxen in search of nourishment, from clambering on a net over some flowerbeds inside Brazils giant climbing frame, to the touch-screen excitement of playing Lithuania or not? (a game of swiping national dishes into a digital shopping basket). Most countries exhibitions feel like a cross between a Waitrose advert and a travel agents trade fair  immersive multimedia dioramas of bountiful produce and spectacular scenery, dotted with stalls selling craft trinkets and samples of cheese.

We thought we had a chance to do something radically different, says Stefano Boeri, the Milanese architect and planner originally responsible for coordinating the Expo masterplan when the city won the bid in 2008, until he was removed in 2010. Knowing that previous Expos have been quite weak, and have failed to leave a serious legacy, we thought we could really do something that would benefit the city.
Boeri assembled a crack team to develop the masterplan. Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron were joined by the London Olympics chief adviser on architecture and urbanism, Ricky Burdett , American designer and cradle to cradle evangelist William McDonough, and Joan Busquets, the Spanish architect and planner responsible for much of the good that resulted from the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. It would have been hard to conjure a better legacy-minded think-tank on paper.
We really wanted to get away from the usual vanity fair of competing architectural innovations, says Jacques Herzog, speaking from his studio in Basel. I was honestly shocked when I visited the Shanghai Expo [in 2010]. You were blinded by the amount of design, so by the time you left the show you had forgotten everything about the exhibition. We wanted to focus on the content, and use the site as a laboratory for creating something useful for Milan, which wouldnt leave the usual wasteland of ruins.
Their plan did away entirely with the conventional format of bombastic national pavilions, sweeping the countries under a field of tent-like canopies instead, arranged in long strips either side of a central axis. We went back to the Roman foundation of Milan, says Boeri, laying out big Cardo and Decumano axes with lateral side-streets, abolishing any kind of hierarchy, so there would be no difference in size between the rich and poor countries.

Embodying the agricultural theme, half of each plot would be given over to a cultivated garden, where the countries would grow a food of their nation and then bring their produce to a kilometre-long table running down the central boulevard  like a global last supper, says Herzog.
In reality, you can now admire photos of the fairtrade coffee cultures of East Timor and Rwanda, then go and have an Illy espresso at the sponsored coffee bar. Or you can learn about the cocoa industries of Cameroon and Gabon, then stuff your face with Ferrero products at the Nutella concept bar .
As for the masterplan structure, it was planned to be shovel ready for development after the Expo, so as not to leave Milan lumbered with the usual white elephant. It was a very simple plan to create something that leaves behind a physical armature for a city, says Burdett. So when the tents came down, you would have the infrastructure there, with all the services already laid.
As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that this light-touch plan was too radical for the international exposition movement and its attendant entourage of sponsors to adopt. Judging by the track-record of what other Expos have left in their wake, the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) in Paris  the intergovernmental agency responsible for co-ordinating worlds fairs since 1928  appears even less aligned to the subtleties of city-making than the steamrolling bureaucracy of the International Olympic Committee. The BIE might talk in lofty platitudes about the intellectual legacies that are supposed to emerge in the form of grand declarations and charters, but in reality there seems precious little care taken to ensure the host city is left better off than it was found.

Despite brimming with positivity about the final result, Gatto is candid about the difficulties of developing the Expo masterplan. It was not so easy to make the design advisors ideas a reality, he says. We couldnt force the participating countries to do what we wanted  the rules of the BIE mean we have to give them freedom to design what they want. The structure of the routes and public space is still as we planned, but the sultans and sheikhs will always have their way and follow their own ideas. And thats really what makes the beauty of the Expo, this amazing variety.
The architectural smorgasbord is certainly varied, as you stroll from Qatars concrete fort, topped with a giant woven basket , past the mirrored labyrinth of Iran , to the bloated Italian pavilion , which appears to be modelled on a Chinese shopping mall. When you get to the one structure designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron at the end  a series of wooden barns for Carlo Petrinis Slow Food movement  you sense the whole thing might actually have been a bit insipid if left in the hands of their restrained Swiss good taste. Because, ultimately, surely the only point of visiting an Expo is to marvel, drop-jawed with morbid fascination, at the bizarre architectural freak-show, and be entranced by the same sense of contemptuous captivation that comes from watching the Eurovision Song Contest. It is a spectacular mess, but its also fascinating to see national ambitions embodied, side by side, in a line-up of skin-deep architectural flourishes.
But then youre rudely awaken out of your kitsch reverie by remembering quite what will be left, and at what cost it all came. Before the Expo arrived, this site was a place of overgrown, formerly agricultural land. The intention was to leave it in such a way that development could happen in a productive landscape, creating a new kind of high-density garden city once the tents were taken down. Such a bucolic idea was soon abandoned and, for ease of development, the entire site has been covered with an enormous concrete foundation slab  at a cost of 224m , mysteriously up 60m from the original tender price.
The elaborate 'canal city' idea didnt quite turn out as planned either

The elaborate canal city idea didnt quite turn out as planned either. The Expo was to be a catalyst for reviving Milans network of waterways , opening up canals to irrigate surrounding farms. Work was begun, before it was realised that the water pressure would not be strong enough to reach the fields. The revised plan met with huge environmental opposition, so instead the network was to be buried underground. With 60m already spent on the project, the fabled  Vie dAcqua  has yet to materialise. It is the real scandal of the Expo, says Boeri. A ditch going to nowhere that will never be used.
Nor does the future look much brighter. The Arexpo company  the joint-venture Expo legacy vehicle, co-owned by the City of Milan, the Region of Lombardy and, in smaller parts, the Fiera Foundation and City of Rho  is now in the unenviable position of trying to find a buyer for the site, a place severed on all sides by motorways and railway lines.
Having first acquired the land at a vastly inflated price from private owners (for 160 per square metre, when agricultural land in the area is worth 8-12 per square metre), the public sector is also burdened with trying to make back some of the huge outlay on remediating the site and building the Expos infrastructure. Recently, the site was offered up for sale at 315m  to deafening silence. What happens next is still up in the air, with vague plans ranging from building a new stadium , to a scientific campus for the State University of Milan and an innovation hub for tech startups. But dont worry, at least therell be a charter .

Theres simply been far too much speculation on the land and now theyre stuck with it, says Emanuele Braga, co-founder of Macao , a politicised arts group that has been organising campaigns against the Expo since it was first announced. The first mistake was buying land from private developers; the second was covering it all in concrete  when the theme is about feeding the planet and reviving urban agriculture. They should have used a site they already owned that was in need of regeneration.
I meet Braga in a former slaughterhouse now squatted as the HQ of Macao, on the other side of town from the Expo. Working groups busy themselves discussing labour conditions and workers rights, while a symposium led by Robin Hood Minor Asset Management takes place upstairs. (A few days later, Macao would stage an occupation of the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, in protest against labour conditions in Saadiyat Island , where the Guggenheim is building its latest outpost.)
Standing on the slaughterhouse rooftop, Braga points to a landscape of derelict meat- and fish-market buildings spreading out before us that he says would have made an ideal setting for an Expo themed around food. But such a site would have necessitated the intelligence of adaptive reuse and careful planning, of a kind clearly at odds with the tabula rasa predilections of the Expo juggernaut.
Few can point to Expos that have left a lasting legacy, other than the Victorian originator and its Crystal Palace

One hundred and sixty four years on from the first such extravaganza, Londons Great Exhibition of 1851 , it seems clearer than ever that the format of the world exposition is well past its expiry date, leaving a trail of debt and destruction wherever it strikes. When pushed, even Expo boosters can point to few events that left a positive, lasting legacy for their cities other than the Victorian originator  which brought us the Crystal Palace and left a great axis of cultural institutions lined up along Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the famed Albertopolis, which the Olympic park is now trying to mimic.
Sure, Vancouvers 1986 Expo opened up its waterfront for development , and Montreal 67 left a nice park with a big Bucky dome and a small amount of experimental housing , but all these benefits could have been achieved without the vast expense of putting on a fair. For several billion dollars, cities could build vast quantities of real, affordable housing and acres of beautiful, truly public space.
Sevilles Expo 92 was one of the largest ever at the time, sprawling across 215 hectares dotted with geodesic domes and snaking monorails, at a cost of almost 10bn. Most of the structures were intended to be temporary, but the city had no money left to remove them following the event. They mostly still stand there, abandoned, as forlorn symbols of a future that never arrived , with the first European space rocket and a strange pyramid of national flags still looming above a post-apocalyptic landscape. The event left the city mired in debt for decades.

Hannover 2000 suffered a similar fate . Buoyed by the light-headed optimism of the Millennium year, the bubble was soon pricked when only around half of the expected number of visitors turned up, once again leaving the region saddled with debt and a landscape of overgrown ruins. The site was laid out by Albert Speer Jr, son of Hitlers architect, who also planned the Beijing Olympics  a strangely prescient choice, given his father coined the idea of ruin value in his grandiose Nazi works.
Hot on the heels of the Beijing Olympics, Shanghais 2010 Expo was the biggest in history, spread across an area five times the size of Milans exposition at a cost of $50bn (32bn)  a level of ambition that saw 18,000 families forcibly displaced , according to Amnesty International. The Chinese pavilion has since been converted into an art museum, while most others have been demolished to make way for cranes, now busy building a new swathe of mixed-use city across the site. Better City, Better Life was the theme  for those who can afford it.

It is a scale of autocratic ambition only likely to be matched by the next Expo, to be hosted in the global capital of architectural hubris, Dubai; home of the tallest building in the world, the largest aquarium on the planet, and an artificial archipelago shaped like the world itself, all soon to be joined by  the worlds first indoor city . Expo 2020 is the jewel in the crown of Dubais national programme of steroidal grands projets but, given the troubled trajectory of fellow Gulf state Qatars endeavours for the 2022 World Cup , the world is watching with trepidation.
Still, in the fantasy playground of the United Arab Emirates, where impossible dreams are daily conjured from the desert at untold human and environmental costs, perhaps the world expo movement has finally found its spiritual home. For the good of other cities around the world, may it be its final resting place.

        <title>The Habana Libre hotel, pawn in Castro's battle against the US - a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 34</title>

Latin Americas tallest, largest hotel was the Habana Hiltons slogan when it opened in Cubas capital in 1958. Eight months later, Fidel Castro and his revolutionaries marched into this unapologetic icon of capitalism to begin their socialist rule of Cuba. Soon, the hotel was nationalised and renamed Habana Libre (Free Havana); throughout its existence, Habana Libre has charted the turbulent relationship between Cuba and the US.
The US fought on Cubas side in its war of independence from Spain, ending with victory in 1898. Following the conflict, the US helped revive the ravaged islands infrastructure and economy  though not without considerable self-interest. The next decades saw a glut of sugar money fuel the flamboyant expansion of Havana . The baroque and neo-classical styles of colonial Cuba were left behind, and an eclectic modern style took over in the form of mansions and edifices built in the newer quarters of the city.
Havana turned into a convenient backyard playground for US tourists, partly thanks to prohibition in the 1920s. But with casinos and nightclubs came the US mafia, and with increasing investments came US-backed dictators such as Fulgencio Batista.

For Batista, the hotel was a project of considerable symbolic value. Built in a strikingly prominent location at the top of La Rampa, a street sloping up from the sea in the downtown district of Vedado, the project was funded through the pension plan of the Cuban Catering Workers Union, to be run by Hilton Hotels International, and designed by the Los Angeles firm of Welton Becket &amp; Associates along with a Cuban firm, Arroyo and Menndez.
Castro set up the new regimes command post in room 2324 of the hotel: the Continental Suite
When complete, an advertisement for the new hotel noted that the 30-storey block had 630 lavishly appointed rooms and suites, a casino, a Trader Vics and a terrace bar. The opening in March 1958 was by all accounts a spectacular affair, with Becket and Conrad Hilton playing host to officials, celebrities and journalists, many flown in from the US.
Architectural historian Peter Moruzzi, author of Havana Before Castro , explains what the hotel meant to Cubas then ruler: Batista considered the Habana Hilton among his proudest achievements, its huge blue-lit rooftop Hilton name announcing to the world that the eminent Conrad Hilton had confidence in Cubas future  that the country was a safe place in which to invest  and that tourists could now find in Havana the modern comforts they expected in a top international resort.
Batista could not take comfort in the Hilton for long, however. With the revolution making rapid advances, he fled Cuba in the early hours of 1 January 1959, while some of his associates welcomed in the new year in the Hilton ballroom. The revolutionaries entered Havana in a jubilant motorcade on 8 January, and Castro made for the Hilton. According to Moruzzi, The Hilton was located at the highest point in Havana and visible throughout the city; it was the most prominent symbol of American influence in Cuba . Thats why Castro made it his provisional headquarters when he took Havana in January 1959.
Photographs from the time show scruffy soldiers lounging with guns in a plush lobby, sitting on the floor eating, machetes still attached to their belts. Castro set up the new regimes command post in room 2324 of the hotel: the Continental Suite. Press conferences and announcements were held here, as were meetings with visiting leaders from other countries.

It was also in the lobby of the Hilton that Castro told a gathered crowd: If the Americans dont like what is happening in Cuba , they can land the marines, and then there will be 200,000 gringos dead. With two floors of the hotel given to the incipient Soviet embassy, changing allegiances were evident. In 1960, the hotel was taken over by the state and its name changed to Habana Libre.
Architecture in Havana changed after the revolution. The multi-centred city was  and still is  a museum of sorts for every European style of building seen in the last few centuries, many with local interpretations. The new regimes attempt at revolutionary architecture came with Castro commissioning a set of national art schools . Two out of five, designed by the architect Ricardo Porro, were completed. These were exuberant, expressive, curvy brick structures, soon criticised for being expensive and idiosyncratic. But they were true products of the revolution for another reason  their design, using brick arches, was directly influenced by the US embargo that caused a shortage of steel.

From the 1960s, Soviet influence is held to have steered post-revolutionary Cuban architecture towards more plain and functional designs  whereas the pre-revolution 1950s had witnessed the construction of several tall buildings in Havana including the FOCSA building , still the tallest in Cuba. The last of those buildings, opened months before the revolution, was the Habana Hilton.
The Habana Libre continues to function as one of the citys leading hotels. In 1996 its management was shared by the Cuban government with the Spanish Sol Meli group and the hotel was subsequently restored, the highlight being the re-emergence of an enormous ceramic mural by Cuban avant-garde painter Amelia Pelez.
Up until 1959, Cubas legislature had assembled in El Capitolio  a replica of the US Capitol building built in 1929. Castros regime shifted it from this too-obvious reminder of the past  but it is perhaps a sign of time elapsed that, as US-Cuba relations ease, the National Assembly is due to meet in a restored Capitolio this year for the first time since the revolution. Meanwhile, in February this year, Paris Hilton visited Havana and the hotel her great-grandfather Conrad inaugurated in 1958. From the selfie she took with Fidel Castros son, it would appear all is forgiven.

        <title>Johannesburg's Ponte City: 'the tallest and grandest urban slum in the world' – a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 33</title>

On the 13th and 14th floor you could get anything from a blow-job to an acid trip in a few minutes. Essentially, the building was hijacked.
In his penthouse apartment on the 52nd floor, Mike Luptak is talking about the bad old days when Ponte, the tallest residential building in the southern hemisphere , fell into the hands of drug dealers, gangsters, pimps and prostitutes. The inner core of this 173-metre high concrete cylinder became a giant rubbish tip piled up as far as the fifth floor. Among the refuse and junk were, so legend has it, the bodies of residents who took a suicidal leap.
A great deal has changed since then. Featured in newspaper articles, photography exhibitions , documentaries and movies, Ponte has come to symbolise the rise and fall and rise again of South Africas commercial capital. It is part of an inner-city renaissance in recent years that has seen previous no-go areas turned into gourmet food markets, artists studios and trendy apartments.

The young middle class are moving back into Ponte 40 years after it first opened its doors amid a surge of optimism and wall-to-wall shag carpeting. Johannesburg , an economic engine and magnet for immigrants, can claim to be the New York of Africa, so this audacious experiment in skyscraper homes, designed by 29-year-old architect Rodney Grosskopff, was the height of aspiration for apartheids ruling white minority.
Through the 1970s, this was the crme de la crmeof living, says Luptak, 30, who gave up his job as a chartered accountant to run youth projects here. If you had this address, you were part of the in-crowd.
In those days the surrounding area, Hillbrow, was a vibrant multicultural hub of bookshops and cafes. But not for long. By the 1980s the middle class was fleeing to the suburbs, and by the 1990s Hillbrow  home to immigrants from the rest Africa  became rife with drugs, poverty, prostitution, gun crime and urban degradation, and Ponte was dragged down with it.
This was, perhaps, the tallest and grandest urban slum in the world, a gravity-defying dystopia that might have sprung from the imagination of a science fiction writer. It is said two floors were stripped bare and, along with the downstairs parking lot, became an informal brothel. Luptak adds: From a kitchen sink, there was a tomato plant growing with tomatoes the size of tennis balls.

By the late 1990s there was talk of turning Ponte into a prison. But then, in 2001, it began a journey to redemption. Its owner, the Kempston Group, hired a husband-and-wife management team, Elma and Danie Celliers, to set about its rehabilitation. A decade later, almost all 54 floors had been refurbished, many from scratch, with around 2km of electrical wiring and sanitary piping used on each. Eight lifts had been refurbished.
Quinton Oosthuizen, construction and maintenance manager for Ponte, who led the team clearing out its central core, told South Africas Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper: It was nasty; we pulled out some very funny things. Anything from mattresses, rubble, loose steel, kitchen and bathroom fittings  even dead stray cats.
To stand in the core today craning ones neck is to feel like an ant gazing up the inside of a monumental concrete tree. At the top is a blue disc of sky. Ponte is now home to up to 3,000 middle- and working-class people including young professionals , students and Congolese, Nigerian and Zimbabwean immigrants.
Luptaks 120-square -metre home is pleasantly furnished with porcelain tiles, wooden floors, a granite kitchen top, hanging plants, three chandeliers, a flatscreen Samsung TV with sound system and a framed picture of Jimi Hendrix. His north-facing window offers a stupendous view, including the FNB stadium that hosted the 2010 football World Cup opening game and final. For this he pays just 5,100 rand (279) per month.

Luptak and his business partner, Nickolaus Bauer, have set up a social enterprise at Ponte called Dlala Nje , which organises cultural, educational and sporting activities for local children, taking advantage of the 2,000 square metres of commercial space and a swimming pool on the ground floor. They also run tours of the building and neighbourhood that they hope will challenge perceptions. Most South Africans live in constant paranoia because of the crime issue, Luptak muses. They also live in bubbles. They spend the weekends at braais [barbecues] complaining about things. Theyre the worlds best complainers but they wont do anything about it.
He admits, however, that Hillbrow is still not everyones cup of tea. Ponte has 24-hour security guards and biometric fingerprint access at all entry points to the building. Hillbrow is still a very dangerous place but its changed a lot from five-to-10 years ago.
Philip Blooms mini-documentary on Ponte
Other parts of the inner city are forging ahead too, gradually shaking off Johannesburgs notoriety for danger and violence. The past decade has seen urban regeneration projects including Braamfontein, the Maboneng Precinct , Newtown and The Sheds@1Fox , with light industrial buildings and warehouses converted to apartments, art galleries, cinemas, hotels, restaurants, theatres and markets featuring organic foods and craft beers. They attract a young, multi-racial crowd  a modern face of South Africa  although critics say they are islands of development surrounded by oceans of urban poverty.
Some of the shops in these nodes sell t-shirts and metal cut-outs portraying the Johannesburg skyline. The 54 storeys of Ponte, of course, loom large. It has a sad story, says Luptak, but also a resilient one.

The history of Mexico has been written, all too often, with the blood of the victims of unspeakable tragedies. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Aztecs and numerous other civilisations performed gruesome human sacrifice rituals. Today, bloodthirsty drug cartels terrorise local populations, sometimes with the cooperation of the authorities, as was revealed during last years massacre of 43 student protesters from an Ayotzinapa school . No one place embodies that painful history more than Tlatelolco.
Today a district of Mexico City , Tlatelolco began as a city-state on the shore of Lake Texcoco, eventually overtaken by the ascendant Aztecs, who made it a part of their empire. During the brutal conquest of Mexico by Hernn Corts, in 1521 Tlatelolco was the site of the last battle between the Aztecs and the Spanish conquistadors. In the battle, Corts triumphed, and some 40,000 Aztecs were killed. Centuries later, a plaque would be built on the site that reads: The battle was not a triumph, nor was it a defeat. It was the painful birth of the mestizo nation that is the Mexico of today.
The deaths of the battle left a scar on the national psyche of the new colony, and later Mexico . The Spaniards did their best to pave over Tlatelolcos dark history, demolishing its temple and using the stones to build a church. Much later, in the 1950s, Mexican leaders resolved to finally right the wrongs suffered on the site, putting it to good use by building a modern housing project there.
It was claimed that the complex would improve the lives of its inhabitants through the virtues of modern design

Naturally, the new plans were the subject of more practical motives too. Mexico City had grown significantly since the Spanish conquest and was continuing to boom. After infrastructure projects drained Lake Texcoco, the city grew steadily out from the centre of the Aztec city of Tenochtitln, which today is Mexico Citys central plaza. After the country gained independence in 1810, gradual industrialisation during the 19th century and the creation of a railway network laid the foundations for a steady population shift from rural to urban. By the 1950s, Mexico City was facing a serious housing shortage.
Seeking to address this issue, the Mexican government sought to implement the most innovative building design of the time. They contracted Mario Pani, a young architect who had become one of the biggest proponents of the modernist ideas of Le Corbusier in the country.
His plan called for 102 residential towers, ranging in height from four to 22 floors, placed in large blocks with plazas and public space in between  Le Corbusiers towers in the park concept . Additionally, the area near the recently excavated ruins of the former Tlatelolco temple and the Spanish church would be converted into a plaza, named Plaza de las Tres Culturas (Square of the Three Cultures, after the Aztecs, Spain and Mexico).
Though part of the plans rationale was to provide an economical solution to the housing crisis, it also claimed to improve the lives of the inhabitants of the complex, through the virtues of modern design. Pani believed that the complex would be part of a general process of regeneration. Far from achieving these lofty goals, the complex instead set the stage for the next instalment in Tlatelolcos tragic history.

At that point, the Plaza de las Tres Culturas became a living hell
Elena Poniatowska
In 1968, Mexico City was preparing to host the Olympics. While the government saw the event as a way to raise Mexicos stature in the eyes of the world, a coalition of left-leaning activists instead wanted to turn attention to social ills and the frequently violent overreach of military forces in Mexico. In response, the government created the Olympia battalion, a paramilitary squad intended to ensure the games wouldnt be interrupted by protesters.
The protests reached tipping point on 2 October, 10 days before the opening ceremony, when protesters gathered in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the late afternoon for a rally. At the same time, snipers from the battalion took strategic posts in the new housing complexes, providing them with a clear shoton the people below.
At 6:10pm, a shot was fired, though no one was sure where it came from. Security forces acted immediately, opening fire on the protesters. At that point, journalist Elena Poniatowska wrote in her book The Night of Tlatelolco, the Plaza de las Tres Culturas became a living hell.
The protesters ran eastward, but many did not escape. The battalion and other security forces broke into residences, and the wide superblocks made fleeing protesters easy targets. After the killings ended, the governments initial reaction was to minimise the carnage, estimating that only 24 had been killed. This figure was dramatically contradicted by other accounts. Poniatowskas account includes an interview with a mother living in Tlatelolco who claims to have seen at least 65 dead bodies during the massacre. John Rodda, Olympic correspondent for The Guardian, witnessed the event and concluded 350 had been killed. Though the final body count remains unknown, photos surfaced in 2001 confirming key elements of Roddas testimony.
The tragic events that night left a lasting legacy and remain a hot topic in Mexican politics . Alongside the plaque to the 1521 defeat of the Aztecs, another was placed to the memory of the student demonstrators. But though the events were seen as an indictment of the Mexican government, they didnt tarnish the reputation of the Tlatelolco complex itself. Two decades later, another tragedy would occur at the site that would do just that.
Two of the three segments of the Nuevo Len building collapsed, killing all residents inside

On the morning of 9 September 1985, Mexico was hit by an 8.1 magnitude earthquake. Though the epicentre was off the coast of the southwest state of Michoacn, it was powerful enough to cause major damage in Mexico City, demolishing buildings, damaging metro stations and killing thousands.
The Tlatelolco complex was hit particularly hard. Two of the three segments of the Nuevo Len building collapsed, killing all residents inside. The collapse, exacerbated by a toxic combination of cost cutting during the original construction and improper maintenance, left between 200 and 300 dead.
Due to earthquake damage, eight other buildings in the complex were demolished and four more had their uppermost floors removed. It was an event charged with symbolism. Just as Pruitt-Igoe in St Louis, Missouri had demonstrated the death of modernism in the United States, the partial demolition of Tlatelolco showed it to be a failure south of the border as well.
Today, Tlatelolco seems to have put its tragic days in the past, but living conditions there remain far from perfect. Mexicos El Universal characterises the complex as being under a virtual curfew at night, as high crime rates keep most people inside. In addition, the dangerous lack of maintenance persists. Architecture magazine Plataforma Arqitectonica reports that five of the buildings are inclined at a level of 1.5%, where buildings inclining greater than 1% are considered at risk.

But the downfall of modernism at Tlatelolco may also represent the rise of a new trend in housing, with a uniquely Latin American twist. This change is at the centre of the argument made by architecture critic Justin McGuirk in his recent book Radical Cities. McGuirk sees the decline of Tlatelolco as coinciding with the beginning of a new movement he calls activist architecture.
McGuirk highlights programmes such as slum upgrading and the social urbanism of Medelln, Colombia, to be the future of cities in Latin America, as well as the rest of the world. [Activist architects] have to play off the private against the public to get the most out of both. They have to insinuate themselves into politicians plans, he writes. Above all, they have to be extroverts.
The activist architect approach seems to be gaining ground among planning professionals, and its becoming increasingly popular in Mexico as well. Even in Tlatelolco itself, groups like Unidos por Tlatelolco (United for Tlatelolco) have emerged to coordinate the efforts of residents to make up for neglect by authorities whenever possible. Today, it seems clear that groups like these, just as much as central planning authorities, will be the ones to confront the difficult task of creating better living conditions for the citizens of Mexico.

In architectural renderings, Gujarat International Financial Tec-City resembles a thicket of glassy blue skyscrapers soaring above the Sabarmati River in Gandhinagar, capital of the western Indian state of Gujarat. Its signature towers include the Diamond, a 410-metre spire resembling an icy stalagmite, and the 362m Gateway Towers, a bendy, sinuous version of Rem Koolhaass CCTV headquarters in Beijing.
By 2021, the creators of Gift City, as it is commonly known, promise to surround these towers with world-class infrastructure which will provide residents with round-the-clock power and water, a district-cooling system that sluices chilled water through buildings, and an automatic garbage disposal system sending excrement hurtling through sewage pipes at 90kph  faster than most Indian trains, as the journalist Manu Joseph dryly observed .
The beating heart  or rather, robot brain  of Gift City is its Command and Control Centre, which keeps traffic moving smoothly and monitors every building through a network of CCTVs. In a country where more than 300 million people live without electricity, and twice as many dont have access to toilets, Gift Citys towers sound like hypertrophic castles in the sky. But they are an essential part of the Indian governments urban vision, one that it wants to see replicated a hundred times across the country. Recently, the Indian cabinet green-lit a 10 billion scheme that will be divided equally between building 100 smart cities, and rejuvenating another 500 cities and towns over the next five years.

Yet many experts and planners fear that such insta-cities, if they are made, will prove dystopic and inequitable. Some even hint that smart cities may turn into social apartheid cities, governed by powerful corporate entities that could override local laws and governments to keep out the poor.
In a monograph for a conference on smart cities in Mumbai in January, the economist and consultant Laveesh Bhandari described smart cities as special enclaves that would use prohibitive prices and harsh policing to prevent millions of poor Indians from enjoying the privileges of such great infrastructure. This is the natural way of things, he noted, for if we do not keep them out, they will override our ability to maintain such infrastructure.

Bhandaris bald statements sparked social-media pandemonium , and the economist is now at pains to assert he is far from uncritical of such plans. I am describing the unfeasibility and undesirability of a thoughtless smart-city vision, he says. When you invest so much without thinking about services and low-cost housing and governance, then you will end up creating enclaves that keep out the poor.
In their present form, Bhandari adds, smart cities are essentially rechristened Special Economic Zones (SEZs); neo-liberal business-friendly zones exempt from taxes , duties and stringent labour laws. They are also subject to what urban scholars say is a form of privatised governance, due to a constitutional amendment that renders local governments powerless. All of which, according to Bhandari, makes them inherently and unreservedly exclusionary. The current template for smart cities only mandates infrastructure creation. What we need is democracy and rule of law, not governance by fiat that holds in SEZs and smart cities created in China .
Last July, Narendra Modis newly elected government allocated 70.6 billion rupees (762m) to its 100 Smart Cities plan. This years allocation shrank to 1.4bn rupees, yet smart cities remain a key justification for a controversial land-acquisition ordinance the government is aiming to enact , which does away with mandatory consent and social safeguards for those whose lands are forcibly acquired. Over the past few months, smart city-themed conferences have been taking place every week in Delhi and Mumbai, culminating in the urban development minister Venkaiah Naidus announcement that the scheme would be  rolled out  imminently.
Yet no one is quite sure of what these cities might look like, or who theyre for. Naidu, with not a little wistfulness, said that smart cities would have clean water, assured power supply, efficient public transport and would not be polluted or congested. A concept note from his ministry, last revised in December, explains that they will have smart (intelligent) physical, social, institutional and economic infrastructure, guaranteeing their residents employment opportunities and a very high quality of life, comparable with any developed European city.
This repeated emphasis on high-end infrastructure and superlative quality of life hints at a discomfiting answer to the second question: who the intended inhabitants of smart cities are likely to be.
A visualisation of Palava Citys lakefront, designed to be the heart of this new citys cultural and social life.
The current template might have given us Palava City. This self-described smart city across 3,000 acres of Mumbais northeastern exurbs is being built by a city-based developer best known for treating skyscraper-erecting as a competitive sport . As its promotional video announces in a smug baritone, Palava City was inspired by the futuristic vision that brought Singapore, Dubai and even Mumbai into being.
What this translates into is essential public infrastructure such as 24x7 electricity, immaculate wide roads, public transport, malls, multiplexes and luxury housing, including Mumbais first and only golf-course-equipped residential township. To make sure that no one trespasses on its immaculate privatopia, Palava plans to issue its residents with  smart identity cards , and will watch over them through a system of  smart surveillance .
The emphasis on surveillance underlines the stratified, elitist nature of smart cities, according to the academic and author Pramod Nayar. Smart cities will be heavily policed spaces, he says, where only eligible people  economically productive consumers (shoppers) and producers (employees)  will be allowed freedom of walking and travel, while ambient and ubiquitous surveillance will be tracked so as to anticipate the anti-socials.
As such, Nayar adds, smart cities will be more fortresses than places of heterogeneous humanity, because they are meant only for specific classes of people. One class to be served, the other to be surveilled and contained.

The smart city paradigm comes from mid-scale European cities, and theyre meant to make existing infrastructure work in a more integrated way, whether its waste, habitation or transport connectivity, says Gautam Bhan, a researcher with the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Delhi. But Indian cities struggle with the absence of networks. Just 16% of Indian cities have underground sewage drainage systems. No technology can make the system work better if basic services dont exist.
Set against this context, Gift City, which models itself after financial hubs Canary Wharf in London and Pariss La Defense, starts to resemble the Emerald City, a glittering spectacle at the end of a shiny highway. In India such cities  geared towards high-end services  seem unlikely to provide many meaningful livelihood opportunities in the rural hinterlands where they come up.
Having islands of well-serviced smart cities amidst a vast sea of poorly-serviced and impoverished villages leads to what urban scholars have called the juxtaposition of the citadel and ghetto, says Sai Balakrishnan, an urban scholar at Rutgers, who studies land conflicts and urbanisation in India . If the government does succeed in building these premium 100 smart cities, but does nothing to alleviate poverty and poor services in the surrounding areas, it could well lead to a politically volatile situation. These visible forms of spatial inequalities engender social mistrust and even violence.
Nowhere is this combination of political volatility and spatial inequality more striking than in the giant expressway projects snaking across the countrys hinterland since 2006. These six-to-eight lane highways, intended to thread together luxury townships and special economic zones, often come up on fertile farmland that is forcibly acquired under the pretext of fulfilling a public purpose. In May 2011, one such project just outside Delhi  involving an expressway, private sports-themed city, and the countrys first Formula 1 racetrack  led to months-long protests among farmers from 10 villages. The rally descended into violence when villagers clashed with armed police, leading to the deaths of two farmers and two policemen.

Not all manifestations of disquiet end in gunshots and death, however. Balakrishnan recounts an incident that took place on the outskirts of Bangalore, where villages are rapidly being replaced with IT parks , gated communities and wealthy villas. A friend returned to her visibly opulent bungalow one evening to find a young man lounging on her porch, drinking a cold beer from her fridge. When she took out her phone to call the police, he brandished a small knife and motioned for her to sit down. She did, upon which he finished his beer, thanked her politely and left.
This incident makes palpable the sense of resentment and alienation among those excluded from partaking in Indias new urban wealth, Balakrishnan says. The young man wasnt out to harm anyone, but he felt justified, entitled almost, to break into an affluent home and to help himself to a few hours of luxury.
Every new smart city, she suggests, signals yet another temporary secession, each of them setting in place a new social order that will not be easy to reverse, and that takes urban planning dangerously away from the public domain. A hundred smart cities could spawn a thousand shadow cities, simmering with resentment and rage.

Why do Africa's mayors get so little respect?
Notwithstanding the inaugural African Mayor Awards, the continents presidents, prime ministers and kings dont leave much room for the humble mayor

Who is Africas Ken Livingstone or Boris Johnson? Its Rudy Giuliani or Bill de Blasio? The continent has seen emperors and still possesses an absolute monarch (in Swaziland), along with presidents, prime ministers, state governors and traditional leaders such as kings, chiefs and emirs, but that doesnt leave much room for the humble city mayor.
A plan to change that took a step forward last week when the first African mayor awards were held in Luanda, Angola, with organisers hoping to boost the profile of this oft-ignored tier of African politics. They claim the annual ceremony showcases excellence in urban development at a time that much of the continents population growth is concentrated in cities  with Luanda itself a stark example of the gap between rich and poor.
But the inaugural event suffered some peculiar branding. Its formal name, apparently due to a last-minute change for reasons open to speculation, was the Jos Eduardo dos Santos African Mayor Awards. This gave the impression that it was more about promoting the Angolan president, who has ruled with an iron fist for the past 36 years, than the mayors, whose names did not even feature in the official press release save for a picture caption.
The mayors' names did not even feature in the official press release save for a picture caption
The winners were divided into three sections. In the large metropolis category  a million residents or more  Accra in Ghana, under mayor Alfred Oko Vanderpuije, defeated Cape Town in South Africa and Dakar in Senegal. Among medium-sized cities (more than 200,000 residents and less than a million), the winner was Kinondini in Tanzania, represented at the ceremony by Sarah Kyessi (the identity of the mayor remains a mystery to almost everyone outside Kinondini). In the small cities (up to 200,000 residents) category, the winner was Praia in Cape Verde under Jos Ulisses Correia e Silva.
The awards organiser and publisher of African Business magazine, Omar Ben Yedder, told guests at the ceremony: The winning cities tonight are being led by individuals who are showing essential leadership qualities as they help build cities that work. And we will need more exemplary leadership, good governance and innovative thinking, whilst paying close attention to our culture and way of living when dreaming of the cities of tomorrow. Our leaders need to be close to the people, and our winners tonight are demonstrating these qualities.
Yet even most Africa aficionados would be hard pushed to name the mayor of Luanda, or indeed the mayor of most cities on the continent. What about that great Nigerian megacity, Lagos? A headline on the African Arguments website in 2012 read: Babatunde Fashola: the Mayor Bloomberg of Lagos State. Technically, Fashola is the governor of Lagos state, rather than mayor of Lagos city.
In South Africa, the mayor of Durban is James Nxumalo, whose Twitter profile shows him wearing traditional mayoral chain, but he is far less influential in the region than Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini, whose recent remarks on immigrants caused a storm.
There is a more high-profile figure in Cape Town, which was shortlisted for the awards: Patricia de Lille, a mixed-race veteran of the struggle against apartheid. De Lille fits the mould of a maverick mayor, and has been a constant thorn in the side of the governing African National Congress. A sign on the wall of her office, where she has reportedly banned air conditioning, reads: I prefer to do the talking myself, that way we avoid arguments.
But perhaps the best known personality to date is the former mayor of Mogadishu, Mohamed Nur, who lived in London for two decades, running community organisations for Somali expats, money exchanges, an internet cafe and an unsuccessful campaign to become a Labour councillor in Camden. He once told the Guardian his blueprint for Mogadishu was the regeneration of Kings Cross.

        <title>Southdale Center: America's first shopping mall – a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 30</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/06/southdale-center-america-first-shopping-mall-history-cities-50-buildings</Link>

Behold the shopping mall  the built epitome, according to its critics, of the mindless, car-bound consumerism of white-bread suburban America. Yet Southdale Center, the first fully enclosed, climate-controlled collection of shops from which all the 1,100 or so similarly designed malls now standing across the United States descend, came from the mind of an anti-car, pro-pedestrian European Jewish socialist.
Victor Gruen, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Austria, arrived in America in 1938 with high architectural aims. He soon launched a career creating New York City storefronts for urban businesses, like Ciros on Fifth Avenue and Stecklers on Broadway, 14 years into which he received a commission to design something else entirely: a shopping centre 10 miles outside Minneapolis.
This job offered Gruen a blank canvas on which to realise his long-imagined utopian vision of an indoor city centre that would import the urbanity of his native Vienna into his fast-growing adopted homeland. Southdale itself went up as he had imagined it  but nothing else went according to plan. By the 1970s, Gruen had returned to Austria to live out his days having all-too-clearly realised what a suburban monster hed created.
Though few built environments now seem as prosaic as that of the shopping mall, it looked downright radical when Gruen first came up with it. He first publicly submitted such a design in 1943, to Architectural Forum magazines competition Architecture 194X, which called upon modern architects to imagine the city of the post-war future. Alas Gruens entry, with its full enclosure and lack of a central square, struck even those forward-thinking editors as a bit much, and they sent him back to the drawing board.

The real postwar America proved far more accommodating to Gruens vision than the imagined one. The 1952 commission that brought Southdale into the world came from the Dayton family, a name synonymous with department stores in 1950s Minneapolis. They wanted a shopping centre to complement the new Daytons location that was planned for the suburb of Edina, a growing town of 15,000 people located  in line with the concerns of cold war America  just outside the blast radius of a nuclear bomb dropped on the city.
You have no idea what an innovation this was in the 1950s
James Lileks
When it opened in 1956, Southdale connected that new branch of Daytons with another large department store, the also now-forgotten Donaldsons, with space for more than 70 smaller shops in between. By then, the concept had some precedents around America, such as Seattles Northgate Mall, which opened in 1950, Appleton, Wisconsins Valley Fair Mall, which opened in 1954, and Gruens own Northland Mall, which opened outside Detroit that same year.
But where the open-air design of those projects left them exposed to the elements, Southdale sealed off the outside environment in order to better create its own world within. Gruen liked to call it introverted, as opposed to the extroverted commercial strips  avenues of horror, he called them  whose proliferation across suburban America he resented. And so Southdales vast, blank walls turned their backs to the street, enclosing not just all those stores, but cafs, public art, pedestrian boulevards and a lush courtyard, through whose skylight the sun shone on a fishpond, all manner of foliage, and a centrepiece cage filled with songbirds.
James Lileks, a chronicler of Minnesota modernism, describes Southdale early aesthetic as the joys of the outside brought inside. Discussing the outdoor eatery, complete with superfluous table umbrellas, Lileks says: You have no idea what an innovation this was in the 1950s; there wasnt any place where you could sit outside in your shirt-sleeves in January  least of all in a place with as inconvenient a climate as Minnesotas. Southdales advertisements promised an eternal spring, and its environment delivered.
But the utter controllability of the enclosed shopping mall, a built form that would arguably hit its zenith of popularity in California, had to do with much more than the climate. It both appealed to Gruens top-down design philosophy  like any good socialist, he believed in the improvability of man by man  and played straight into the fears of middle-class American shoppers. They didnt just want protection from the heat, wind, rain, snow and traffic encountered downtown; they also wanted protection from the people encountered there.
Those social concerns ran somewhat at odds with Gruens own. He wanted to create not just a gigantic shopping machine, but a community centre where, free from the terror of the automobile, Americans could stroll, congregate, debate and enjoy the human experience just as Gruen remembered doing in Vienna.
To this end, he designed Southdale not as an isolated structure, but as one element of a masterplan including hundreds of hectares of residential, commercial, medical, office and mixed-use projects around a lake and public park, most of which the developers ignored. Instead, it set the precedent for all the colossal boxes surrounded by what Gruen called land-wasting seas of parking  1,500 of which appeared across America in the half-century after Southdales unveiling, all of which benefited from a postwar change in tax law which dramatically increased the profitability of such big commercial projects.

Though Gruen himself would disown and decry the shopping mall, declaring in 1978 his refusal to pay alimony for those bastard developments, many Minnesotans, especially the 75,000 who turned out for opening day, loved Southdale. Generations of Americans who grew up far from a genuine city centre turned to places like Southdale for the closest thing to an urban experience they could find.
Hence the pangs of nostalgia that accompany the 21st centurys desertions or even demolitions of some of the United States enclosed malls. Even suburban Americans, no longer captive audiences for ersatz city centres, have not just a host of revitalised actual downtowns to choose from, but a new wave of high-design, urban-flavoured shopping malls that do away with introversion. (Some old enclosed malls, in a bid for the same appeal, have even gone so far as to remove their roofs and cut holes in their walls.)
You should have left downtown downtown, pronounced architect Frank Lloyd Wright in a characteristically grumpy 1956 visit to Southdale. But his comment reveals that he didnt quite grasp his colleagues intentions. M Jeffrey Hardwick titled his biography of Gruen, Mall Maker, but Gruen saw himself as more of a city builder, albeit an ultimately frustrated one. Socialists often claim that real socialism, in a properly supportive context, has never been tried. Victor Gruen could claim that neither has the real shopping mall.

        <title>The dangers of eco-gentrification: what's the best way to make a city greener?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/06/dangers-ecogentrification-best-way-make-city-greener</Link>

When construction on New York Citys famous High Line began in 2006 , the project to turn a remnant of the industrial age into a post-industrial garden and tourist attraction appeared innovative, but potentially very risky.
In fact, having finally opened in 2009, the High Line is now suffering from its own success : with more than 5 million estimated visitors to the site each year, this greening initiative has managed to transform the entire socio-economic character of the neighbourhood that surrounds it. Many small businesses and moderate-income residents have been forced to relocate due to rising land values, while even those who can afford it have begun to experience the downsides of living or working in an area that panders to tourists.
The High Line is thus a perfect example of environmental gentrification  the growing phenomenon of rising property values in the wake of a large-scale urban greening project. Its a bit like the introduction of a new transportation hub or other major infrastructure project: while intended to serve existing residents, in reality it tends to increase land values to the point that those who live there are forced to leave. This exodus in turn transforms the sociological contours of the area and, by extension, the spatial segregation of the entire city.
The High Line is a perfect example of 'environmental gentrification'
It feels timely, then, to revisit an old question: what is the best way to introduce nature into a city?
Land speculation in regard to large-scale greening projects is nothing new. When the very first public park in Europe, Birkenhead Park on Merseyside , was in the early phases of planning in the 1840s, park commissioners bought up parcels of land around the park and cashed in after it was built. Similarly, one of the main reasons behind the construction of New York Citys Central Park  designed by Frederick Law Olmsted after a trip to Birkenhead  was to raise property values and tax revenues for the city. (Olmsted himself carried out a series of studies on rising land values around the park from the mid-1850s to the mid-1870s, and used these findings to obtain support for the creation of parks in other cities.)
In our present neoliberal era, this process has been further amplified. Large-scale projects for greening cities, such as the High Line, have become bigger and more targeted to more specific audiences, contributing to the problem of residential segregation. In New York City, for instance, a proposed Lowline is scheduled to open in the Lower East Side in 2018. Funded in part by Absolut Vodka , the clientele of this underground park-museum is easily identified. Also expected in 2018 is the London Garden Bridge , presumably geared toward a similar, cocktail-oriented crowd.
Increasing the segregation of cities is not, of course, what the creators of these and other projects intended. But these plans nevertheless reflect a rather narrow-minded vision of what it means to bring nature into the city. They also appear to turn a blind eye to the drawbacks of endeavours such as the High Line  not only for moderate-income residents but for everyone in the city, no matter what their income level.
Such a myopic approach is a sign of our times: we want big projects that can be unveiled to spectators at a specific point in time. In reality, a more modest, piecemeal approach is often better both for the environment and for the socio-economic composition of large cities. Ideally, smaller-scale projects would be implemented in neighbourhoods across urban areas simultaneously.

Over the past few years, a new trend has emerged in direct response to the problem of eco-gentrification. I will label it conscious anti-gentrification. This kind of greening project aims to increase the environmental quality and public health of a neighbourhood but without changing its socio-economic character. This is done by explicitly rejecting elements that tend to lead to gentrification, such as fancy waterfronts; by including neighbourhood residents in the planning process; and by implementing changes gradually. Interestingly, many of the main players in todays conscious anti-gentrification movement were themselves gentrifiers in another era, especially the 1980s.
Conscious anti-gentrification aims to green a neighbourhood without changing its socio-economic character
The American academics Winifred Curran and Trina Hamilton brilliantly call this the just-green-enough approach, and point to Newtown Creek, a neighbourhood of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as an example. In the 19th century, Newtown Creek was a centre for oil refining and other industries, which left behind a massive oil plume. Over the last 10 or so years, Newtowns community has become increasingly active in the environmental clean-up of its own neighbourhood. Most recently, in 2010, Newtown Creek was declared a Superfund site ; an Environmental Protection Agency designation that brings federal funding but also the fear of stigmatisation.
What is unique in this case is the extent of public participation in determining how to carry out the clean-up, facilitated by the Newtown Creek Alliance and other groups. They explicitly rejected the all-too-familiar waterfront model, and instead focused on retaining the strong manufacturing base of the neighbourhood  replacing, when necessary, the type of manufacturing with more eco-friendly versions that better utilise the neighbourhoods proximity to water. The result, which is still ongoing, is a greening initiative that resists the need to mix gin and tonics.
Related: How Berliners refused to give Tempelhof airport over to developers
Across the Atlantic in Berlin, another example of conscious anti-gentrification is emerging. It involves the redevelopment of the former Tempelhof airport , located in the popular neighbourhoods of Kreuzberg and Neuklln. Once one of the largest airports in Europe, Tempelhof re-opened as a public park in 2008. Originally the park was going to be designed by a group of internationally renowned architects, and a recent plan for its redevelopment included the creation of 4,700 new residences as well as shopping amenities. Fearing the socio-economic changes that often accompany such development projects, however, Berliners rejected this plan in a referendum in spring 2014, and its future remains open.
Even if not a direct response to environmental gentrification, a variety of other approaches to greening cities exist. At the University of Virginia, urban planner Timothy Beatley has created the Biophilic Cities Project , devoted to developing new ways of making cities more biophilic, or close to nature  not only by increasing exposure to green spaces, but also by enhancing the emotional connection of urban residents to life outside. Rather than providing a set of guidelines, biophilic design simply asks urban planners to start by taking nature seriously, as well as its role in wellbeing and quality of life, rather than considering it as an afterthought.
Perhaps the most literal translation of greening a city is in simply planting more trees, an initiative taken up by many cities across the world. In Boston, where I live, the municipality plans to increase the number of trees across the city by 100,000 by 2020. It arrived at this number through a 2004-06 survey of tree canopy cover, carried out using aerial photography. The survey determined that the city had 28% canopy cover; increasing this to the municipalitys desired 35% meant adding 100,000 more trees.
More modest, gradual approaches such as these may not attract sponsorship from the likes of Absolut Vodka. But they do represent broader and more creative ways of thinking about how to bring nature into the city  and that is something we need now more than ever.

As cities increasingly seek to reduce car use and encourage more sustainable forms of transport, so cycling will surely play an ever-more important role in urban life.
Following a swath of activism in the 1970s, Dutch cities began to introduce measures for safer cycling . Now Amsterdam, Utrecht and Groningen  not to mention cities such as Copenhagen, Mnster and Seville  have become pioneers for a pro-cycling urban culture with extensive networks of cycle paths, as well as other clever ideas to make cycling around the metropolis easier.
But which other places around the world should we add to this list of most cycle-friendly towns and cities? Where is unexpected progress being made in the quest for safer and more innovative cycling infrastructure?

        <title>Moscow's Narkomfin building: Soviet blueprint for collective living – a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 29</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/moscow-narkomfin-soviet-collective-living-history-cities-50-buildings</Link>

In the shadow of one of Stalins Seven Sisters skyscrapers in Moscows Presnensky District, an unkempt park gives way to a trio of yellowing buildings in varying states of decay. The crumbling concrete and overgrown wall-garden dont give much away, but this is the product of the utopian dreams of a young Soviet state  a six-storey blueprint for communal living, known as the Narkomfin building.
Designed by architects Moisei Ginzburg and Ignaty Milinis in 1928, the building represents an important chapter in Moscows development  as both a physical city and an ideological state. Built to house the employees of the Narodnyo Kommissariat Finansov (Commissariat of Finance), Narkomfin was a laboratory for social and architectural experimentation to transform the byt (everyday life) of the ideal socialist citizen.
In the years following the 1917 Russian revolution, living conditions in the newly established Soviet Union left much to be desired. Newcomers moving from the countryside with the promise of a new life arrived in an overcrowded and underdeveloped Moscow with very little infrastructure or housing. Architects were tasked with developing a solution for the housing shortage  and a framework to support the changing face of Russian society.
Enter the social condenser, an idea developed by the Organisation of Contemporary Architects, who spearheaded revolutionary ideas of collective living through standardised Stroikom units, confining private amenities to a single cell while facilities like kitchens and living space were communal. Thanks to this design, the Narkomfin building appears as one long apartment block, connected to a smaller communal structure by a covered walkway and a central garden space.

But communist values were not the only ideals behind the Narkomfin: women too were set to be emancipated. Petty housework crushes, strangles and degrades  chains her to the kitchen, wrote Lenin in A Great Beginning . The real emancipation of women, real communism, will begin only where and when an all-out struggle begins ... against this petty housekeeping.
While the organisations architecture was set to transform the byt of the domestic soviet, head architect Ginzburg was in no rush. He spoke of architecture as being able to harness the activity of the masses, and to stimulate but not dictate their transition into a socially superior mode of life.
Yet the communal and feminist values behind Narkomfin went stale almost as soon as the building was completed in 1932, and only a handful of such projects were completed before Stalins Five Year Plan halted the experiment. After Stalins rise to power, the communal and emancipatory values the architecture intended to inspire were quickly rejected as leftist or Trotskyist, and Narkomfins communal spaces fell in disrepair. Residents illegally installed makeshift kitchen units into their homes and the recreation space originally planned for the buildings rooftop was instead dominated by a penthouse apartment for the commissar of finance, Nikolai Milyutin.

Having since suffered years of neglect, Narkomfin is now caught in a tug-of-war battle between developers seeking to capitalise on the buildings central Moscow location, and those campaigning for its full restoration. Between 2006 and 2008, developer Alexander Senatorov bought up around 70% of the buildings 54 flats (the Moscow government owns a further 20%, with the remaining 10% owned by individual occupants). Soon after, Senatorov began working with Alexei Ginzburg, the original architects grandson, to draw up plans for a boutique hotel.
The project fell flat after the 2008 financial crisis, however. The unique split-level units were then let to artists at a nominal fee, but more recently, rental hikes have been forcing tenants out. They have been replaced by commercial establishments including a falafel shop, shisha lounge and yoga studio  and heightened security.
These days it is more inviting to hipsters than historians, says Natalia Melikova, a Moscow-based photographer and founder of the Constructivist Project . Its catering to a certain public now.
Warned of the security guards aversion to snoopers, I entered Narkomfin by reciting a rehearsed request to visit the sixth-floor shisha lounge. Behind the heavy metal entrance door, I was eyeballed, quizzed  who gave you information about us?  and eventually taken up to the rooftop where, ironically, I was free to roam.
In the place where Milyutins penthouse once stood, the Healthy Space yoga studio now takes classes outside when the sun is shining, against a backdrop of Stalins ominous Kudrinskaya Square skyscraper.
Inside, illegal repairs have been carried out by Senatorov, who plans to spend around $12m (7.7m) on a renovation project carried out by Kleinewelt Architects , set to include private accommodation, a mini-hotel and a small museum of constructivism. Inside an apartment-turned-falafel shop on the fifth floor, I spoke to a resident who told me that he values the collective mentality of the occupants of the building, for whom rental hikes and hasty evictions loom large.
For now, the building has been temporarily filled with artists and trendy businesses, but the ghost of the communal living experiment lingers in the hallways of Narkomfin.

Occupying a prime spot between the US embassy and a shopping centre, the land around Narkomfin is ripe for real-estate development. Having previously appeared three times on the World Monuments Fund watch-list, Melikova has nominated the building once again for 2016 listing  but its worsening state puts it at risk. If considered more than 70% dilapidated, she explains, Narkomfin could be razed, rather than restored: It is a crucial time for all stakeholders  which includes the developer, the city of Moscow, city residents, and the international community - to work together for the Narkomfin building.

Many masterpieces of Soviet constructivism are now crumbling under capitalism, replaced by pastiche architecture or pale replicas of former buildings. When opening the neighbouring luxury Novinsky Passage mall , former mayor Yuri Luzhov commented : What a joy that in our city such wonderful, new shopping centres are appearing  not such junk, pointing in the direction of Narkomfin.
Melikova, whose Constructivist Project aims to promote the preservation of the citys avant-garde architecture, is hoping for a sensitive restoration of the building: The changes are irreversible and Narkomfins authenticity is at stake. Moscow does not need another replica.

How Amsterdam became the bicycle capital of the world
In the 1960s, Dutch cities were increasingly in thrall to motorists, with the car seen as the transport of the future. It took the intolerable toll of child traffic deaths  and fierce activism  to turn Amsterdam into the cycling nirvana of today

Anyone who has ever tried to make their way through the centre of Amsterdam in a car knows it: the city is owned by cyclists. They hurry in swarms through the streets, unbothered by traffic rules, taking precedence whenever they want, rendering motorists powerless by their sheer numbers.
Cyclists rule in Amsterdam and great pains have been taken to accommodate them: the city is equipped with an elaborate network of cycle-paths and lanes, so safe and comfortable that even toddlers and elderly people use bikes as the easiest mode of transport. Its not only Amsterdam which boasts a network of cycle-paths, of course; youll find them in all Dutch cities.
The Dutch take this for granted; they even tend to believe these cycle-paths have existed since the beginning of time. But that is certainly not the case. There was a time, in the 1950s and 60s, when cyclists were under severe threat of being expelled from Dutch cities by the growing number of cars. Only thanks to fierce activism and a number of decisive events would Amsterdam succeed in becoming what it is, unquestionably, now: the bicycle capital of the world.

At the start of the 20th century, bikes far outnumbered cars in Dutch cities and the bicycle was considered a respectable mode of transport for men and women. But when the Dutch economy began to boom in the post-war era, more and more people were able to afford cars, and urban policymakers came to view the car as the travel mode of the future. Entire Amsterdam neighbourhoods were destroyed to make way for motorised traffic. The use of bikes decreased by 6% every year, and the general idea was that bicycles would eventually disappear altogether.
The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows
Maartje van Putten, former MEP
All that growing traffic took its toll. The number of traffic casualties rose to a peak of 3,300 deaths in 1971. More than 400 children were killed in traffic accidents that year.
This staggering loss led to protests by different action groups, the most memorable of which was Stop de Kindermoord (stop the child murder). Its first president was the Dutch former MEP, Maartje van Putten.
I was a young mother living in Amsterdam and I witnessed several traffic accidents in my neighbourhood where children got hurt, van Putten, 63, recalls. I saw how parts of the city were torn down to make way for roads. I was very worried by the changes that took place in society  it affected our lives. The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows. That made me very angry.

The 1970s were a great time for being angry in Holland: activism and civil disobedience were rampant. Stop de Kindermoord grew rapidly and its members held bicycle demonstrations, occupied accident blackspots, and organised special days during which streets were closed to allow children to play safely: We put tables outside and held a huge dinner party in our street. And the funny thing was, the police were very helpful.
Van Putten remembers the 70s as a time when Dutch authorities were remarkably accessible: We simply went to tea with MPs  and they really listened to what we had to say. We cycled with a group of activists and an organ grinder to the house of the prime minister, Joop den Uyl, to sing songs and ask for safer streets for children. We didnt get beyond the hallway, but he did come out to hear our plea.
We had a great fighting spirit and we knew how to voice our ideas. And in the end, we would get our bicycle lane
Tom Godefrooij
Stop de Kindermoord became subsidised by the Dutch government, established its headquarters in a former shop, and went on to develop ideas for safer urban planning  which eventually resulted in the woonerf : a new kind of people-friendly street with speed bumps and bends to force cars to drive very slowly. Nowadays the woonerf has gone out of fashion, but it can still be found in many Dutch cities.
Two years after Stop de Kindermoord was established, another group of activists founded the First Only Real Dutch Cyclists Union to demand more space for bicycles in the public realm  organising bike rides along dangerous stretches of road, and compiling inventories of the problems encountered by cyclists.

Somehow we managed to strike a chord, says Tom Godefrooij, 64, who got involved with the Cyclists Union as a young man. He remembers noisy mass demonstrations with tricycles and megaphones, and nightly ventures to paint illegal bicycle lanes in streets the union considered dangerous.
First we would be arrested by the police, of course, but then the whole thing would be in the newspapers and municipal politicians would eventually listen. We had a great fighting spirit and we knew how to voice our ideas. And in the end, we would get our bicycle lane. Even in the 70s, you know, there were politicians who understood that the general focus on cars would eventually cause problems.
The activists of Stop de Kindermoord and the Cyclists Union were resourceful and undaunted, but there were other forces helping to create a fertile soil for their ideas. The Netherlands  possessing few hills and a mild climate  had a great tradition of cycling to begin with and the bike was never completely marginalised as it was in some other countries. The intolerable number of traffic deaths really was a serious concern for politicians, and there was a nascent awareness of the pollution caused by vehicle emissions.
The 1973 oil crisis  when Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil exporters imposed an embargo on the US, Britain, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands for supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur war  quadrupled the price of oil. During a television speech, prime minister Den Uyl urged Dutch citizens to adopt a new lifestyle and get serious about saving energy. The government proclaimed a series of car-free Sundays: intensely quiet weekend days when children played on deserted motorways and people were suddenly reminded of what life was like before the hegemony of the car.

On one of these car-free Sundays, Maartje van Putten, together with a group of other parents and children, rode her bike through a tunnel to the northern part of Amsterdam, in which no provisions for cyclists had been made. We didnt realise that what we did was dangerous, because there were still some cars on the road. Our trip ended at the police station, but we made our point.
Gradually, Dutch politicians became aware of the many advantages of cycling, and their transport policies shifted  maybe the car wasnt the mode of transport of the future after all. In the 1980s, Dutch towns and cities began introducing measures to make their streets more cycle-friendly. Initially, their aims were far from ambitious; the idea was simply to keep cyclists on their bikes.
The Hague and Tilburg were the first to experiment with special cycle routes through the city. The bicycle paths were bright red and very visible; this was something completely new, says Godefrooij. Cyclists would change their routes to use the paths. It certainly helped to keep people on their bikes, but in the end it turned out that one single bicycle route did not lead to an overall increase in cycling.
Subsequently, the city of Delft constructed a whole network of cycle paths and it turned out that this did encourage more people to get on their bikes. One by one, other cities followed suit.
Nowadays the Netherlands boasts 22,000 miles of cycle paths. More than a quarter of all trips are made by bicycle, compared with 2% in the UK  and this rises to 38% in Amsterdam and 59% in the university city of Groningen. All major Dutch cities have designated bicycle civil servants, tasked to maintain and improve the network. And the popularity of the bike is still growing, thanks partly to the development of electric bicycles.
The Cyclists Union has long ceased to be a group of random activists; it is now a respectable organisation with 34,000 paying members whose expertise is in worldwide demand.

We have achieved a lot, but were facing many new challenges, says their spokesman, Wim Bot. Many old cycle paths need to be reconstructed because they do not measure up to our modern standards  some are used by so many people that they are no longer wide enough. We have the problem of parking all those bikes, and we are thinking of new ways to create even more space for cyclists and pedestrians. What our cities really need is a totally new kind of infrastructure. Theyre simply not fit for so much car traffic.
The battle goes on, says Godefrooij. The propensity of urban planners to give priority to cars is still persistent. Its easy to understand: an extra tunnel for cyclists means you have to spend extra money on the project. Weve come a long way, but we can never lower our guard.

        <title>'Chaos? This is open-heart surgery': Medellín risks a massively expensive plan to bury its highway</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/01/medellin-bury-highway-urban-intervention</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
The body of water that runs through Medelln can be called many things: an open sewer, a barrier, a crime alley or even a highway median strip. Anything but a river.
The city, however, is determined to change that. For years, the city had a reputation as the most violent city in the world . But in the last decade it reinvented itself through innovative urbanism, with projects like cable cars and outdoor escalators credited with successfully overhauling depressed and crime-ridden neighbourhoods. Its new plan, though, is its largest, boldest and  by far  costliest urban intervention yet.
Parks of the Medelln River (Parques del Ro Medelln) aims to completely transform the surroundings of the river, turning a highway into a public space and, with luck, sparking urban renewal. More than 1.1bn, 20km of riverbanks and 15 years will be needed to complete this ambitious project. It is the highest bet the city has placed. If it goes wrong, it could overshadow all the previous urban hits that brought the city fame.
The first step of the plan is the most controversial: to bury a 392m stretch of highway along the river and build a park on top. It will mean Medellns main highway will close for 11 months, cost 43m of public money and require the cutting down of large trees. Many citizens are enraged, saying it will cause chaos.
Chaos? How could that not happen? asks Catalina Osorio, the projects social deputy director. This is open-heart surgery for the city, and everyone is involved. We are touching what we never wanted to touch: the most frightening place of Medelln.

Particularly vocal in opposition are the residents of Conquistadores, a quiet, wealthy neighbourhood that would be the starting place for the project. Locals fear that noise, crime, street vendors and unregulated parking will invade the neighbourhood.
When the works began, a group of Conquistadores neighbours blocked the highway in protest. They felt the project would hurt the value of their apartments. That is my patrimony, what I worked all my life for, says Hernando Medina, one of the protesters. Among their main concerns is that new pedestrian bridges will connect them with the east bank of the river, where the highway will be buried and a large boulevard built instead. There are economically depressed neighbourhoods nearby, and the bridges will be located less than a kilometre away from a place by the river where dozens of homeless people dwell. We dont need a park here, says Olga Ruiz, a resident of Conquistadores. People will come down from everywhere. Some protesters have suggested building a wall to separate their neighbourhood.
Medelln always had a troublesome relationship with its river. The city is located in a narrow mountain valley, and the river often floods violently. The riverbanks were pastures until the 1950s when the river was channelled, the highway built and the citys development skyrocketed.
As industrial areas mushroomed along the axis of the river, residential areas began growing up the steep slopes of the Aburr Valley. It is difficult to provide utilities and public transportation in these places, and landslides have killed hundreds, rich and poor alike.
Meanwhile, the river became a frontier that separated paisas  the inhabitants of Medelln   from themselves. The highway blocked access to the river, which became invisible to the city. Paisas only go down to the river in December, when a section of the highway is closed for people to walk and enjoy enormous arrays of Christmas lights.
To correct this historic problem, a new metropolitan urban plan was adopted in 2011, which later gave birth to Parks of the Medelln River. The project is not an end, but the means to materialise the zoning plan, says Juan Pablo Lopez, the projects operating director. He claims the parks will attract dense residential developments near the river.
After four years, an international urbanism design contest and tenders for engineering designs and construction, the project was given the green light. Still, many paisas dont see the project as a priority, considering the more pressing social issues in Medelln. Lopez admits they did a bad job selling it. We were unable to show the project as a complete city strategy, showing infrastructure instead, he says.
Historic projects seem to be just the standard operating procedure in this town
Janette Sadik-Khan
Medellns highway also serves as the main national road, so heavy cargo transportation in western Colombia will be affected by years of partial closure. Parks of the River will condemn us, for decades, to a heart attack of the metropolitan economy, says Johel Moreno, former president of the Society of Engineers and Architects of Antioquia. He is afraid the river wont serve as the transportation axis it was conceived to be 60 years ago, and the park will rule out the possibility of an elevated highway.
Technical aspects also concern Moreno, who remembers the problems faced during the construction of the Big Dig in Boston: water leaks, billion-dollar cost overruns and years of delays. If that happened in Massachusetts, in the first world, what would happen here? he asks.
Morenos vision is contrasted by experts like Janette Sadik-Khan, New Yorks former transport commissioner, who is remembered for pedestrianising Times Square. When it comes to massive infrastructure projects that actually have immediate, important impacts on the lives of its citizens, Medelln is showing the world how its done, she says. Historic projects seem to be just the standard operating procedure in this town.

Sadik-Khan thinks the project will continue to power the economic engine that has transformed Medelln, thanks to the real-estate investment opportunities that come with it. The mayors office is creating a company to boost urban renewal across the river in partnership with two of Colombias largest utilities companies.
This new company would invest in civil works and manage the new urban developments. In exchange, it will receive long-term income from urban tolls, real-estate development rights and taxes from capital gains, allowing Parks of the Medelln River to be financially sustainable.
This financial scheme was inspired by Rio de Janeiro, which allied with one of Brazils bigger pension funds to build Porto Maravilha: an ambitious urban project that became famous for the implosion of 4.8km of elevated highway over the last two years.
Medelln and Rio could join Madrid, San Francisco and Seoul in the group of cities that have rethought their highways for the sake of public space. The experience of these cities could shed new lights in urban debates worldwide, and help cities decide what to do with their freeways.

These debates often go on for decades. The Gardiner Expressway, a six-lane elevated highway that runs through downtown Toronto and effectively blocks access to much of the Lake Ontario waterfront, requires hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs. There are proposals to bury it and build a boulevard, but city authorities are reluctant to let go of their highway. Success in Medelln could inspire other cities, such as Toronto, to action.
With a year to go before the completion of the first stage of Parks of the Medelln River, the city is anxious. Success or failure now will define the future of the project. In the best-case scenario, it will be yet another reasons for paisas to feel proud of their city. In the worst, it could ruin Medellns reputation for being at the forefront of innovative urbanism.
They gave us these instant photos that were so beautiful, says Blanca Ruiz, an elderly lady who was present at the launch of the project. The detailed renders show glossy projections of the new parks and spaces next to the river. I am keeping the pictures to see what the park comes out like.

Extreme violence 'blighting a generation' in Central African Republic
Two years of conflict have left more than 90% of children fearing they will be killed or injured, warns Save the Children

Almost two-thirds of school-aged children in the Central African Republic are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because of the violence they have seen or experienced during the countrys two-year conflict, according to Save the Children .
A new study from the international childrens NGO suggests that more than 60% of CARs children have witnessed or been subjected to acts of extreme violence since March 2013, when the mainly Muslim rebels of the Seleka alliance seized the capital Bangui and installed the countrys first Muslim president, Michel Djotodia.
The Seleka went on to terrorise the majority Christian population, killing men, women and children until they were ousted in January 2014. Predominantly Christian forces known as the anti-balaka (anti-machete) militia retaliated by slaughtering thousands of Muslims and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Close to three quarters of the children, aged between five and 16, are said to have directly witnessed beatings, killings, artillery fire, or machete attacks on either their own relatives or members of their community during  months of violence and suffering, says Ren Yetamasso, programme quality director at Save the Children in CAR.
The study  which directly consulted 111 children, 113 parents and 66 teachers  found that 91% of children interviewed had feared that they would be killed or seriously injured. Some 43% of children reported being victims of being physical abuse, shootings, or death threats; 65% said they often felt afraid, and 25% said they were too frightened to go to school.
More than half of parents said they felt their neighbourhoods were dangerous environments for their children, while almost two-thirds of children either described themselves  or were described by their parents and teachers  as suffering from emotional, behavioural, learning or relationship difficulties.
Yetamasso said the traumas they had experienced would blight not only the childrens individual futures but also the future of their country.
These numbers underline the disastrous impact the conflict is having on CARs children, he said. If we dont ensure those affected get the appropriate support to move on with their lives, an entire generation runs the risk of suffering for years to come, unable to get over their experiences or contribute to building a better Central African Republic .
Among the reports recommendations are: the establishment of after-school support groups for children suffering from PTSD and other emotional disorders; training for school counsellors; improvements to school security; promotion of positive discipline in schools to end physical and emotional punishment for misbehaviour; creation of school safety plans, and emergency training for children.
The new study was published as donors gathered in Brussels at an international fund-raising conference for CAR. Save the Children is calling on those present to step up their efforts, pointing out that the humanitarian community has received only about a fifth of the total funds required for the UN strategic response plan, while the education plan is almost completely unfunded.
We must urgently restore schools as physical and emotional safe places for children, as well as training communities, parents, teachers, and health practitioners to identify children with psychological difficulties and help them resume a normal life at their homes and in schools, said Yetamasso.
On Tuesday the European Union announced a new assistance package for CAR worth 72m (51m). The new package comes in addition to the 377m the EU mobilised for CAR between 2013 and 2014. In July last year, the union also launched the first European trust fund, the Bkou Trust Fund for the Central African Republic. The fund, which began with original funding of 74m, is intended to support actions linking humanitarian response to reconstruction and mid-term development programmes.
We live in turbulent times, where new crises hit any time and anywhere, said Christos Stylianides, the commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management . But our attention must not shift from ongoing humanitarian crises such as this one. The people of the CAR continue to need our help to survive and rebuild their lives.
Last month, the UN warned that the CAR crisis was becoming the largest forgotten humanitarian crisis of our time . According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR , 2.7 million people are in need of aid in CAR, 436,000 are internally displaced, while more than 460,000 people are living as refugees in neighbouring countries.

2015 is 'year of fear' for children worldwide, warns Gordon Brown

Children are bearing the brunt of escalating worldwide refugee crises, armed conflicts and natural emergencies with 2015  dubbed the year of fear  already the most dangerous since 1945 for the youngest and most vulnerable in society, according to Gordon Brown , UN special envoy for global education.
Delivering an impassioned call for urgent international action in a briefing in New York , the former British prime minister and Labour party leader said more than half the worlds record numbers of 38 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 16.7 million refugees are children.

An estimated 825,000 children are being trafficked each year and 5 million girls under the age of 15 are forced to marry. In total, according to UN figures, about 168 million children are used for unskilled labour, 85 million of whom are engaged in hazardous work. It is estimated 8.6 million children are in slavery, Brown said.
This is not the year of the child but the year of fear, with 2015 already the worst year since 1945 for children being displaced, the worst year for children becoming refugees, the worst year for children seeing their schools attacked, he said. We expect the figure to rise in crisis zone after crisis zone as even school-age children who were once at school are being forced into child labour. Today in some of the worlds most troubled spots it is open season for traffickers, with girls snatched from the streets in Nepal to adolescents forced into marriage in Syria , Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
The extreme impact on children of the four-year-old civil war in Syria has received more international attention than many other crises. According to Save the Children , 10,000 Syrian children have been killed since the conflict began, 5.6 million are in need of humanitarian aid and 3.5 million have been forced from their homes. Nearly 2 million children have fled the country, while 3 million are unable to go to school.

In northern Nigeria and Pakistan, schools have been attacked and schoolgirls abducted by Islamist extremists. In Burundi, more than 100,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have fled current political unrest. Many are now at risk from a cholera epidemic affecting makeshift camps in Tanzania, with 400 new cases being reported daily.
In South Sudan, children are being forcibly recruited as child soldiers as internal conflict has flared in the wake of the countrys 2011 declaration of independence. In Nepal, meanwhile, homeless young girls have become increasingly vulnerable to people traffickers in the wake of the recent earthquake disaster.
This week, Nepalese state radio messages are confirming what we already know, Brown said. In the midst of the fallout from the earthquake, the government is directly warning half a million girls  now on the streets  and their parents, to beware of suspicious gangs trying to recruit them and traffic them out of the country.
Brown said improved educational opportunities provided the best way to help vulnerable children, and called for the creation of a new international fund to help quickly target and assist young people caught up in wars and emergencies. He called on governments, aid agencies and development organisations to back the proposed global humanitarian fund for education in emergencies, which he said could be launched at the UN general assembly in New York in September.
The UNs World Education Forum, held in Incheon, South Korea, this month, heard that worldwide, 58 million children currently have no schooling at all , while 250 million are not learning basic skills even though half have spent at least four years at school.
2015 is the worst year since 1945 for children being displaced, for becoming refugees, for seeing their schools attacked
Gordon Brown
The forum adopted targets intended to provide inclusive, equitable, quality education for all, underpinning the new Sustainable Development Goals that will supersede the 15-year-old Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) when the general assembly meets this autumn.
Significant progress has been made in some least developed countries in improving early life education but many aspects of the MDGs on education, including universal access to primary education, remain unmet, the forum was told.
Anthony Lake, executive director of the UN childrens fund (Unicef), said: If this generation of children is to someday reduce the inequalities and injustices that afflict the world today, we must give all our children a fair chance to learn. This must be our collective vision and commitment.
Kishore Singh, UN special rapporteur on education, called for new strategies focusing on girls and women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and children living in conflict-affected areas, rural areas and urban slums. He said: It is the weakest among us who need education the most and we cannot stand by as they are being excluded.

How clamping down on tax avoidance can unlock billions for development
There is an existing global instrument to help prevent the 2tn annually lost to governments. The UN should focus on making it work

Tax evasion is a major cause of underdevelopment. Against the backdrop of Greece struggling to plug budgetary holes , aggravated by rampant tax evasion , the upcoming UN financing for development conference to support achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to cultivating domestic resources to promote development.
Rather than adopting new initiatives to bolster tax bases and reduce evasion, UN members ought to focus on making existing tools work better. Among the most powerful instruments available is the anodyne-sounding convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters , which was developed under the OECD and Council of Europe , but is open to all jurisdictions.
The convention is the result of tough negotiations and constitutes a major breakthrough, but has yet to achieve its potential. With governments worldwide losing an estimated $3tn (2tn) annually to tax dodging, making this agreement effective particularly for developing countries  could help unlock billions of dollars for national development efforts.
There are many reasons why taxation is central to development. Most obvious is that taxes give states resources to invest in essentials such as education, roads, and healthcare. As countries become wealthier, taxes fund social welfare and pensions, reducing poverty and inequality and evening out aggregate demand.
Less appreciated is the role of taxes in the development of states themselves. Historical scholarship, such as John Brewers classic work on18th-century Britain, shows that revenue collection builds governments bureaucratic competence and institutional integrity. The need for revenue drives capacity to collect taxes, which leads to improvements in state administration overall, thereby supporting broader economic growth.
One of the sad ironies of public finance is that countries level of development is positively correlated with the share of gross domestic product (GDP) represented by taxes. In other words, wealthier states take a greater percentage of national income in the form of taxes than poorer countries. Within the OECD, the percentage of GDP taken up by the state ranges from 26-48% , while in developing countries the state typically receives only 5-20% .
This is where the convention can make a major contribution.
Developing countries relative inability to tax effectively has a variety of causes but lack of information tops the list. To avoid scrutiny by domestic tax authorities, wealthy persons and companies routinely shift their funds to foreign jurisdictions.
Lacking legal means to demand the information from their counterparts overseas, national revenue authorities have often been without recourse. Until now.
The convention is meant to reduce the need to enter individual bilateral tax information-sharing agreements, while streamlining the actual exchange of information.
The process is quite simple. A tax authority in one country suspects a taxpayer of having income or assets in a foreign jurisdiction. The authority sends a request for information to the equivalent foreign body. Subject to procedural protections, including assurances of confidentiality, that authority processes the request and transmits the information to the requesting authority, which can then take steps to assess taxes owed.
While the conventions mechanisms are straightforward, a number of steps are needed to make it effective and the UN financing for development conference should back these.
First, developing countries need to sign and ratify the agreement. Until now, although 85 jurisdictions have joined, only 26 are developing countries and in only 15 of those has it entered into force. If developing countries dont enter, they cant use the treatys mechanisms.
Indeed, as more countries enter, the convention will become more useful because the pool of jurisdictions from which others can obtain tax information will be enlarged.
Next, to encourage ratification and improve implementation, the convention should be prioritized in development activities. With OECD figures showing that support for tax administration represents less than 1% of all official development assistance, much more emphasis should be placed on making theconvention work.
Above all, these initiatives should focus on building developing countries administrative capacity. Training and technical assistance are essential. Rather than being a vaguely defined ambition, these efforts must achieve demonstrable results.
Specifically, they must help to upgrade national standards to a level that allows other participating countries to disclose confidential taxpayer information with certainty that its integrity will not be compromised.
Official development proclamations regularly pay homage to goals of financial sustainability, while doing little to achieve it. Foreign aid can contribute to development but it will never rival states own tax and revenue-generating capacities. Developing those competencies, in relation to international revenue cooperation, will have spillover benefits for overall domestic revenue collection. And this will put governments firmly in charge of their own development efforts.
As a legally binding treaty, the convention can catalyse activity by all stakeholders. If it is fully operational, there will be more chance of achieving the SDGs. Its time to put this task at the top of the development agenda.

        <title>Syrian refugees in Lebanon camp reliant on 'hell water' that reduces metal to rust</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/26/syrian-refugees-lebanon-shatila-camp-hell-water</Link>

Water at Shatila refugee camp in Beiruts southern suburbs is now so salty and ridden with chemicals that metal cutlery rusts after less than half an hours exposure to the brine.
Imagine having water so bad that you cant have metal cutlery? Its hell water really, says Ahmed, a resident at the camp.
Gesturing at the salty, foul-smelling liquid oozing from a nearby tap, his friend Moussa Deeb, an electrician originally from Damascus, adds: Have you ever woken up and tried washing your face with sea water?

Camp authorities now have to bring in water for bathing and cleaning from outside.
The site of a brutal massacre during the Lebanese civil war, Shatilas population has doubled to about 40,000 in the four years since the conflict in Syria began. At least 1.5 million refugees are estimated to have spilled over the border into Lebanon, with many seeking affordable housing in the populous coastal strip.
The water infrastructure was already reeling from decades of over-pumping, and the effect of these new arrivals has been devastating.
Families who used to receive four subsidised gallons of clean drinking water a week must now make do with half of that as cash-strapped camp bosses struggle to meet demand. Few communities in Lebanon have seen their water quality deteriorate as dangerously as Shatila, but the camps problems point to the countrys difficulties in coping with a sudden 30% growth in population.
People just dont realise how critical the status of our water resources is, said Nadim Farajalla, a professor of hydrology and water resources at the American University of Beirut. Refugees arriving when there was already a drought really killed us.
Unlike Jordan and Iraq, both of which have also taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, Lebanon usually enjoys a long rainy season and receives ample recharge from melting mountain snows, although rains are beginning to become less predictable because of climate change.
But poor management of water sources and the additional refugee demand have set the country on a destructive path.
Because of the Syrians, a water balance that should have been negative in 2030 is negative now, said Fadi Georges Comair, general director of hydraulics and electrical resources at the ministry of energy and water. We were organised to fulfil water demand management for about 4.5 million [people]. We were not ready to deal with the one-and-a-half to two million extras that have come already.
Over the mountains from Beirut, and alongside the Syrian border, residents of the agricultural Bekaa Valley are experiencing their own water crisis.

Water demand from the thousands of makeshift refugee tent settlements has meant rivers are drying up earlier than usual. Farmers, who previously resorted to using expensive wells for water in the hot summer months, are now having to pay out for these earlier in the year. According to Farajalla, the effects in a country that already imports 80% of its cereals , and where the amount of land devoted to food has fallen by 45% in 20 years, are obvious. Many farmers have simply given up.
Every week, theres a bad pump here or a revolution there, so agriculture is not easy in Lebanon, said Mohammed al-Arigi, who grows wheat, radishes and a variety of vegetables within earshot of heavy shelling and bombs three miles away across the border.
The crisis has had some compensations, farmers say. The glut of young, desperate men has meant theres plenty of cheap labour. But the tide of wastewater seeping from the haphazardly built refugee shelters has forced some to shift away from growing vegetables that are usually served raw, such as lettuce, due to concerns about exposure to contaminated water.
Refugees arriving when there was already a drought really killed us
Professor Nadim Farajalla, American University of Beirut
Water experts acknowledge that no country of Lebanons size could cope easily with such an influx of refugees, but they say infrastructural neglect by Beiruts paralysed political class has left it particularly poorly placed to handle the crisis.
Water establishments are highly understaffed, lack financial means, technical competence, and effective internal organisation, said Marie-Hlne Nassif, a consultant for the International Water Management Institute , who has conducted extensive research in the Bekaa.
A national water strategy proposed in 2010 was never implemented properly due to political disagreements. Authorities are left to practically guess how much water they can count on because they lack the equipment necessary to gauge snowmelt.
Shatilas residents have tried to offset the terrible water quality by stocking up on rust-proof plastic cutlery. Nearby shops are doing a roaring trade selling water filters that offer the promise of usable tap water.
But civic leaders fear that conditions in the camp, where children are at risk of electrocution by the low-hanging mess of water pipes and electrical wires, will only worsen as more Syrians seek sanctuary among its creaking tower blocks.
For sure, the population will increase as the Syria war continues, said Abu Moujahed, director of the camps Children and Youth Centre. And the water and services will, of course, just get worse and worse too.

Somewhere among the immense spew of mud brick and broken timber that Bachulaxmi Shrestha now surveys is the home she shared with her family, the fruit and veg shop that was her livelihood, and the treasured keepsakes she had picked up over her 60 years.
All of it was lost, instantly destroyed and commingled with two neighbouring houses, when the first 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Nepalese village of Chapagaun at lunchtime on 25 April.
Shrestha was at work when it hit. I ran outside and seconds later, the building collapsed behind me, she says. It fell and then the others next to it fell.

Dizzy and terrified, she stood, looked at what had been her house, and wept.
Soon, lots of people came to the open space where I was and we all stood and cried for a long time while the earth shook, she says. We were so scared.

At a candlelight vigil on Monday night Nepalis pledge to remember and rise again.
A month after the disaster that killed more than 8,000 people and left thousands injured and homeless, Chapagaun, which lies half an hours drive from Kathmandu, remains a village trapped in an anxious limbo. Many of the houses that withstood the quake and the dozens of aftershocks that have followed are too badly cracked to be habitable and their owners too fearful to set foot in them.
In the absence of permanent shelter, 200 villagers have established a temporary camp in a square, where they eat and sleep together. While the men scavenge the ruins and try to demolish them brick-by-brick, the women work if they can. Children, meanwhile, play in child-friendly spaces (CFSs), hundreds of which have been set up across Nepal by NGOs. Part-creche, part-school and part-psychosocial treatment centre, the spaces are designed to give children a fragment of the normality destroyed by the quake.
At the Chapagaun CFS, run by the youth-led NGO Restless Development , girls sing hill country songs and dance while the boys do jigsaw puzzles made from bits of cut-up calendars.
Neeva Shrestha is a 19-year-old student who was about to sit her exams when the quake struck. She spends her days helping the other children and attempting to reassure her mother, who is permanently dizzy and worried that the earth will split open again at any moment.

Survivors still living in tents talk of their fears of another major quake
Ive been trying to keep my mum calm; Im afraid too, but I am trying to be strong for her, she says. We feel safe in the camp even though everyone is too afraid to go back home.
Unlike many of the camps set up in the aftermath of the quake, the temporary shelter in Chapagaun has become a genuine refuge: the closeness of the community has been reinforced by the disaster. The women there have no fear of sexual assault and the children no anxiety about the traffickers who use such catastrophes to lure them away from their parents and into orphanages or sexual exploitation.
We eat and pass the time together, says Neeva. The earthquake has made the future very dark, but its nice to see the young children laughing and playing again.
We all stood and cried for a long time while the earth shook. We were so scared
Bachulaxmi Shrestha, earthquake survivor
The situation elsewhere in Nepal is far bleaker.
A helicopter flight across the central Sindhupalchok district  one of the worst-affected areas  reveals an ugly tapestry. Crows swoop over tumbles of brick and concrete that were once homes and schools, beams protrude through shattered roof tiles like open fractures and entire villages lie flattened. Orange, blue, yellow and white tents and tarpaulins confetti the steeply terraced hillsides, while people and animals stare up shyly from dwellings that look incapable of sheltering any life at all.
Chautara municipality, the districts headquarters, has the look of a war zone. Many of its taller buildings list at vertiginous and improbable angles, cricket stumps smashed by a brutal ball. Around and beneath them, the hills of rubble disclose the occasional door, window and sheet of twisted corrugated iron. High up on what must have been the second floor of one house, a kitchen cupboard clings to an external wall, tins and packets of food still sitting on its shelves.
Krishna Gyawali, chief district officer of Sindhupalchok, sums up the damage with a handful of numbers: 4,242 people killed across the district, 4,000 injured, 44 still missing and 95% of homes destroyed.
Weve lost schools, health facilities and government offices, he says. Most of our villages are in very remote areas; it takes five days to walk to some of them with relief items, but were trying our best. People are in a very difficult situation; theyve lost their family and their children are suffering. They want to go to safe places.

About 400 people are camped out around the Norwegian Red Cross field hospital, sleeping 12 to a tent. With the monsoon season expected to arrive within a few weeks, Oxfam , Save the Children , the International Organisation for Migration , the Red Cross and others are working with the police, army and government to keep people as safe as possible.
Among the technical discussions of the relative merits of different kinds of tarpaulins and the possibility of upgrading to corrugated iron-roofed shelters, there is a familiar and nagging concern.
The areas affected by the quake have traditionally been high-traffic areas for taking girls to Indian brothels, but theyre also used for internal trafficking, says Bimal Rawal, a child protection adviser for Save the Children. Although he praises the Nepalese government for putting a moratorium on international adoptions and banning the registration of new orphanages following the quake, Rawal says people are still trying to take children to orphanages in Kathmandu, where they are used in funding appeals.
All the agencies need to keep an eye on children, he says. Everything is important but its easy to overlook children in the relief efforts.

His warning is echoed by Virginia Prez , chief of child protection in Nepal for Unicef, the UN childrens agency. Sitting on the concrete stands of Tundikhel, a military parade ground in the centre of Kathmandu that is now home to hundreds of displaced families, she stresses the importance of keeping families together over the coming months.
The best thing we can do is make sure that kids stay with their parents, she says. The Nepalese government has put together a package to help vulnerable children  those who have lost their homes, are being looked after by neighbours, lone girls  and that needs to be properly targeted.
However, it is not just children who are at risk. Saraswoti Gautam, whose house was destroyed, brings her children to the Tundikhel camp each day but is too worried about the threat of sexual violence to stay there overnight. We go back to another camp each night because we dont want to share a tent with the men here, she says.
Justine Greening , the UKs secretary of state for international development  who visited Nepal last week  said some of the 33m the British government had pledged to help Nepal would be spent on protecting women and children, with 10m earmarked for primary healthcare and rebuilding hospitals.
We know that primary care has been hugely disrupted by this earthquake  children not getting the immunisations and vaccinations they normally would do and pregnant women not able to give birth in a safe place with skilled midwives, she told the Guardian. Theres also family planning, which is critical for women.
She added: Were doing a lot of work around women and girls and making sure that children can stay safe. In these situations women and girls and children are always vulnerable.
Greening said that the earthquake highlighted the importance of working to prepare for natural disasters. She pointed to efforts over the past four years to preposition emergency supplies in Nepal and improve the countrys healthcare capacity.
She also said 2m contributed by the Department for International Development to the construction of World Food Programme humanitarian staging areas in Nepal had proved key to the emergency response. One such area was opened close to Kathmandus Tribhuvan airport just four weeks before the earthquake struck.

Had the staging base for humanitarian supplies not been [in place] before the quake, the World Food Programme estimates the whole relief operation would have been pushed back three weeks, because all of that stuff would have come into the airport and been stuck on the tarmac and clogged up an already small airport even more, she said.
Although the talk has already turned to learning lessons from the quake and focusing on building back better, managing the psychological aftershocks of the disaster has emerged as one of the main challenges for relief workers.
For Prez and her colleagues  and chief district officer Gyawali  the second, 7.3 magnitude quake that hit Nepal on 12 May was almost as shattering as the first, despite being weaker.
The emotional impact of the second quake has been devastating on all levels, says Prez. Its delaying the recovery process and people are losing faith. The geologists may just call it an aftershock, but we call it the second quake: its been a double quake.
Gyawali refers to 12 May simply as the day everything went back to zero: within seconds, 1,000 people were running to the flat ground where the Norwegian Red Cross hospital in Chautara sits; 45 minutes after that, the first battered pick-up truck rolled into town, carrying casualties from the surrounding area.
In Chapagaun, the close community suffers fresh agonies with each new tectonic twitch. A little before 3pm on Wednesday, a 4.4-magnitude tremor shook the village, sending the birds screeching into the air and the children screaming into the cover of their tarpaulin camp. It was yet another unnecessary reminder of what had happened  and what may yet lie ahead.
Im still very frightened and nervous, says Bachulaxmi Shrestha. I lost my home and my family has lost everything. We dont know what will happen next or if the government will come to help us. All we can do now is try to reclaim whatever we can from our house.

After more than 50 years of conflict marked by widespread and systemic sexual violence, Colombia has established a national day to remember the appalling suffering experienced by so many women, whose plight has until now been largely ignored.
The first National Day for the Dignity of Women Victims of Sexual Violence caused by the Internal Armed Conflict takes place on Monday 25 May.
The establishment of this special day and the inclusion of survivors of sexual violence in the peace talks in Havana aimed at ending the conflict demonstrate how public awareness of the issue is growing.
It is hard to quantify the numbers affected. One survey estimates that between 2000 and 2009, almost half a million women suffered some form of sexual violence in areas affected by the conflict.
But that is just an estimate. The truth is, in Colombia, as in many other countries with poor prosecution records, most women tend not to report acts of violence against them . According to the same survey, some 82% of women who have survived sexual violence in Colombia, domestic and conflict-related, have not reported the attacks.
One of those at the forefront of demanding public recognition of this form of violence, and the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators, is Colombian journalist Jineth Bedoya Lima , who 15 years ago was abducted, tortured and raped by three paramilitaries while investigating a story about arms trafficking. For years after the attack she had remained silent .
The UN security council recently commended Colombia for introducing a landmark law that recognises that sexual violence can constitute a crime against humanity, and enhances the status of sexual violence survivors so that they can receive reparations, psychosocial support and free medical care.
Related: Women's human rights defenders under threat  podcast
But the problem remains as marked as ever, if not worse, despite the fact the government and the Farc, the main insurgent group, have been engaged in peace talks for more than two years. Following a freedom of information request made by Claudia Meja, director of NGO Sisma Mujer  a Christian Aid partner  the National Institute of Forensic Services revealed that they recorded a 93% increase of sexual violence in the context of the conflict.
They also disclosed that there were 30% more killings of women by partners or ex-partners, and a sharp increase in threats against womens human rights defenders.
Explaining this apparent escalation of gender violence is not straightforward. One suggestion has been that more women are coming forward to report violence. Also, as more women dare to speak up, more may be facing a backlash.
To womens rights experts like Meja, the persistence of violence against women, however, shows that there are other forces at work. She believes that the root causes are the deeply entrenched discrimination and inequality that condones gender violence and, crucially, the almost complete impunity, particularly of military perpetrators. For this reason, Sisma Mujer and other organisations recently filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court, calling for sexual violence to be recognised as a deliberate strategy and war crime, and condemning the failure to prosecute perpetrators.
There is reason to hope that the final peace deal may bring some change. Thanks to relentless pressure by womens groups, the negotiators in Havana have established a special gender sub-committee and listened to testimonies of victims of sexual violence. These are positive and innovative steps, although long overdue given numerous, unfulfilled international commitments to incorporate women and gender perspectives in peace negotiations.
Allowing perpetrators of war crimes to walk free risks allowing such violence to become normalised
Yet, because these are negotiations, and because all parties continue to deny their responsibility for such crimes, there is a very real risk that perpetrators may get away with some form of amnesty, as has happened with a number of other peace deals in Latin America.
Failure to deal with abuses and allowing perpetrators of war crimes to walk free risks allowing such violence to become normalised, although the country may officially be at peace.
The peace deal that is sought is the opportunity to introduce radical change, and to shape a more equal society, tackling the root causes of the conflict. Guaranteeing justice and reparations for women and girls is an essential step towards a peace that is lasting and meaningful.
The work of womens rights groups including Sisma Mujer, alongside initiatives such as choosing a national day to recognise victims of sexual violence are vital to maintain pressure on the peace negotiators.

Hien was 10 when he arrived in Britain. He did not know where he was or where he had been. He knew only that he was here to work. Since he emerged from the back of a lorry after crossing from Calais seven years ago, his experience has been one of exploitation and misery. He has been a domestic slave, been trafficked into cannabis factories, been abused and beaten and was eventually prosecuted and sent to prison. It has been a life of terror, isolation and pain.
Hiens story is not unique. He is one of an estimated 3,000 Vietnamese children in forced labour in the UK, used for financial gain by criminal gangs running cannabis factories, nail bars, garment factories, brothels and private homes. Charged up to 25,000 for their passage to the UK, these children collectively owe their traffickers almost 75m.
While there is growing awareness of the use of trafficked Vietnamese people in the booming domestic cannabis trade, child trafficking experts are now warning that the British authorities are unable to keep up with the speed at which UK-based Vietnamese gangs are recruiting and exploiting children for use in other criminal enterprises such as gun-smuggling, crystal meth production and prostitution rings.
By our calculations there are around 3,000 Vietnamese children in the UK who are being used for profit by criminal gangs, says Philip Ishola, former head of the UKs Counter Human Trafficking Bureau.
The police and the authorities are now aware that trafficked children are being forced to work in cannabis farms but this is really only the tip of the iceberg. Often the same child will be exploited not just in a cannabis farm but also in myriad different ways. This is happening right under our noses and not enough is being done to stop it.
Police admit that they are struggling with the speed at which Vietnamese criminal gangs are diversifying and expanding their activities across the England and into Scotland and Northern Ireland. Right now we are just fighting in the trenches, fighting in the nail bars, said detective inspector Steven Cartwright, who heads Police Scotlands human trafficking unit. It is vital that we that we understand new methods being deployed by the gangs because we need to stop demand at one end or limit their ability to make money at the other.
Hiens journey to the UK started when he was taken from his village at the age of five by someone who claimed to be his uncle. As an orphan, he had no option but to do as he was told. He spent five years travelling overland, completely unaware which countries he was going through, from Vietnam before being smuggled across the Channel and taken to a house in London. Here he spent the next three years trapped in domestic servitude, cooking and cleaning for groups of Vietnamese people who would come in and out of the property where he was held.
The men in the house beat him and forced him to drink alcohol until he was sick. Other things happened to him that he still cannot talk about. He was never allowed out of the house and was told that if he tried to escape, the police would arrest him and take him to prison.
During his time in that house, Hien says, many other Vietnamese children were brought in. They told him that they were here to work and to pay off debts for their families back home. They would stay for a few days and then be taken away, and Hien never saw them again. He became homeless after his uncle abandoned him. He slept in parks and ate out of bins. He was eventually picked up by a Vietnamese couple, who offered him a place to stay but then forced him to work in cannabis farms in flats in first Manchester and then Scotland.
In his testimony to police, he says he still does not understand exactly what the plants were, although he understands now that they are worth a lot of money. He looked after the plants, using pesticides that made him ill, and only left the flat when he helped transport the leaves to be dried elsewhere. He was locked in, threatened, beaten and completely isolated from the outside world.
I was never paid any money for working there, he says. I did not stay there for money but because I was afraid and I hoped the whole thing would end soon.
When the police came, they found Hien alone with the plants. He told his story to the police, but was still sent to young offenders institution in Scotland, where he spent 10 months on remand, charged with cannabis cultivation. He was released only after the intervention of a crown prosecutor led to him being identified as a victim of trafficking.
Vietnamese children such as Hien are easy pickings for the increasingly sophisticated trafficking gangs operating between the UK and Vietnam. Children make up nearly a quarter of the estimated 13,000 people trafficked into the UK every year, and Vietnamese children are the largest group of children trafficked to the UK. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that 30 Vietnamese children arrive illegally in the UK every month, on well-established smuggling routes.
Children are an increasingly valuable assets to criminal gangs because they are easy to get hold of, easily intimidated and exploited, and easy to keep isolated and unaware of what is really happening around them, which makes it far less likely for them to be able to disclose anything of use to the police, says Ishola.
When it comes to Vietnamese children, he says, the culture of seeing a child as the golden egg, who will be sent to work abroad and provide for their families still prevails. This attitude is exploited by gangs, who deceive families into believing that there is legitimate work in Britain for their children.
During their journey to the UK, the traffickers keep charging the children more and more money, and by the time they arrive, the pressure to pay back this enormous debt is a key factor in their vulnerability to ending up trapped in forced labour, he says. Upon arrival the children are faced with a highly organised system of criminal activity, with methods of control ranging from extreme physical brutality to debt bondage. Before they even arrive, that trap is set for them.
Members of the Vietnamese diaspora in London told the Observer that they had seen an explosion in child trafficking by criminal gangs operating on the peripheries of their communities in recent years. Some of these children and victims have told me that it cost them 25,000 to get to the UK, said one Vietnamese community leader in London, who did not want to be named. They come with a debt and they are not allowed to leave until the debt is paid. That is slavery and exploitation.

Hiens story: A child trafficked from Vietnam into forced labour in the UK
Like Hien, many of the children end up working on cannabis farms. The link between child trafficking and the UKs domestic cannabis industry has been increasing, with Vietnamese children the main group at risk. According to a 2014 report by the NGO AntiSlavery International , almost all potential victims of trafficking linked to cannabis are Vietnamese, and more than 80% are children. Many of these children are subsequently prosecuted by the UK justice system, despite many being identified as potential victims of trafficking. This has led to Vietnamese children becoming the second-largest ethnic group held in youth detention centres across the UK.
Vietnamese gangs have historically dominated the UKs 1bn cannabis trade and have been instrumental in the proportion of domestically grown cannabis in Britain rising from 15% in 2005 to about 90% now. While the trade remains enormously profitable  the number of Vietnamese cannabis factories in the UK has grown by 150% in the past two years  their grip has been weakened thanks to increased law enforcement and under competition from British growers. Now they are finding new and more efficient ways of doing business.
In terms of law enforcement, I think were about two years behind the curve, says Daniel Silverstone, a criminologist at London Metropolitan University who has written extensively on Vietnamese gangs in the UK.
Traffickers have changed their modus operandi in recent years in direct response to the attention and interventions of law enforcement. A few years ago it was almost exclusively cannabis farms, but their business interests have now become much more diverse. So were seeing an expansion into Scotland and Northern Ireland, the use of nail bars for forced labour and money laundering, and moves into drugs like crystal meth. This means that children, who are an integral part of the gangs business operations, are also now being moved into other areas of exploitation. As their grip on the domestic cannabis trade slips a little, they are looking to maximise their profits from these children in whatever way they can, he adds.
The Metropolitan police say that there is now much more awareness of the complexity of tackling the UKs child trafficking problem but that the closed nature of the Vietnamese community has made things difficult. What has persistently been a challenge for us is making inroads into this community, says Phil Brewer, who heads its new human trafficking and kidnap unit. We usually only find out about a child when we make a raid and find someone in a cannabis factory or nail bar, but often this person has been through multiple forms of exploitation before we reach them.

Parosha Chandran, a leading human rights barrister and UN expert on trafficking, has represented Vietnamese children charged with cannabis cultivation who have gone through many different trafficking situations before being moved into cannabis farms.
Trafficked Vietnamese children have rarely faced just one type of forced labour, she says. Ive come across cases where young people have been subjected to a spectrum of exploitative practices. In one of my cases, for example, the child was forced to look after peoples homes and care for their children, when he was just a child himself, then he was taken to work cleaning a nail bar, then moved to another place where he was forced to sew labels on to clothing  and all of this happened before he even arrived in the cannabis factory.
In March the UK passed its first Modern Slavery Bill, designed to increase the prosecution of traffickers and give better protection to victims of modern slavery in the UK. However, Chandran says that Vietnamese children continue to be prosecuted for cannabis cultivation while their traffickers remain free.
The Modern Slavery Acts central focus on prosecution is misguided and its provisions fail to fully protect the rights of trafficked children, she says. We as a democratic country need to find durable solutions to ensure these children remain protected from harm for the rest of their lives.
At safe accommodation for child trafficking victims run by the charity Love146, Lynne Chitty, its UK care director, says that she has helped between 40 and 50 Vietnamese children try to rebuild their lives after trafficking experiences.
We have seen children starting to be exploited in multiple ways, to maximise the profit that can be gained from them, she says. We recently had a client who was in domestic servitude, forced to work in a nail bar during the day and every evening taken to a brothel and exploited there all night.
Related: Human traffickers may face life sentence under Britain's tough new slavery bill
Methods used to lure children from Vietnam to the UK are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, including use of social media. Vietnamese children are brought to the UK, taken in by Vietnamese adults and put to domestic work, says Swat Pandi, from the NSPCCs child trafficking advice centre. The child feels indebted to the adults for food and shelter and is told they need to return the favour by looking after cannabis plants. These children suffer high levels of neglect, emotional abuse and, in the absence of any protective factors, are highly vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse.
Despite the governments pledge to end modern slavery and the UKs first modern slavery bill, passed in March, Chitty says she has seen no change in the numbers of Vietnamese children coming through her charitys services. Its very much business as usual, she says. We still have a problem with immediate safeguarding and appropriate placements for trafficked children. And young people are still being criminalised by the courts.
Even when a child has been taken out of trafficking and come under the care of a local authority, he or she is likely to return to the control of the traffickers. In 2013, a report by independent thinktank the Centre for Social Justice concluded that 60% of trafficked children in local authority care go missing, nearly a third of them within a week of arrival. Most are never found again. There are increasing reports of children being retrafficked from foster homes or when they have been given asylum status.
I dont think we understand the entire enterprise, says detective inspector Cartwright. Despite our best intentions I think were not offering them anything that would persuade them to stay. Many will get retrafficked because we didnt offer them a better alternative to what the traffickers are providing.
Hien is trying to rebuild his life after being given asylum in Scotland, but is struggling to find peace after years of trauma. I still worry that the traffickers may find me and come to my house. But I know this time that I will ask for help, he says. I think they have justice here but I wish they hadnt kept me in prison for so long. By telling my story, I want people to understand what I have experienced here.

MODERN SLAVERY IN NUMBERS
10,000
The Home Office estimates that there are between 10,000 and 13,000 victims of modern-day slavery in the UK.
100
Estimates suggest that there could be 100 children trafficked every week into the UK. Albanian and Nigerian females, including adults, make up the largest groups being referred to agencies as potential victims, while Vietnamese people make up the largest number of males referred. British children make up the largest group of trafficked young people, while Vietnamese children are the largest number of foreign nationals exploited in the UK.
34%
The National Crime Agency has reported a 34% rise in potential trafficking victims in 2014 compared with a year earlier. Adults are predominantly victims of sexual exploitation, while minors are exploited for labour.
51%
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) says that 51% of all the young people referred to itschild trafficking advice centre from Vietnam have been reported missing at one time.
96%
Anti-Slavery International says that of the potential trafficking victims who were forced to cultivate cannabis, 96% were from Vietnam and 81% of those were children.
25%
Nearly 25% of all trafficking victims are children.
30,000
Agencies report that victims are being sold on, along with their debt, for as much as 30,000, to other traffickers for multiple exploitation, including sex trafficking, domestic servitude and cannabis cultivation.
58%
Of the trafficked children who have disappeared, the NSPCC reported in its 2012 all-party parliamentary groupreport that 58% were being exploited for criminal activity and cannabis cultivation.

On Sunday, millions of Ethiopians will line up at polling stations to participate in Africas largest exercise of political theatre. A decade-long campaign by Ethiopias government to silence dissent forcibly has left the country without a viable political opposition, without independent media , and without public challenges to the ruling partys ideology.
For most Ethiopians, these elections are a non-event.
Related: Ethiopia's elections are just an exercise in controlled political participation | Jason Mosley
The one potential dividend of these sham polls, however, is the international attention they will garner for the governments growing political repression . The blatant disregard for internationally recognised standards for free and fair elections just might convince Ethiopias largest donors that it is time to rethink their relationship with an increasingly authoritarian government.
As long as democratic governance and respect for human rights are pushed aside by donors in favour of economic development and security cooperation, Ethiopias long-term stability is at serious risk.
Since 2005, the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front s (EPRDF) has cracked down on independent media and human rights groups.
In 2009, parliament passed the charities and societies proclamation , which placed restrictive regulations on non-government organisations, including limitations on foreign funding. Today,only a handful of these groups exist, and most are struggling to survive.
The preferred government strategy for eliminating independent media is to file criminal charges against publishers, and to impose hefty fines and prison terms. When lawsuits do not succeed, the government simply arrests journalists, as occurred last year when bloggers and journalists affiliated with the Zone 9 blogging collective were apprehended. The group remains imprisoned and charged as terrorists.
Post-election, the EPRDF, secure in its hold on power, might be willing to allow a small degree of dissent: Ethiopian officials are increasingly wary of reactions by the international community to the crackdown on critics and in 2013 published a national human rights action plan .
Related: What causes conflict and how can it be resolved?  podcast
The US, UK and European Union  Ethiopias largest donors  need to increase their support for democracy and human rights because much can be done right now.
Despite years of political repression, a new generation of human rights defenders is slowly emerging. The Zone 9 bloggers represented this new generation, using new technologies to educate fellow Ethiopians on exercising and defending their rights.
The human rights and democracy groups that remain are finding creative ways to conduct their work. This includes working with traditional development organisations, which the government generally tolerates, or focusing on seemingly apolitical issues, such as government accountability and corruption, that are important in strengthening Ethiopias democracy.
Donor countries fall short in their support for these groups. In the US, President Barack Obamas latest budget request includes some $400m (257m) in assistance to Ethiopia  but only $2m of it is for democracy and human rights programming.
The UK is equally parsimonious in democracy support. One reason is that the EPRDF makes it difficult for domestic groups to accept outside aid.
Donors could take concrete action right now. First, supporting off-shore programming allows activists to travel outside Ethiopia to get technical and strategic advice. Second, donors strategies for Ethiopia should include funds specifically dedicated to strengthening independent media outlets and journalists; the EU intends to take this step after the election.

Also, donors can find ways around foreign funding restrictions by pushing for the creation of funding pools considered local under Ethiopian law. The EU did this in 2011, when it created the Civil Society Fund , providing assistance to local human rights and democracy groups. The US should use its economic and diplomatic leverage to do likewise, a move that would provide a much-needed lifeline for these groups.
Greater funding for human rights will be vital for Ethiopian activists, whose reach has been limited by the charities and societies proclamation.
Before that came into being six years ago, the countrys leading human rights organisation, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO), operated with a budget of $400,000 and 60 employees .
Today, its budget is less than half that figure, and staffing is down 80%. The only thing keeping EHRCO alive is financial aid from the EU Civil Society Fund.
Ethiopia receives nearly $4bn in official development assistance. This is more than any other country in Africa and makes up a significant portion of the governments annual budget. If the US, UK, EU and Canada coordinated policies, Ethiopia would have to respond to their human rights and democracy concerns.
Ethiopias election should be a wake-up call for the international community. With each successive election that does not allow genuine choice, both apathy and resentment grow, and Ethiopia risks falling prey to the same instability that has plagued its neighbours.

South Sudan close to economic collapse as famine fears resurface
Soaring inflation threatens to cause financial crash that would mark a tipping point for people struggling to survive brutal civil war, warns senior UN official

South Sudan is on the verge of economic collapse, sparking renewed fears of famine as continued fighting takes a heavy toll on peoples livelihoods, a top UN official has warned.
Toby Lanzer, the UN humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan, said there is a very high probability that soaring inflation will cause the South Sudanese pound to collapse.
Related: South Sudan: how the crisis unfolded  interactive timeline
Its not only that South Sudan has some of the lowest human development indicators of anywhere. Its not only that youve had 17 months of pretty brutal violence. Its that were also in the midst of economic stress, which  to be clear  is on the verge of economic collapse, said Lanzer.
That will add significant pressure to people who are trying to eke out a living, and it will certainly send some people who have managed to get by over the edge, and turn them to just about surviving. People will be spending 80-85% of what income they have on food.
South Sudan slid into civil war in December 2013, when president Salva Kiir accused his former deputy, Riek Machar, of launching a rebellion. Fighting has mostly been waged across ethnic lines, pitting Kiirs Dinka against Machars Nuer.
About 3.5 million people  nearly 40% of South Sudans population  will require emergency food assistance by June, according to the famine early warning systems network (Fews Net) .
In March, fresh skirmishes broke out, putting 650,000 people beyond the reach of aid agencies . Recent fighting has prompted NGOs to evacuate their staff from Leer, Koch, Nyal, Ganyiel and Mayendit, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha).
The army said on Wednesday it had taken Leer, the town where Machar was born, from opposition forces after an almost month-long assault that has come at a huge cost to civilians. Paul Critchley, head of mission in South Sudan for Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF), told Agence France-Presse: I managed to make contact yesterday with one of our South Sudanese employees in the Leer surroundings, who told me that he had been immersed in muddy water for up to nine hours to avoid bullets flying overhead. He recovered the bodies of two dead children from the swamp and reported that a woman from the group had been abducted. Someone else was looking after her baby.
Rebels last week launched a major counterattack, including an assault on Malakal, the state capital of Upper Nile and the gateway to the countrys last remaining major oil fields. There has also been heavy fighting in vital oil zone areas north of Malakal, around the town of Melut, where two mortar bombs hit a UN base, killing four civilians including a woman and child.
Children as young as seven have been killed amid the rising violence; others have been raped, abducted, mutilated or recruited to fight . Survivors told the UN childrens agency, Unicef, that whole villages were burned to the ground by armed groups, while girls and women were raped and killed. At least 19 boys and seven girls were reportedly killed, said Unicef.
Critchley said: The escalation has left people in conflict areas exposed to violence and without much needed medical care and humanitarian assistance.
Much of the recent violence took place in Malakal, in the north-east of the country, where MSF has established a safe haven for about 30,000 civilians. The highly volatile situation continues to prevent teams from being able to enter Malakal town itself, MSF said.
Heavy rains are expected to spread across the country by the end of June, turning roads to mud and making it more difficult for aid agencies to provide assistance.
Fighting has also prevented farmers from planting new crops in time for the countrys rainy season, lowering expectations for future harvests. [Recent violence] bodes very, very badly for the coming three to six months. I see the number of people who are severely food insecure growing sharply in the coming months, said Lanzer.
Related: South Sudan: how conflict shapes life in local communities  in pictures
Huge numbers of people already facing severe food insecurity will be unable to grow food, meaning the possibility of famine cannot be excluded, Lanzer said. In a way, we are already very, very worried because the last place to have a famine was Somalia, but actually many hundreds of thousands of people died well before the famine was officially [declared], he added.
There is mounting frustration, both within South Sudan and among the diplomatic community, over the slow progress of peace efforts. Talks brokered by the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development floundered in early March.
We dont have any concrete news that [peace talks] are likely to begin in the foreseeable future, Lanzer said. There are so many of us here in Juba and on the ground in South Sudan who are really frustrated by the situation and the tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes. The greatest frustration is that we do not sense urgency and a will to foster reconciliation from the political leadership.
On 16 June the European commission and Ocha will hold a conference in Geneva to raise money for humanitarian operations in South Sudan. Lanzer is hoping to raise at least $600m (383m) for aid and logistics.
That will be a very important moment for the aid operation in South Sudan. It will be crucial that we raise a significant amount of money in mid-June to help tide us over during this lean season, when we really need to step up the aid operation.
But what the country really needs is a lasting peace deal, Lanzer said. In the absence of peace, I find it difficult to see a way out of this.

When disaster strikes, cash transfers can offer older people a vital lifeline
For older people unable to endure lengthy waits and mad scrambles for relief items, cash relief and the freedom of choice it confers affords obvious advantages

Khamraj*, 87, lost everything when his home collapsed in front of him during the earthquake in Nepal . He was given $75 (48) from HelpAge International and can now afford the labour to build a temporary shelter. He is one of 10,000 people over the age of 60 who have received this support.

Cash relief, which complements in-kind humanitarian assistance as well as offering a potential alternative to it, is increasingly common. It is often preferable to relief items, allowing individuals and families to spend money on what they need, and to make these critical decisions for themselves in a dignified manner. Cash spent locally and on useful things has a positive impact on the economy, and can greatly assist the process of markets re-establishing themselves. Money in the hands of the most vulnerable disaster victims has been shown to support traders all the way down the supply chain.
For the donors who fund humanitarian assistance and the agencies that deliver it, cash offers obvious advantages. Less expenditure on transport and warehouse costs means more funding where we all want to see it. Imagine the terrain and logistical challenges in Nepal at the moment, and think how much easier it would be  assuming food is available to buy locally  to transport money for people to buy food, rather than sending in supplies by truck. Cash distributions can greatly reduce logistical costs, meaning more money can go directly into the hands of those who need it.
Related: Urgent need to deal with rapid rise in numbers of older people, says report
Older people often face specific challenges during the distribution of relief items. Long waits can be a hardship for the elderly  and perhaps completely impossible  while for those with reduced strength, large, heavy items can be difficult to carry home. Chaotic scrambles for blankets or food dropped off by helicopters or trucks, scenes we know all too well from our televisions, tend to reward the strongest in a community, not the weakest.
Older carers of children  and there are many in Nepal because of the widespread migration of young adults to cities in Nepal, India and the Gulf for work  may find it hard to attend food distributions unless they can find someone to fill in for them. But cash puts older women and men back in control: in most towns and villages, goods can be paid for at a store and then delivered to their door.
In addition to physical relief efforts, weve been working with the government of Nepal and the World Food Programme to ensure that households with older people can be included in cash-for-work programmes. These schemes are widely used, and rightly so: they put money in peoples pockets, and enable critical clear-up tasks  debris clearing, road opening and so on  to be completed quickly. Such work is far from easy, and not everyone in a community is strong enough to do it. About 8% of Nepals population is aged 60 or above , and approximately 650,000 older people in Nepal have been affected by the disaster .
In many past clear-up operations, we have seen older and disabled members of the community miss out on cash-for-work programmes altogether. Not in Nepal, though: international guidelines now ask all relief agencies running schemes of this type to find light labour tasks such as childcare, record-keeping or fetching water.
Even more significant, they are asked to make compassionate, unconditional payments equivalent to a days work if a person is truly unable to do tasks of any kind due to age or infirmity. This could impact positively on hundreds of thousands of older or disabled people in the coming months.
Cash puts older people back in control: goods can be paid for at a store and then delivered to their door
Cash distributions are not suitable for every context, and not without risks. Agencies need to understand the local economic and security context. If there is no food or shelter material to buy locally, cash will not put food on the table or a roof over someones head. Agencies distributing cash must obviously do all they can to ensure the safety and security of everyone involved, so we think about the time of day when money is given out, checking whether older people will be able to return home in daylight and that due diligence has been undertaken to ensure the security of both recipients and staff.
Individual agencies donating cash with a specific aim  for example, to achieve a positive nutritional outcome or to help children resume their schooling  must be prepared to accept that, in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, a family may not share the NGOs priorities. The very element that makes cash so empowering for those who receive it can challenge the well-choreographed and rehearsed narratives within our sector about the relationship between inputs and outcomes. Importantly, however, fears that people will spend the money they receive on negative products such as alcohol and tobacco are almost never found to be justified . That they persist is to the discredit of an overly paternalistic humanitarian system, rarely to the families receiving cash.

I have been living and working in Mdecins Sans Frontires hospital since the clashes began in March . Ive only been able to leave the hospital twice since then. The first time was to refer a patient to a specialised hospital as his life was in danger. Thankfully, he is now alive and well.
The second time was to participate in the burial of a dear friend who had died. He was an administrative employee in a local hospital but was working as a volunteer to provide first aid to the injured. One day, he was transferring an injured patient to the hospital. The car was going fast  there was no ambulance and they were using an open pickup. My friend fell from the car and was taken to a hospital. I was not able to visit him, as I was busy here; we were receiving many cases and it was important for me to stay in order to supervise the nurses, nursing assistants, cleaning staff, and others. On the third day after his injury, I received news of his death. The second time I went outside the hospital was to say farewell to my friend and participate in the burial. He was a pleasant, hard-working and brave person.

My family left with our neighbours to an area outside Aden for their own safety. I wasnt able to see them or say goodbye. My house is not far from the hospital, about 3km away, but it feels like thousands of kilometres. I cannot go and check if everything is OK there. I heard from some neighbours that our neighbourhood has been affected by shells, but I dont know the condition of my house. Is it locked? Have the windows been broken? Has it been robbed?
All I do is work and eat and take some rest if I can. Often, I try to sleep but am woken by an emergency and have to make sure everything is going as planned in order to receive the injured. We are still receiving significant numbers of patients despite the fact that many have difficulties reaching the hospital. Some patients told me they had to pay 10 times [more] for transport compared with prices before the clashes, so they are the ones who make it to the hospital. So, for a trip that used to cost 500 Yemeni rials (about $2.50), some people are now paying 5,000-6,000 rials to come to the hospital.
This amount is difficult to afford in the current circumstances, especially as so many people have not received their salaries due to the bank and post offices and foreign exchange centres being closed, and the extreme difficulty of movement in the city.
Food and water are additional problems, besides fuel shortages and the deteriorating security situation in Aden. Some of my neighbours say that they are taking two meals and sometimes only one meal a day after having to wait in long queues to buy food.

It is the same problem with water, with people having to queue with jerrycans. We are facing all this in the hot summer of Aden, which gets hotter every day. Though we usually have food for the people in the hospital, sometimes we face problems providing it as we cannot go out. Restaurants and grocery stores are closed in areas where there are clashes.
Our biggest fear is that the fighting will surround the hospital. Many times, when the clashes intensify, we go down to the basement. But this creates a different problem. Before we save ourselves, we move the patients who are in beds near windows to a safe place. This has happened many times. We hear the sound of gunshots and shelling or air strikes and we move all the patients to safe areas before finding a safe place for ourselves. Windows at the hospital have been broken more than once and bullets have entered, but no one has been hurt inside the hospital.

Some of our medical team in Aden have lost family members due to the fighting. Some have lost a father, a brother, a friend. Sometimes members of the team leave the hospital to check on their families and we hear nothing about them for a week or two due to the bad telecommunications coverage or the unstable security situation, which forces them to stay home.
I have no idea how long things will stay like this . I am very sad to see what has happened to Aden. A friend of mine tells me that I will not believe my eyes if I go to the Crater district of Aden now . Crater is my favourite place in Aden and I have many beautiful memories of being there.
We have to forget about our pain and motivate ourselves to continue working and providing healthcare to patients. As for the ceasefire we heard so much about, we have not felt it here in Aden.

This week in New York, UN member states are discussing implementation and review mechanisms for the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will become the focus of the UN development agenda for the next 15 years. In its 2014 world investment report , the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates the SDGs will require between $3.3tn and $4.5tn (2.1-2.9tn) a year to implement. Proponents of privatisation have used this funding gap to promote the case for greater private sector participation, particularly in the global south.

But before the UN creates a new channel for foreign investments in public services it needs to take a closer look at the history of the private sector leaving behind the most marginalised and vulnerable. This is particularly salient in a global context where investment treaties increasingly limit the ability of states to uphold human rights commitments when they are deemed to interfere with profits.
In March this year, an Indonesian court annulled a 17-year-old private contract with the water corporations Suez and Aetra on the basis of human rights violations resulting from a fourfold rise in tariffs since the utility was privatised, lower service coverage than promised, and water leakage levels of up to 44%.
Jakarta is the largest of 186 municipalities worldwide that have brought water and sanitation services back into the public sector over the past decade. In May 2014, Greeces top administrative court prevented the privatisation of Athens Water , ruling that it would violate human rights. In July 2012, Italys constitutional court blocked plans to privatise water. Uruguay and the Netherlands have adopted outright bans on private water services. For the most part, these were outcomes of public outrage at corporations profiting from astronomical rates as they shortchanged the public on service quality and diminished environmental, public health, and labour standards.
Research shows that the estimated $260m financing gap in water and sanitation will be best met through public financing, which currently accounts for more than 90% of global infrastructure investment.
Conversely, without an economic incentive to serve poor communities, the private sector will not ensure universal enjoyment of the human right to water and sanitation. A Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) study shows that private sector investment results in very few new connections in parts of the world where the need is greatest, such as sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.

Requiring ever-increasing returns on investments, for-profit operations are far more expensive than public financing through progressive taxation or bonds. PSIRU data demonstrates that the vast majority of states have the capacity to deliver universal access to strong public services. Even countries with the highest number of people in need of water and sewerage connections could deliver these services over a 10-year period with less than 1% of GDP a year. For the few countries where needs cannot be met through progressive taxation, the gap can be filled by aid.
Foreign investment poses an increasing threat, due to the rapidly expanding web of trade and investment deals that incorporate investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanisms. ISDS undermines state sovereignty by allowing investors to make recourse to a separate court system that enables them to sue states when policies threaten present or future profits. ISDS arbitration is beholden to the terms of trade treaties, which are designed to protect investments. This means that in any case of doubt, provisions are interpreted in the investors favour , over and above any concern for democratic decision-making for the public good.
There has been a sharp increase in the use of ISDS. Unctad records indicate that, in the 50 years to the end of 2014, there have been a total of 608 known ISDS cases, with 58 new cases in 2012 , and 42 in 2014. A new investment agreement is concluded every other week.
Greater private sector participation through the SDGs will only exacerbate the global water and sanitation crisis
Argentina has been sued more than 40 times for actions it took during its economic crisis in the early 2000s. Faced with mass unemployment and 70% of children living in poverty, it fixed the price of water, gas and electricity, and later nationalised utilities to stave off threatened price hikes. In a ruling last month , the country was ordered to pay Suez $405m. While Argentina argued that it acted to ensure the human right to water for its population, the tribunal found that human rights cannot override investor rights.
This fundamental premise of ISDS means southern countries must absorb the double impact of privatisation and investment treaties.
Last month, Alfred de Zayas , UN special rapporteur on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, warned that secret investment agreements threaten human rights and violate international law. In March, more than 100 US law professors signed a letter highlighting the threat posed by the unaccountable ISDS system to the rule of law and domestic sovereignty.
If the international community is truly concerned about leaving no one behind, the SDGs must ask why so many have been left behind in the first place.
With the rise of investment treaties giving primacy to corporate rights, and no legally binding international mechanisms to hold these corporations accountable for human rights violations, greater private sector participation in water and sanitation projects through the SDGs will only exacerbate the water and sanitation crisis around the globe.

Hugh Muir and Clr N Chonghaile present this edition of the Global development podcast, which examines the factors that drive conflict, assesses the role women and the UN can play in peacebuilding, and asks what the sustainable development goals will do to help tackle the issue.
Gustavo de Carvalho, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa, talks about the role of militarisation in driving conflict, while Laura Hammond, head of the development studies department at the School of Oriental Studies in London, argues that the ready availability of weapons and the marginalisation of women do nothing to promote peace. Both De Carvalho and Hammond identify economic factors as a key driver of conflict.
We also hear from Leymah Gbowee, the Nobel peace laureate and Liberian activist, who says women should be given more space to promote peace at national and international levels.
Debating the significance of these issues are Radhika Coomaraswamy, formerly the UN secretary general's special representative for children and armed conflict, Maria Butler, director of the PeaceWomen project, and Colin Archer, secretary general of the International Peace Bureau.

European gold, tantalum (the material that makes mobile phones vibrate), tungsten and tin imports from conflict zones will be subjected to tougher surveillance procedures under a new regulation adopted by the European parliament on Wednesday.
MEPs in Strasbourg voted to enforce an obligatory monitoring system for the whole supply chain of conflict minerals, affecting 800,000 European companies.
Mineral importers, smelters and refineries, but also manufacturers of consumer products such as mobile phones, tablets, washing machines, will have to ensure that revenues from the minerals they use are not funding conflicts.
The bill is largely aimed at Africa, where minerals play a role in several violent conflicts. The Great Lakes region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is particularly affected by the phenomenon. Mineral production accounts for an average of 24% of gross national product in African countries, and is implicated in no fewer than 27 conflicts on the continent.
The surprise vote, led in large part by the European parliaments leftist parties, has strongly reinforced the European commissions proposal, which was initially based on a voluntary system.
It also went beyond the proposal of the European parliaments international trade committee, whose members had hoped to oblige only European smelters and refineries to source their materials responsibly.
Marie Arena, the socialists and democrats (S&amp;D) groups spokesperson on conflict minerals, said: The regulation voted through today is a historic victory that puts the respect of human rights above the profit of companies. Europe can become a pioneer in the field of ethical economy.
But the regulation still has a long road to travel. The bills slim majority in the European parliament pushed MEPs to opt for quick negotiations with the other institutions (the council and commission) before making their formal decision during the first reading. This is a very unusual procedure.
Iuliu Winkler of the European Peoples Party (EPP), the bills rapporteur, said: Unfortunately, the divisions, which were already clear in the vote in the international trade committee, dominated the plenary vote. We are heading towards a complicated negotiation process.
Among the primary concerns expressed by conservatives was the effect the regulation would have on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Implementing such an obligation on the supply chain is utopian and impracticable, especially for SMEs, said EPP member Franck Proust.
The European Conservatives and Reformists Group highlighted the negative impact the regulation could have on the legitimate trade of minerals in war-torn regions. The British Conservative MEP Emma McClarkin said that businesses who cannot afford the mandatory requirements, or get the verification they need, [may] seek to source minerals from elsewhere.
The path travelled by the conflict minerals bill has already been a rocky one , beset by pressure from big business lobbies. The French business group Medef contacted MEPs before this weeks plenary session to warn them of the potentially costly consequences of a binding system that covers the whole supply chain. The lobbies pushed their interests very strongly with the rapporteurs, the Green MEP Yannick Jadot confirmed.
The extension of the regulations scope to all actors would be inefficient, impracticable and unreliable. Such an extension would engender very significant costs, particularly for small businesses: disproportionate compared to the expected results, Medef stated in its document, seen by EurActiv.
The French Socialist MEP douard Martin told the press: I accuse Medef of having placed a price on human life.

Burundi's turmoil points to a shifting social and political landscape
Analysts see the upheaval in Burundi as symptomatic of a public craving for principled politics and an end to the era of the autocratic statesman

The upheaval in Burundi may bear many of the hallmarks of a classic African military coup but, for some analysts, the crisis is indicative of a newfound public hunger for good governance, and a reaction against administrations run by political strongmen who cloak repression in the trappings of democracy.
As global leaders work on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) , a blueprint for governing development over the next 15 years, young people in Burundi are making their own demands, of their leaders as well as international donors.
Their appeals for democracy and abuse-free institutional processes mirror the call in SDG 16 to promote the rule of law, ensure equal access to justice, and develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions.

Burundis crisis began in late April after the ruling CNDD-FDD party nominated President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a third term in the countrys June elections, despite a two-term constitutional limit. Protesters took to the streets and clashed with police.
Then, on 13 May, Major General Godefroid Niyombare told reporters that he had dismissed the president. The attempted coup was short-lived, however, and Niyombare is now on the run . Nkurunziza is back in charge, and fears of reprisals are widespread.
Rights groups say at least 20 people have been killed and more than 110,000 Burundians have fled to neighbouring countries, raising fears of a severe humanitarian crisis.
Some observers predict a drawn-out period of uncertainty and violence, with particular risks for opposition activists and the media. Protests continued on Wednesday , while the government said local and parliamentary elections would be delayed for a week but the presidential elections would go ahead as planned on 26 June.
Some elements of the crisis  the timing of the coup to coincide with the presidents absence at a regional summit, the fear of ethnic tensions exploding  seem to hark back to Burundis unstable past. But Jesper Bjarnesen , senior researcher at the Nordic Africa Institute , says the dynamic is different this time.
Bjarnesen visited the Burundian capital Bujumbura recently and met with young activists who style themselves the Arusha generation, a nod to the peace accords that, in 2005, brought an end to a 12-year civil war between Hutu rebels and the mainly Tutsi army.
For these activists, ethnicity is no more the issue than Nkurunziza himself: rather, they feel the president has violated the constitution.
Its about political principles, says Bjarnesen. That is remarkable. Its not that long ago that ethnicity was in many ways the  defining split. What I got from [the activists] was this sense that formal politics are just not a useful medium for those not in power.
Yolande Bouka, a researcher in conflict prevention and risk analysis at the Institute for Security Studies , says Burundis government has long shown a disdain for the Arusha peace accords that has chipped away at trust between political actors.
The protestors and the opponents to Nkurunzizas third term are trying to evoke an African spring

Should the conflict drag on and erode inter-ethnic trust  it is possible to see a flare-up of ethnic tensions, says Bouka, adding that the international community should have acted sooner on warning signs that the authorities were cracking down on dissent after the 2010 elections.
Nkurunziza is not alone in attempting to use almost absolute political power to extend his rule. Next door, Rwandas president, Paul Kagame, is said to be considering another term despite a two-term limit. Ugandas Yoweri Museveni , already one of Africas longest serving leaders, has already changed the constitution to allow him to run again.
There are more cautionary tales. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Joseph Kabila was forced to withdraw a bill seen as an attempt to extend his term after protests in January. Nkurunziza may also be mindful of Burkina Fasos former president, Blaise Compaor, one of Africas longest serving leaders, who was f orced from office after he tried to change the constitution and run for another term.
End of Africas big men?
The idea that the big man model of rule is running out of steam may be gaining traction among the continents leaders.
At a regional summit this week, west African heads of state discussed a proposal to limit presidential mandates. The proposal was rejected because of opposition from Gambia and Togo, where there are no term limits, Reuters reported . But the discussion did not go unnoted.
The protestors and the opponents to Nkurunzizas third term are trying to evoke an African spring, with Burkina Faso setting the precedent. They are trying to use public protests to end a regime that has used both legal and illegal ways of reinforcing its grip on power, says Bjarnesen.
Related: Burundi unrest leaves 50,000 refugees facing dire conditions in Tanzania
Thierry Vircoulon , project director for central Africa at the International Crisis Group , says Burundisproblems are in the 2010 elections, which most opposition parties boycotted.
The first mandate of President Nkurunziza was about the consolidation of his power within the ruling party, and his second mandate was about the consolidation of his grip over the institutions and the preparation of his third mandate. This is a pattern that we see in a lot of post-conflict regimes in the region, says Vircoulon.
A former Belgian colony, Burundi is one of Africas poorest countries, ranking 180 out of 187 states in the 2014 UN human development index. It relies on foreign aid for half its national budget. Britains Department for International Development ended bilateral aid in 2012, and has been criticised by a parliamentary committee for doing so.
Bjarnesen says that while donors are in a catch-22 situation, suspending assistance will only hurt the poorest. This month, the EU said it would withhold 2m ($2.2m) of aid, while Belgium also announced a suspension of electoral aid.
Cutting aid in itself just does not work, says Bjarnesen. The threat now of cutting funding to the elections, who is that serving?
For Bjarnesen, elections now would be devastating for the opposition but perhaps palatable to international partners  a situation that encapsulates an ideological tug-of-war between the merits of stability versus true democracy.
To a large extent, the international community would rather have some sort of elections and then relative stability rather than continued political instability with the threat of conflict, he says.
Thats the biggest weakness of the response from the international community: its so short-sighted and focused on visible symptoms  whereas what is actually keeping the status quo is this kind of structural violence that has been in place since Nkurunziza came to power.
Bjarnesen is critical of international lenience towards African governments. The argument would be these are young democracies, they need time to develop  I think that moment has passed. I dont see any reason why you would measure democracy in Burundi against standards other than those you use in the UK or Sweden.

Britains Department for International Development (DfID) is failing to capitalise on partnerships with the private sector because of a lack of concrete targets and detailed operational plans with a clear focus on reducing poverty, the UKs aid watchdog has said .
While recognising the potential for development agencies and private businesses to work together to boost livelihoods in the developing world, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) said these collaborations must identify more clearly how they will benefit the poor.

DfID has described its partnerships with the private sector as an  engine of growth . But the study, which was released on Thursday, said the department must work with businesses which want to invest in developing countries in such a way as to maximise benefits for the poor.
The watchdog gave DfID an amber-red rating  its second worst  for its work with businesses. Icais report assessed the impact of DfIDs work with private sector firms on economic and human development, environmental sustainability and humanitarian assistance.
Graham Ward, Icais chief commissioner, said: [DfID has] clearly stated their intention to work more with business and there are great potential benefits for the poor from this collaboration. We are concerned, however, about how DfID will translate these goals into practical actions without more strategic oversight of business engagement activities and without concrete targets.
This year, DfID is projected to ramp up its financing to private sector firms  in the form of loans, equity investments and guarantees  to an estimated 580m, up from 68m in 2012, the report said.
Between 2012 and 2015, DfID spent about 494m of its budget on alliances, financing and partnerships with UK and foreign businesses, the study said. Examples of these relationships include the Business Action for Africa network; the Safety, Health and Education and Employment for Girls and Women alliance; a partnership with Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor ; and the Food Retail Industry Challenge Fund .
Poor leadership has made the development objectives behind DfIDs private sector partnerships unclear, according to Icai. We didnt get the sense that this new and really important agenda is being steered by senior management, said a spokesman for the watchdog.
Part of the problem is that DfIDs poverty reduction targets are out of sync with the profit-making imperative fundamental to private business. The financial incentives for businesses to work with DfID mean that the agency must agree with private sector partners on reachable targets, the study said.
This is further complicated by DfIDs remit to reduce poverty in the worlds most fragile countries , which often have challenging business environments, the study warned.
An Icai spokesman said: The markets that most business are going to be interested in are going to be in the more developed countries. The very poorest countries, by definition, are going to offer slim pickings for businesses, and therefore theres going to be less opportunity for DfID to do this direct engagement with [businesses].
According to the report, DfIDs spending on challenge funds  competitions for funding  is particularly problematic. In some cases  we are not confident that DfIDs support is additional to what businesses would have done anyway, especially in the case of challenge funds, the report said.
The report echoes criticism by some NGOs, who say DfIDs private sector partnerships dont translate into development gains.
This report raises serious questions about DfIDs ideological drive to work more and more with the private sector when theres so little evidence of the development benefits, said Polly Jones, head of policy and campaigns at Global Justice Now.
Beck Wallace, a private sector policy analyst at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: DfID needs a clear oversight mechanism in place when working with private firms that goes beyond just cash flow and considers who bears which of the economic, social and environmental costs, risks and benefits of projects. By identifying specifically what value it adds to partnerships with private firms, DfID can help drive forward thinking about how best to deliver poverty reduction through profit-making enterprises.
This report raises serious questions about DfIDs ideological drive to work more and more with the private sector
Polly Jones, Global Justice Now
The report did not take into account spending by the UKs CDC Group, formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation, or the Private Infrastructure Development Group, in which DfID invests. Icai said this is because the UKs National Audit Office (NAO) has recently reviewed PIDGs spending . The NAO had been scheduled to review CDCs spending, but this review has since been cancelled, Icai said.
A DfID spokesman said: Our relationship with business has never been closer and this is delivering real results, whether working with the London Stock Exchange to boost markets in Africa, partnering with Unilever to set up social enterprises that improve the lives of millions of people, or getting new vaccines to market quickly and safely.
He added: This report comes a year into our groundbreaking new strategy and only reviews a small cross-section of our work. It would be wrong to rush to conclusions on projects that are intended to deliver over a five- to 10-year timeframe.

Zuhur Yasin has never been to the US, but she holds a bachelors degree from an American university. Part of Yasins studies in Somaliland, a self-declared independent country in Somalia, were spent in a special classroom, lined with rows of computers equipped with webcams and microphones.
The 29-year-old watched videos and took part in live virtual classes at Indiana University as part of her journalism programme at the University of Hargeisa . We had discussions and shared any challenges or questions, she says.
The African Virtual University (AVU) , an intergovernmental organisation, connected Yasin with Indiana University. The AVU says it has used virtual learning to train 43,000 students since its creation in 1997. Last year, it announced 29 new distance learning centres like the one Yasmin used to take part in seminars nearly 8,000 miles away.
Professors use programmes and apps including Skype and WhatsApp to communicate with students, but classes are taught using special software. The AVU is considering plans to make lectures accessible on mobile phones, which would tap into Africas estimated 112m smartphones .
Like Yasin, many students in sub-Saharan Africa are looking for opportunities to attend university. In 2008, the region had the lowest university attendance in the world, with just 6% of secondary school-leavers advancing to higher education  well below the world average of 26%, according to the UNs Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco).
On Wednesday, the African Union (AU) opened the eLearning Africa conference on ICT for development, education and training at its headquarters in Addis Ababa with the aim of closing that gap and nurturing the human resources necessary for economic development. About 1,200 government ministers and business representatives are expected to attend.
Rebecca Stromeyer , founder of eLearning Africa, says: Now is the time when technology can really help to entrench the progress many African countries have made in education. If the right decisions are taken now, they will help to sustain long-term economic growth.
Experts say online learning tools can connect Africas students to massive open online courses (Mooc) such as Coursera , an education platform that provides free virtual tuition from some of the worlds top universities. In March, the AVU enrolled 1,698 African students in its first Mooc, which explored using technology to enrich learning .
Mark West, a mobile learning expert at Unesco, says: [Virtual learning] is a portal into educational opportunities that, frankly, hadnt existed before, and some of those opportunities  if you can afford the broadband connection and the hardware to use that connection  are free. For really self-motivated learners, its remarkable.
However, high dropout rates still plague virtual universities. The best use of online learning is to pair it with some practical instruction and assessment, West says. A lot of people start but they never finish  they dont finish individual courses and they definitely dont finish entire areas of study.
Yasin had to work hard to follow the online curriculum. In a regular class you have a teacher who is in front of you who makes you concentrate, she says. With the online environment, you have to have discipline, make your own timetable to listen to the lectures, and submit the assignments online.
Virtual learning is an ideal solution to the barriers that face African students in accessing university education, according to Bakary Diallo, rector of the AVU. Taking classes online can address some of the bigger challenges for the continent, he says. In Africa , the need for education is so important. Poverty, violence, extremism  I think the root of these problems is lack of education.

The AVU partners with dozens of African universities and foreign institutions to help students get degrees in ICT, maths and science . Starting next year, the virtual university will offer its own degrees, but for now it simply links students to local and regional universities. Some programmes are taught completely online, while others require attendance at classes and practical assessment at nearby campuses.
While Diallo says his aim is to drive the cost of learning down, the AVU doesnt have any control over fees at their partner institutions. But that could change when the AVU becomes an accredited university and is able to offer its own classes and charge its own fees.
Unsurprisingly, many of the classes currently offered by the AVU are related to technology. Josiah Mugambi, director of Nairobis iHub , a meeting place for east Africas tech entrepreneurs, says virtual learning appeals to students who want to land a job at a tech startup because of its flexible schedule. The AVU is definitely cheaper than the conventional approach, plus one can be doing something else [while enrolled].
Africas politicians are awakening to the potential of virtual learning. So far, 19 African countries have signed a charter that establishes the AVU as an intergovernmental organisation and the AU has prioritised virtual learning in its long-term development strategy .
But with many parts of Africa still facing irregular power supply and poor internet access, Diallo accepts that it will take some time for virtual learning to be rolled out across the continent.
Nevertheless, hes encouraged by mounting political recognition of the role that online learning can play in African development. Ive been working on [virtual learning] for the last 15 years and what Im seeing today  Ive never seen before. Governments are really interested in [virtual] learning now.

For Ibrahim Hussein, it was the final blow. When the Kenyan government ordered the closure of the Dadaab refugee camp following the al-Shabaab terrorist attack in Garissa in April, Hussein gathered his courage and went to the UN refugee repatriation office to ask to be resettled back home in Somalia. After years of living in the largest refugee complex in the world , Dadaab had become an open-air prison to him, with little more to offer than a daily dose of anxiety.
I came here because of the famine in 2011 . I am a farmer. There is nothing for me here, I cannot work. We are not getting much food either, says Hussein, seated in the office of the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR. And now they accuse us of being responsible for the attack. Its not bearable.
Located halfway between the Somali border and the Kenyan town of Garissa, and home to an estimated 334,600 Somali refugees , Dadaab has once again become the focus of the Kenyan governments response to terrorism after the massacre of 147 students at the University of Garissa last month.

Ten days after the attack, Kenyas vice-president, William Ruto, gave the UN until July to relocate all the refugees and close the camp, saying that Dadaab has become a hideout for al-Shabaab in Kenya . The group which attacked Garissa earlier this month  they stayed in the refugee camps, said Bunow Korane, the chair of Kenyas Refugee Affairs Commission. They assembled their arms there.
According to security experts, however, there is no evidence linking Dadaab or refugees to al-Shabaab and the Garissa attack.
Although this is not the first time that Kenya has demanded the closure of Dadaab following a terrorist attack, and despite government assurances that Somali refugees would not be forcibly repatriated , the announcement has created panic in the camp.
Issa Maaciye, a UN repatriation officer, says he has seen an increase in the number of people turning up at his office since the governments statement. It is not voluntary repatriation, Maaciye explains. It is fear.
Hussein says he knows there is insecurity in Baidoa, the Somali city where he intends to relocate his family. Since December 2014, the UNHCR has run a pilot project for voluntary repatriation to areas of Somalia deemed safe for refugees, including Kismayo, Baidoa and Luuq .
Resources are scarce in these areas, including land, and experts fear that the return of refugees en masse could create further tensions.
Before leaving Dadaab, Hussein will have to take a fitness test. He will be given $80 (50) for each member of his family, and will be offered some practical advice. He will also be told that he can change his mind about boarding the UN bus out of the camp up until the last minute. Above all, I want to be free, he says.
More than 2,000 people have made use of the repatriation scheme so far, and a 2014 survey found that less than 3% of Dadaabs refugees intended to return to Somalia within the next two years. Meanwhile, more than 3,000 new refugees have arrived in the camp since December.
It is not voluntary repatriation. It is fear
Issa Maaciye, UN repatriation officer
Across the yard from the repatriation office where Hussein is organising his return, Maryan and her husband Ali are registering their baby son, Hassan, so that he is added to their food ration card. Both Maryan and Ali grew up in Dadaab, and have no recollection of life in Somalia. Over the years, more than 100,000 babies have been born in the refugee camp, and today half of the camp population is under 18 .
Those who were born here dont want to go to Somalia. They would be facing a new world. They could be easily radicalised by al-Shabaab, as they would have to take arms or be killed. There is no freedom in Somalia right now, says Mohammed Yusuf, an 80-year-old Somali elder.

There is not much freedom in Dadaab either. Under the camps dystopian system, Maryan and Ali were able to survive living in tents made of plastic sheeting distributed by the UNHCR, and eating food distributed by the World Food Programme. It has been a life of acronyms, monotonous rations, and dependency on humanitarian aid, confined to a few kilometres square in the middle of the desert.
Maryan gave birth to Hassan in a hospital run by Mdecins Sans Frontires, receiving a level of healthcare that she could not have had in Somalia. But if going back means nothing to her and her husband, staying does not seem a viable option either. We have a son now. He cannot live like we did. But no one offers us any real option. Where are we meant to go?

The Nigerian senate recently passed its violence against persons prohibition (VAPP) bill, which seeks to eliminate female genital mutilation (FGM) as well as all other forms of gender-based violence.
Womens rights groups, practitioners and activists in Nigeria have been pushing for the law for the past 13 years. It is a major boost not only for Nigerias women, but for the nation as a whole. The question is: will it make a practical difference?
Women and girls cannot reach their full potential when their basic rights to health and security are not honoured.
FGM is most often carried out on young girls  robbing them of the chance to have a healthy life  with severe immediate and long-term health complications, often leading to death. In parts of Africa where medicine is not advanced, such as in areas of Sudan where antibiotics are not available, an estimated one-third of girls who undergo FGM will die. Those who survive face lifelong problems including increased risk of infections, cysts, complications during childbirth, and newborn deaths.
It is estimated that 25% of girls and women between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM in Nigeria. The practice is most widespread in Africa and the Middle East, where it has been carried out on an estimated 125 million girls and women alive today, but it is prevalent around the world. In the UK, where FGM has been outlawed for more than three decades, an estimated 60,000 girls below the age 15 could still be at risk. It is also illegal to take British citizens or residents out of the country to undergo FGM , yet it continues to happen.
Such laws are a must. They are particularly critical for organisations working tirelessly to end FGM. In Nigeria, this law provides them with a legal framework and backing to tackle the problem. The legislation sends a clear message on impunity and serves as a basis for holding government to account.
However, criminalisation of entrenched cultural practices has its limitations. While legal safeguards are an important step towards ending FGM, they are not enough to eliminate it. Ending violence against women and girls requires investment, not just laws written in statute books. This is why we must emphasise community engagement, with a view towards shifting social norms, as a critical component of the eradication of FGM.

It is crucial that we scale up efforts to change traditional cultural views that underpin violence against women. Only then will this harmful practice be eliminated. Doing so involves laws and policies, as well as community level engagement and programmes that work to empower girls directly. Education is crucial, and must work in conjunction with school systems. It is also important to promote reporting of the practice, ensure perpetrators are prosecuted and address stigma.
Change will not happen overnight. Investing in research is key to developing effective, sustainable and evidence-based solutions. Harmful practices such as FGM not only affect women and girls, but are also a major impediment to global development efforts to end poverty.
A case in point is a flagship programme from the UKs Department for International Development, entitled what works to prevent violence against women and girls . The scheme will build evidence on effective solutions to prevent violence against women and girls.
One branch of the programme involves adding to existing data on the economic and social costs of violence against women and girls, which will create a better understanding of the far-reaching consequences of violence at all levels. Producing new evidence is crucial in strengthening the case for resources to implement laws, provide health and social support services, and encourage communities to move away from social norms that support violence.
It has been 20 years since the Beijing declaration and platform for action , a blueprint toward achieving equality that denounces all forms of violence against women. Prioritising the rights and wellbeing of women and girls is long overdue. Violating their right to a safe and productive life not only has a profound effect on them, it has an impact on every one of us.
Ensuring that the human rights of women and girls are protected means flourishing economies, healthy communities and a brighter future for us all.

        <title>Poverty in Nicaragua drives children out of school and into the workplace</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/19/poverty-nicaragua-children-school-education-child-labour</Link>

Strolling through the coastal town of Bluefields on a school day, the number of children out and about is striking. Young hustlers sell cold drinks and sweet breads, teenage mums push snoozing infants in prams, while small groups of adolescents idle away hours on shaded park benches listening to the latest dancehall hits.
Boredom is one reason these young people give when asked why they are not in school. Among a group of nine- to 15-year olds, others explain: My family cant afford the books, I prefer to work and earn money and I was kicked out when I got pregnant. None of the children had plans to go back to school.
Bluefields is the biggest town in the isolated autonomous provinces on Nicaraguas Atlantic coast  the poorest region of a very poor country where figures for school dropout and child labour remain worryingly high.
As leaders meet in South Korea this week for the World Education Forum , Bluefields  and Nicaragua as a whole  offers a snapshot of the huge challenges that still remain to get children into school.
The links between leaving school and child labour are multifarious, but poverty plainly drives both. Nicaragua  a country of 6.1 million people  is the second poorest in the Americas after Haiti . It has the largest youth bulge in Latin America with more than 2 million school-aged children, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, Unesco. Half of all children and adolescents live in poverty .
The UN childrens agency, Unicef, estimates that 500,000 Nicaraguan children aged three to 17 are not in the educational system . Most live in rural areas, or are poor, indigenous or disabled.
In a country with such high poverty levels, it is perhaps not surprising that children find themselves out of school and in the workplace.
The last national child labour survey, published back in 2005, reported almost 240,000 child workers aged between five and 17.
Nicaraguan officials recently told the Inter America Commission of Human Rights that eradication of child labour was a priority for the current government  led by former leftist guerrilla leader Daniel Ortega since 2006.
Last year Nicaragua signed up to the International Labour Organisations (ILO)  road map , which aims to eradicate the worst forms of child labour by 2016, and all child labour by 2020  the last country in the region to do so.
Nicaragua has ratified multiple international treaties and has strong national policies, but government claims that it is reducing child labour are not supported by any published evidence.
Related: Education for All scheme has failed to meet targets, says Unesco
The most recent US Department of Labor analysis said: The [Nicaraguan] governments enforcement of labour laws is inadequate, and plans to combat child labour and protect children have not been fully implemented.
A recently published study by the La Isla Foundation interviewed 26 children aged 12 to 17 who were working in sugar cane fields in 2013. Nicaraguan law allows children to start working at 14, among the youngest in the region, but not in hazardous environments like sugar cane, mines or quarries.
Half the children interviewed were not in school, four could not read or write and virtually all had suffered injuries or illnesses linked to perilous work conditions .
Luis Hernandez*, 17, left school almost three years ago, and was contracted to weed sugar cane crops during the most recent harvest. I hated school, it was so boring, and I was glad to get this job as it means I can help my family and buy new clothes, he said. Of course I am scared about the health risks, all the boys in my team are scared, but there are no other jobs.
The sugar company, which said it has a zero tolerance policy to child labour, is investigating.
Compulsory education is one of the most effective ways of combating child labour , according to the ILO. In Nicaragua, children are only obliged to attend school until 12.
Only 65% of children from the poorest families completed primary school compare to 90% from the richest homes
Only 72% of children finished primary school in 2009, the latest year for which data is available.
This low figure hides even bigger inequalities as only 65% of children from the poorest 20% of families completed primary school compared to 98% from the richest homes.
On the poor Atlantic coastal regions where Bluefields is situated, just 58% completed six years of primary education.
The Ortega government has prioritised spending on primary and tertiary education, so secondary school figures are unsurprisingly much worse: 46% finished the first tier (9th grade/year 10), and only 19% completed 11th grade (year 12). In the poorest families, only 6% of children finished secondary school.
Manos Antoninis is a senior analyst at Education for All global monitoring report , which has analysed progress on education in 164 countries since 2002. He is in favour of increasing the age at which children can leave education. While raising the compulsory age of schooling is unlikely to immediately impact on completion rates in Nicaragua, it would send a powerful message that the state believes in the importance of education, which in turn would impact the way families perceive their own responsibility in keeping children in school.
The EFA movement promotes a minimum nine years of free compulsory education.
Philippe Barragne-Bigot, Unicef representative in Nicaragua, disagrees with Antoninis. He believes children drop out because of cultural norms driven by the cycle of poverty, poor-quality, lacklustre classes and the chronic lack of economic opportunities that makes school seem pointless.
Quality, flexible education and jobs will keep children in school, not a change in the law, said Barragne-Bigot.
In Incheon, South Korea, this week, leaders will assess progress towards the millennium development goals, which expire this year, and seek to agree a common position on the post-2015 sustainable development goals , which seem likely to include universal free primary and secondary education.
Opinion is divided about whether it is wise to include secondary education in the proposed SDG target when one in six children in low and middle income countries does not finish primary school, according to EFA.
Countries that dont educate their children to second school level dont stand a chance. But the sudden expansion of secondary education could serve the elite, so policies must target the neediest, said Antoninis.
He added: The inter-generational effect is chilling. A lack of education not only scuppers a childs chances, but also the chances of their children. Failing to make an effort in this generation, also fails the next.

Burundi refugees say there is no turning back as fears grow of reprisals at home
Thousands of refugees who fled to Rwanda are resigned to long stay amid concerns that violence in Burundi could reignite tensions of civil war era

Evariste Hakizimana arrived at the Bugesera camp in eastern Rwanda last month, after members of the Imbonerakure , the feared youth wing of Burundis ruling CNDD-FDD party, turned up at his house in the middle of the night.
Dont tell us that we never warned you, he recounts that they told him. The next day he left with his family for Rwanda .
Since early April, more than 112,000 refugees have fled Burundi to Rwanda , Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), amid rising violence and intimidation, mainly by the Imbonerakure, in the runup to Junes presidential elections.
The refugee crisis peaked after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced on 25 April that he would stand for a third term, triggering street protests in the capital, Bujumbura. After violent clashes between protesters and police, General Godefroid Niyombare last week led a coup attempt but failed to take control of the country.
Nkurunziza, who was abroad at the time of the coup attempt, has returned to Burundi and is purging his cabinet . Protesters have been warned that they will be treated as accomplices of the rebel generals while rights activists have accused Nkurunziza of repressing opposition and gagging the independent media.

The crisis has raised fears of further instability in a volatile region where armed groups often crisscross borders to prey on communities, and where several civil wars have left a deep legacy of fear and distrust.
In Burundi , memories are still raw over the conflict between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis that left around 300,000 people dead a decade ago. During that conflict, Nkurunziza was among the mainly Hutu rebels fighting against the army, which was then dominated by the Tutsi minority. Despite the integration of both groups into the army  Niyombare is also a Hutu  fears that the crisis could spiral are still driving people across the countrys borders.
Placede Mukerabirori remained in Burundi throughout the 12-year civil war , during which her parents were killed. This time, however, she decided to flee after she was threatened by Imbonerakure militias.
We cannot go back as long as [President] Nkurunziza is in the leadership, she said. If we went back and he was the leader, we would die, especially us  the refugees coming back. He would believe we were the enemies.
If we went back and Nkurunziza was the leader, we would die. He would believe we were the enemies
Placede Mukerabirori
Between 24 and 26 April, the number of refugees crossing the Rwandan frontier every day surged to between 15,000 and 23,000. The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) scrambled to attend to this massive influx, and for several days, Bugesera camp, which was designed to hold 8,000 people, was home to more than 13,000.
Bugeseras 35 hastily built hangers of tarpaulin and tree trunks are the first stop for many of the 27,000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda.
Now, the UNHCR, along with the Rwandan government, has begun the process of relocating hundreds of refugees a day from Bugesera to a larger, more permanent camp.
Since the failed coup , up to 200 refugees a day have continued to stream across the border and UN officials are preparing for many more in the coming weeks. The agency estimates that as many as 100,000 could flee to Rwanda as the election nears.
Saber Azam, UNHCRs representative in Rwanda, says one of their biggest challenges has been attending to the large numbers of children. Many are without their parents, and around 30% are malnourished.
Our hope is that the situation in Burundi will improve and that they will feel secure and they will return to their country, said Azam, noting, however, that the agency was preparing for this not to happen.
Last week, east African heads of state condemned the coup attempt and called for Burundian elections to be held in a free, fair and peaceful manner. Rwanda has also called for a return to stability in Burundi, which relies on foreign aid to meet half its budget .

According to officials at Rwandas ministry of disaster management and refugee affairs, Rwanda will cap the number of Burundian refugees in the country at 60,000. After the cap has been reached, Rwanda will work with the UN and the international community to open a humanitarian corridor to allow refugees to pass through Rwanda to neighbouring countries.
We cant close our borders to prevent refugees from coming, said a ministry official who did not want to be named. The exact details of the passage and end destination have yet to be determined.
So far, the ethnic tensions that characterised the civil war do not seem to be a problem among refugees in Bugesera. People appear united by their politics.
No one here at the camp supports Nkurunziza, said Frazile Rwasa, a Tutsi refugee who arrived on 20 April. All those who support him are back in Burundi.
But Hakizimana fears the crisis could take on ethnic dimensions. Things are moving from politics to ethnicity, he said. He fears that, if he returns, he will be targeted as an enemy of the president because he is a Tutsi.
After hearing news of the coup attempt last Wednesday, thousands of residents at Bugesera sang, danced, and planned their return to Burundi. But with the failure of the coup now confirmed, they are settling in for a long stay in Rwanda.

        <title>Tunisia's female politicians prepare to seize their chance in local polls</title>

At a hotel in the desert city of Tozeur, 26-year-old pharmacist Mariem Bouattour is preparing to share the findings of a survey into womens opinions on key challenges for the local government. Waiting to hear her is a small crowd of around 150 people, but the event is part of a much bigger drive to get Tunisian women into politics.
Some 1,250 questionnaires were distributed throughout Tozeur, canvassing womens opinions on 10 of the issues perceived as facing the municipal government. Subjects ranged from the provision of cultural services to transparency in government. Public hygiene, health services and local government infrastructure were considered the most pressing.
The presentation is taking place at a  political academy, organised by Aswat Nissa (Womens Voice), an NGO dedicated to promoting womens interests across Tunisia. The organisation is preparing women to stand in local elections and the academy provides a space for discussion of local issues before next years municipal polls, as part of the dentralisation promised in the 2011 constitution.
For women, the academies offer not just an opportunity to lobby their political leaders to get the most pressing issues into their manifestos, but a platform for those who want to go into politics themselves to convince potential voters they are up to the job.
There are women in both industry and politics, but there arent really any in decision-making positions, said Bouattour, who will stand as an independent candidate in the municipal elections.
If youre in power you can address the issues affecting women. You understand them better. We live in a patriarchal society, so its important to have women with the will, the power and the energy to create change and push through the action we need to improve the situation for women in Tunisia , she said.

Tunisia comprises 24 governorates, divided into 264 municipalities and 36 village councils. Devolution is aimed at tackling growing regional inequalities and to ensure more equal distribution of funds for local services.
Both the degrees of devolution and the exact timing of the elections are still to be determined by the national constituent assembly. However, the decentralisation of power across the countrys diverse political, social and ecological landscape has meant that significant change looks inevitable. Women are hoping to seize the opportunity.
Among them is Ourida Touhami, who is preparing to stand as a candidate for Ennahda, the centrist Islamic Party. The municipality is the foundation of politics. Its here where you directly interact with other women and the populace at large  This is a real opportunity to show society what women are, that they have agency; that women can genuinely affect change.
But this will not be easy. The majority of women dont have political experience, said Ikram Ben Said, president of Aswat Nissa. Even if theyve been members of political parties since, say, 2011, they have very little responsibility within that party. Also, those political parties arent really investing in women. They have women when its time for election, because of the parity law, [the stipulation that parties provide a minimum number of female candidates ], but they dont have a long-term vision for them.
Its a legacy that Aswat Nissa is striving to counter, working with women across the political spectrum nationwide to develop their skills as politicians.
Women have to be more active if were ever going to represent society as a whole
Professor Kais Saied
Were seeking to develop womens capacities in three main areas, said Ben Said. Firstly, theres gender sensitive budgeting, because if youre going to improve equality youre going to need money  The second part is that, by participating in the political academies, women will go out and engage with potential voters, to convince them that theyre here and theyre ready to serve them. Thirdly, theyre there to present the priorities of women to their political parties and convince them to include them within their electoral programmes.
But Professor Kais Saied, one of the countrys leading constitutional experts, is sceptical about the devolution process and exactly how much power central government is willing to cede. Theyre worried they might lose some of their authority. The revolution came from within, from the inner states, then through the local authorities and to the centre, he said.
Prof Saied is also sceptical about the success of quotas in elections, although it has yet to be decided whether quotas for female candidates will form part of the municipal elections. Unfortunately, womens roles in Tunisia are quite limited. Theyre perceived as cosmetic. In the last elections, despite the laws on fair representation for women, the quotas were only ever superficial. Women have to be more active if were ever going to represent society as a whole.
Organisations like Aswat Nissa are preparing to do just that.

At dizzying speed, Julien sticks a hole-punch tool into a piece of paper, over and over. When the 12-year-old is done, the teacher gives the paper to another student and asks him to read it. Julien nods approvingly as the other boy reads aloud. It is exactly as he had written it, punching out the text in braille.
Julien, who is blind, and the other student, who is not, both share a classroom in the Promhandicam school in the Mimboman district of Yaound, the capital of Cameroon.
The school opened in 1975 as part of a private philanthropy project set up by Daniel de Rouffignac, a retired French colonel. It has 120 pupils and aims to help disabled children participate fully in society, and to educate children who are blind or have impaired vision.
About half of the pupils have disabilities. Of these, many are blind, but there are others who have paralysis or learning disabilities, or have lost limbs. They study alongside children with no disabilities. Everyone learns to read braille.

For the schools manager, Father Sergio Janeselli, this integration is key.
You see? he says, pointing to the children playing together one breaktime. One of the greatest things about this kind of education is that children just play with each other no matter if they are blind, disabled, or not.
About 2 million of Cameroons 23-million strong population are disabled, according to Marta Imamura, a medical officer specialising in disability and rehabilitation at the World Health Organisation in Switzerland.
The UNs children agency, Unicef, estimates that 23% of children aged between two and nine in Cameroon have at least one type of disability, and 65% of children acquired their disabilities through illnesses, such as polio, malaria, leprosy or measles.
The most recent World Report on Disability , published by the WHO in 2011, noted that children with disabilities are less likely to start school than their peers without disabilities, and have lower rates of staying and being promoted in schools.
About 80% of disabled people, including 150 million children, live in developing countries. The 2006 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been ratified by 36 African countries . However, in countries grappling with hunger and poverty, stigma and discrimination  even by parents  often renders disabled children effectively invisible.
In poorer communities, this ostracisation can condemn children with mental or physical disabilities to a life in limbo, with no prospects for therapy and an increasing likelihood of being malnourished and otherwise neglected.
Current attitudes  reinforce the many barriers these children face, including discrimination, direct abuse and violence
Marta Imamura, World Health Organisation
Current attitudes of rejection and neglect reinforce the many barriers these children face in daily life, including discrimination, direct abuse and violence, says Imamura.
There has actually not been very much research done in these areas, says Lynn Cockburn, assistant professor in the department of occupational science and occupational therapy at the University of Toronto . We are just beginning to really understand the extent and details of the situation.
There are very few schools that can adequately accommodate children with visual and hearing impairments, or with significant learning disabilities. There are almost no assistive devices and technologies used in schools to allow for such accommodations, she said.
In 2010, Cameroons ministry of social affairs introduced a law to protect and promote disabled children, but activists say implementation has been slow.
In Promhandicam the letter of the law  integrating disabled people into society  is brought to life. The schools ethos is spelled out on a big poster: In the classroom, we are all equal in rights and obligations.
Class groups at the school are usually organised by age, as in any other institution, but there are some exceptions to meet specific requirements.
Landry, 15, sits with a group of five-year-olds. He, like them, is learning to write. But while they struggle to hold pens between their little fingers, Landry is learning how to write with his mouth because his arms are paralysed.
Monique Hendje, a teacher, is helping him. She scribbles letters on to a small blackboard and then Landry copies them on to paper, using a carpenters flat pencil.
As well as catering for children with physical challenges, such as Julien and Landry, Promhandicam also educates children with learning disabilities. Older children, who may no longer be able to benefit from academic teaching, are taught other skills.
The 25 pupils in this class are not able to learn how to write or read any more, so we teach them how to become independent by doing some handicrafts that can be sold later, says Rachel Bekono, a teacher.

One of Promhandicams strengths is its ability to produce tailored learning materials for its diverse range of students.
Benjamin Mbelle, armed with patience and a noisy printing machine, copies every textbook into braille. This means every student can follow each class.
The school opened a rehabilitation centre in 2005 and there is also a small workshop. There, Joseph Amougou, who himself is disabled, works at the school making prostheses or adapting furniture to the pupils specific needs.
Next to his workbench there are broken tricycles and wheelchairs, and many kinds of artificial limbs, including Amougous own.
Amougou embodies Promhandicams devotion to integrating disabled people as fully as possible into society. Cockburn says this is a human rights issue.
Attitudes can have an impact because children are not given opportunities to engage in everyday activities because parents and others dont think they can  The charity model is still very prevalent, rather than a human rights model, she says.
Amougou is well aware of the importance of his job.
[This is] how we can prove that there are real options and that being disabled doesnt mean being non-capable, he says.

They are coming in their thousands, a steady stream of men, women and children bearing what few possessions they can carry as they flee their native Burundi and the pro-government militias who they fear are intent on death and destruction.
At Kagunga, a tiny fishing village on the shores of Lake Tanganyika just 2km (1.5 miles) inside Tanzania , an estimated 50,000 refugees are sleeping rough, waiting for a 100-year-old ferry, the MV Liemba, to carry them south to safety.
Conditions in the makeshift camp are dire, with families forced to sleep on the dirt; plastic sheets and tarpaulins provide their only protection from the elements. To eat, they cook meagre rations on open fires.

According to the UN refugee agency, the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), more than 110,000 people so far have fled a political crisis that many fear could descend into another bout of ethnic bloodletting in the heart of Africas Great Lakes region.
Most of them have gone south to Tanzania, but 27,000 have sought safety to the north in Rwanda , which is still recovering from the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. A further 9,000 people have headed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In Kagunga, seven people have died since the evacuees started arriving, the UNHCR said. After a failed coup in Burundi last week, few expect the flow of people to slow. Of the dead, two people are suspected to have been victims of cholera, while 300 others are suffering from acute diarrhoea, said the UNHCR, suggesting that the death toll could climb.
The ferry, which was first used by the German imperial navy to patrol Lake Tanganyika in 1915, can carry 600 people but cannot dock at Kagunga, meaning that passengers have to be transported from there by fishing boat, a process that takes 10 hours.
The only other way out of the village is a four-hour trek to another village up through the dense jungle on cliffs abutting the lake, part of Africas Great Rift Valley.
The situation is very difficult. Weve stepped up efforts to move people away by trying to rehabilitate a mountain track so that at least they can walk out, but its a strenuous hike, said UNHCR spokeswoman Karin de Gruijl

Violence in Burundi forces thousands to flee to Tanzania.
More than 2,000 people are arriving at Kagunga each day, more than the ferry can handle. They are united in fear of the youth militias known as Imbonerakure, who are loyal to President Pierre Nkurunziza, the man whose bid for a third term has triggered the crisis.
Just 10 years after the end of a civil war between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis in which 300,000 people died, any sign that the Imbonerakure are flexing their muscles is enough to sow panic.
The reason there are so many people here is because we didnt feel secure back at home because Imbonerakure were going around threatening people and saying they were going to finish them [off], a refugee who did not want to be named told Reuters.

This went on for a while  And then things got worse because we heard about what was happening in the capital.
In Rwandas refugee centres, some Tutsis said they had fled an expected backlash from Nkurunzizas security forces after last weeks attempted coup by generals opposed to his plans to prolong his presidential term.
I heard that the coup had failed so I was afraid that the Imbonerakure could retaliate, said Hakizimana Leonidas, a 46-year-old Tutsi who arrived in the Gashora refugee camp at the weekend. They tried a coup and it failed. I think its going to be worse for us who dont want to see Nkurunziza run again.
I have a fiance in Burundi but because of the terror by Imbonerakure I had to run away, said 27-year-old Jean Berchimas Dukuzemungu, the son of a Tutsi father and Hutu mother. When you are young and youre not in their party, you are in danger.

Leading figure in the development of the New Left in the 1950s and 60s who became a driving force in the fair trade movement
Michael Barratt Brown taught adult evening classes and founded Northern College as an adult and community education residential college

In the late 1950s and 60s, a number of British leftwing intellectuals and activists began to look beyond the prevailing concerns of Marxist thinkers  initially, to critical examinations of the Soviet model of socialism and of British imperialism. Michael Barratt Brown, who has died aged 97, was a leading figure in the development of this New Left , a pioneer in industrial worker education and the drive for workplace democracy, and later active in the movement for fair trade. He was one of the founders of New Left Review in 1960, of the Peace Foundation established by Bertrand Russell in 1963 and of its journal the Spokesman, of the Institute for Workers Control in 1968, and of the Conference of Socialist Economists in 1970.
From 1948, he taught adult evening classes in Essex, and 10 years later moved to Sheffield. There he established and taught extension classes for miners and steelworkers for the next two decades. In 1978 he founded Northern College at Wentworth Castle, near Barnsley, as an adult and community education residential college, and was its first principal. The intake at the outset was largely male  miners and steelworkers  but Michael responded to the demand from women by making over a residential block for them and opening a creche.
After retiring in 1983, he went to the Greater London council, led by Ken Livingstone, to produce study materials on the issues that its industrial sections were trying to address. Out of this work came his interest in fair trade: in 1985 he co-founded Twin Trading which, under his chairmanship, developed Cafdirect , the Divine chocolate business and other fair trade brands as a model for a different kind of trade between small peasant producers and consumers in developed countries.
All these initiatives in different forms are still running. His industrial classes in Sheffield produced a whole generation of shop stewards, union officials, local councillors and Westminster politicians. Northern College now has an annual student roll of 6,000, primarily those returning to education. Twin Trading acts as the developed world partner to, and is owned by, 30 cooperative networks in the developing world, with 300,000 members.
Like his New Left contemporaries Raymond Williams and Edward Thompson, Michael had joined the Communist party in the 1940s, but abandoned it after the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. Like them, Michael was committed to being a peripatetic teacher for adults in the evening, after their daytime work. Like them, he attempted to make sense of the simultaneous twin events of Hungary and the Suez crisis . These were the years when Williams developed his ideas of a long cultural revolution and Thompson his equally influential work on a long political revolution. Michael, as an economist, set out to describe the contours of a long economic revolution. Together they marked out the three strands of the post-1956 British New Left.
Michaels first book, After Imperialism (1963), was a landmark in critical economic thinking at the time of decolonisation, and was widely translated. It argued that the end of formal colonial power was likely to intensify neo-colonial economic power, particularly in the form of the large corporations. What was needed was for the newly independent countries to use their political independence to resist these new forms of economic power and create their own path of social and economic development.
Many of his books continued with these themes, examining the ever more complex and tightening webs of post-colonial economic control, and the alternatives. He thought planning was part of the answer (in developed as much as in developing countries), but it had to be decentralised and democratic.
He applied a similar argument in relation to British economic policy, first in his contribution to the May Day Manifesto (1968), a socialist alternative to Labour government policies as the cover of the Penguin Special paperback proclaimed, and then in his book From Labourism to Socialism (1972). His work for the Institute for Workers Control, for adult education, and later for Twin Trading and fair trade were all initiatives aiming to put these ideas into practice.
In all that he did and wrote, Michael was part of the long British tradition of nonconformist, dissident champions of democracy. Born in Birmingham, he came from Quaker stock. Michaels father, Alfred, was one of the conscientious objectors who had been imprisoned because of their religious, and in his case political, opposition to the first world war: he was given leave to be present when his wife, Eileen (nee Cockshott) gave birth to Michael. There was a strong Quaker culture in and around Oxford, where his father was principal of Ruskin College, and Michael was sent to Bootham school, a Quaker establishment in York. After taking a degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University, in 1940 he married Frances Lloyd and started serving full time with the Friends Ambulance Unit, whose wartime postings took him to Cairo, Italy and Yugoslavia, with Titos partisans.
This last experience led him to renounce pacifism, leave the Quakers, and join the Communist party, though his lifes work and writing reflect his view of Quakerism and its practices as the foundation of real democracy. He coupled this with a secular humanism that he said he owed to the Greek scholar and liberal Gilbert Murray, which he called Comtian stoicism. On this view, the ideas of the 19th-century French philosopher Auguste Comte resonated with the ancient Greek Stoics belief in reason, high-mindedness and altruism as a route to deterring conflict and promoting cooperation.
Michael and Frances had two sons, Christopher and Richard, before divorcing in 1948. His second wife, Eleanor Singer, was a doctor whom he had worked with in Yugoslavia. They had two children, Daniel and Deborah, and were both magnetic characters to all who knew them, remaining close collaborators until her death in 1995.
Michael was then still running five miles every morning, gardening, cooking, sailing and travelling, quite apart from his involvement in fair trade, about which he wrote three books. In 2005, he re-met Annette Caulkin, whom he had known in the Friends Ambulance Unit. He moved down to London and lived with her until her death in 2012.
Michael is survived by his four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

The battle to eliminate extreme poverty will require rich western nations to step up their financial help and spend at least half their aid budgets in the worlds poorest countries, a leading development campaign group said on Tuesday.
ONE, the organisation co-founded by U2 frontman Bono , said donor nations should reverse the trend of recent years that has seen only 30% of assistance go to the 37 least-developed countries (LDCs).
Total overseas development assistance flows to the least-developed countries have been in worrying decline in recent years. In 2014, total overseas development aid to LDCs fell by 2% compared with 2013 and by 6% compared with 2010, ONE said in a report designed to pressure the G8 leading western nations before their summit in Germany next month.
It added that only one country directed more than 50% of its overseas development aid to LDCs in 2014  Iceland. If the 24 rich countries that sit on the OECDs development assistance committee had allocated half of their budgets to LDCs in 2014, it would have made an additional $26.5bn (17.1bn) available to the worlds poorest countries, the report added.
Donor nations have generally failed to fulfil the promise made at the Gleneagles summit of 2005 to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid. Only five countries  Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain  achieved the 0.7% level in 2014, and aid budgets were skewed to parts of the world where western nations had strong historical links or where there was geo-political or security reason for providing help.
ONE said that 2015 would be a crucial year, with a conference in Addis Ababa on providing the finance for development followed in September by a meeting of the UN that will set 17 Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030.
A new set of global goals  will set out the path to a fairer, more prosperous world and an end to extreme poverty. But goals alone are not enough  need a clear plan of action and the determination to deliver it.
ONE added that the conference in the Ethiopian capital would be the pivotal point of the year. It would require governments, civil society and businesses to provide additional aid, curb the illicit financial flows and corruption that strip countries of precious development resources, and improve transparency and accountability.
The campaign group called for a mutual accountability pact to meet the basic needs of the poorest people, which would require the mobilisation of international and domestic resources. The pact would include minimum spending levels on essential services of $300 per person in the 27 LDCs by 2020; increased domestic government revenues; increased aid targeted at the poorest countries; specific investments in agriculture, infrastructure, energy and technology; and mechanisms to ensure commitments are kept to.
ONE added it was important that anti-poverty efforts concentrated on improving the lives of girls and women.
Poverty and gender inequality go hand in hand: girls and women in the poorest countries suffer a double hardship, of being born in a poor country and being born female. Put simply, poverty is sexist. Across virtually every measurable indicator, life is significantly harder for girls and women in LDCs compared with men, and compared with girls and women living in other countries, it said.

I wrote last summer about our plan to run citizen reporting programmes in different parts of the world. The aim is to train marginalised people and communities to bring forth burning issues and stories that, perhaps, the national and international media are overlooking. In June we visited South Africa , and October India . Now weve just returned from Brazil.
Twenty people came from all parts of the country to take part in a two-day workshop. The training covered storytelling, evidence-finding, verification, ethics, social media and the ways participants can connect to us directly through digital platforms such as GuardianWitness .
The stories they brought in were extraordinary, covering indigenous rights in the Amazon, Olympic relocations, young people in the favelas, sex workers during the World Cup, and life for Bolivian and Syrian migrants. One of our trained citizen reporters, Luis Adorno, collaborated with our Latin America correspondent Jon Watts on a murder story in Sao Paulo. We plan to use their work as part of a big piece on violence across Brazil. A Year in a Favela will chart the period immediately before the Olympics, with our newly trained citizen reporters in Mar, Alemo and Rocinha delivering monthly updates.
We have also commissioned a How I Go to School video series with children from rural areas in Brazil. Several participants said education was their priority, especially the problems that many children face getting to school. One landless worker told us of students who had to walk for two hours across a river after their old school was shut down. Favela residents described long bus journeys even to reach city schools. Indigenous groups spoke of the challenges faced by children who have to go by boat through the forest.
Our correspondent is in touch with citizen reporter Tonico Benites in order to plan a visit to Guarani Kaoiwa for a feature article about Brazils other indigenous people, and how they are not the photogenic jungle-dwellers of the worlds imagination, but live in much worse conditions. Finally - for now - we also commissioned an opinion piece about the threat posed by miners and loggers to the village of Itaituba.
These workshops showed us that there is still a great deal out there, sadly, which the national and international media are not covering. You just have to let people tell their stories...

Ethiopia's elections are just an exercise in controlled political participation
Electoral defeat is not on the cards for Ethiopias ruling party, but it is vital for the countrys development that it engages more effectively with dissenting voices

Ethiopians will go to the polls on 24 May . Few observers doubt the outcome, with the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) expected to remain in power.
While symbolically significant  this is the first general election since the death of the long-serving prime minister Meles Zenawi in 2012  the polls are more of a logistical hurdle for the ruling party than a competitive, democratic exercise. What happens after the elections is more important for stability than the conduct of the polls themselves.

The prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, will lead the EPRDF into the elections, but there is intense speculation about how long he will remain in charge. Senior figures in the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front, Meles former party and the core constituent group of the EPRDF, are assumed to be competing to succeed Desalegn as national leader.
However, Meles had begun a generational shift in the EPRDFs leadership, bringing new leaders to the fore  including Hailemariam as his deputy  in the two years preceding his death. The continued dominance of ethnic Tigrayan leaders (such as Meles) was creating a challenge for the EPRDF as a multi-ethnic coalition. Hailemariam, an ethnic Wolayta from southern Ethiopia , is thus a symbolically significant choice. Retaining Hailemariam would reflect recognition within the EPRDF executive committee that stability rests on maintaining a truly multi-ethnic party.
The EPRDF values stability, given its ambitions. It came to power with a vision of itself as a vanguard party, setting the agenda and pulling the countrys population along with it.
In the past decade, that agenda has focused on an intensive campaign of infrastructural development  especially roads, railways, and electrification  which has underpinned a surge in headline GDP growth (which averaged 10.8% between 2004 and 2013). The impacts are visible, although poverty reduction in a heavily agrarian and rural society remains a challenge.
The government is expected to unveil its next five-year economic plan by June, following the 2010-2015 growth and transformation plan  probably maintaining a focus on infrastructure, including links to neighbouring economies. Boosting exports is at the core of Ethiopias economic strategy.
Related: British support for Ethiopia scheme withdrawn amid abuse allegations
The EPRDF sees elections as an opportunity to engage the population in an act of political participation, albeit non-competitive. Last year, the government conducted a series of training sessions for mid-level and senior civil servants, university lecturers and students, during which the goals of a developmental state were set out, and a case was made for the EPRDFs continued leadership  perhaps for decades.
The government also adapted its one to five network, which had underpinned massive expansion in EPRDF membership  now at about 7 million  since 2005. Instead of one member recruiting five, one public sector worker is now responsible for reporting on the developmental activities of a group.
Beyond participation, the mobilisation and social control aspects of this network help entrench EPRDF control.
Although opposition parties are participating in the election, their competitiveness has been undermined by internal divisions and bureaucratic obstacles. The main block, the Ethiopian Federal Democratic Unity Forum, emerged before 2010 but has failed to move beyond a strategic coalition and forge a common political platform. The Blue party was established in 2012, and has managed to organise some demonstrations.
Divisions within and between parties have enabled the government-controlled national electoral board of Ethiopia to establish bureaucratic hurdles. For example, the sole opposition MP will not stand for re-election after the board registered a rival faction of his party.
What happens after the elections is more important for stability than the conduct of the polls themselves
Demonstrations have emerged as an alternative outlet for dissent. Since 2011, Muslim leaders have organised intermittent protests against government involvement in religious affairs, after the EPRDF sought to promote the influence of al-Ahbash, a perceived moderate school of Islamic practice. Protests have triggered crackdowns by security forces.
Significant demonstrations also took place in May 2014, in a largely spontaneous response to a draft of Addis Ababas city expansion plan. The Ethiopian capital is at the heart of the EPRDFs economic development strategy, but its footprint effectively extends throughout Oromia, the state in which it is located. A proposal to absorb some of the neighbouring administrative districts under the Addis Ababa authorities prompted a wave of regional protests and another crackdown.
A few weeks ago, EPRDF critics took advantage of demonstrations against the apparent execution of 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya by Islamic State to voice frustration with the government . In the absence of formal spaces where political dissent and grievances can be aired, there is a risk that spontaneous demonstrations of this kind could escalate.
In this balance, the EPRDFs relations with donors are a crucial factor in maintaining its position. Ethiopia remains structurally dependent on aid, with the country receiving more than $3 billion a year from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, all indications are that external support will remain strong, regardless of electoral openness. Ethiopia is a key partner for countries concerned about security in the region, especially the US, UK and the European Union. Consequently, political reform will need to come from within the system.

The fall of Ramadi has not just exposed the weakness of Barack Obamas nine-month war against the Islamic State . It has also exposed his administration to accusations of a growing credibility gap between optimistic White House pronouncements and the grim realities on the ground.

Iraq veterans, thinktank analysts and former US officials have begun drawing comparisons to Donald Rumsfelds Pentagon during the darkest days of the Iraq occupation. Then as now, some suspect the US is sacrificing a truthful description of the war to avoid pressure to escalate.
Perhaps reality has smacked the administration over the head with a two-by-four in recent days, said retired army colonel Peter Mansoor, a multi-tour Iraq veteran who served as executive officer to general David Petraeus during the 2007-08 Iraq surge.
The long-simmering critique has boiled over after Ramadi fell to Isis fighters, a circumstance administration officials downplayed before and after the capital of Anbar province was overrun earlier this month. Administration pronouncements on Ramadi now openly contradict assurances issued just days earlier.
On Saturday, defense secretary Ashton Carter excoriated the Iraqi military for showing  no will to fight  Isis, after it abandoned Ramadi  a city it had previously held for a year.
Yet just days before, the senior US military officer, general Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had defended the Iraqi withdrawal as a strategic retreat to a more defensible position. The [Iraqi Security Force] was not driven out of Ramadi, they drove out of Ramadi, Dempsey told the Wall Street Journal on 20 May.
Five days before that, as Isis fighters carried out a string of assassinations and bomb attacks that heralded their capture of the city, senior US officials insisted that their coalition  not the insurgents  still held the momentum.
The Iraqis, with coalition support, are making sound progress, Marine brigadier general Thomas Weidley, the chief of staff of the US military command prosecuting the war, told Pentagon reporters on 15 May. Weidley conceded that Isis had for days assaulted the city, but pointed to 165 air strikes which had been launched in the past month to help government forces keep Ramadi.
We firmly believe Daesh is on the defensive throughout Iraq and Syria, attempting to hold previous gains, while conducting small-scale, localized harassing attacks, occasional complex or high-profile attacks, in order to feed their information and propaganda apparatus, Weidley said , using a dismissive Arabic acronym for Isis.
Asked about Isis hoisting its flag in Ramadi, Weidley suggested that Isis was merely taking photos and documenting small-term gains and then using it for propaganda purposes.
By 26 May, more than a week after Ramadi fell, a Central Command press release boasting of a robust coalition commitment to defeating Isis referred vaguely to recent tactical-level setbacks.
In the weeks before Ramadi fell, Pentagon officials dismissed fighting in the surrounding, mainly Sunni province of Anbar as a sideshow.
On 14 April, Dempsey said Ramadi  the capital of Anbar provice, which sits between Isis strongholds in Syria and the Iraqi capital of Baghdad  was  not symbolic in any way , calling the oil refinery at Baiji  a more strategic target . Baiji is about 180km south of Mosul, Iraqs second city, which US warplanners have publicly prioritized over Ramadi since autumn  an emphasis they have now reversed.
Anyone who was looking at the situation could tell that the loss of Ramadi would be hugely significant, Mansoor said.
Mansoor, now a history professor at the Ohio State University, bemoaned happy talk that the strategy is working and all they need to do is adjust at the margins, saying it could create a credibility gap going forward if they dont become more forthright.
Beyond Ramadi, questionable administration statements about Iraq and Isis have accumulated for months.
In April, the Pentagon released a map that seemed to show Isis losing its hold on territory throughout Iraq by more than 25% . Despite the administrations daily air strikes and its deployment of 3,000 noncombat military forces back to Iraq, Susan Rice, Obamas national security adviser, said on 20 May that Obama has  ended two wars responsibly   while both wars continue .
The deployment of those forces, many of them elite troops that the administration prefers to call advisers to the Iraqi military, has stretched the White House assurance against boots on the ground to the breaking point. So has the on-the-ground contributions to the war made by Shia militias and Iranian forces, which took the city of Tikrit back from Isis even as senior US generals denied they were present .
Even the Pentagons website for the war prefers the relatively antiseptic term  Targeted Operations Against [Isis] Terrorists . Meanwhile, a campaign that Obama unilaterally launched in August with the limited goal of preventing a  humanitarian catastrophe  has sprawled into daily strikes in two countries. The US military acknowledges causing only two civilian casualties despite launching more than 3,000 such air strikes.
Jack Keane, the former army vice chief of staff and an architect of the surge, told a Senate panel on Thursday that the specter of the Rumsfeld Pentagon, which for years insisted the Iraq occupation faced merely minor difficulties, had returned .
I hear a disturbing and frightening echo of the summer of 2006 when administration senior government  when a different administration, senior government officials and military senior generals came before this committee and in the face of compelling evidence that our strategy in Iraq was failing, these officials looked at you and defended that strategy and told you that overall the strategy was succeeding, Keane testified.
From the White House, the administration has taken the view that the war would always be  long and difficult , as deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said on 18 May, and the fall of Ramadi is a setback that does not herald broader flaws in US strategy. Weve had other periods of setback too that have been followed shortly by important progress, press secretary Josh Earnest said on 19 May.
Taking a broader view, Obama last week rebuffed the idea that he overlearned the mistake of Iraq, suggesting that the limits he has placed on the US military commitment to Iraq reflect and hedge against Iraqi sectarianism that outside pressure cannot resolve.
If the Iraqis themselves are not willing or capable to arrive at the political accommodations necessary to govern, if they are not willing to fight for the security of their country, we cannot do that for them, Obama told the Atlantics Jeffrey Goldberg , adding: No, I dont think were losing.

Burma's birth control law exposes Buddhist fear of Muslim minority

Despite fierce campaigning by women rights groups and an international outcry, Burma has introduced a birth control law which opponents say is aimed at ethnic minorities.
The controversial bill is one of four pieces of legislation driven by nationalist Buddhist monks who fear that the Muslim population is growing too quickly.
Under the law signed by president Thein Sein, governments of the 14 states and regions can request a presidential order so that local authorities can organise women to have a gap of 36 months between births.
Related: Burmese women could be forced to have fewer children under new law
The World Health Organisation recommends a similar policy to reduce child mortality. However, the law explicitly states that factors taken into consideration, as well as mortality rates and food shortage, can be a high number of migrants in the area, a high population growth rate and a high birth rate, that are seen negatively impacting regional development.
This has reinforced concerns of international observers that the law is aimed primarily at controlling birth rates of the Muslim community  which has been subject to birth-control policies in the past  and non-Buddhists more widely.
Burmas attorney general Tun Shin, who is reported to be a London-educated Christian, will oversee the laws and will be supported by Khin Yi, a retired brigadier-general who was previously chief of police.
The Health Care for Population Control act does not identify any specific group within Burmas web of ethnic communities and religions. But as the plight of thousands of Rohingya Muslim fleeing persecution unfolds, the US and human rights organisations have stepped up their criticism.
US deputy secretary of state Antony Blinken said at a press conference in Yangon on Saturday that he was deeply concerned about the four laws, that could exacerbate ethnic and religious divisions. He said the population law could be enforced in such a way as to undermine the reproductive rights of minorities. Blinken lobbied president Thein Sein about the law on a visit last week while it had already been discreetly signed.
We are particularly concerned that the bill could provide a legal basis for discrimination through coercive, uneven application of birth control policies, and differing standards of care for different communities across the country, the US State Department said.
Comments by extremist monk Ashin Wirathu, close to the Committee for the Protection of Nationality and Religion movement that inspired the laws, has fueled concerns. If the bill is enacted, it could stop the Bengalis that call themselves Rohingya, who are trying to seize control, he told The Irrawaddy, a local magazine.
[The bill] was drafted for healthcare. The World Health Organization also advised a three-year interval between each child. Will it only be legal when women join the discussion? Did women have any participation in sharia law? He added.
The three other laws would impose restrictions on religious conversion and inter-religious marriage and prohibit extra-marital affairs.
The final version of the bill was approved by the joint houses of parliament on 14 May following minor amendments submitted by the president. Members of Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy opposed the bill.
Activists with a racist, anti-Muslim agenda pressed this population law so there is every reason to expect it to be implemented in a discriminatory way, Human Rights Watch Asia director Brad Adams said, warning that the package of laws was likely to escalate repression and sectarian violence.
Rights groups complain that they have not seen the final text of the law but earlier drafts instruct authorities in designated health zones to organise married couples to practise birth spacing. The bill does not contain explicit guarantees that contraceptive use should be voluntary with consent of the user. It does not specify punishments either, nor does it mention abortion.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al-Hussein, also expressed concern over the four bills as they moved through parliament in February.
During an election year, it will be tempting for some politicians to fan the flames of prejudice for electoral gain, he said, placing the legislation in the context of an unpopular quasi-civilian government facing parliamentary elections in November and unwilling to antagonise powerful lobby groups of Burmas Bamar Buddhist majority.
One of the constant narratives of a hardline minority of Buddhist monks is that the ancient religion of Burma must be defended against an advancing tide of radical Islam, with the Muslim population growing more swiftly within the country and entering as illegal immigrants from without.
A report commissioned by the government after violent clashes between Buddhists and Muslims concluded in 2013 that the extremely rapid growth rate of the Bengali population also contributed to fear and insecurity ... The growth was not only due to high birth rates, but also to a steady increase of illegal immigration from neighbouring Bangladesh.
Khon Ja, a member of the Kachin Womens Peace Network which is part of a wider group of womens organisations trying to stop the law, said it particularly affected minority groups.
The target is the Rohingya, she said, referring to the Muslim minority. But the law could affect anyone, she added.
She is worried about the vagueness of the law and what punishments might be entailed. There are concerns it would be applied to pregnant women in prison, and whether they might come under pressure to have abortions.
Members of the Akhaya womens group, which promotes education about sexual health, said they were sexually harassed on social media and even accused of treason for speaking out against the law.
Activists still hope that even after becoming law the government will fail to follow up with the specific directives that would activate the population controls. If Aung San Suu Kyis party wins the elections in November and is allowed to form a government they could then influence that process and clarify the law. However, a new government will not take office until next March 2016.

        <title>Brexit: would it mean dancing to our own tune, or being out of step with the world?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/24/brexit-anti-eu-lobby-must-come-clean</Link>
        <Description>The anti-EU lobby needs to explain in detail what the reality of leaving the union will mean </Description>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
We learned last week that the business world is not united on the burning issue of the UKs membership of the European Union . There is clearly a powerful pro-EU lobby that will rally to CBI president Sir Mike Rakes call for business to turn up the volume and be crystal clear that membership is in our national interest. Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao, for example, said last week: Its in the interests of our customers and our shareholders that Britain does not leave the EU.
But there are also vocal opponents. Graeme MacDonald, chief executive of digger firm JCB, said he did not think a UK exit would make a blind bit of difference to trading with Europe. Others advise waiting to see what David Camerons attempt at renegotiating the UKs relationship with the EU yields.
Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, said: Some of these reforms can be done and should be done, and it is best for Britain to see what those reforms are before making a judgment.
That position may also be closer to the mood of the majority of small and medium-sized businesses. In a survey last year the Institute of Directors  which has a very different membership from the CBI, with its battalion of multinationals and large banks  found that for 60% of members, support for continued EU membership was conditional on successful reforms in key areas, such as employment law.
At least we will have a debate. Despite the CBIs irritating claim to be the voice of business (as if there could be only one), Rake is correct on two central points. First, it would be a good thing if business folk spoke in a language people can understand. Second, opponents of EU membership should explain in detail what an alternative would look like.
The first point cuts both ways. If employers, when they grumble about the EU working time directive and other employment laws, really mean that they would like greater freedom to fire staff cheaply, they should say so. Such an admission might not convert many waverers to the EU cause, but it would be honest.
Equally, though, directors should feel free to say what Brexit  the UKs exit from the EU  would mean for jobs and investment at their companies. High-minded notions about open economies and the benefits of free trade dont cut it. Workers want to know if their jobs are on the line. In the Scottish referendum, the threat of specific jobs and companies moving to England injected a much-needed dose of economic realism into the debate.
Few would mourn the departure of crisis-ridden Deutsche Bank from the City, but if a more respected institution  say, Lloyds of London, the insurance market  could make a detailed case about the damaging effect of Brexit on the financial services industry, voters would wish to hear it.
The second point  about an alternative to EU membership  is critical. Here Rake makes a good argument: Norway and Switzerland are not in the EU but still have to abide by EU rules to sell into the single market, so where is the supposed escape from European red tape?
MacDonald at JCB says it is easier selling to North America than to Europe sometimes, but why does he believe exit, as opposed to engagement from within, would improve matters?
Thats the challenge to get-out lobby must face. Its easy to maintain that the UK would be able to negotiate trade deals with countries across the globe, rather than be bound by the EUs agreements. Of course there could be deals. But would they be better deals? Common sense suggests the US, for example, would give more generous terms to a zone of 500 million citizens than to a single country with 64 million people. If the reality is different, lets hear a detailed account rather than vague aspiration.
Wongas back: would you credit it?
Three years ago Wonga , pumping out profits of 62m on turnover of just 309m, proclaimed its borrowers were young, single, employed, digitally savvy and can pay us back on time. Except that much of its lavish profit margin was from multiple fees racked up by less than savvy individuals who did not pay back on time, and who were wiped out by its 5,853% interest rate.
Last month, a humbled Wonga  having been forced to write off loans to 330,000 clients and pay millions after it was found to have issued fake legal letters  reported a loss of 37m. As one wag put it, the loss would only have been 1.50 if it hadnt taken out a loan with itself in December.
Last week Wonga relaunched, were told, to a more middle-class audience. Its less-than-catchy new slogan is credit for the real world. Its press release proclaims: Our focus is on serving hard-working people throughout the UK. With admirable chutzpah, Andy Haste, the chairman brought in to clean up the operation, said it had decided to keep the Wonga name as it was still seen as a trusted brand by our core audience.
That core audience has shrunk dramatically, from more than 1million to around 600,000 today. Wonga believes new customers will be impressed by a 24-hour money-back guarantee, a three-day grace period, where customers will escape the 15 default fee, and freezing all balances in arrears to stop them racking up interest for longer than seven days.
It has even slashed the interest it charges. It faces stiff competition, as personal loan rates have tumbled in recent months. M&amp;S Bank is offering an APR of 3.6% (although the minimum term is 12 months, rather more than with Wonga). Nationwide and Sainsburys are also charging 3.6%.
So what is Wonga now charging? Its new APR is 1,509%, or, using its preferred calculation, 292%. The Wonga puppets may have been retired but evidently the company reckons there are plenty more muppets out there.
Half a dozen of the other sex isnt much FTSE 100 progress
A small victory for diversity at the top of Britains biggest companies was scored on Friday when Alison Brittain was named as the new chief executive of Whitbread, owner of Premier Inns and Costa Coffee. Not only has Brittain managed to jump sectors  she has spent her entire career as a banker until now  she has managed to take the number of female bosses in the FTSE 100 to six.
Brittain joins Vronique Laury at Kingfisher, Liv Garfield at Severn Trent, Moya Greene at Royal Mail, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall at easyJet in the higher echelons of corporate Britain.
But keep the champagne on ice. In 2015, six female bosses out of 100 should not be a cause for celebration. The truth is that there are still nearly three times as many bosses called John (or Jean) at the helm of big UK businesses as there are women.

Canadian three-way split might enable Harper to pull a Cameron in election
Conservative government has got through a tough spring and could, like its UK counterparts, achieve a majority unless Liberals and New Democrats cooperate

Canadas increasingly unpopular Conservative government stumbled through a bruising spring in which it enraged the nation and alienated some of its most faithful supporters. But the prime minister, Stephen Harper , is entering the race for re-election this autumn with the wind at its back.
The reason parallels the situation in the UK, where David Cameron returned with a majority of seats conjured from a bare plurality of votes. Opposition to Harper is evenly divided between two major opposition parties  the Liberals and the New Democrats  so the one-third of voters who vote Conservative are set once again to choose Canadas national government.
Most analysts here think that vote-splitting will help Harper and the Conservatives, says Ted Morton, a former Conservative politician and senior fellow at the Manning Foundation thinktank in Calgary. As evidence, he points to the last election, in which Harper prefigured Camerons feat by winning a solid majority of seats with fewer than 40% of votes.
Harper is still within reach of a minority, if not yet a majority, Morton says.

The Conservatives gained fresh hope of a sort this week with the release of polls showing a strong surge in support for the leftwing New Democratic party following its surprise victory in a recent provincial election in Alberta, a staunchly conservative region often called the Texas of Canada .
The NDP gains have drawn the federal party tied with the Conservatives and the Liberal party in voter approval ratings as the long campaign begins, thus improving the odds that the increasingly restive majority of Canadians who oppose the Harper government will once again divide their votes and usher him to victory.
Outsiders will find little to distinguish between the two parties now promising a progressive alternative to the Conservatives.
Under their dashing but unproven young leader, Justin Trudeau, the Liberals have attempted a youth-centred revival promising a break from the complacency and cronyism of the partys recent past.
The New Democrats  led by bearded, experienced Thomas Mulcair  have emulated Tony Blairs New Labour by jettisoning their old-school socialist baggage and veering onto the centre-left terrain previously monopolized by the Liberals.
The one wedge that opens clear light between the two opposition leaders is their stated willingness to cooperate in an effort to defeat Harper. After some prevarication this spring, Trudeau ultimately rejected calls to form a coalition with the NDP in order to topple the Tories, citing personal differences with Mulcair. His style is anchored in the old way of practising politics, Trudeau said.
By contrast, Mulcair has openly embraced cooperation in an effort to distinguish himself from the Liberal leader, eldest son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau. My first priority is to get rid of Stephen Harper, he said in response to the Liberal leaders rebuff. The first priority of Justin Trudeau is Justin Trudeau.
As deadlock looms and commentators descend into familiar demands for electoral reform, the leftwing campaign group Council of Canadians has launched a voter registration campaign, confident that increasing the last campaigns historically low 61% turnout will accomplish the necessary work automatically.
Its a complicated situation, says the councils head, Maude Barlow. But if we can get the issues out and get more people voting, we can get rid of Harper even if there isnt any formal coalition ahead of time.
Barlow accuses the Conservatives of hollowing out Canadian civil society, cancelling thousands of programmes, rescinding grants, removing regulations, shutting institutions and rescinding the tax-exempt status of annoying charities. They dont care about us and I dont believe they try to represent us, she says. They only care about the 35% of the population they want to vote for them.
Related: Canada poised to pass anti-terror legislation despite widespread outrage
Even former supporters have joined the attack. The governments sweeping anti-terror legislation, seen as a political masterstroke when introduced, ultimately inspired a massive outcry that echoed from every establishment pulpit in the country. The governments more recent attempt to announce clearly unattainable carbon-emission targets  and its subsequent U-turn inspired derision on both the right and left.
Partisan cooperation is unknown in Canadian election campaigns, according to Bob Rae, a senior statesman who served as the NDP premier of Ontario 20 years ago and more recently as the federal Liberal partys caretaker leader following its 2011 electoral collapse under Michael Ignatieff .
People are very determined to maintain the identity of their parties and to maintain their separateness, Rae says, and the intensity to do that seems to grow as the ideological differences between the parties becomes less and less significant.
Despite that, Rae adds, there is a long history of Canadian parties cooperating to form governments following less than decisive elections. And despite the reliable perversity of a first-past-the-post electoral system in a multiparty democracy, theres never any easy way to tell whom it may favour.
First-past-the-post is a momentum play, Rae says. I think what were seeing, particularly with this long campaign, is that its quite possible any of the three parties will make a breakthrough.

        <title>First Ramadi, then Palmyra: Isis shows it can storm bastions of Syria and Iraq</title>

Islamic State fighters are celebrating their second major conquest in a week in Syria and Iraq as they pick through the ruins of the historic city of Palmyra.
The sudden advance of the militants into the UN heritage site in central Syria resulted in the rout of a national army, the exodus of refugees and a fresh pulse of regional alarm at the resilience of the self-styled caliphate force.
The UN said one-third of Palmyras 200,000-strong population had fled. And Isis militants used social media to show themselves posing amid ancient columns in Palmyra on Thursday. Other images displayed a more familiar theme: the summary slaughter of local men whose blood drenched the road.

Isiss latest advance has prompted a re-evaluation across the region, which had earlier sensed it might be in retreat. From Beirut to Baghdad and as far away as Riyadh, regional actors are coming to terms with an organisation that can win most of its battles and successfully storm Syria and Iraqs best-defended bastions.
The seizure of Palmyra followed the equally startling conquest of Ramadi in Iraqs Anbar province last weekend. Both operations, around 600 miles apart, have become emblematic of a terror group that can have its way across two crumbling countries despite embattled state forces being propped up by global powers.
In Syria, forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad had committed to defend gas fields to the north of Palmyra that are essential to the nations electricity supply. The ruins themselves, as well as being enduring testaments to the countrys diverse past, are central to the pluralistic image conveyed by the modern state. Both sites are strategic, yet they fell in less than four days  with elite army units unwilling and unable to defend them.
Ramadi in Iraq , meanwhile, had been a holdout in the heart of the countrys most hostile province  a place where local Sunni leaders allied with the Shia-led government and its militia proxies to keep Isis at bay.
That too changed in less than 72 hours of clashes, where top-tier troops and tribes posed little resistance. In both cases, once the battles started going badly, state forces surrendered the cities to their fate, leaving large amounts of ammunition behind.
They wanted to defend this area, said a government official who fled Palmyra for Damascus on Thursday. They even tried to. But if thats the best that they can do when they try, then the country is lost.
Officials who had fled Palmyra said jets from the US-led coalition that had bombed Isis targets elsewhere in the country had not joined the fight. US jets were instrumental in expelling the terror group from the two cities it has lost so far, Kobani, in Syrias north, and Tikrit, in central Iraq.

The fall of Ramadi stirred ghosts of a painful past: jihadis had used the city as a launch pad to spread nationwide chaos from 2004-07. That could never happen again, Iraqi officials claimed. The fact that it has  yielding Isis its most spectacular triumph this year  has shattered already brittle confidence in the ability of Iraq to hold the country together.
In both countries, residents said the Isis victories said perhaps more about the weakness of the states than about the potency of the jihadis. And while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fall of Palmyra meant Isis now controls more than 50% of the country, opposition groups countered by saying that battle lines elsewhere in Syria had not shifted in Isiss favour since 2013.
Gains against the Syrian regime, they said, had been made by groups who previously fought Isis and included an amalgam of mainstream fighters and jihadis, among them the ascendant al-Nusra front, which like Isis has been prescribed by the US and much of Europe as a terrorist group.
The anti-Assad opposition played no role in the Palmyra clashes. Regime troops had been the areas primary defenders.
In Ramadi, despair was endemic. There are no police left, said the police chief, Colonel Jabbar al-Assif, himself a recent exile. Everyone left was killed or is injured. Whoever didnt make it out was killed later on by Isis. They have a list of all the policemen and the soldiers, with addresses, and they were going to their homes to kill them. So all of the police families fled too.

The Isis advances mark a sharp turnaround from events earlier this year when it lost Kobani and Tikrit and was forced to retreat from around 7,700 sq miles (20,000 sqkm) of land in northern Iraq. That had led to claims that it could not hold its gains, and that after a year in which sociopolitics of the Middle East had been overturned, Isis could no longer secure its objectives.
If the state was strong, then that would be the case, said an army officer who ordered his men to flee Ramadi. They are not winning because they are powerful. They are winning because we are weak. Im not sure about Syria, but I think its the same there.
Thirty miles closer to Baghdad, in the city of Falluja, which is also under Isis control, some residents say they have become used to the jihadis in their midst and have come to prefer them to the vagaries of central government rule.
We dont have much electricity and fuel and we have been bombed a lot by the air strikes, but apart from that we are in a better condition than we were under the army, said a doctor to whom Isis had offered security and a platform that Iraqs government could not match.
We in Falluja prefer to stay here in our homes than become refugees begging to enter Baghdad or left to rot in refugee camps which arent even suitable for animals. We prefer to live with our dignity in our city. We are all viewed by the government as Isis, this is our identity.

Seizure of Palmyra and Ramadi by Isis reveal gaping holes in US jihadi strategy
Far from being on the defensive, Islamic State has shown that the arms-length approach of the US to Iraq is failing and Washington is operating day by day

Islamic States victories in Palmyra and Ramadi have been painful blows for the US-led coalition in both Syria and Iraq respectively, underlining the flaws in a strategy that has been widely criticised as both wrong-headed and half-hearted.
Until the last few weeks the conventional wisdom in Washington, London and Arab capitals was that Isis had been forced on to the back foot, suffering from shortages of cash, weapons and problems of resupply, even if its morale was sustained by a slick propaganda machine that kept attracting recruits.
Now events may be forcing a rethink. The Obama administration is taking an extremely hard look at its approach, in the words of an unnamed official who declared in the wake of the fall of Ramadi: Youd have to be delusional not to take something like this and say what went wrong, how do you fix it and how do we correct course to go from here?
Robert Gates, the former US defence secretary, put it even more bluntly: We dont really have a strategy at all. Were basically playing this day by day. The urgent delivery of new anti-tank missiles for the Iraqi army has been one short-term response. But larger military and political questions are still unanswered.
Iraq remains the priority. Air attacks launched last September have been carried out by the US, Britain and half a dozen other countries, while operations in Syria are limited to the US and the largely symbolic presence of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . Coalition aircraft have carried out 2,200 air strikes in Iraq and 1,400 in Syria.
The recapture of Kobani on the Syrian-Turkish border has been the headline achievement for the air campaign. Last week the US highlighted a special forces raid that killed a Isis financier. Britain made great play of the imposition of EU sanctions on the Syrian purchasing oil from the group on behalf of Bashar al-Assad. Squeezing Isis cash is an important element of the overall strategy, officials say. So is domestic counter-terrorism work.
In recent weeks a significant novelty in the regional mix has been the greater effectiveness of Saudi Arabia , which is now working with its old rivals Qatar and Turkey to build a more potent coalition of non-Isis Syrian rebel groups fighting Assad on the ground, not just from 30,000ft.
By contrast, the US programme to train and equip a Syrian force to fight Isis  though not Assad  is moving agonisingly slowly after its launch in Jordan a few weeks ago. Britain backs that effort as well as maintaining financial and political support for the opposition Syrian National Coalition. But the SNCs unceasing demands for a no-fly zone or a safety zone to protect civilians from the regimes barrel bombs and chlorine gas are getting nowhere slowly.
On the Iraqi front, analysts say the US has to decide how many more victories by Isis it can sustain before increasing support to the underperforming Baghdad government forces on the ground. It and its allies must also do more to back acceptable insurgent groups in Syria, argues Charles Lister of the Brookings Institution.
But Obamas credibility is extremely low. Next time you read some grand statement by US officials on [the] campaign against Isis or see a Centcom [US Central Command] map about Isis reversals, just bin it, commented Emile Hokayem , a respected Middle East expert with the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
The fundamental problem is that Isis is waging war across two countries in a single interconnected crisis that is sustained by Sunni anger and the perception that the US and the west are content to look on as a confident Iran backs Shia groups in Iraq and beyond for its own strategic and sectarian reasons.
In the Middle East the conventional wisdom remains that Islamic State will not be defeated until Assad is. But while there is no doubt that the Syrian presidents position has weakened in recent weeks, his regimes demise is not in sight.

A summit in Riga this week is likely to highlight the failure of the EUs flagship programme designed to entice six former Soviet states out of Moscows orbit and into the embrace of Brussels.
The Eastern Partnership scheme was set up in 2009 in response to Russian actions in Georgia and was meant to check Russias ambitions in what Moscow regards as its near abroad, while offering the vaguest of suggestions of future EU membership.
We will act more carefully with regard to Russia in the future. Perhaps there was not enough carefulness
The Kremlins intervention in Ukraine , however, combined with even less desire in the EU to see the bloc expand further, has left the Eastern Partnership concept in turmoil, with two of the six countries joining the Kremlins Eurasian Economic Union, explicitly designed as a rival to the EU.
Meanwhile, Ukraine and Georgia , the most fervently pro-EU of the six, are likely to be given little in the way of carrots at the summit in Riga, to be held on Thursday and Friday.
At a 2013 summit of the grouping in Vilnius, Lithuania , Ukraines then president Viktor Yanukovych said he would not sign a free trade agreement envisaged by the programme, under pressure from Russia. The decision set in motion a chain of events that led to protests in Ukraine, Yanukovychs downfall, the Russian annexation of Crimea and war in east Ukraine.

These events have loomed heavily over the Riga summit.
We have all experienced a collective shock that we have a neighbour who is willing to use any means in order to undermine sovereign choices in Europe . We thought that this time was long over, said a top EU official in the runup to the summit.
Amid internal EU divisions on whether the best response to this is redoubled commitment to integrating eastern neighbours or a scale-back of ambition, the result is a fudge.
The EU will never allow a third country to dictate the policy it has towards other countries, said the senior EU official. However, we will act more carefully with regard to Russia in the future. Perhaps there was not enough carefulness, not enough outreach, not enough dialogue before.

In the runup to Riga, EU officials are publicly claiming they are still as committed as ever to the Eastern Partnership. But the rhetoric shows the bloc is now extremely worried about provoking Russia and the voices of EU member states less hawkish on Russia are in the ascendancy.
We dont want to provoke Russia and give them one more reason to be aggressive, said another European diplomat attending the summit. We need to be extremely careful.
Trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the EU were held this week in Brussels to iron out the details and time scale of the implementation of the EU-Ukraine free trade agreement.
Among some of the partner countries, enthusiasm for the project is also on the wane. Azerbaijan , aware that the EU is interested in its energy supplies anyway, has lost interest in the programme. President Ilham Aliyev will not attend the Riga summit, apparently in protest at European complaints about the countrys human rights record. Belarus and Armenia are still engaging with the programme but have become members of Vladimir Putins Eurasian Union, ruling out real economic or political integration with the EU.

That leaves Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova still keen on EU integration and eventual membership, but here it is the EU itself that is trying to slow things down. Diplomats say they are preparing to manage expectations of Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova , because several EU countries do not want to commit even to the vague prospect of future membership as part of the Riga summit. Wrangling over the wording of the summits statement is ongoing. Even visa-free travel, a key carrot for Eastern partnership countries, seems unlikely to be extended to Ukraine and Georgia in Riga.
Before the summit, a new study released recommends the EU to do much more to counter Kremlin propaganda among Russian-speaking citizens of EU and neighbouring countries.
More than 90 media experts worked on the feasibility study presented by the European Endowment for Democracy, which works for greater coordination among Russian-language media resources and increased funding.

Peter Pomerantsev, one of the authors of the report, who writes extensively about Kremlin-controlled media propaganda, said: One thing we discovered across the Eastern Partnership and beyond: people often dont trust any media  be they Russian, western or their own. We need to rebuild trust in high-quality journalism.
Moscow boosted its budgets in 2015 for its English-language global network RT and for Rossiya Segodnya, the state news agency headed by television propagandist Dmitry Kiselev and producing output in a dozen languages. It also has a major Russian-language arm aimed at speakers in the Baltics and elsewhere.
However, some express unease over the fact that many of the calls for funding Russian-language media sound like calls to play Russia at its own game.
It should not mean counter-propaganda. We have to find a smarter way, said Jerzy Pomianowski, executive director of the European Endowment for Democracy.

Israel's bus segregation row shows high wire act facing Netanyahu
Caught between the Israeli right and the international community, the president is struggling to keep all his plates spinning

The first crisis in the new rightwing government of Binyamin Netanyahu  over a discriminatory pilot scheme that would have seen some Palestinian workers banned from using Israeli buses in the occupied West Bank  is deeply instructive.
Scotched by Netanyahu barely hours after it had been approved by defence minister Moshe Yaalon, amid an outcry from across the Israeli political spectrum that condemned the move as racist and smacking of apartheid, it has underscored the immense political challenges facing Israels prime minister.
At the head of a coalition with a majority of one in the Knesset, Netanyahu has found himself exactly where many expected him to be after having assembled a coalition heavily dominated by the pro-settler right: between a rock and a hard place.
Reliant on the support of Naftali Bennetts ultra-nationalist Jewish Home, he has found himself, too, under sharp and increasing scrutiny by the international community including the US and EU. During elections in March, Netanyahu appealed directly to Bennetts voters when he disavowed support for a two-state solution, a position he has since tried to row back on.
In any circumstances the events of Tuesday evening and Wednesday were bizarre in their timing.
Related: Israel scraps scheme to ban Palestinians from buses
Coinciding with the visit of the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter , who had flown in to try to persuade the Palestinian Football Association to drop its efforts to have Israeli football banned from international competition for discrimination, it also preceded the visit of EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini  who is under increasing pressure to formulate a tougher policy against Israels continued occupation and settlement-building.
While it is possible Netanyahu was not aware of the decision by his defence minister  one of his closest allies in cabinet, Moshe Yaalon  to press ahead with the controversial pilot scheme, that poses an equally awkward question: why not?
The explanation of Netanyahus own office has hardly helped shed light on what occurred  a series of events evoking more than a passing similarity to the political satire The Thick of It. The proposals, Netanyahus office told the Jerusalem Post without elaboration, were unacceptable to the prime minister.
Related: Israel faces Fifa suspension over claims it discriminates against Palestinians
What seems more than likely is that this will not be an isolated incident. For years Netanyahu has flourished on his own terms as the political equivalent of a plate spinner in an old-fashioned music hall act, supplying just enough momentum to avoid a crisis.
In the last year, however, that trick has seemed ever harder for him to pull off. Unhappy with what he thought was an unmanageable coalition last year, he has replaced it with a more tenuous one.
The reality, underscored by recent events, is that Netanyahu is confronting a potentially unsolvable problem.
On the one hand he cannot keep the pro-settlement lobby inside his government happy without increasing friction with an international community already deeply frustrated by the collapse of the Middle East peace process.
On the other, Netanyahu  under pressure from the US and the EU to show concrete signs that he is still committed to negotiations  has little room to move on them, surrounded in government as he is by those who oppose the creation of a Palestinian state.
Related: Shaky Israel coalition spells trouble for Netanyahu and peace process
If the bus-segregation row was one indicator of this increasingly precarious high-wire act, it has not been the only one in recent days.
As few have failed to notice, Silvan Shalom, the man Netanyahu has given responsibility for handling peace negotiations with the Palestinians, has been vocal in the past about his opposition to a Palestinian state.
And it is not only political figures from Israels left and centre that have been sounding warnings about the direction of the country under Netanyahus new coalition.
In Tuesdays Haaretz, prefiguring the bus segregation row, former Likud minister Dan Meridor warned in sharp terms about his old partys dangerous trajectory.
In the past, warned Meridor, the Likud had always tried to strike a balance between nationalism and the pursuit of the Zionist dream, on the one hand, and liberalism, respect for democracy and the individual, on the other.
This balance, unfortunately, has been disturbed and I see the Likud becoming much more nationalistic and less attentive to its liberal side. Today, in the party, when you use words like democracy, human rights and rule of law, they immediately depict you as a leftist.
For now all the plates are still spinning. But for how long?

        <title>Belfast gay cake ruling: the law may be clear, but was it wise to prosecute?</title>

Sections of the Tory press got predictably excited on Wednesday about a Belfast judges ruling that a local bakery firm run by staunch Christians had been guilty of discrimination for refusing to bake a cake with Sesame Street puppet decorations proclaiming the virtues of gay marriage.
Related: The gay cake ruling is a victory for equality in Northern Ireland | Joshua Rozenberg
So the law is clear, but were the plaintiffs wise? Im not sure.
In a 90-minute hearing on Tuesday Judge Isobel Brownlie decided the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland was right in bringing the case on behalf of Gareth Lee, described as a gay activist, who had tried to buy the cake from Belfast-based Ashers Baking Company. The firm must pay a token 500 in compensation, plus costs which will be larger.
The commissions head, Michael Wardlow, argues that people who take part in commercial activity must do so within the framework of the law which outlaws this kind of discrimination. Fair enough, and Northern Ireland is a corner of the kingdom which has seen more than its share of ugly discrimination down the decades.
As Joshua Rozenberg explains , the law is clear. When conflicting ethical values collide  in this case the hard-fought battle of gays to overcome persecution and achieve equal rights versus the embattled beliefs of Christians in a largely secular country  the law as stated must prevail.
As the Daily Mail loves to point out, there have been several such cases. A Cornish couple running a small hotel had a ruling (it went all the way to the supreme court) against them after refusing a double room to a gay couple on the grounds that they were not married. In vain did they plead that theyd have done the same to unmarried heterosexuals on religious grounds. While the marriage guidance charity Relate was upheld in sacking a staffer who would not counsel gay couples.
Each case is different, but we get their drift. My question is twofold. It may be legal, but is it wise? And is it fair of those who so recently suffered majoritarian persecution themselves to use the muscle they now enjoy to discomfort others when they can get their cakes baked or their hotel booked elsewhere?
I dont claim to be sure about this. I was sceptical  so were some gay people we all know  about the wisdom of the coalitions symbolic legislation in favour of same-sex marriage despite earlier promises that Labours civil partnership reform would suffice. It seemed needlessly divisive at a point in time when the fiddly consequences of legal discrimination  wills, property, that sort of thing  had finally been eradicated in most of Britain.
I should add that same-sex marriage is not yet legal in Northern Ireland or indeed across the border in the Republic, where a lot of catching up has taken place in the past 20 years and where voters go to the polls on Friday for a referendum on whether to legalise gay marriage. Hardliners on both sides of the sectarian divide often seem united in opposing social reform. Abortion remains a hot issue in all 32 counties . Beware stiff necked self-righteousness.
Since the coalitions marriage reform (so much cheaper than Daves marriage tax break) it has been touching to see and hear about the pleasure it has given thousands of gay couples to make their public affirmation of commitment, complete with all the OTT trimmings that accompany modern marriage. Poignant too, since statistics suggest the value of marriage has declined among heterosexuals.
But was it wise to press home an advantage against what is still a substantial minority  including all the great faiths and many of their activists  who opposed the move? Whatever else they are, our current political leaders are not profound thinkers. They can just about raise their sights to the next election, but rarely think long term. Public opinion is volatile, its mood changes. Just look at the changing frontiers of the abortion debate.
Lilly-livered stuff, you may say. Rights have to be policed and enforced. Abortion law proves that. Well, yes. But societys institutions behave much like individuals, they pick and choose the rigour with which they enforce.
Some police chiefs are keen on cracking down on speeding or drink driving, others it seems less so. Magistrates and judges follow fashions too. Regulators the world over fine banks (ie punish shareholders who did nothing wrong), but almost never jail the crooked traders who did the damage. Multiculturalism sensibilities are sometimes invoked (rightly so on occasion) to stay authoritys hand. Not paying your TV licence is not a crime to the Murdoch press, though it disapproves of bilking your Sky TV subscription.
In any case the Belfast bakery was not pursued by the police or the Crown Prosecution Service, but by the state-funded agency tasked with anti-discrimination enforcement, at the instigation of the QueenSpace campaign. It says it didnt realise that Asher was a biblical name (the Ashers were Old Testament bakers) and the six-branch firm run by devout Christians. It wasnt looking for trouble, honest.
To my mind a lot of these issues are about giving other people space in which to live their lives as they see fit in a plural and tolerant society. The Belfast bakery staff werent demonstrating or issuing threats  as the anti-abortion crowd so often do. They fell foul of the law by accident and the law has left them aggrieved.
We talk about tolerance but we sometimes dont include tolerance of attitudes, behaviour and people we dont like. Theyve learned that the hard way in Northern Ireland. But Im always amazed how indignantly secular western liberals can berate more tradition-bound societies beyond Europe (American attitudes are different, suffused with a fundamentalist strain) for clinging to attitudes which were orthodox in France, Britain, Germany and Co well within living memory.
Abortion? Capital punishment? Gay sex? Strict dress codes? Religious adherence? Above all, the treatment of women, who constitute one half of humanity? Good old New Zealand gave women the vote in 1893 , we completed the task only in 1918-29, France in 1944. Switzerlands courts finally confirmed the female vote in federal elections in 1971, six years before the French state stopped chopping peoples heads off Saudi- and-Isis-style in 1977. That was almost 200 years after the revolutionary declaration of the rights of man - from which women were excluded despite protest. Of course.
Beware self-righteous intolerance, wherever quarter it comes from.

Why is Aung San Suu Kyi silent on the plight of the Rohingya people?
Burmas opposition leader appears to be cowed by her need to dampen ethnic tensions and win votes from an electorate in the thrall of Islamophobia

When thousands of Rohingya people from Burma were discovered floating in boats on the south-east Asian seas much of the world was understandably gripped by this unfolding human tragedy.
Voices of anger were raised; something had to be done to end the suffering, to help those men, women and children in need.
But what has surprised some is the silence of the Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi .
After all, these are the poverty-stricken and disenfranchised refugees from her own country who are now the focus of greater attention than ever before.

The contrast could not be more striking: how could such an iconic figure of human rights be so reticent when it comes to defending an ethnic minority from her own country?
It was only at the urging of reporters on Monday that a spokesman for her opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), addressed the issue.
He said the Rohingya people should be entitled to human rights, while urging a solution that acknowledged their right to citizenship status.
But nothing has come directly from the partys leader. Aung San Suu Kyi herself has previously justified her reluctance to speak out on the issue of the Rohingya, even when pressed to do so during Buddhist-Muslim clashes that swept through the country in 2013.
She feared that any statement she made would only fuel tensions between the Buddhist majority and the Rohingya, who make up about a third of the population of Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh .
Now, a surge of Buddhist nationalism and the complex ethnic political ramifications for a country that has just started a transition to democracy are taking their toll on her international image.
In the courtyard of a Buddhist monastery in the ancient Rakhine capital of Mrauk-U, the difficulties faced by the opposition leader known as the Lady are illustrated by a senior monk who repeats what he says are the warnings of Ashin Wirathu, an influential monk based in Mandalay who has become a leading voice of a new generation of nationalists espousing the cause of the Bamar, the dominant ethnic group in Burma.
They will come with swords, they will kill us, the senior monk says of the Muslim hordes he sees encroaching on Burma .
Muslims reproduce like rabbits, they want to kill us with swords, they want to conquer us
Muslims reproduce like rabbits; they want to kill us with swords; they want to conquer us  we have to defend ourselves and our religion, he insists, explicitly identifying the Rohingya with Islamist terrorism around the world.
Extremist movements such as 969 , which is driven by Ashin Wirathu, and Ma Ba Tha  the Organisation for the Protection of Race and Religion  present themselves as defenders of the countrys interests and its Bamar soul against foreign influence in post-sanctions Burma.
While insisting that he is against violence, Ashin Wirathu and those like him have fuelled and exploited tensions between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine state, promoting the belief that Islam is penetrating the country to install sharia law and leave Buddhists as a minority.
The nationalists are also trying to smear Aung San Suu Kyi by depicting her as the Muslim lover.
In a country that is 90% Buddhist there is little sympathy to be found for the Rohingya cause, and expressing support could be political suicide for both the NLD and the military-backed ruling party less than six months before parliamentary elections.
A party source close to Aung San Suu Kyi, who asked not to be named, said the party leader was deeply upset over what was happening. But the source said she also understood the penalty for being seen as favouring Muslims and believed she needed to be in government to deal with the backlash.
There is a strong belief that powerful people with close links to radical monks are deliberately stirring up tensions between communities in an attempt to disrupt ongoing political reforms.
According to some observers, Aung San Suu Kyi and her strategists have decided that speaking up for the Rohingya may not be in their electoral interests.
Aung San Suu Kyi and her strategists are looking at the electoral maths, says Nicholas Farrelly, director of the Australian National Universitys Myanmar Research Centre.
They have long imagined that any perception the NLD is too cosy with the countrys Muslims could lose them millions of votes. That, at least, is the fear.
They are anxious that the Rohingya could serve as a wedge between Aung San Suu Kyi and tens of millions of Buddhists that she is counting on for votes. It doesnt help that many NLD members probably support harsh treatment for the Rohingya and feel no special compassion for them.
Burmas quasi-civilian government, which is headed by former generals, is in a similar situation. President Thein Seins success in bringing the country back into the international fold after decades of isolation is threatened by foreign coverage of the Rohingya boat crisis.
For days the government line was to resist diplomatic pressure and insist the root cause of the crisis was trafficking of migrants, not the persecution of a stateless people whose name, Rohingya, is not even officially recognised.
But on Tuesday the official newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar , reported on the crisis for the first time, in a further sign that the government is moderating its rejectionist position. The daily quoted the information minister, Ye Htut, as telling foreign ambassadors that Burma would cooperate with regional and international counterparts to tackle the ongoing boat people crisis, which is a consequence of human trafficking of people from Rakhine state and Bangladesh to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
The Myanmar [Burmese] government will scrutinise the boat people and bring back those who can show evidence of citizenship, the minister said.
The governments move to at least acknowledge the problem in public could make it easier for the NLD to follow suit and promote a united response.
On the other hand, Aung San Suu Kyi might decide to maintain her silence, calculating it is in her interests to leave the government on its own to deal with any backlash across the country but especially in Rakhine as the elections draw near.

        <MainBody>WHAT WE KNOW
Nine people are dead
Eight people were pronounced dead at the scene and one other died in hospital a few hours later. Police said that all nine were members of two motorcycle gangs, the Bandidos and the Cossacks. Sergeant Patrick Swanton, a spokesman for the Waco police department, said it was one of the most violent scenes hed seen in his career. The bodies have now been sent off for autopsy.
 and 18 injured
In addition to those killed, 18 people were injured and taken to area hospitals. All those injured were members of biker gangs, according to police, with no officers, bystanders or shoppers hurt.

170 arrested on charges relating to capital murder
At last count, 170 people were apprehended by local police from the scene of the shootout on Sunday, Swanton said at a press conference on Monday, but this number is subject to change. The figure was revised down from an earlier figure of 192, as police initially were not sure how many people they had detained due to the chaos on scene. Waco police transformed the citys Convention Center into a staging area overnight to hold those arrested; most at the site had been or were in the process of being booked into the McLennan county jail.
They have now all been charged with engaging in organized crime in reference to the shooting at Twin Peaks. Swanton said this is a capital murder charge because of the number of victims killed at one site.
The number of shots, who shot who and all of that will be part of our investigative process and wont be released right away, Swanton said. Officers found more than 100 weapons at the scene.
Gangs involved
Police said that the shootout involved members from five different motorcycle gangs, including the Bandidos , the worlds second largest biker gang , and the Cossacks, a smaller Texas-based outfit. Photographs of arrests at the scene showed several members of the Scimitars biker gang were also present. Swanton declined to elaborate on the groups specifics. You wont hear their name from us here today, Swanton said. Were not about to give them the respect of knowing their names. We dont care.
At a press conference on Monday, Swanton said the fight started in the Twin Peaks restroom and quickly escalated to the patio/bar area. Shots were fired inside the restaurant by rival gang members at each other, Swanton said, before the fighting moved swiftly into the parking lot.
Police involvement
Sergeant Swanton said that 18 police officers, including command staff, were present at the scene prior to the multiple shootings, as they had been alerted to the presence of multiple biker gangs in advance. We have been made aware over two months that rival gangs are meeting here and that the potential for violence is increasing, Swanton said of Twin Peaks.
Once the fighting moved into the parking lot outside Twin Peaks, the bikers turned their guns away from each other and towards police, who returned fire, Swanton said, reportedly possibly wounding and possibly killing several. It is not yet clear how many, if any had been killed by police fire.
The officers on scene became involved in the gunfight within a matter of seconds from the initial indication that there was a disturbance inside.
Local, state and federal law enforcement officials descended on the scene and many are still present, providing support and manpower, Swanton said. Swat officers are still on the scene, providing protection.
Related: Waco shootout: who are the Bandidos motorcycle gang?
Twin Peaks franchise license revoked
The restaurants liquor sales will be revoked for at least seven days due to the ongoing danger it presents to the community, Swanton said, but they will be open for food sales. The Texas Alcohol and Beverage Commission is conducting a parallel investigation into the incident, which raised the possibility of further violence.
A spokesperson for the Twin Peaks parent company issued a statement on Monday saying that it was revoking the franchise from the Waco location.
WHAT WE DONT KNOW
Why the fight started
Multiple theories abound as to why the gang members had gathered that evening at Twin Peaks, though none are conclusive. Steve Cook, a Kansas City-area police officer who said he has worked undercover in gangs linked to the Bandidos, said the fight appeared to have started as turf war between the Cossacks and the Bandidos. Citing police sources, he told the Washington Post that he understood the shootout started because the Cossacks, backed by the Hells Angels, had challenged the Bandidos for control of Texas.
Twin Peaks involvement
Twin Peaks and Waco police are at odds over their versions of events. Twin Peaks local franchise owner said on Sunday night that they had been cooperating with polices investigation and had had ongoing, positive communications with police. Swanton later addressed those comments, calling them a fabrication and saying that police had attempted to get the local management to assist but that they would not cooperate.
The restaurant had hosted biker groups in the past, police said. Weve been here over the past two months because of the problems weve had with biker gangs here at Twin Peaks, Swanton said. We have attempted to work with local management of Twin Peaks to no avail. They have continued to allow these bikers to gather here and this is the culmination of what has occurred.

When Ramadi was last overrun by jihadis nine years ago, the rest of Iraq slid rapidly into chaos. Now Iraqis are trying to come to terms with the fall of the city for a second time, with some predicting that this loss may prove even more catastrophic.
Islamic State took full control of Ramadi on Sunday night after Iraqi federal troops and police officers withdrew from the last government compounds and bases they had held since the militants stormed towards them on Friday .
Outgunned though far from outmanned, up to 1,000 soldiers and officers were seen streaming from the city to a nearby highway, in scenes reminiscent of the fall of Mosul a year ago . This was Isiss biggest triumph since then  a victory that belied claims that it was withering in the face of relentless air strikes and that Iraqs military had learned how to hold its ground.

Iraqi troops retreat from Ramadi
The rout left government officials reeling. By early Monday, ministers and paramilitary leaders were mobilising Shia militias to travel from Baghdad to take on the estimated 400 Isis fighters now in control of the city. Such was the speed of events that the prospect of Shia fighters being sent to the predominantly Sunni Anbar province met with little hostility from Ramadi residents, who until this week had disavowed the role that militias had played in the fighting elsewhere in the country.
The ones to be blamed for this are the government and the local authorities in Ramadi, said Saleh Eraqi, a police colonel who fled on Sunday after his brother was killed in the fighting. The army dont have the fighting spirit. They were there waiting for Isis to attack. They are poorly equipped comparing to Isis. We are fighting with guns and pistols while Isis have Humvees and IEDs and suicide bombers.
There are many Sunnis inside the city who want to fight Isis but they dont have the weapons. Our only hope is that we can get real support from the Americans.
Eraqi said the Shia militias, known as Hashd al-Shaabi, or the popular mobilisation units, faced an enormous challenge in winning back the city as Isis members stream towards it from elsewhere in Anbar province.
The Hashd al-Shaabi cant do it, he said. They will suffer huge losses. I saw Isis fighting; they were more than 250, most of them Iraqis with some foreigners, and they had support from sleeper cells inside the city. We fought them from 12 in the morning till 4pm but we almost ran out of weapons and had to withdraw.
Ramadi, which sits on both the Euphrates river and a highway connecting Baghdad to the Jordanian and Syrian borders, has been the centre of gravity in Anbar province throughout the past 12 years of war and insurrection. It was a hub for foreign fighters crossing from Syria from 2003-07 and, over the past year, it has been contested by government forces and militants who have crept towards the city from Iraqs western deserts.
Sunni tribal leaders were instrumental in protecting the city, just as they were in 2006 during a crucial phase of the US occupation in which Ramadi tribes rose up against the Islamic State of Iraq, an earlier incarnation of Isis, ousting the group from their midst with the support of US ground forces.
But since then, some Sunni communities in Ramadi and Fallujah have been central to claims that Iraqs post-US governments have pursued sectarian policies that benefit the majority Shias.
Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Bahari, a tribal leader whose members were involved in the battles at the weekend, said the loss of the city was a reflection of a decade of neglect both by the Shia-dominated central government and by exiled Sunni tribal leaders.
We are exhausted, we want security and to be able to walk in our streets, he said. We are tired, we want peace, we want to live, and the government is run by thieves and ignorant people. I know most of the decision-makers in Anbar who pretended to be tribal leaders. They used to be shoeless and now they own streets in Jordan. They are sitting outside Anbar in Baghdad, Irbil, Jordan or Dubai and deciding our future by [the messaging service] Viber.
We are not welcoming Hashd in our city. We wont fight them if they enter, but we are emotionally against them. They are an ethnic militia who will treat us badly.
The Hashd al-Shaabi think they can win Ramadi as quickly they won Salaheddine [the province surrounding Tikrit] but thats a lie because Salaheddine is small compared to Ramadi. It was surrounded by other areas which they had already won, while Ramadi is a big city and is surrounded by desert.
Shia militias led government troops in a successful battle to reclaim Saddam Husseins home town of Tikrit in late March.
Along the way, though, the militias have faced persistent claims that some members have pursued sectarian agendas and committed abuses against some Sunni communities. While Hashd al-Shabi has struck alliances with some Sunni tribes near Tikrit, it is distrusted by Sunni residents in Diyyala province, north of Baghdad, who claim its fighters are answerable to no state authority.

Hakim Zamili, a member of the Iraqi parliaments defence committee and leader of the Salam Brigades, a Shia militia, said other Anbar tribes had been more circumspect about militias being sent to replace the vanquished national army.
I have just finished a meeting with the leaders of Hashd al-Shaabi, Iraqi generals and the defence minister and we have put a plan to coordinate the fighting in Ramadi, he said. I have received many requests from the tribe leaders in Anbar asking us to bring the Hashd al-Shaabi to defend them.
Ihsan Shimari, a Baghdad-based political analyst, said the fall of Ramadi was a wakeup call for Iraqi citizens who had been persuaded by the government that the campaign against Isis had been going well, especially since the reclaiming of Tikrit.
Iraqis are easily misled by their emotions and they used to believe in a quick victory, but now they are hit with a harsh reality in Ramadi, he said. Now they believe that the war against Isis will be long and difficult. It took them a long time to understand that brutal reality.
The militias dwarf Iraqs embattled security forces in number and influence. With resolute backing from Iran, they have led the war against Isis since June, regularly taking primacy over Iraqi forces, to whom they readily cede credit for most battlefield successes.
Hashd al-Shaabi  are stronger because they are ideological, said Shimari. They are better organised and some of their brigades even have better weapons than the Iraqi army.
Naim al-Ubaidi, a leader of Asaib ahl al-Haq, one of the militias that plays a leading role under the Hashd al-Shaabi banner, said: The Iraqi government asked us last night to intervene and rescue the city. We know that decision came late and we warned [the prime minister, Haidar] al-Abadi that they wont achieve victory without us, but we know that he was under pressure from the Americans to not let us be involved in this operation.
All the brigades are now gathering their elite fighters to go for the battle in Ramadi and we are expecting the rescue the city within few days. The fighting in Ramadi will be easier for us than the operations in Salaheddine because of the collaboration of the tribes.
Ramadi has fallen under the eyes of the Americans and they havent done anything. This isnt like what happened in Irbil when the Americans intervened there and prevented the fall of Irbil at all costs. This tells us that Iraqis are the ones who should deal with their problems together and get united to fight their enemies.
The US military said it had carried out nine air strikes as Isis advanced and officials in Washington said they were confident that the city could be retaken with their ongoing air support.
If so, that would almost certainly mean that the US would be flying in support of militia forces, rather than the national army. Asaib ahl al-Haq and the Jeish al-Mehdi, both strong allies of Iran, were two of the US militarys most formidable foes from 2006-11, accounting for more than 25% of its casualties, according to figures provided by Washington.
The US relationship with Iraqs Sunnis was at times equally fraught. However, it reached a high point in Anbar in 2007, when a grassroots revolt was amplified by an increased presence of US troops, which curbed violence drastically in Anbar.
Sheik Saddon al-Eifan, from the town of Amriyat al-Fallujah, said: We in Anbar need any help we can get to get rid of Isis. They are attacking every family who fought against them and seeking revenge from everyone. We are now between two bad choices but we prefer the Hashd, and once they kick out Isis from our city we will ask them to leave.
We need the Americans to intervene in our reconciliation like they did before in order to bring us together to fight Isis. We all want to fight but we dont have faith in the Iraqi government and it will take a lot to make us believe in them again.

Qatar's PR efforts on labour scandal backfire with BBC team's detention
Expensive efforts to improve wealthy Gulf states image wasted as repressive instincts win out over modern communications strategy

Professional public relations advice doesnt come cheap and it is a tribute to Qatar that it has invested in one of the best providers in the business, London-based Portland Communications , which began working for the Doha government a year ago for what is widely rumoured to be an eye-watering amount of money.
In per capita terms the Gulf state is the wealthiest country in the world, with vast natural gas reserves, a tiny native population far outstripped by an army of migrant workers and ambitions crowned by its controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup . Its eye-catching global investments  from Harrods to Paris St Germain football club  have been matched by an effort to punch above its weight politically in the Middle East, backing Islamist movements in particular.
Related: Fifa to investigate arrest of BBC news team in Qatar
Yet its recent experience has disproved the old maxim that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The World Cup bid has drawn attention to the appalling conditions in which Asian labourers live and work, while the turmoil of the Arab spring has exposed Qatar to charges of supporting extremist groups fighting in Syria. Neither, to put it mildly, have helped burnish the emirates modern image.
News of the arrest of a BBC team invited to see improvements for foreign workers is damaging too  and will doubtless have the Portland PR team grinding their teeth in frustration. It is ironic that an effort to show that Qatar is responding to complaints from trade unions, the International Labour Organisation and human rights watchdogs such as Amnesty International has backfired so badly.
Qatari officials acknowledge that Guardian coverage of the migrant labour story has been an important spur to change. Abdullah al-Khulaifi, labour minister, told me he had had nightmares as a result and felt unfairly criticised, but was still keen to highlight positive reforms  improved standards of workers accommodation, wage-payment methods and the enforcement of other rules.
The downside is that there is still no timetable for the promised abolition of the controversial kafala (sponsorship) system  which prevents workers from changing jobs for five years and leaves them open to abuse  and doubts about whether the proposed changes amount to much more than cosmetic tinkering or rebranding.
The detention of the BBC journalist Mark Lobel is doubly embarrassing because he had been invited on a press trip that was designed to showcase progress. The Guardian was able to undertake a similar officially arranged tour with Portlands help, but I also managed to visit workers housing in Dohas grim industrial zone without an escort and, happily, without being detained by security personnel.
The story illustrates a wider problem. Under the emir, Sheikh Tamim , who took over after his fathers abdication two years ago, powerful elements of the Qatari government are committed to reform and to a more transparent communications strategy. Others, clearly, are not. It is no coincidence that the kafala system remains the responsibility of the interior ministry, not Khulaifis more image-conscious ministry of labour.
Qatar is no democracy but it does not feel like a police state. Yet following reporters, covertly photographing them and throwing them into prison are not normally used to prevent trespassing  as the government claimed in a professional-looking press release that bore the imprint of Portlands expertise. PR has its uses, up to a point, but it cannot be a substitute for genuine openness.

Is Iran creating its own state within Iraq?
Iranian-backed Shia militias are on the rise in Iraq, but these forces are being brought under Iraqi state control, argue an Iranian and Iraqi expert

Iraq and its security occupy a central part in the debate about a possible nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers. The Gulf Arab states fear that Tehran, boosted by the relaxation of economic sanctions, will try to expand and consolidate its hegemonic grip over the Middle East.
According to this argument, Iranian hegemony will above all affect Iraq, where Tehran seeks to install a government in thrall to it, hindering the formation of a viable democratic system in its western neighbour. The domestic and foreign exponents of this view point to the growing power of Tehran-backed Shia groups fighting the so-called Islamic State (Isis) as proof of attempts to plant an Iranian deep state in Iraq, allegedly similar to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Such concerns are legitimate but exaggerated and even misplaced. Iranian influence is unlikely to produce a state within the Iraqi state, even if some elements in Iran desire it. And this holds regardless of whether the nuclear negotiations are successful or not.
Shia paramilitary forces are undoubtedly on the rise in Iraq, and this may intensify sectarian fault lines. David Petraeus, who commanded US troops in Iraq during 2007-2008, has voiced concerns over reports of sectarian atrocities committed by the Shia Popular Mobilization Units (al-Hashd al-Shabi or PMUs) as well as by Iraqi security forces.
Human Rights Watch has accused the PMUs of looting and destroying Sunni Arabs property. Although PMU commanders have invariably condemned these acts and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice, their recurrence is likely to exacerbate the chronic distrust between Sunni Arabs and the Shia groups that make up the security backbone of the central government in Baghdad.
More worrying for Petraeus and many Arab politicians in the region, however, is the increasing influence of Iranian Revolutionary Guards - especially its overseas arm, the Quds Force - on which the bulk of PMU forces rely for logistical support and advice.
If Daesh [the Arabic acronym for Isis] is driven from Iraq and the consequence is that Iranian-backed militias emerge as the most powerful force in the country - eclipsing the Iraqi security forces, much as Hezbollah does in Lebanon - that would be a very harmful outcome for Iraqi stability and sovereignty, not to mention our own national interests in the region, Petraeus warned in an interview with The Washington Post. John Brennan, director of the CIA, has made similar comments about Irans very aggressive and active role in Iraq.
But this is not the entire picture, and represents a skewed conception of the reality on the ground. There are significant factors in play that undermine prospects for the PMUs becoming a force operating on behalf of Tehran outside the jurisdiction of Baghdad. While most of Iraqs Shia citizens might desire a prosperous and successful Iran next door, it would be an extraordinary stretch of imagination to claim they would favour turning their land into an Iranian satellite state.

The latest outburst of Iraqi nationalism vis--vis Iran came in response to controversial comments on Iranian-Iraqi relations from Ali Younesi, advisor to President Hassan Rouhani on ethnic minorities and a former intelligence minister. Currently, Younesi said , Iraq is not only part of our civilisational influence, but it is our identity, culture , centre and capitalBecause Iran and Iraqs geography and culture are inseparable, either we fight one another or we become one.
Younesis comments drew stringent criticism from Rouhanis rivals in the Iranian parliament where 109 deputies signed a letter demanding his dismissal. Younesi was reportedly summoned to the Special Court for the Clergy, where he was questioned about statements against national security before being released on bail.
But by suggesting an imperial belief in bringing Iraq into the orbit of Iranian civilization, Younesi set off a massive backlash in Iraq not only from Sunni Arab groups and personalities, but also from Shias. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most revered Shia cleric in Iraq, was one who stepped forward in defence of Iraqi autonomy and sovereignty.
We are proud of our country and our identity and our independence and sovereignty, said Ahmad al-Saafi, Sistanis representative, in apparent response to Younesis remarks. While we welcome any help offered today from our brothers and friends in our fight against the terrorists and thank them for that, this doesnt mean in any way that we would ignore our identity and independence.
In their fight against Isis, Shia paramilitary forces derive their religious legitimacy primarily from Sistani as their chief source of emulation and from his fatwa, issued after the groups takeover of Mosul in June 2014, calling on all able Iraqis to take up arms. Ever since, Sistani has consistently maintained that volunteers must operate under Iraqi state command.
By the same token, the PMUs are at the moment organised by a committee affiliated with the Iraqi National Security Advisory (NSA), which is accountable to the prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi. It is hard to believe that all PMU actions and moves are under the scrutiny of Baghdad, but the Iraqi government does maintain a degree of control, providing their salaries and fighting equipment according to the defence minister, Khaled al-Obaidi.
This goes some way to meet demands from Sunnis for the  institutionalisation  of PMUs as a means to bring them under state control. The former deputy prime minister and leading Sunni Arab Rafe al-Issawi, for example, said recently at the Brookings Institution in Washington that some of the militias...[are] out of the total control of the central government...[and] without institutionalisation of paramilitary forces...there will be much more discontent.
Related: What do Iraqis think of Iran?
Given the strength of nationalist sentiment across all Iraqi sects and the broad-based recognition of Sistani as a force for national unity, it will be difficult for Shia PMU groups to form a quasi-state in parallel to the Iraqi government once Isis is dislodged. In the eventuality of such a political outgrowth, the PMUs are bound to lose Sistanis backing, and with it their legitimacy in the eyes of millions of Iraqi Shias who currently support them.
Moreover, PMU leaders and military commanders have so far shown little interest in taking that path. Hadi al-Ameri, the head of Badr Organisation, a long-standing Shia group with close ties to Iranian Revolutionary Guards, envisions a future for PMUs where the Iraqi state has the final say. After Sayyed Sistanis fatwa, we were left with no choice but to take up arms and fight, he told al-Sumaria TV. These are, however, the states arms. The Badr Organization doesnt possess any weapons.
In a similar vein, Qais al-Khazali, leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq  another paramilitary Shia group with sympathies towards Iran  stressed during an interview with al-Ahd television that PMUs were national factions for sure...part of the Iraqi state institutions, and committed to the decisions of the commander-in-chief [the Iraqi prime minister].
While seeing Iran as their major source of strategic depth, Iraqi Shias are reluctant to lose their majority position in the Iraqi state by creating a paramilitary force operating in parallel to the central government. Shia leaders understand these dynamics well, with a consensus emerging that a new National Guard will absorb the PMUs once Isis is done with and Ayatollah Sistanis fatwa expires.
The National Guard is supposed to recruit locally and fall partly under the command of the elected local governments, mainly to assure the Sunni Arabs they will be included in running security. Both Shia and Sunni groups in Iraq are generally driven by a strong sense of nationalism and look forward to the rise of Iraq - given its strategic position, cultural heritage and natural resources - as a regional power on a par with Iran and Saudi Arabia. This is a promising cause that can soften and mature factional politics.

How one NGO exposed contradictions at the heart of Putin's foreign agent law

The human rights group Committee Against Torture has been declared a foreign agent by a Russian judge, who accused the group of trying to change state policy.
Its become a dreaded label for the NGO sector in Russia since Vladimir Putin introduced a law clamping down on organisations who receive funding from abroad.
Related: Harassed and shunned, the Russians labelled foreign agents by Kremlin
But for Committee Against Torture (CAT), the move initiated an perplexing legal process that exposed the contradictions at the heart of the law. By accusing the group of trying to change policy, prosecutors were forced to implicate the state in the use of torture, when it is in fact outlawed in Russia .
In challenging the label , CAT and the court became tangled in a debate  at times leaning on the philosophical  about the hopelessly broad tenets that lie at the centre of the law: over what constitutes state policy and political activity, terms which have been applied in damaging trials against NGOs on a case-by-case basis.
The groups founder, Igor Kalyapin, explained the incongruity of the states accusation to Russian media: By the prosecutors logic, it turns out that state policy is torture in police departments and the covering up of torture by investigative bodies, he said .
The human rights organisation was established in 2000 and aims to raise awareness of torture and degrading treatment in Russia. In the past 15 years it has worked on 120 cases of mistreatment and prompted 655 unlawful decisions to be annulled, organisers say. Its investigations have also resulted in 107 officials in the law enforcement agencies being convicted.
If CAT was undermining state policy by uncovering cases of torture, then torture itself must be state policy
But in December 2014, the prosecutor for the Nizhny Novgorod region, Oleg Panasenko, ordered the organisation to register as a foreign agent, claiming it had tried to change state policy by broadcasting information about its campaigns and activities.
Panasenko accused the human rights advocates of preparing and distributing statements, papers and reports demonstrating torture is a commonplace occurrence in Russian institutions.
In spreading such information, the prosecutor argued it was attempting to attract attention and create negative public sentiment.

Contradictions
The accusations raised an interesting legal paradox: as far as the prosecution was concerned, if the organisation could be deemed to be undermining state policy it followed that torture itself must be state policy. The NGO, by this reckoning, qualified as a foreign agent because it tried to do this with money received from foreign donors.
In court, Kalyapin asked the prosecution: What is state policy regarding the use of torture? Does it aim to diffuse the practice or to eradicate it?
The prosecution replied: State policy is aimed at the eradication [of torture], of course!.
Are you saying that thevictims of torture constitute a social group?
Igor Kalyapin
The opposing sides spent several hours debating the meaning of the term, and a local political scientist, Sergei Ustinkin, was called to give evidence.
Ustinkin concluded that by defending the interest of a specific social group, CAT could indeed be deemed to be engaged in political activity.
Which groups interests do we defend? asked Kalyapin, knowing that the prosecutor was unable to formally recognise victims of state torture as a social group.
Ustinkin tried to avoid answering. Considering that we all have an interest [in seeing that] Russian laws are enforced by members of Russias law enforcement agencies, he said, CAT performs a very important social and legal function. It defends those who have suffered violence at the hands of the Siloviki [politicians from the military or police services].
Kalyapin countered: By your criteria, as far I understand them, to engage in political activity we have to promote the interests of a given social group. Are you saying that victims of torture constitute a social group?
Yes and no  well, yes, Ustinkin said.
Evidence
Kalyapin argued strongly that neither the prosecutors nor the specialist witnesses had put forward a convincing case that CAT was undermining state policy in its investigation and support of victims of torture.
Instead, he said it was the inadequacy of Russias investigative committee  and its reports on the use of torture  which were at fault.
Torture is outlawed in Russia, but it is not explicitly defined in the countrys legal code and was traditionally prosecuted under article 286, Abuse of power, and article 302, Coercion to give evidence. Amnesty International says abuse and degrading treatment is routine in Russias prison and police detention.
On the basis of his NGOs appeals, Kalyapin said that Russian judges had annulled more than 700 unlawful rulings by the investigative committee and prosecutors, who had refused to initiate criminal proceedings relating to torture. It was therefore the judges, he argued, not CAT who were making decisions that criticised state policy.
More than 100 of those rulings were overturned in the very court room Kalyapin was defending his organisation: It is this court itself which offers a negative assessment of the prosecutors and investigative authorities, he argued, not CAT.
Related: Russia raids human rights groups in crackdown on 'foreign agents'
Kalyapin claimed his organisations objective was not to change policy, but to ensure that it was implemented effectively.
But the Russian courts had given him an ultimatum, he said: Either I stop doing what Im doing, or [the court] will charge Committee Against Torture on the grounds that I, as its head, am engaged in politics. That is absurd.
Once labelled as foreign agents , organisations often struggle to gain access to government officials and public institutions. NGOs are also required to mark their publications with the term, and start any oral statement with a disclosure that it is being delivered by a foreign agent.
CAT wouldnt survive these restrictions, Kalyapin said, and the result of the ruling would ultimately be the organisations destruction, he concluded.
The legal process is ongoing: CAT are appealing against the judges decision, and the organisations work continues. This week the group announced it would challenge the investigative committees refusal to allow one of its lawyers to consult Dadaev Zaur , suspected of killing opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, about the maltreatment he is allegedly receiving while in police custody.

When is a campaign not a campaign? When it's a Super Pac
Nominally independent committees that can raise unlimited amounts for their preferred candidate are set to play a huge role in the 2016 presidential election

These days, presidential candidates are not just raising money for their own campaigns. They are also raising money for outside groups with generic sounding names like Priorities USA, Right to Rise and Our American Renewal.
These are Super Pacs (political action committees), affiliated with each outside campaign but nominally independent. In 2012, they were helpful appendages. This year, heading into 2016, they are becoming fully fledged substitutes for campaigns, taking over functions including opposition research, polling and even knocking on doors.
Super Pacs are just five years old. Like most developments in modern campaign finance law, they were created by accident through judicial decisions, not by legislation.
First, in 2010 the Citizens United supreme court decision struck down restrictions on independent expenditures in campaigns by nonprofits. Citizens United was followed the same year by a decision by the DC circuit court of appeals in a case called SpeechNOW , which said political groups that sought to make only independent expenditures could not be subject to federal campaign contribution limits.
These two decisions combined to create super versions of previously existing political action committees, that would make expenditures independently of the candidates they supported and thus could raise as much money as they wanted. In other words, one donor can fund an entire Super Pac.
In the 2012 Republican primary , Super Pacs were credited with keeping the campaigns of Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum alive for months, extending the race into the spring.
In that race and the general election that followed, Super Pacs were primarily used to run television ads. American campaigns have long focused on saturating the airwaves with advertisements; Super Pacs provided a new vehicle to air even more commercials. Campaigns, however, still have major advantages over Super Pacs when it comes to buying television time.
Within 60 days of a general election or 45 days of a primary, political campaigns are entitled to something called lowest unit rate. It means that a political campaign gets the lowest rate a television station offers to any advertiser, and it is coupled with the requirement that stations give political campaigns reasonable access to run ads. Lowest unit rate also means TV stations cannot censor or restrict ads that federal campaigns seek to run.
None of these rules apply to Super Pacs. This means that they have to pay a much higher rate per ad and may find it more difficult to get their advertisements on television.
However, all such advantages for campaigns pale next to the fact that Super Pacs can raised unlimited money from an individual donor. Federal campaigns can only take $5,400 from any individual ($2,700 for a primary election and another $2,700 for a general election). So while campaigns can get more value for their money when spending on advertising, Super Pacs dont have to worry too much about value.
And this year, they are not worrying too much about just running television ads.
A bipartisan matter

The nascent campaign of Jeb Bush has been entirely headquartered out of an organization called Right to Rise. The group is on pace to raise more than $100m in May alone and is expected to be significantly better-funded than Bushs inevitable presidential campaign.
Bush has also set up a connected nonprofit , Right to Rise Policy Solutions, which is serving as a parking place for campaign policy advisers until the former Florida governor announces his candidacy.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Right to Rise is that it is expected to be led by Bushs top political adviser, Mike Murphy. Because Super Pacs cannot coordinate with campaigns, this means that Bush will probably be unable to communicate with Murphy for the duration of the campaign.
While Bush has yet to declare his candidacy, Ted Cruz, who has announced his bid for the White House, has also bragged about the success of the four interrelated Super Pacs that are backing his campaign.
In a speech at the April meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas, the Texas senator boasted that a Super Pac supporting him had raised $31m in the first week of his campaign. Thats more money than any other Super Pac has raised  in the history of politics in a comparable period, he said.
Each of the four Super Pacs supporting Cruz is funded entirely by one major donor and devoted to one specific campaign task.
Nor are Republicans alone in such activity. Hillary Clinton, the clear Democratic frontrunner for 2016, is holding a number of fundraisers for one of her affiliated Super Pacs, Priorities USA. A separate group, Correct the Record, has spun off from the Democratic research Super Pac American Bridge, solely to do rapid response for Clinton.
Correct the Record insists it will be able to coordinate with the Clinton campaign, despite taking unlimited contributions, because it will not run any ads on her behalf.
Not all of this may end up being legal. But as Rick Hasen, an election law expert who teaches at University of California, Irvine, points out, even if some of these things dont pass muster with the courts, such matters probably wont be resolved until after the 2016 election.
Furthermore, campaign finance may have changed dramatically by the time such legal issues are resolved.
Nothing is permanent when it comes to campaign finance, said Hasen.
For now, though, the landscape is dominated by Super Pacs.
