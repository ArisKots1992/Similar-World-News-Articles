        <MainBody>ECB MAINTAINS EMERGENCY FUNDING BUT DOESN'T RAISE IT

Its official, the European Central Bank has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity support on offer to Greece, but it has also not provided any extra help.
In a statement, the ECB says that it has decided to maintain the ELA ceiling at Fridays limit (thats 89bn).
So it hasnt pulled the plug, but it also hasnt provided extra funding to cover the funds that have flowed out of Greek banks this weekend.
For weeks, the ECB has been agreeing to requests from Greece for extra emergency liquidity, often providing a billions euros or more each week.
So if theres no extra ELA, that is going to make it harder for banks to handle withdrawals, if people keep taking money out.
Heres the full statement:
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank today welcomed the commitment by ministers from euro area Member States to take all necessary measures to further improve the resilience of euro area economies and to stand ready to take decisive steps to strengthen Economic and Monetary Union.
Following the decision by the Greek authorities to hold a referendum and the non-prolongation of the EU adjustment programme for Greece, the Governing Council declared it will work closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability.
Given the current circumstances, the Governing Council decided to maintain the ceiling to the provision of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greek banks at the level decided on Friday (26 June 2015).
The Governing Council stands ready to reconsider its decision.
Mario Draghi, ECB President, said:
We continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro area economies.
Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, said:
The Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.
The Governing Council is closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council is determined to use all the instruments available within its mandate.

        <title>Kuwait mosque attack: suicide bomber identified as Saudi citizen</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/kuwait-mosque-suicide-bomber-identified-saudi-citizen-fahad-suleiman-abdulmohsen-al-gabbaa</Link>

Kuwaiti authorities have identified the suicide bomber behind an attack on a Shia mosque that killed 27 people as a Saudi citizen who arrived in the country just hours before he blew himself up.
The interior ministry named the bomber as Fahad Suleiman Abdulmohsen al-Gabbaa and said he was born in 1992. It said in a statement carried by the official Kuwait News Agency that he arrived on a flight to Kuwait International airport at dawn on Friday.
Police have begun making arrests in connection with Fridays bombing, which took place at one of Kuwaits oldest Shia mosques during midday prayers. An affiliate of the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the blast in the normally peaceful oil-rich nation.
Authorities also said they had arrested a 25-year-old from Kuwaits Bidoon community, identified as Abdulrahman Sabah Eidan Saud, who they say drove the car that brought the bomber to the mosque.
The Bidoon are descendants of desert nomads and others considered stateless by the government. They have long claimed the government deprives them of citizenship and rights.
A Kuwaiti man who housed the driver was also taken into custody. The interior ministry described him as a follower of fundamentalist and deviant ideology.
The government-linked al-Jarida newspaper reported that at least seven suspects had been detained in connection with the attack, which has been condemned by Sunni groups in Kuwait and leaders across the Middle East.
Officials say 227 people were wounded in the attack.
A local affiliate of the Islamic State group calling itself the Najd Province has claimed responsibility for the bombing. The IS group considers Shias to be heretics and is fighting Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq and Syria.
More than a third of Kuwaits 1.2 million citizens are believed to be Shia.

        <title>Theresa May: no evidence Tunisia gunman targeted Britons</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/28/theresa-may-tunisia-gunman-did-not-target-britons-andrew-marr</Link>
        <Description/>

The home secretary, Theresa May, has said there is no evidence that the gunman who shot dead 38 people on a Tunisian beach specifically targeted British tourists, as she warned that the confirmed death toll of 15 Britons was likely to rise .
May, who chaired a meeting of the governments Cobra security committee on Sunday morning, also said the government had sent a medical liaison team to the coastal resort of Sousse to assist injured Britons, and was expanding a unit sent to examine security around similar tourist sites in Tunisia .
The prime minister, David Cameron, has asked for flags over Downing Street to be flown at half-mast in memory of the victims.
Thousands of British tourists were preparing to fly home following the massacre on Friday, during which student Seifeddine Rezgui walked down the beach and into a hotel firing a Kalashnikov gun. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.

While many reports suggested Rezgui was targeting tourists  Tunisian workers have recounted that he ordered them to run away  May told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show that she did not believe Britons were singled out.
As youll appreciate, this is still an ongoing investigation and were working very closely with the Tunisian authorities in relation to this, she said. Ive seen no evidence so far that this was targeted because there were British tourists there.
She added: But if course we must recognise that this is the most significant loss of British life in a terrorist attack since 7/7 in the UK.
The confirmed total of 15 British dead remained the same, May said. But we are expecting that to rise.

May said security warnings would remain constant for the time being. She said, however, that it could be difficult to prevent such future terrorism attacks.
The threat has become more diverse over time, she said. Thats why its important for us to sustain the counter-terrorism capabilities of the agencies. We have not just those who will plot for some time, perhaps in a group, to plot a complex attack, but also the possibility of more spontaneous attacks, so-called lone-wolf attacks.
Speaking to reporters after the Cobra meeting, May said that while consular staff were working around the clock, it may take time to give definitive news to relatives in Britain. The process is a complex one, she said. And it is of course imperative that we get it absolutely right for families, and that can sometimes take time.
The medical team would ensure injured Britons were being properly looked after and assist them in travelling back to the UK, May said. She added: Weve also dispatched a small team to Tunisia to look at protective security arrangements around tourist resorts and weve decided this morning to increase the numbers of that team, and they will be assessing any extra requirements in relation to security on the ground.
Holiday firm Tui, meanwhile, which owns Thomson and First Choice, said it was flying people back to the UK on 12 planes leaving Enfidha airport, about 25 miles from Sousse.
It asked for customers to bear with us amid a hugely challenging situation. A company statement read: Those affected by the tragic events in Tunisia are our main priority and we will continue to do all we can to support our customers as well as their family and friends in resort at this exceptionally difficult time.
We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the friends and families of those involved in this tragic event. The whole of Thomson and First Choice are deeply shocked and truly saddened by the events and we are grateful to our staff on the ground and in the air and the emergency services who are working hard in an incredibly challenging environment.
More details emerged about the confirmed victims , who also include people from Ireland, Germany and Belgium. Among the British dead are known to be three generations of the same family: 19-year-old student Joel Richards, his uncle Adrian Evans, 49, a gas services manager from Tipton in the West Midlands, and his grandfather. Owen Richards, Joels 16-year-old brother, survived the attack.
Also confirmed killed were Carly Lovett, 24, a photographer and beauty blogger, and a couple in their 40s, Sue Davey and Scott Chalkley, as well as Lisa Burbridge from Whickham, Gateshead, and Jim and Ann McQuire from Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire,
Another victim, Trudy Jones, from Blackwood in Gwent, south Wales, was named by her local MP, Chris Evans.
Three Irish nationals are confirmed killed: Lorna Carty, a nurse from Robinstown, Co Meath; and Laurence and Martina Hayes, a couple in their 50s from Co Westmeath.
While official travel advice for Britons heading to Tunisia remained unchanged, the Foreign Office warned that further attacks were possible, including by individuals who are unknown to the authorities and whose actions are inspired by terrorist groups via social media.
British police have joined UK embassy and Foreign Office teams at the resort to help identify victims.

More details have emerged of the attack. The Washington Post recounted witnesses as saying Rezgui paused at one point to wash his hands and face in the sea, then turned to Tunisian hotel staff who were trying to drag away injured tourists. He fired his Kalashnikov into the air and yelled, Run! Get away! Im not here to kill you! Ibrahim Ghrib, 23, a lifeguard, told the paper.
Another young Tunisian man told AFP that the gunman shouted at him and other locals: The terrorist told us: Stay away, I didnt come for you. He did not fire at us  he fired at the tourists.
One Tunisian builder said he helped stop the attack by knocking over the attacker with tiles thrown from the roof, allowing police to shoot him. The man told Channel 4 News he saw Rezgui escape down an alleyway after the shooting and threw the tiles, yelling: You terrorist, you dog. Rezgui fell to the floor, and got up shooting wildly, allowing police to catch him, he said.
On Saturday evening, tourists joined local people for a candlelit vigil. Some people held posters saying Peace and Sousse will never die.
It is the second major attack in Tunisia this year. In March, 21 people, mainly tourists, died when an Islamist-inspired gunman fired at visitors arriving at the Bardo Museum in Tunis.
Tunisias tourism minister called Fridays attack a catastrophe and authorities vowed to toughen security.

        <title>French terrorism attack: suspect took selfie with severed head</title>

The main suspect in the beheading of a businessman that French authorities are calling a terrorist attack took a selfie with the victim and sent the image via WhatsApp to a Canadian mobile phone number, officials said on Saturday.
French investigators were working to determine the recipients identity, but werent able to immediately confirm media reports that it was an unspecified person now in Syria, where the Islamic State has seized territory, security officials said.
Related: French terrorist attack: mystery of calm and gentle man who beheaded his boss
The revelation added to an investigation that has not turned up a solid link to radical or foreign groups, but has revived concerns about terrorism in France less than six months after deadly attacks in Paris .
Top suspect Yassin Salhi , a truck driver with a history of radical Islamic ties, and his sister and wife remained in police custody in the city of Lyon, a day after he allegedly crashed a truck into a US-owned chemical warehouse and hung his employers severed head on a factory gate, officials said.
One of the officials said the selfie was forwarded via WhatsApp, the popular instant messaging system, to a phone number in Canada . The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.
Jean-Christophe de Le Rue, a spokesman for Canadas public safety minister, confirmed Canadian authorities were involved in the case.
While I cannot comment on operational matters of national security, we are assisting the French authorities with their investigation, he said.
He declined to comment further on details of the investigation.
No group immediately claimed responsibility. The severed head appeared to mimic Isiss practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads, and came days after the militants urged attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. French authorities said Salhi had had links to radical Salafists in the past.
Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors office, said the leading suspect began speaking to investigators after first refusing to do so. She declined to provide details, but said investigators had not found any foreign connection.
The site of the beheading wasnt yet known to investigators, and the victim had been strangled beforehand, she said.
A fourth person arrested Friday was released without being charged. Under French anti-terrorism laws, Salhi and the women can be held for up to four days before either being released or handed preliminary charges.
The office of the French president, Francois Hollande , said he would convene a meeting with top parliamentary leaders about the matter on Tuesday.
Separately on Saturday, hundreds of people turned out in the region to honour businessman Herv Cornara and denounce the violence. Dozens turned out for a minute of silence in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, the town south-east of Lyon where Fridays attack took place at an Air Products chemicals warehouse.
Several hundred people also gathered outside a housing project in the town of Fontaines-sur-Saone to honour Cornara, 54, the manager of a transportation company that had employed Salhi since March. They recalled a kind, humble man who was active in the community of the Lyon suburb.
He lived on the fifth floor, me on the fourth. He spoke with all the young people in the neighborhood. He didnt differentiate between [non-Muslim] French and Muslims, said Leila Bouri, a 24-year-old cafeteria cashier. If you ever had a problem, you would go see him.
When I heard this, I was shocked. Its shameful, she said. I am a Muslim, but you cant kill like this. Its not who we are. In Islam , were not told to slit throats. We only slit the throats of sheep. You dont slit the throats of people.
The suspected killer, she added, isnt a Muslim in my opinion.

A coach driver from Northern Ireland has been killed and his assistant seriously injured after the vehicle carrying pupils and staff from Brentwood school in Essex crashed in Belgium .
One child is in intensive care in hospital after suffering a head injury, a spokesman for the school said.
The coach, which was carrying 34 schoolchildren and their teachers on a language trip, overturned on the A18/E40 motorway that runs to the Channel ferry ports and Channel tunnel, trapping the passengers for a short period.
It is understood that all passengers have now been rescued, and that three pupils and two teachers were taken hospital. Those who escaped injury were taken to a nearby swimming pool.
The children are believed to be year seven and eight pupils. They were setting out on a four-day trip and had left the school at 4am on Sunday.
The accident happened near the town on Middelkerke in West Flanders at 9.45am local time (8.45am BST). A major rescue operation was mounted and the road closed. Pictures showed the bus lying on its side.
The scene of the coach crash in Belgium
Unconfirmed eyewitness reports suggest the bus crashed into the central reservation and then into a pillar of a bridge.
The vehicle belonged to Richmond Coaches, based in Lisburn, County Antrim. A man who answered the firms out-of-hours line described the crash as an awful tragedy, according to the Daily Mirror . I can confirm that it was one of our coaches. We are working with the authorities, he said. Obviously it is an awful time for both families and the coach firm staff.
The tour was organised by the NST group, a company that organises school trips.
A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was aware of the crash and was working with the Belgian authorities to establish further details.

A man has been found dead at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford.
The 44-year-old, who was working at the site, was discovered unresponsive by police at 7.30am on Sunday after reports of a person having fallen from the stadium.
Ambulances attended but the man was pronounced dead shortly before 8am. His death is being treated as unexplained.
Scotland Yard has not named the man but said he was a sub-contractor working at the venue. Officers believe they know his identity and are trying to trace his next of kin.
The Olympic Stadium is being transformed into a venue for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in September before becoming the permanent home of West Ham United football club from 2016.
Balfour Beatty , the construction company managing the site, said: We can confirm there has been a fatality at the former Olympic Stadium site this morning. We are working with the relevant authorities whilst a full investigation is carried out. All work on site has been stopped.
Our thoughts are with the individuals family, friends and colleagues.
David Goldstone, the chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation , said: We are devastated to hear of the death at the stadium this morning and our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at this time.
As yet, the exact cause of death is unexplained, but we have stopped all work on site and will cooperate fully with the emergency services and all other relevant authorities on their investigations. We will also be conducting our own thorough examination of events.

New York police close in on remaining escaped prisoner

Officers scouring dense and boggy woods for a killer who has been on the run for three weeks since escaping from a New York state prison have used floodlights to help their search area overnight.
Police carrying rifles manned checkpoints and searched vehicles in their hunt for David Sweat. The Franklin County sheriff, Kevin Mulverhill, said late on Saturday that tips continued to pour in and he was optimistic Sweat would be captured, perhaps within 48 hours.
Its going to be one of those phone calls that turns this case around, he said.
Richard Matt  who once vowed never to be taken alive  was shot dead on Friday during an encounter with border patrol agents about 30 miles (48km) west of the prison from which he escaped with Sweat on 6 June. Sweat remained at large on Sunday, with a 1,200-strong search party focused intensely on 22 square miles (56 sq km) of thick forests and heavy brush near where Matt was killed.

Police hoped the solo escapee would finally succumb to the stress of little sleep, scant food and biting bugs. Anyone in the woods and on the run from the law so to speak is not getting a full eight hours sleep, theyre not eating well and they have to keep moving, Mulverhill said. Hes fatigued, tired, and hes going to make a mistake.
Sweat could have an even tougher time now without someone to take turns resting with and to watch his back, the Clinton County sheriff, David Favro, said. Now its a one-man show and it makes it more difficult for him. And Im sure fatigue is setting in for him as well, knowing the guy he was with has already been shot.
The breakthrough in the manhunt happened on Friday afternoon when somebody towing a camper heard a loud noise and thought a tyre had blown. Finding there was no flat, the driver drove eight miles before looking again and finding a bullet hole in the trailer. A tactical team responding to the scene of the shot smelled gunpowder inside a cabin and saw evidence that someone had fled out of the back door.
A noise  perhaps a cough  ultimately led to the discovery. A border patrol team discovered Matt, who was shot after failing to heed a command to raise his hands. He had a 20-gauge shotgun that was believed to have been taken from another cabin. The pair had apparently been relying on the remote regions many hunting camps and seasonal dwellings for supplies.
Matt, who turned 49 the day before he died, was serving 25 years to life at Clinton correctional facility for the killing and dismemberment of his former boss. Local residents were relieved that one killer was no longer roaming the woods, but the constant commotion of speeding police cruisers and helicopters pointed to the continued danger.
Half the threat is taken care of, but obviously David Sweat is on the loose, said Matt Maguire, who was waiting for a police escort to pick up some clothes from his house inside the search area. Maguire and his fiancee decided a week ago to stay with nearby relatives.
Sweat, 35, was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriffs deputy in Broome County in 2002. Mulverhill said investigators believe he may be armed.
Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, made a hole in a 2ft-thick brick wall, squeezed through pipes and emerged from a manhole outside the prison.
While there have been no confirmed sightings of Sweat, police said investigators saw a second set of tracks near where Matt was shot.
Ultimately, how the chase ends is up to Sweat, Mulverhill said. If hes willing to surrender to law enforcement then well place him in handcuffs and well bring him back into custody, he said. If he chooses to resist or he chooses not to comply, then the results are his.

Nearly 500 people have been injured, 141 seriously, after a fire on a music stage spread into a crowd of spectators at a party Saturday night at a Taiwan water park, authorities said.
The fire was sparked by an accidental explosion of an unknown powder near the stage in front of about 1,000 people, said Wang Wei-sheng, a liaison with the New Taipei city fire department command centre.
Taiwans Central News Agency on Sunday reported 474 had been injured, including 141 in serious condition. It quoted the New Taipei City health bureau. The injured included four mainland Chinese and two foreigners.
A spokesman for the New Taipei City fire department said: Our initial understanding is this explosion and fire ... was caused by the powder spray. It could have been due to the heat of the lights on the stage.
The fire erupted at the Formosa water park in New Taipei City near the islands capital and was quickly brought under control.
Video showed rescue workers and bystanders carrying burned and injured people on their backs, in inflatable boats and on stretchers to get medical treatment.
CNA reported witnesses as saying the fire spread quickly after the coloured powder was blown into the air.
One male witness told local news channel CTI: It started on the left side of the stage. At the beginning, I thought it was part of the special effects of the party but then I realised there was something wrong and people started screaming and running.

Dazed victims were carried from the site on inflatable rubber rings and others were lying on inflatable water toys with bystanders pouring water over them from plastic bottles.
Authorities said ambulances had struggled to get near to the site and had to send in emergency workers with stretchers.
We feel sad and regretful about the accident, New Taipeis mayor, Eric Chu, said. He said extra doctors had been called in to help treat the victims.
Ive ordered the park to shut down immediately and be placed under a rigorous investigation, he said.
It wasnt clear if the colored powder was part of a performance.

        <title>Puerto Rico in crisis: weighed down by $73bn debt as unemployment hits 14%</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/puerto-rico-debt-unemployment</Link>
        <Description/>

Viewed during a drive along the northeast region of Puerto Rico , the Caribbean landscape, usually a festival of lush greenery, is dotted with trees withering from a month-long drought. Dust blown from the Sahara in northern Africa has dulled the bright sun with a haze that shrouds everything in uncharacteristic gray.
The darkening skies mirror the bleak outlook of an island that US law calls a unincorporated territory and others call one of the worlds last colonies. Puerto Rico is floundering under $73bn in debt and a rapidly deteriorating ability to pay.
The unemployment rate is hovering at 14%. There has been a surge in violent crime. A health care crisis has seen doctors leave the island at a rate approaching 500 per year and the government is discussing an 11% cut to Medicare and Medicaid services in 2016. There has been a wave of school closures. No wonder, then, that upwards of 200,000 people have left in the last 10 years.
What I see is a generalized feeling of stagnation, said Universidad del Este politics professor Manuel Almeida, who struggles with how long he can afford to continue living on the island of his birth with his wife and child. We dont know where were going.
More bad news seems to come every day to Puerto Rico, but in the US the drama is hardly acknowledged outside of the business press. This week government bonds fell to a seven-week low after David Chafey, chairman of the Puerto Rico-owned Government Development Bank, resigned for personal reasons, creating a power vacuum as concerns mount over whether the islands electric power authority will be able to make a 1 July bond payment.
The current debt crisis is largely assumed to have resulted from years of irresponsible borrowing by the Puerto Rican government, as if it were a consumer using one credit card to pay off another. But the US government deserves a considerable share of the blame. The Jones Act that gave Puerto Ricans US citizenship in 1917 in effect made Puerto Rico a US dependent. Puerto Ricos government cannot make trade agreements with other countries. No trading ships can dock in its ports without flying the American flag.
The islands economy began to falter with the recessions caused by the oil crisis of the 1970s. In response, the tax code was amended and US businesses were allowed to eliminate taxes on profits made in Puerto Rico. But in 1996 a 10-year phase-out of the tax break began. Its end signaled the beginning of a 2006 recession that island economists are now calling a depression.
The government had already begun borrowing in the 1970s and unemployment grew as multinationals left the island to pursue lower wages after the implementation of North America Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s, and a construction bubble driven by infrastructure spending in the early 2000s collapsed. The borrowing accelerated, and now the ratio of debt to Gross Domestic Product  the broadest measure of a countrys economy  is a little over 100%, making it unsustainable.
Wall Street firms have also played a part in exacerbating the crisis. Recent credit downgrades allowed Wall Street to demand hundreds of millions more in short-term lending fees, credit-default-swap termination fees, and higher interest rates. Between 2006 and 2013, Puerto Rico raised $62bn in bonds, generating $1.4bn in fees for Wall Street banks and lawyers, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal . The island has more municipal debt per capita than any US state.
Puerto Ricos territorial status has helped trigger the crisis in the sense that its bonds are triple-tax exempt, the case in all municipal bonds issued by US territories. This attracted hedge funds and the more sinister vulture fund speculators that specialize in high-risk bonds for a big payoff in the end.
But since Puerto Rico, as a territory, cannot declare bankruptcy, vulture funds, which own about 24% of the debt, have taken a hard line on any attempt by the government to restructure the debt.
As the European Central Bank began bailing out Greece and other troubled economies, the vulture funds began to move to Puerto Rico, said Hereiberto Martnez Otero, economic adviser to two House representatives. He said that their insistence on repayment in full is dubious considering they knew the bonds were high risk when they made the investment.
A proposal by Puerto Ricos Fundacin Francisco Carvajal suggests that the Federal Reserve Act can allow the Fed to buy up many of these bonds in a way that would not be considered a bailout per se. It would be a much-needed injection of liquidity. If they gave $85bn to AIG, why not $4bn to Puerto Rico? said Juan Aponte, who helped author the just-published report. Still, default is imminent by the fall, University of Puerto Rico economist Argeo Quiones Prez insists. This is going to wind up in federal court, he said.
Even in the best-case scenario, debt restructuring will most likely require further painful austerity, something already carried out through the recent passage of an 11.5% sales tax, higher than any state in the union, and further cuts in government jobs. We have already seen that these austerity policies have had a worsening effect on peripheral economies, said Martnez.
Meanwhile, Puerto Ricos middle-class experiment seems to be dying a slow, painful death, with depopulation and disinvestment leading to greater inequality and a vacuum for further privatization. A bustling caf called Latte Que Latte in San Juans business district was started by local entrepreneurs who wanted to find a way to stay on the island by creating a niche business that serves artisanal coffee and pastries to millennials who, for the moment, feel compelled not to flee their homeland.
Yet one of the caf workers, 57-year-old Jess Santana, can trace his own history of circular migration, back and forth to the mainland, as a constant through generations. Ive been back and forth to the mainland three times already, he said. Whats different now is people who are leaving have no choice. People have lost their homes and cars. I feel terrible about my friends having to leave, but I want to stay, and for the moment, I still can.

She is one of the worlds most high-profile social activists and a ferocious critic of 21st-century capitalism. He is one of the popes most senior aides and a professor of climate change economics. But this week the secular radical will join forces with the Catholic cardinal in the latest move by Pope Francis to shift the debate on global warming.
Naomi Klein and Cardinal Peter Turkson are to lead a high-level conference on the environment, bringing together churchmen, scientists and activists to debate climate change action. Klein, who campaigns for an overhaul of the global financial system to tackle climate change, told the Observer she was surprised but delighted to receive the invitation from Turksons office.
The fact that they invited me indicates theyre not backing down from the fight. A lot of people have patted the pope on the head, but said hes wrong on the economics. I think hes right on the economics, she said, referring to Pope Franciss recent publication of an encyclical on the environment.
Release of the document earlier this month thrust the pontiff to the centre of the global debate on climate change, as he berated politicians for creating a system that serves wealthy countries at the expense of the poorest.
Activists and religious leaders will gather in Rome on Sunday, marching through the Eternal City before the Vatican welcomes campaigners to the conference, which will focus on the UNs impending climate change summit.
Protesters have chosen the French embassy as their starting point  a Renaissance palace famed for its beautiful frescoes, but more significantly a symbol of the United Nations climate change conference, which will be hosted by Paris this December.
Nearly 500 years since Galileo was found guilty of heresy, the Holy See is leading the rallying cry for the world to wake up and listen to scientists on climate change. Multi-faith leaders will walk alongside scientists and campaigners, hailing from organisations including Greenpeace and Oxfam Italy , marching to the Vatican to celebrate the popes tough stance on environmental issues.
The imminent arrival of Klein within the Vatican walls has raised some eyebrows, but the involvement of lay people in church discussions is not without precedent.
Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general , delivered the keynote address at a Vatican summit in April on climate change and poverty. Anticipating the encyclical, he said he was depending on the popes moral voice and moral leadership to speed up action.
When it came to the presentation of the document itself, the pontiff picked a five-strong panel, including a Rome school teacher and a leading scientist. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber , who heads the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, used the time to give churchmen a lesson in climate science.
The pope has upset some conservatives for drawing people from outside the clergy into the heart of the debate, while critics have also argued the Catholic church should not be involved in an issue that should be left to presidents and policy-makers.
But Klein said the popes position as a moral voice in the world  and leader of 1.2 billion Catholics  gives him the unique ability to unite campaigners fighting for a common goal. The holistic view of the encyclical should be a catalyst to bring together the twin economic and climate crises, instead of treating them separately, she said.
Much of the popes discourse focuses on the need to give developing countries a greater voice in climate change negotiations, a view that sits uncomfortably among some in developed nations. There are a lot of people who are having a lot of trouble in realising there is a voice with such global authority from the global south. Thats why were getting this condescending view, of leave the economics to us, said Klein.
She views the rise of Francis as an environmental campaigner as marking a welcome shift not only in the international sphere but also at the Holy See: Were seeing the power base within the Vatican shift, with a Ghanaian cardinal [Turkson] and an Argentine pope. Theyre doing something very brave.
While the upcoming conference is centred on the popes encyclical, delegates will also be looking ahead to decisive international meetings this year. Before the Paris talks comes a UN summit, where states are due to commit to sustainable development goals, which will inevitably affect the environment.
The pope will fly into New York on the first day of the meeting and address the UN general assembly, reinforcing his message and emboldening countries worst affected by climate change.
For Klein, the papal visit will mark a much-needed change in the way negotiators discuss the environment. Theres a way in which UN discourse sanitises the extent to which this is a moral crisis, she said. It cries out for a moral voice.

Police arrest and charge Bree Newsome and helper James Ian Tyson
Protest organiser tells Guardian: The flag represents white supremacy

An activist in South Carolina climbed a flagpole in Columbia early on Saturday morning and removed the Confederate flag flying in front of the capitol building. The womans action came a day after President Barack Obama gave the eulogy for a black pastor who was murdered by an apparent white supremacist along with eight other people in a Charleston church last week.
A woman identified by a protest organizer as Bree Newsome, a 30-year-old youth organizer from Charlotte, North Carolina, climbed the flagpole before 6am and took down the controversial emblem of the antebellum, slaveholding south, with the assistance of another activist. Newsome was halfway up the 30ft pole when police demanded that she climb back down, but she continued upward and removed the flag.
Activist Mervyn Marcano told the Guardian that when Newsome returned to the ground she and James Ian Dyson were arrested by capitol police and taken to a detention center.
Sherri Iacobelli, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Safety, told the Associated Press Newsome and Tyson, 30, also of Charlotte, had been charged with defacing monuments on state capitol grounds, a misdemeanor that carries a fine of up to $5,000 and a prison term of up to three years, or both.
The flag represents white supremacy, said 25-year-old Tamika Lewis, another activist from Charlotte. The image alone is used to ignite fear and intimidation, especially among people of color and minorities.
Taking it down is a long time coming.
Lewis noted that the flag was raised above the capitol in 1961, after African American students marched through the city  and after more than 180 of them were arrested. She said the fact of a rally to support the flag shows theres nothing being hidden about the persistence of racism in America more than half a century later.
This was a Confederate symbol that ignited an individual to kill and murder innocent black people in a church, and it was still erected, she said. The legislature was just taking too long to act morally and justly. Theyre dragging their feet.
Lewis said that the group hopes to secure Newsomes release and to fight for minimal charges against her, and that the act of civil disobedience inspires others to start becoming active agents in their own change.
The activists said they took matters into their own hands because of state leaders lethargic response and apparent reluctance to deal with the issue.
We removed the flag today because we cant wait any longer, Newsome said in a release sent to the Guardian. Its time for a new chapter where we are sincere about dismantling white supremacy and building toward true racial justice and equality.
The flag, which flies at the capitol but not on the building under state law, was raised again shortly after it was lowered, in time for a rally by supporters of the symbol scheduled for later on Saturday.
This week, Republican South Carolina governor Nikki Haley called for the flag to be taken down, in an emotional speech that declared  the time has come . But only the state legislature can mandate its removal. That body voted to debate the flag, but has not yet taken up the issue.

Sepp Blatter says his decision to leave Fifa was liberating and he expects the election to replace him will be in early 2016. In an interview published on Saturday, Blatter explained why, on 2 June, he announced his exit from Fifa amid American and Swiss investigations of corruption in world football. It was the only way to take away the pressure from Fifa and my employees, including [pressure] from the sponsors, Blatter told the Swiss newspaper Walliser Bote. To remove Fifa and me personally from the line of fire.
Blatter was asked hand on heart if he would renege on his promise to go. I am not a candidate, but the elected president, Blatter said in the interview given several days ago. And I want to hand over Fifa in good condition.
That is likely to be in 2016, he suggested, at a special election congress of Fifas 209 member federations in Zurich. Blatter said the realistic date was the beginning of next year, to prepare a four-month election campaign required by Fifa rules and avoid a clash with the Club World Cup. That tournament in Japan is scheduled to take place from 10-20 December.
In his most frank comments since his declaration on 2 June, he reflected on the approaching end of his four decades at Fifa and what lies ahead. I am not yet having many thoughts about this, and am not worrying, he said. The decision to go is definitely liberating. For Fifa and for myself.
He suggested that his final months will be busy, despite many descriptions of him as a lame-duck leader. I am still president of Fifa and fully capable of acting. Fifa and football have been the most important part of my life for 40 years, Blatter said. So I will use all my strength and inspiration up to my last working day to steer the ship back into the safe harbour.
Blatter has pledged to drive through reforms which could be approved at the election congress. The key to this is strengthening democracy in the Fifa government, he said. There should not be a redistribution of the places on the executive committee, but an appropriate expansion of the body.
Blatter said Asia and Africa were not democratically represented on the exco he has chaired as president since 1998. The two continents combine for 100 Fifa members yet have only nine of 25 voting seats on the ruling panel.
Further tensions with Uefa are likely with Europes traditional influence in world football under attack. Blatter won re-election last month despite Uefas president, Michel Platini, urging him to resign. Their face-to-face meeting followed the day after US and Swiss federal cases hit Fifa and top officials with raids in Zurich for separate investigations of alleged corruption. The events of 27 May were an earthquake for football, Blatter acknowledged.
The Swiss investigation focuses on possible money laundering and criminal mismanagement at Fifa, mainly in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process. Switzerlands attorney general, Michael Lauber, has said Blatter is not under suspicion but could be questioned.
The US case alleges bribery in the 2010 World Cup hosting vote and widespread bribery and racketeering implicating senior Fifa officials in organising competitions in North and South America. Seven men among 14 indicted have been detained in Zurich and face extradition to the US. Blatter is a part of the widening investigation, American law enforcement officials have confirmed.
Blatter was not asked whether he is avoiding travel to countries where he risks arrest at the request of American authorities. The Womens World Cup final is played on Sunday 5 July in Vancouver.
Blatter offered one piece of advice to his successor: that he should continue with Fifa development programs which 130 members depend on. Asked if he expected Platini to seek the presidency, Blatter replied: Im not a prophet. Youll have to ask him.

California oil spill cleanup continues as state may allow expanded production
A month after states worst oil leak in decades, the investigation into what went wrong is ongoing. In the meantime, officials are considering a bid to triple output

Just over a month after California experienced its worst oil spill in decades, the state is considering allowing a company to triple its oil production off the coast of Santa Barbara and run the oil through the same pipeline that leaked on 19 May.
Both oil producers Venoco and ExxonMobil had to halt operations in the region this week as crews continued repairing the ruptured pipeline and cleaning the beaches surrounding it. But that didnt stop regulators at the State Lands Commission from holding a hearing for Venoco in Goleta, California.
Local regulators heard a proposal from Venoco to expand their offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. Activists say that expansion would create three times the volume of oil, which would have to be transported through the same Plains All American Pipeline that spilled over 100,000 gallons of oil onto Refugio Beach and its surrounding waters last month.
Outside, dozens of protesters donning hazmat suits carried an inflatable mock-pipeline to voice their concern over increased oil drilling off the California coast.

Were already suffering from the worst spill in decades, said Kristen Monsell, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity and one of the protesters at Wednesdays event. Imagine if that spill had been three times the size. The coastal environment just cant handle another devastating spill.
State senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who will hold a hearing on the Plains Pipeline spill on Friday, also expressed concern.
The public obviously is not very happy about it and the timing is very problematic, she said. Im concerned about expanding oil drilling, period, but Im especially concerned about expanding it before we have answers to the questions about how to make sure this never happens again.
Venoco would not comment on the record for this story, but in a fact sheet stated that its new activity would bring a number of economic and environmental benefits to the state of California.
Because California has a law prohibiting new offshore drilling leases, the Venoco deal would involve a rare lease swap in which the company would give back some of the land it currently uses to California in exchange for the ability to tap into pre-existing but inactive oil wells in another section of ocean. Both sections of ocean are part of the California Coastal Sanctuary.
Venocos statement said the project would provide about $200m in property tax revenue to Santa Barbara County over 30 years and create dozens of new jobs. But activists point out that those increases would come from shipping three times as much oil through the troubled Plains All American Pipeline.

Were not okay with expanding oil operations off our coast, Becca Claassen, an activist with Food and Water Watch, said. We see the land swap as representing an increase and expansion in offshore drilling at the same time were trying to transition away from offshore drilling.
Meanwhile, state regulators are trying to figure out what went wrong on 19 May. The spill coated Refugio Beach in oil slick, which was then washed deep into the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Hundreds of birds were killed along with other marine animals, including dolphins . The beach remains closed while crews finish their clean up.
We are 93% complete, said Eric Laughlin, a spokesperson for the California department of fish and wildlife. But that remaining 7% is going to take a while because its all shoreline, which is more complex to clean up than oil in water water.
State senators held a hearing on Friday to figure out why the Plains pipeline ruptured in the first place.
A test run on the pipeline two weeks before the incident showed that it was deeply flawed , missing 50% of its metal in some sections. But that test wasnt analyzed in time to stop the spill. After the spill, federal regulators said that corrosion had eroded even more than the test had shown: 80% of the pipelines metal in the section where it ruptured was gone.
Igor Mezic, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara, said he didnt believe Plains All American was particularly negligent, though they likely could have used more updated technology to shut off the leak sooner.
There should be an automated system that shuts things off, he said. Things can be done better.
But Mezic also said the activists concerns about Venoco using the same pipeline are overblown.
The drilling and the production is going to continue, he said. Theres no way to stop it and not cause substantial economic damage. And there are methods out there that can make it more safe.
Federal and state investigators are also looking into Plains All Americans response to the disaster. It took the company several hours to notify authorities that the pipeline had ruptured.
Theres a gap of 2.5 to 3.5 hours, depending on who you talk to, state senator Jackson said. The quicker you can contain something, the quicker you can contain the damage. Were going to do what we can to inquire about that.
California senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein along with Massachusetts senator Edward J. Markey, all Democrats, sent a letter late last month to the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration questioning the delay.
Based on this timeline, we are concerned that Plains Pipeline may not have detected this spill or reported it to federal officials as quickly as possible, and that these delays could have exacerbated the extent of the damage to the environment, they wrote.
State attorney general Kamala Harris earlier this month announced her office would investigate the incident and decide whether to pursue criminal charges over the spill. While Harris would not divulge many details about the investigation, she called the revelation that the pipeline had been badly corroded troubling .
Oil that scientists have chemically identified as coming from the Plains pipeline has been found as far as 100 miles away along beaches. And some residents along the coast this week filed a class action lawsuit against Plains All American for damage to their waterfront property.
But activists said any wins in court wouldnt be enough. Theyre using the incident to push their mission to end offshore drilling in California completely.
Ive been checking the beach and there are big globs of oil washing up every day, Claassen said. Its never going to be completely cleaned up. The industry is getting more and more dangerous.

        <title>Greek debt crisis: ECB freezes emergency funding</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-decide-emergency-funding</Link>
        <Description/>

A bank run, public holidays or closures and capital controls looked inevitable in Greece this week after the European Central Bank declined to increase its emergency financial lifeline to the Greek banks, cash that is keeping the countrys financial system functioning.
With Greece holding a controversial referendum on its creditors terms for its bailout in less than a week and the eurozone deciding to terminate the bailout on Tuesday, the pressure was on Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB, to make the call as to whether Greece would sink or swim.
In a finely calibrated decision, the governing council of the ECB decided on Sunday to leave the so-called emergency liquidity assistance to Greece at 89bn, unchanged from last Friday.
We continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece, said Draghi.
Yannis Stournaras, the governor of the Bank of Greece and a member of the ECB council, said: The Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.
The decision to maintain life support supplied a little oxygen to a Greece in the throes of suffocation. On the other hand, no fresh funds were made available while Greeks resorted in ever-increasing numbers to withdraw their savings from ATMs, meaning that bank reserves were running low and not being replenished.
It was one of the the most momentous decisions in the ECBs brief history and came after the Greek parliament upped the stakes when it voted 178 to 120 in favour of holding the referendum proposed by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , on Friday. Embarrassingly for his radical left-led coalition, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party joined it in endorsing the proposal, which has to be approved by Greeces president, Prokopsis Pavlopoulos.
As his debt-laden country edged ever closer to exit from the eurozone, queues formed at ATMs in many parts of Athens. Lines of cars waited at petrol stations and supermarkets reported a higher than usual volume of sales as Greeks bought in stocks to see them through a possible crisis. Yet in the centre and more fashionable areas, there was a slightly unreal air of normality.
That was not the only paradox in the fast-evolving crisis. If the head of state gives his blessing to a referendum next Sunday, Greeks may be called to vote on a proposal from Greeces creditors that will no longer be on offer.
The latest proposal from the ECB, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European commission was based on Greeces bailout programme, which is due to expire on Tuesday. But on Saturday the so-called Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers turned down Tsiprass request for a one-month extension so the referendum could be held without external pressures.
According to two polls published on Sunday, the prime minister faces an uphill battle to secure the rejection he has indicated that he favours. One in the right-leaning tabloid Proto Thema found 57% of those interviewed favoured acceptance of the creditors latest offer. Another in the centre-left To Vima put support at 47%.
Syrizas MPs voted in a bloc for the referendum, together with their coalition partners from the radical right Anel party. They were joined by 16 of Golden Dawns 17 lawmakers. One Syriza MP and a Golden Dawn member were absent from the vote, which was taken in the early hours of Sunday.
Austrias finance minister, Hans Jrg Schelling, intensified the drama, telling the daily Die Presse that Greece would have to leave the EU before leaving the eurozone. He said its departure from the single currency appeared almost inevitable now but that this would only be possible if Athens first asked to leave the European Union and other countries agreed to its request.
Its clear that one country can under no circumstances blackmail the European commission and the euro countries, the paper quoted Schelling as saying.

        <MainBody>Related: San Francisco takes pride in same-sex ruling but caution underlies celebration
To the uninitiated, San Franciscos Pride parade appears a wild extravaganza where a million people do whatever they want.
It turns out the bacchanalia has rules, or at least etiquette, especially for those straight allies who join the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender revellers.
SF Weekly, the citys free, alternative weekly paper, has compiled a list of dos and donts to follow in order to be the best heterosexual you can possibly be at Sundays parade, the 45th annual celebration in the gayest city in the galaxy.
Here is a summary.
Dont do anything awful, an injunction prompted by an assault last year on several Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence: Please, dont get shooty, stabby, or punchy.
Dont lose all inhibition. In acknowledgment of continued intolerance, oppression and HIV/Aids, respect Prides solemn, mournful side.
If you run into someone you didnt know was LGBT, dont pretend you didnt see them: It takes two to make it awkward, so always err on the side of saying hi to Bob from Accounting when hes got boobs now.
If a party is getting out of control, dont make it worse by tweeting indiscriminate invitations.
Dont assume all gay men wish to be touched, Instagrammed and screamed at: Just because some people got up before dawn to look like an exotic species of bird doesnt mean theyre communal property. And honey, youre going to get polyps on your vocal cords if you shout Woo! for five straight hours.
Go to the Frameline film festival to learn about the diversity and complexity of the LGBT community.
Take care with terminology. Queer and dyke are OK if thats what people call themselves. Tranny is more problematic: And remember, its transgender, not transgendered.
Enjoy! Wear bright colors. Smile at ugly naked people. Graciously accept fliers for parties youd never, ever go to. Hug and be hugged.

        <title>Pussy Riot at Glastonbury: ‘The toilets aren’t so bad. At least they have doors’</title>

Pussy Riots Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Pyotr Verzilov (in and out of character as an ultra-conservative Russian freedom fighter wearing a balaclava and wielding an AK-47) met G2 backstage at the Leftfield, fresh from declaring an independent Peoples Republic of Glastonbury from the top of a surplus Russian military van.
Hi Pussy Riot! How is your Glastonbury?
Nadezhda: We just arrived before our performance so we didnt see much, but we like the audience and it was probably the best questions weve faced in our experience. Its very political. Active!
How does that compare with Russian festivals?
Nadezhda: In Russia we also have rock festivals, but we have guys like him [points at Pyotr] at rock festivals.
[G2 laughs]
Nadezhda: Thats not a joke.
Maria: Because of the money which rock festivals took from the government, they look not like this. Are they corporate? Unfortunately, yes. But some of the underground clubs try to do independent festivals and succeed.
What would Vladimir Putin make of Glastonbury?
Maria: He will not have this opportunity. I think its not for him.
So, where did you get the military truck?
Pyotr: Well, when we had a rally down in the Park stage, I gave a speech and said that today is the founding day of Glastonburys Peoples Republic. And as with any peoples republic, you need surplus military vehicles. So we just purchased them down at the corner store along with some equipment and some clothes.
Er, is that a real gun?
Pyotr: Obviously it is, look at it. [Rests his hand proudly on it.] Look at the weight, its heavy!
How did you get it in? We couldnt get a glass bottle of whisky through the gate.
Pyotr: Well, you know. Russian rebels have their ways.

You said during your speech on the Park stage that you wanted people to start the day with a riot. Where do we start?
Maria: Its the decision of every person and some of the riots can be inside riots, inside you, rather than going and attacking people.
So, the Glastonburys Peoples Republic, eh? How do we sign up?
Pyotr: Well, you buy your own military vehicles, you recruit men who will fearlessly fight to separate the republic from the United Kingdom and then install nice conservative values here, not the bullshit you have going on down in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. People in Donetsk [the Ukrainian city held by pro-Russian separatists since 2014] and other parts of the Russian world are really having a nice time these days, so we just need people down in Glastonbury to really feel their power.
You said on stage that you wanted the crowd to inspire Russian peace. How do we do that then  buy a stranger some chunky chips and funky dips?
Maria: By music! If music will become more political like it was in the 60s and 70s we will be happier.
You were introduced on stage by Charlotte Church. She said that she was inspired by your ideas. Did she have anything to inspire you?
Nadezhda: She just told us that shes not usually an interviewer, so we appreciated that she decided to be an interviewer especially for us. Its a big honour. Shes a real cool activist right now, so it was cool to have a chat with her.
Pyotr: I asked her to perform at the foundation concert for Glastonburys Peoples Republic and she agreed. We have plans to turn her into one of the pop icons of the new republic.
Who do you want to see while youre here?
Nadezhda: I want to see some food.
People know you for political acts designed to shock. Ive seen some pretty shocking things at Glastonbury. Do you think this crowd is unshockable?
Maria: I dont think people come here for shock. But they come here for inspiration. If we found a way to do that, its a pleasure for us.
The crowd thought it was quite shocking when Pyotr started talking, in character, about banning gay parades. They didnt know what to make of it.
Nadezhda: Its cool to explore what can embarrass people in different countries because this type of character is a usual character for Russians. People will applaud him and nobody would be embarrassed.
Pyotr: If you had said the same words in Russia, youd definitely get a massive cheer. And people would be incredibly happy that their hero has appeared.
OK, time for the really important question. How do the Glastonbury toilets compare with the ones in a Russian penal colony?
Nadezhda: Yes, I visited the toilets. But theyre better than the penal colony.
Maria: Whats wrong with the toilets?
No, not these nice ones backstage. The ones out in the campsite.
Nadezhda: Its cool. Ive seen some pictures. Its not so bad. At least they have doors. In penal colonies they dont have doors. So its OK for me to pee in public.

Small clusters of European tourists watched from hotel entrances and applauded as the procession of Tunisians passed down the main boulevard of the Port el Kantaoui resort, just north of Sousse.
Local families, some with small children, hurried to join the march against terrorism late on Saturday night as it headed for the Imperial Marhaba hotel, where 38 people were gunned down on the beach on Friday.
At the hotels entrance, about 300 people sang the national anthem and shouted slogans denouncing terrorism. On the other side of its closed gates, policemen armed with automatic weapons watched intently. Hotel staff said only about 50 guests remained in the hotel.

We are staying on to support Tunisia , said one British woman, clearly moved as she exchanged waves and greetings with passing motorists honking their support on the main boulevard. This was her third holiday in Sousse, she said, and she had decided to remain despite the massacre on Friday.
Tunisia needs our support, thats all you need to say, she said, declining to give her name.
The rally at the hotel was a breakway from the main anti-terrorism rally held at about 9pm in Sousse city centre. That was a more official affair, with support from the main political parties, including the parliamentary Islamist party Ennahda.
Tourism is crucial to the economy of Sousse and other towns along Tunisias Mediterranean coast. It provides jobs for many Tunisians who rent rooms in outlying suburbs and make up the bulk of the often modestly paid hotel and restaurant staff, taxi-drivers and guides. .
There is concern that Fridays attacks will make an already difficult economic situation worse, and the march was intended to counter the terrible publicity brought to the town by the killings. It was heavily promoted on the local radio station and national private television channels.
Local people joining the march were also clearly deeply upset that foreigners visiting their country had been seen as a soft target. There is also concern, including among the younger generation that spearheaded the 2011 revolt that brought down the countrys long-standing president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , about the countrys direction, as conflict continues in neighbouring Libya.

Now is the time for all of us to come together. Its not the time for arguments, said a student originally from the inland town of Kasserine as he headed for the Imperial Marhaba hotel.
Two young European women were hurrying to catch up with the march, having read about it on an official Facebook page detailing Sousse events for visitors. One was from Liverpool and was on the beach at the time of Fridays attack. This march is great! she said, holding a handmade placard that read I [Heart] Sousse, Peace.
Sousse is a party city, and as the night wore on excited young people drove through the streets honking their horns in scenes difficult to distinguish from celebrations following a football match.
At a hotel opposite the Oliviers clinic, to which many of those injured on Friday were rushed for treatment, the receptionist shook his head disapprovingly, suggesting that a more sombre mood would show proper respect. This is not quite the right way to go about it, he said.
Tunisias tourism minister, Selma Elloumi, is to meet ambassadors of the countries that are home to many of the tourists who visit Tunisia, including Britain, France and Germany. Some hard talk is expected about security, and how best to protect holidaymakers on the hundreds of beaches along Tunisias long Mediterranean coast.

White supremacist calls Charleston 'a preview of coming attractions'
Dylann Roof refers to Harold Covingtons white separatist group, the Northwest Front, in his alleged manifesto. The rightwing sci-fi writer distances himself from the shooting, but his followers speculate if his work influenced Roofs actions

One of the shadowy figures who appears to have influenced alleged Charleston killer Dylann Roof is Harold Covington, the founder of a white separatist movement and, within supremacist circles, an influential sci-fi author. Covington, the latest in a long line of rightwing sci-fi writers, has been linked to racist crimes in the past and this week called the massacre a preview of coming attractions.
The racist manifesto and photos apparently posted by Roof makes mention of the Northwest Front, created by Covington, a former member of the American Nazi party who traveled to South Africa and Rhodesia in order to agitate for white power. In the accompanying photos, Roof wore patches with Rhodesian and apartheid-era South African flags on them.

Covington, if you believe his website, runs a growing enclave of white supremacists near Seattle called the Northwest Front. The non-profit group is reflected in a series of sci-fi novels, authored by Covington, about a dystopian future in which a white nation is the only answer to US economic and racial woes.
American science fiction has long had a rightward tilt, from the contemporary strain of small-press sci-fi Tea Party fantasias swarming the Hugo Awards nominations all the way back to libertarian deity Ayn Rand. But Covingtons novels are a breed apart.
His followers see conspiracy in Covingtons connections to Roof. And why did this young man have a flight jacket with flag patches from the old White ruled southern African countries, which is where HAC spent part of his early days in the Cause, hmmm, wrote a commenter called Wingnut under a recent podcast on the Northwest website. Wonder if theyll find a pile of NF-HAC stuff in this young mans home? Then they can pull one of those the devil made me do it numbers on HAC.
Covington doesnt advocate for randomized violence; he wants revolution, to the extent that he calls his followers comrades and lectures them on the purpose of revolution among other phrases more characteristic of the left than the right. While it was clear Roof knew about the Northwest Front and seemed familiar with it, Covington condemned Roofs shooting on his Tuesday podcast because it doesnt work.
People, dont do this shit, this flipping out with a gun lunacy, he said. No, this is not just ritual disclaimer, Harold trying to cover is ass, this is what Harold really thinks.
The Roof killings are not the first time Covingtons name has come up in connection with an allegedly racist murder. Covington was part of a group of white supremacists in the 1970s who massacred black people at a rally in Greensboro (Covington didnt kill anyone and wasnt in attendance on the day of the violence). He was also at one time close with Frazier Glenn Miller , who is charged with killing a one woman, a 69-year-old Jewish man and that mans 14-year-old grandson in front of their temple last year.
Elizabeth Wheaton wrote about Covington in her book Codename Greenkil: The 1979 Greensboro Killings. Covington was pretty much a minor player, she told The Guardian. He liked the Nazi image on the white power kinds of things, but he was kind of nerdy. Most of [the others] were country people or ex-military.
For all of his lacks, he does not lack the ability to turn a phrase, said Wheaton. Hes very articulate in presenting his message.

Covington said hed never heard of Roof before the massacre and told The Guardian to try Stormfront. Thats usually where newbies in the Movement end up leaving their first electronic footprint.
Much of Covingtons influence on his followers comes from his novels, which are written in a style that reads like someone spilled a 50-gallon barrel of ethnic slurs all over a stack of early-draft Robert Heinlein novels. His choice of cultural icons dates his books considerably, even the recent ones, which are filled with up-to-the-minute references to Jane Fonda and Gilligans Island, but the author probably doesnt care about these criticisms. The books are not primarily novels, anyway.
The Northwest novels are not meant to be mere entertainment, according to Covingtons website Northwest.org. They are meant to be self-fulfilling prophecies. The author wishes to inspire the creation of a real Northwest American Republic, and his novels are filled with a great deal of sound practical advice about how to do it.
There are five Northwest novels are all populated with similarly brave and heroic white men (domestic terrorist-type dudes in the words of Shane Ryan, the narrator of Covingtons A Distant Thunder), cruel, DW Griffith-style black people whose speech is written in dialect, and hand-wringing liberals who want nothing more than to stifle the right to free speech of (white) people who just want to secede from the US.
As the NVA [Northwest Volunteer Army, Covingtons heroes] vise had slowly clamped down on the Northwest over the past five years, Capitol Hill had lost much of its left-wing cachet, as those artsy-fartsy habitues who were dusky of skin or sexually inverted either fled to more hospitable climes or got well and truly wasted, shot dead on the pavement by the NVA gunners, Covington explains in 2004s A Mighty Fortress.
Shane Ryan, hero of the purported oral-history-of-the-revolution volume A Distant Thunder, recalls the heroism of his white brothers and sisters up to and including teams specialty snipers who pick off interracial couples and, of course, Conrad Baumgarten, who came all the way from Germany with his SS officer grandfathers scoped 98 Mauser to hunt Jews.
The conservative fringe in science fiction
Covington comes from a long line of rightwing US fantasists, though most are far less extreme. Where film and literary fiction and visual art tend to trend left, American sci-fi has a definite rightward bent, from libertarian deity Heinlein (widely praised by both his ideological detractors and his fans) to Ayn Rand, Orson Scott Card and beyond.
Science fiction has always had a strain in it that has been conservative and libertarian and some combination of the two; thats been kind of a prominent feature for a very long time, said John Scalzi, president of the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers of America. That in itself isnt particularly problematic. Some of the most iconic writers in science fiction and fantasy have been conservative to libertarian. Theres nothing inherently wrong with them or the stories they tell. But like any group of people there are going to be folks whose politics are fairly fringe, and whatever comes out of their fringe is going to be fringe as well.
Scalzi is currently the target of one of those fringe figures, the openly misogynist and racist sci-fi writer Vox Day whose logrolling campaign to include more white men and fewer women and minorities in the Hugo Awards has attracted ire across the political spectrum and from the current king of fantasy, George RR Martin.
There are also less fringey figures whose work has taken a sharp rightward turn. Dan Simmons, writer of the much-praised Hyperion Cantos, wrote a novel called Flashback that more or less explicitly blamed progressives for the coming collapse of civilization and featured an Islamic caliphate that swarmed across Europe. Tea Party politics infect the work of Simmons contemporary, Orson Scott Card, as well: Cards 2009 novel Empire imagines a world in which a radical leftist army calling itself the Progressive Restoration takes over New York City and ignites a second civil war.
Scalzi said that its unwise to dismiss authors because of a single novel or late-career tendency toward the lunatic fringe, but that hes seen a rightward shift in a baby-boomer sci-fi novelists in particular. For some healthy slice of the baby boomers in general, 9/11 just caused a bend in their thinking and theyve been thinking in a much more conservative and reactionary way, he said.
Covingtons prophecy
In an email exchange with the Guardian, Covington said he was urging followers not to talk about Roof until all the facts were out.
What did he mean by that? I mean that a lot of times these things are not as advertised and people like you have a tendency to try to use us as props and aids to support the Official Version. Oklahoma City being a prime example; there is a compelling case to be made that was a government sting operation gone very wrong, but I long ago gave up any hope of ever getting anybody to listen; anything we say is simply shouted down or kicked aside, we are treated as cranks at best, and facts are never allowed to interfere with the Received Wisdom from on high.
For another example, I am well aware of the ideological orientation of the Guardian (I lived in the British Isles for a number of years [Covington spent time among skinheads in the UK  a lot of them were great guys, he said on a recent podcast]) and I understand that I have not a snowballs chance in hell of getting our viewpoint represented honestly and fairly there.
A few hours later, a new installment of his radio show went up on the Radio Free Northwest website, in which he did not advocate for violence, but did fantasize for a little while, saying that liberals were afraid of Charleston because it was a preview of coming attractions.
Theyve been given a vision of a time in some imagined but possibly not too-far distant future when all of a sudden, on the street or in their office, or in some trendy fern bar, or Starbucks, or wine-and-cheese boutique on the Upper East Side or in San Francisco, they will look up, possibly from the laptop, where they are typing up their days quota of leftwing, liberal horseshit, and they will see a young white man like Dylann Roof standing in front of them with no steroid-pumped policemen in blue to protect their liberal candy asses from the consequences of years of their own behavior, he said. They will see in that young white mans eyes, that he recognizes them. That he is now beyond deception or bullying or browbeating or Twitter-shaming or intimidation, that he knows them for what they are. And they will look down and see that he has something in his hand.

It fell to the junior Foreign Office minister, Tobias Ellwood , to tell the UK media that at least 15 British nationals had died in the Tunisia shooting and that the number was set to rise.
The subject is one with which Ellwood has an intensely personal connection. In 2002, his brother was among 202 people killed in the double bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali .
Jon Ellwood, a teacher who was in Bali for a conference, died in the second of two blasts that hit nightclubs on Kuta beach. It took three days for his family to learn that he had had been killed.
Tobias Ellwood, a former army officer who became the Conservative MP for Bournemouth East in 2005, flew to Bali with his sister to bring home Jons body. Ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack in 2012, he told the BBC about the chaos they encountered.

We just wanted to bring my brothers body back to Britain, as simple as that. But its not that simple, he said. You need death certificates in both languages, embalming certificates, sealing certificates. All these processes require time and people to participate. None of that happened.
I had to do many of those things myself to the point where I ended up screwing the lid down on the coffin myself. That cant be right.
Ellwood, now one of the parliamentary under-secretaries of state at the Foreign Office, said some of the additional staff the British embassy in Jakarta had brought in to help were unable to cope and had to be flown out. Overall, he said, the official British response was horrific.
Following his experiences, at the invitation of Jack Straw, the foreign secretary at the time, Ellwood contributed ideas as to how such emergency responses could be improved.

Ramaphosa, a board member of Lonmin platinum mine where thousands were protesting in August 2012  made phone calls that allegedly escalated the confrontation; sent emails reportedly calling for action to be taken against these criminals, whose crime was to seek a wage increase; and held secret meetings to get the government and police to act in a more pointed way to quell the unrest.
Thirty-four miners were killed during the strikes  the bloodiest massacre by South African security forces since the end of racial apartheid.
But for Judge Ian Farlam leading the investigation, to tie the massacre to the person holding the second highest post in government, Ramaphosa would have had to be standing behind the police line with a loudspeaker instructing the police to shoot at the striking Lonmin workers himself.
Farlam said in his 646-page report that the commission could not find even on a prima facie basis that Mr Ramaphosa is guilty of the crimes he is alleged to have committed despite hearing from lawyers, witnesses and observers how Ramaphosas interventions were infested with a litany of conflicts of interest.
The commission is of the view that it cannot be said that Mr Ramaphosa was the cause of the massacre, the report states.
For the injured and families of those who died, and those who continue to live in poverty and indignity at Marikana, there was always going to disappointment with the outcome of the commission, because they were looking for accountability at the highest level.
That was never going to happen.
What happened was the opposite. Over a thousand days since the deaths of 34 people not a single person is being held accountable. There is no justice or closure for a single life lost or family destroyed.
The wound stays open. The suffering continues.

They were killed by a state meant to protect them
President Jacob Zuma had the Marikana report in his possession for 86 days before it was fully released. On Thursday night, he announced its key findings , without any specific actions on his part  apart from asking the relevant ministers to study the report and advise him on the implementation of the recommendations.
The commission overall found that a multiple failure from all involved resulted in the violence at Marikana, but in language that is extremely cautious. It found that Lonmin did not use its best endeavours to resolve the labour dispute, and did not respond appropriately to the threat and outbreak of violence. But the company that profits from the sweat of poorly paid workers got off fairly lightly.
The commission found that the companys failure to provide proper housing created an environment conducive to the creation of tension, labour unrest, disunity among its employees or other harmful conduct.
In almost three years since the massacre, the workers live and work in the same conditions that contributed to the violent protest in 2012. Lonmin has not acted to correct the situation, and a slap on the wrist from the commission is hardly stimulus to do so now.
Those who went on strike were people who tried to upset that balance so that their lives might be better
Judge Farlam said he did not agree that there was a toxic collusion between the police and the Lonmin mine, a finding that runs contrary to the narrative of the workers and the victims families. The commission did not recommend any form of compensation for those injured or dependents of the deceased, saying the terms of reference were not wide enough to cover this issue.
The commission also found that the two unions involved, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) did not do enough to prevent the violence. The report said Amcu members sang provocative songs and made inflammatory remarks, which tended to aggravate an already volatile situation. The NUM, it said, wrongly advised rock drill operators that no negotiations with Lonmin were possible until the end of the two-year wage agreement, and also did not take the initiative to persuade and enable Lonmin to speak to the workers.
After waiting 34 months to hear why their loved ones and colleagues were killed, the people of Marikana have to contend with the fact that there is as yet no justice or accountability for the extreme violence visited on them, and no compensation owed to them.
They live in indignity and die in indignity. Their blood and tears mean nothing to the rich and powerful who benefitted from their toil.

Day after day, they pass the killing fields of Marikana and go deep into its bowels so that the balance between the poor and the rich, the prosperous and the damned is maintained. Those who went on strike were people who tried to upset that balance so that their lives might be better. For that they were shot and killed by a state that is meant to protect them.
Marikana is and always will be a tale of utter shame.

How Britain's khat ban devastated an entire Kenyan town
Mild stimulant used to be Mauas most valuable export, bringing prosperity to all involved. A year since it was outlawed, the local economy has been devastated

Share on WhatsApp
In a quiet and unassuming town tucked away in a hilly part of eastern Kenya , the British home secretary Theresa Mays name is spoken with barely concealed anger. Since her role in the ban of the towns most valuable export, shes become a universally vilified figure.
For more than two decades, Maua enjoyed booming business propelled by the growth and sale of khat, known locally as miraa, a popular herb whose leaves and stems are chewed for the mild high they offer.
But last year the UK, home to one of khats biggest markets, declared the stimulant a class C drug and banned all imports , prompting Mauas rapid descent into economic purgatory.
Since the early 1990s, Britain has imported between 2,500 to 2,800 tonnes a year, according to the Home Affairs committee. Although in its initial findings the committee could not find a compelling health or social reason to ban khat, Mays argument  that continuing to allow trade in the UK would spawn off an illegal export corridor to other European countries where it is banned  won out in what became a controversial cultural debate .
Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food
Miriti Ngozi
Now, a year after the legislation was signed, residents in Maua have been hit hard by a shrinking local economy that has left many facing poverty.
Losses
Edward Muruu is one of the earliest pioneers of the khat export trade. A retired headmaster at a local primary school, he says he has experienced unprecedented losses since the ban came into effect.
I used to ferry miraa (khat) from Maua to Nairobi four times a week using 27 Toyota Hilux trucks, where it was repackaged for export. I used to make around 2,100 a month. Now I am lucky if I bring in 250 per month, he says.
With the European market gone, the only place left for Muruu to sell his stimulant is Somalia , where consumers now dictate how much they pay  and its not much.
The other issue with the Somali market is that the only people who can transport miraa to Mogadishu are Kenyan Somalis, meaning that the rest of us drivers have been put out of work, says a former worker of Muruus, who only identified himself as Kanda.
According to Kanda, if non-Somali drivers attempt the trip they are attacked along the journey. For a town of its size and location, Maua has a disproportionately large number of residents of Somali heritage, most of whom are involved in the khat trade as middlemen. They are also big consumers themselves.

Miraa was the heartbeat of this town
The effects of the London ban have reached everybody in the khat micro-economy, from the big name traders like Muraa to the small fish who depend on the trade for their survival.
Although Muraa has made investments that have cushioned him against the blows of a deeply depleted income, those at the lower end of the food chain have not been so lucky.
Miriti Ngozi, chairman of the Miraa Traders Association, says that many farmers and traders are no longer able to pay school fees or even buy enough food for their families.
The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else
Lawrence Kobia
You have to understand that in this region, subsistence farming has long been overshadowed by the more prestigious miraa farming. Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food and many families are sleeping hungry, he says.
Yet many remain reluctant to uproot their khat crops and plant maize instead, holding on to the hope that their fortunes might one day return.
Pius Mbiti, a trader in his early 30s, is a qualified vet but says that he makes most of his income from picking and selling the stimulant.
On a good day I used to make up to 12 which, when supplemented with earnings from my vet practice, was enough to take care of my family. But since the ban I am lucky if I make even 2 pounds, he says.
He cannot rely on animal medicine any more either because farmers no longer have the money to pay for his services.
This narrative is familiar across the town, with the common refrain being that shutting down miraa imports to London is killing businesses indirectly linked to the herb.
The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else. With revenue from miraa so drastically low, people no longer have the money to buy things, says Lawrence Kobia, who owns a bookshop. He says that his sales have plummeted by more than 40% since last year.
Seizures
In its submissions to parliament, the Home Office committee warned that banning khat would result in the formation of a black market  as seen in the United States and other European countries including Norway and Holland.

Although initially khat sold for between 3 and 4 a kilogram in Britain, the committee reported that if it was banned the price could increase to 318, similar to its price in the US.
Their predictions turned out to be true: there has been a proliferation of the stimulant in London since the ban. While the border police have no statistics on seizures, the London Metropolitan police says it has handled a number of khat-related offences.
A spokesperson said that in the first six months after the ban came into effect, a total of 68 warnings and 14 penalty notices were issued. In addition, 36 people were arrested for possession of the herb, four of whom were later charged.
In the meantime, the Kenyan government is trying hard to get the ban lifted, with president Uhuru Kenyatta even promising the farmers in Maua as recently as February that he will petition to have the market reopened for them.
The farmers, however, see this as a cheap political move to whip up support, complaining that no tangible rewards have come from promises made by politicians regarding the matter in the past.
But the squabbling over high-level politics in Kenya and the workings of the parliament in Britain are meaningless to the miraa farmer in Maua, whose only worry is where the next meal will come from.

From photographs to video, every-day items to modern artefacts, an exhibition touring Russia is blurring the lines between art, science and ethnography to educate the population about the cultural and geographical diversity of their own country.
Our peoples idea of geography is an absolute mess. When the countrys main TV channel speaks of Altai being in the far north when it is one of Siberias southern-most republics, it is very hard to accept, says Sofia Gavrilova , one of the exhibitions curators.
Initiated by an organisation called Russia Research, the first project was an installation in the central Russian Udmurt Republic, followed by a focus on the village of Kalevala in Karelia, along the border with Finland, and another on Moscows satellite towns.

I love conducting an experiment among my students, says Gavrilova. I ask them: What makes New York different from Florida? And how is Birobidzhan different from Vladivostok?
Everyone is stuck. No one has a real image in their head, she says. They cant go to these places themselves. Whats left is the mass media, the news, and the image of these regions that the Russian Geographic Society promotes.
Russia Research is made up of a team of well-known photographers, including Ikuru Kuwajima, Maxim Sher, Ivan Mikhailov and Sergey Novikov.
The group is described as Russias first inter-disciplinary project bringing together artists, photographers, geographers, anthropologists, architects and urbanists with the aim to study modern anthropological and geographical processes taking place in Russia today, through the medium of art.

Often, their photographs from Russias diverse regions are accompanied by written commentaries from psychologists, economists, anthropologists, urbanists and sociologists. But none of the commentators are told where the photographs were taken, or what the story behind them is. Instead, theyre forced to speculate. The curators say this allows them to escape from presenting the photographers visions and the commentaries as the truth, but as art.
For example, one caption exhibited at the groups recent show at Moscows Triumph Gallery reads: The women are going to the centre of town, or to the city; theyre waiting for a bus that only goes two or three times a day. The women look solemn, important. Its obvious that they are travelling for the same reason. They are old, but still healthy, still work  maybe at the local dairy plant.

Dmitry Khankin, a partner at Triumph Gallery, says that by allowing artists to approach the subject of social customs and folklore, the nuances that might otherwise be overlooked by anthropologists or other professionals can come to the fore: As strange as it sounds, artists with a strong social conscience are able to measure processes that scientists sometimes arent able to see.
The Ministry of Culture in Moscow has so far supported two exhibitions, but hasnt given a grant for the whole projects. Yet to be convinced of the value of Russia Researchs work,
for the moment, everything is happening gradually, one exhibition at a time.
But as Russia becomes increasingly isolated  and its position in the world increasingly tense  supporters of the organisations work say it offers a unique way for citizens to gain an understanding of their own country at a critical time in the countrys political climate.

How Egyptian media has become a mouthpiece for the military state
With imprisonment of journalists at an all-time high, Nour Youssef speaks to leading journalists about their inability to criticise the government

When Tahrir Square was flooded with Egyptians calling for former president Hosni Mubaraks downfall , journalists were divided: jump ship, or defend the president?
Some, like Ibrahim Eissa, joined the calls of the protesters, co-founding the daily newspaper El-Tahrir (The Liberation). Others, like then-state TV presenter Khairy Ramadan, turned on demonstrators, suggesting they were funded by foreign conspirators.
But today even Eissa , among many others, is a defender of the new military government run by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi . Having shed any pretence of revolutionary fervour or objectivity, Egypts journalists are reluctant to even suggest that more than 36 people died in the 2011 uprising, when independent estimates say more than 900 were killed .

I would say anything the military tells me
Today, many of Egypts top TV presenters and journalists are remarkably candid about their willingness to act as government mouthpieces.
I would say anything the military tells me to say out of duty and respect for the institution, says Ahmed Moussa, one of the most popular TV presenters in Egypt .
Moussa has no qualms admitting on air his relationship with the authorities  and his vocation to serve them. He claims he would also extend the same courtesy to the police, he said but he might stop and think a little first.
Sharing Moussas sense of duty towards the military is the veteran talk show host Mahmoud Saad, from Al-Nahar TV. The military should never, ever, ever be covered, he says, shaking his head. You have to let them decide what to say and when to say it. You dont know what will hurt national security.
But its also the power to influence people that appeals to him, he says. Its a beautiful feeling knowing that when you swing right, he says as he swivels his upper body right, the people will swing right. And when you swing left, he goes on, swivelling in the opposite direction the people will swing left.

The official story makes people feel better
Before 2011, there was an unspoken rule among broadcasters and newspapers: criticise everyone except the president and his immediate family. To some, this silence extended to the defence and interior ministers.
El-Watan reporter Ahmed Ghoniem says owning media outlets comes in handy if you get into any kind of trouble and have to pressure the government. But no owner completely unleashes his journalists on the government, he says.
But after Mubaraks fall from power, the media exploded in congratulations, apologies and promises to never return to the days of humiliation that were Mubaraks reign, as popular TV host Amr Adeeb tearfully declared on ONtv.
We [talk show hosts] were cowards... The authorities used to call all the shows to dictate content, said Adeeb, who had once claimed that Mubarak had personally protected his freedom of expression  and indeed that of all journalists.
The media is not free, but better be controlled by Sisi and not the west
Ahmed Abdullah
Television presenters continue to be the undisputed leaders of public opinion in Egypt, where over a quarter of the population is illiterate . But where once they openly criticised the military and the government  most notably for killing protesters during the months of revolution in early 2011  now their role in public debate is much less clear.
Given this climate of well-known government pressure, many younger Egyptians are deeply cynical about the media, but older viewers have a softer view. So what if they paid respect to Mubarak? Everyone did, says 63-year-old retired teacher, Amal el-Tahry.
Ahmed Abdullah, who owns a shop in the capital, is also ambivalent: The media is not free, but better be controlled by Sisi and not the west, says the 55-year-old.
The government sanctioned narrative offers a sweeter pill, claims TV producer Sherief Badie el-Nour: People believe the official story because it makes them feel better, he says. It requires less work from them as individuals.
What can the viewer do about it? Change the channel? He will find another host saying the same thing, he says.

Self-censorship
This pervasive pressure from government has prompted journalists to police themselves more rigorously.
Dot Masr reporter Mohamed Abu Asay says in the past he could never report on the budget deficit in Egypt and the Saudi-Egyptian military operation in Yemen in the same piece. I cant tie the idea that the government doesnt have money, but is abandoning its war on terror to go fight in Yemen, in the readers mind, he says. It might stir public opinion and that is not good for the regime or the funders. Abu Asay knows that if he doesnt self-censor, his editors simply wont run it.
At Al Masry Al Youm, reporters also say they know which topics to avoid. No one can question how [well] trained the soldiers we have thrown to face the insurgency in Sinai, says website editor Ahmed Ragab.
Even when the newspaper published a report on police abuse partly showing the authorities in positive light and showcasing their heroism in the war on terrorism , its journalists were still referred to the public prosecutor after the Ministry of Interior issued a statement promising to sue the paper for what it claimed was an unprofessional report.
The viewer is tired
Mahmoud Saad
No one has ever made me say something I didnt want to say, but they have made me not say what I wanted to say, says the TV presenter Mahmoud Saad.
Lighting a cigarette, Saad reflects on the many phone conversations he says he had with Mubaraks minister of information, Anas el-Fiqqi, arguing about the topics he was allowed to discuss, whom to interview, and for how long. He called me to tell me to say that the 25 January protests in 2011 were [organised by the rival] Muslim Brotherhood. I refused and I didnt go on air, he recalls.
Saad no longer has that fighting spirit. I am an old man, he says. I just want to spend my time here in quiet  of which there is plenty in his brightly lit villa in a gated community in Giza.
I dont want to ruin anyones day, he says. The viewer is tired. He doesnt want to hear about corruption and theft. This desire to please is clear on Saads show, where all he had to say on the day a court dropped charges of killing protesters against Mubarak was : Is it really important that we get into details? I think not.

Claims of oppression are just a trend
Despite many journalists first hand experience of censorship and corruption in the countrys media, many stop short of holding president the government directly responsible.
Claims of oppression are just a trend, CBCs Khairy Ramadan says. Anyone who says they are under pressure is a liar.
ONtvs Youssef el-Husseiny goes further, claiming that the authorities would like the press to be balanced , but its journalists themselves who are the ones resisting. Sisi, el-Husseiny claims, personally asked him where his governments opposition is: Where are the other voices? Is everyone a supporter [of mine]?
We are tools, not journalists. The media owners use us to attack the regime when they want and support it when they want
Ahmed Amir, journalist
But frustration amongst journalists is also growing, and not everyone is resigned to become beholden to the governments narrative. Some have some have quit their jobs, but many also keep their head down to make ends meet.
Give me a nine to five job and I will quit tomorrow, says young journalist Ahmed Amir. Amir works on Ahmed Moussas TV talk show on Sada el-Balad TV.
We are tools, not journalists. The media owners use us to attack the regime when they want and support it when they want, he says. This is the profession of those with no conscience.

EU to counter Russian propaganda by promoting 'European values'

The document, drafted by the EUs diplomatic corps, also calls for efforts to persuade people in countries such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova of the benefits of European-style reforms.
The plan was prepared ahead of the EU summit in Brussels and offers a strategy to provide alternatives sources of information to outlets such as Russias state-funded RT television, amid an increasingly polarised media environment sparked by the war in Ukraine .
A communications unit called the East StratCom Team, launched in April, will support EU delegations in the six eastern neighbourhood countries, Armenia, Azerbaijan , Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine  as well as in Russia itself.
The main objectives include communicating and promoting EU policies and values, supporting independent media and increasing awareness of disinformation activities by external actors.
The document states that communication towards the east should first and foremost focus on the development of positive and effective messages regarding EU policies towards the region.
Brussels needs to spread the message that reforms promoted by the European Union can, over time, have a positive impact on their daily lives, the action plan says. It stresses that the strategy should highlight the benefits, not the bureaucracy, focusing on clearly explaining the positive effects of EU programmes and policies rather than going into details about the policies.
Tensions between Europe and Russia have exacerbated since Ukraines former president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following months of protests sparked by his decision to scrap plans to move closer to the EU and improve trade ties with Moscow instead. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 and has backed separatists fighting with government forces in the east.
The action plan also calls for the 28-nation EU to more actively to promote freedom of the media in the eastern neighbourhood region, mainly in concert with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe . Proposals include targeted training and capacity building for journalists and media outlets in the region. Brussels will also consider how best it can support training for journalists experiencing conflict situations, to better enable them to report on issues of relevance to local populations.
Several potential responses to Russian propaganda have been discussed among EU member states, including an initiative led by countries such as Denmark and Latvia to create a Russian-language TV channel.
The action plan does not mention the creation of new media outlets in Russian, but it notes that a number of Member States are already increasing their support for broadcasting in the Russian language to cater to national minorities. In the meantime the EU will continue its support at local level for independent media, including Russian language media, to ensure that citizens have access to alternative sources of information in their local language.
It also states that the EU will ensure that communication materials and products are available in local languages, notably in Russian.

'Armenia is not a new Maidan. Please don't make it one'
Protests against electricity price hikes in Yerevan have little in common with Ukraines uprising  but Russian geopolitical rhetoric has a habit of making self-fulfilling prophecies, says Paul Goble

Many Russian analysts are hurrying to suggest that this weeks protests in Yerevan and their suppression by the Armenian government are the opening round of a new Maidan  an anti-Moscow action promoted and exploited by the west as part of a broader geopolitical struggle.
But such an interpretation of events, if it comes to guide policy, could prove to be the worst form of a self-fulfilling prophecy, transforming what are protests by Armenians about domestic conditions into something more. Should Moscow choose to defend the existing authorities in Yerevan no matter what, it would alienate the country against Russia .
That is the conclusion Sergey Markedonov of the Russian State Humanities University offers in his latest commentary , one that constitutes a clear warning to the Kremlin, as well as analysts inside Russia and abroad, about misreading the situation on the ground by trying to make everything fit a pre-existing framework.
Those who read every case of popular discontent in the post-Soviet space as a Maidan or proto-Maidan are falling victim to a kind of geopolitical determinism, as Markedonov puts it, according to which practically any [protest movement] is only an expression of a proxy war between the United States and Russia.
Such people are taking the lazy way out, and forgetting that a political crisis is not a virus which spreads from one place to another, but rather reflects specific problems, however much some of those who are participating in it  both the regimes andthose who oppose them  draw on past cases in their vocabulary.
What is happening in Armenia is decidedly not like what happened in Ukraine . For one thing, Russia considers Armenia its strategic partner. For another, the government and the people are not divided in their attitude toward Moscow. Some in the government question Yerevans ties with Russia; and many in the streets would like to see those ties deeper.
In short, the Moscow analyst says, the issue of Russia is not the defining element in their struggle and it is critically important that in Moscow people do not fall victim to emotions and look for signs of a Maidan where they are hard to find. Rather, Russia must recognise that the protesters are not unhappy with the Kremlin but with Yerevans own power structure.

Capturing the world of Russian amateur football, one game at a time
A long way from the glitz and gore of the Fifa scandal, photographer Sergey Novikov is travelling to the furthest reaches of the country to capture local teams at play. The Moscow Times reports

Beating on drums and chanting loudly, two dozen supporters of FC Semyonov football club march across their local teams pitch and take their places in the stands.
Down on the grass, photographer Sergey Novikov is instructing the 11 local players how to stand as he takes a pre-match photo, before the game against FC Spartak Tumbotino begins.
The shots Novikov takes are part of his ongoing project, Grassroots , which has seen the 35-year-old spend the past three years travelling around central and western Russia to photograph amateur football teams and their stadiums.
Focusing as much on what lies beyond the pitch as who is playing on it, Grassroots is more than just a collection of sports photography. From the sparse pitches in the far north of the country to fields in central Russia surrounded by churches, Novikovs project also offers a glimpse into everyday life in the furthest of Russias regions.
For me it is always interesting to look at what surrounds the stadium: how does it fit into the urban landscape? Novikov says. The stadiums in the Tver region are often surrounded by concrete blocks. In the village of Pryazha in the Karelia region, they built a wooden fence around the pitch as if it was an ancient fortress.

Sport, or alcohol
Novikov works in Moscow as a photo editor for culture news site Colta.ru. He devotes much of his spare time to Grassroots, funding the project out of his own pocket. The problem is when  you have to travel really far for one photo, its very expensive, he says. In order to make the trips worthwhile, he tries to attend two or three games in the same area over a weekend.
Given the amateur status of the teams that he photographs, Novikovs plans are prone to disruption. He recalls travelling to the northern town of Kirovsk in the Murmansk region only to find out the match had been cancelled. It turned out that a day of mourning had been declared after more than a dozen local officials were killed in a helicopter crash.

Plans to watch another team in the Nizhny Novgorod region also fell through after the club  FC Ruslan, named after a character in Alexander Pushkins poem Ruslan and Lyudmila  withdrew from the game citing financial reasons. Novikov says problems with money are the main reason for cancellations.
When asked why Russian supporters should shun professional clubs in order to watch amateur teams, Novikov notes that grassroots matches say a lot about real life.
Stadiums are especially important in provincial towns because they are often the only place that members of the local population can let off some steam. When everything is going badly at work, when you face chaos and corruption in your town, when your wife leaves you for another man then you have two options: sport, or alcohol.

To find clubs to take part in his project, Novikov scrolls through fixtures on the websites of regional championship federations and then contacts them via Russias VKontakte social media site. Two towns in particular took weeks of planning to photograph  Snezhnogorsk and Polyarny in Murmansk. These , like other so-called closed cities, are successors of Soviet towns which house military or nuclear facilities, locked-off to non-residents. For Novikovs visit official minders accompanied him to and from the games.
Grassroots is still a work in progress, and Novikov says he wants to extend his project eastward beyond the Ural Mountains and into Siberia. His aim is to complete the project by 2018, when Russia will host the Fifa football World Cup .

Grassroots is not Novikovs first football-inspired project. A previous series titled FC Volga United saw him photograph amateur and professional clubs dotted along the banks of the Volga River. It was during this time that Novikov realised: how diverse the footballing landscape of the country was and decided to do Grassroots to document the more unique and interesting pitches across Russia.
The stadium in Semyonov comprises one stand overlooking a synthetic pitch that is dotted with sand-filled holes. Behind the stand lies a copse of birch trees, where several cows are grazing. A herd of cows once almost wandered onto the pitch at another match, Novikov says.
He says he always shoots the team before the game because after the match the weather  or the players moods  might change.
Teams usually respond well to having their photo taken, but Novikov notes the players often act very seriously. Sometimes when I do a group photo, I feel like adding a bit of irony  so if someone not connected to the team comes into the frame, Im for this.
No sooner has the days game kicked off than the group of raucous FC Semyonov fans let off a flare, prompting five or so policemen to march over.
That will be a 3,000 rouble [35] fine, says a middle-aged man dressed in a suit and with glasses perched on the end of his nose, marking the violation down on his clipboard. Hes a match inspector from the regional football federation,and spends the rest of the game lurking around for possible infractions.

At least one police car and a medical officer are obliged to attend every football match organised through football federations, says Novikov, pointing to the designated doctor for todays game  a middle-aged woman wearing three-inch heels and a nurses apron underneath her coat.
In the 70th minute, one of the home players punches an opponent in the face and is sent off. Later, the same sides goalkeeper is ordered off after he flattens an attacking player just outside the penalty box.
FC Semyonov did eventually pull a goal back, but a 45-yard lob sealed the win for Spartak Tumbotino, who won the match 3-1. The two dozen hardcore Semyonov fans left about five minutes before the end of the match, releasing several flares outside the stadium gates as they went.

        <title>What do Iranians really think of a nuclear deal beyond the polls and Twittersphere?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/25/iranians-speak-out-landmark-nuclear-deal</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Related: Offices in houses and the best tea breaks  welcome to working life in Tehran
When I first started at the company, my new co-workers warned me about delving too heavily into politics with others. Most were afraid there might be an informant lurking in the office. Careful  dont say that in front of just anyone, theyd say. Living in Tehran, Im no stranger to talk of bugged rooms, keywords that alert spooky software to tap your phone, and government agents disguised as hipsters.
Ive decided, however, that much of this is the same exaggerated nonsense that must have hovered over the Shah s secret police in the 1970s.
So I unabashedly spark conversations on the nuclear negotiations in the office.
But when I extract myself from the Twittersphere and ignore my politically savvy journalist friends, I notice few at my workplace are engaging with the nuclear negotiations as passionately as Im being told they are. Or as passionately as I am.
Because when Irans nuclear negotiators struck a framework agreement in early April (the Joint Plan of Action  JPOA), I was ecstatic. Our office? Not so much.
Hamed says Im nave if I think anythings going to change.
Gita tries for small talk with a you think so? and then delivers her finishing blow with a lukewarm I sure hope so. Mohsen just lays it on: the mood hasnt changed.
In the office where I spend most of my days, the nuke talks dont always arouse heated discussion. I cant blame my co-workers for not being fired up. Irans reformers have been shot down so frequently over the past few decades that JPOAs, comprehensive JPOAs and framework accords seem like noise set against a backdrop of immense un- and underemployment, inflation that outpaces pay raises, and social restrictions that have no place in 2015 ( lets avoid the hijab for a second: physically playing musical instruments on state TV is still against the rules). That mood will remain unchanged, Mohsen says, until Iranians see the proof in the proverbial pudding.
Related: Iranians optimistic about end to isolation, says new poll
People dont believe its going to happen  its like theyre waiting for the talks to end in disaster, says Hesam, whose smartphone is clearly more grabbing than the prospect of having sanctions lifted. I probe him for more: what about the street celebrations on Vali Asr street after the framework deal  the pictures, the tweets? He looks up as if to swat a fly. People were happier on the first day after the agreement. But over time, they started to doubt it again.
And its not just at the office: were less than a week away from what could be a historic agreement, but it sure doesnt feel like it in my slice of Tehran. That doesnt mean people dont support the deal. Everyone I know would like nothing more than to see the sanctions removed. They just arent excited - or optimistic - about it.
Sometimes, I fantasise about the nuke deal. I see Iran on the cusp of what could be a transformation  an end to nearly four decades of exasperating sanctions that have prevented its full and unhindered reintegration into the international community. Its big. It could bring massive foreign investment , job creation, and cleaner air. It could pry the economy from entrenched establishment types that have abused the countrys relative isolation for their own gain. It could mean McDonalds, Starbucks and maybe somewhere down the line, Shakira and Radiohead.
Then reality smacks me square in the face and Im back at the office. I remember dropping by my co-workers room a while back to follow up with a project we were both assigned to. I noticed he was gone, so I checked a few other rooms to find still more unattended desks. When this happens, I usually head to the cafeteria, which contains one of two televisions hooked up to state TV. Sure enough, the second-floor staff had huddled around the lunch table, gripped by the last few minutes of a soccer match on Channel 3.

Theres nothing unnatural about this. It was just a bizarre contrast to the complete lack of interest in the run up to the JPOA last November, when Iran and the United States  sworn enemies for 36 years  took the first concrete step toward dtente. No one rushed to the cafeteria to see if the negotiations had succeeded, even though IRINN was on, broadcasting live updates. At the time, in fact, most were busy furiously debating an upcoming faceoff between Esteghlal and Persepolis . If there has ever been passion in our office, it was then.
Related: Did the Supreme Leader just torpedo the nuclear talks?
(Admittedly, Ali, who used to sit across from me, would occasionally ask for the latest on the nuke deal, setting off a conversation between me, him, and the guy who sat in the corner. Once he stopped me in the stairwell, saying he was worried about the supreme leader lambasting the US at a critical juncture in the talks. I responded by asking him to picture the utter regime meltdown that would ensue if the supreme leader had instead extended an olive branch to America. Our conversation thus ended).
Determined to find someone beaming with as much enthusiasm as I am in the aftermath of the framework accord, I head upstairs to the third floor. Here I find Asghar, who isnt beaming but is content with the faint scent of hope that has wafted through Iran. Just the fact that theres hope  like when [President Hassan] Rouhani was elected  is enough. Iran has to change gradually, he says, because sudden changes  like a revolution  could end up in a full-blown civil war between the not-so-religious and the religious.
Across the table, Elnaz takes the counterpoint: the agreement only prolongs a status quo she utterly despises. This just means that these people are only going to stay around longer - for another ten to 20 years now, she says of her countrys political leaders.
The lack of excitement still confounds me. Maybe Im cuing into the wrong signs? You would assume an agreement that could fundamentally remake Irans relationship with the world would be glamorous enough to trigger something beyond prosaic elevator chitchat.
Then I think back to what the always-smiley Morteza had to say. Instead of looking at the formidable challenges ahead, he marvelled at the distance we had already travelled.
Related: Iran's state TV tries 'soft power' to win hearts and minds
I mean just the fact that our two presidents have spoken to each other is big, he says of President Rouhanis historic phone call with President Barack Obama in September 2013. Could you imagine that just a short while ago they tried to avoid each other? Like, if one of them learned the other was walking somewhere, he would try to distance himself so they didnt cross paths? Morteza is telling the story of the Islamic republics first reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, and the rumoured lengths to which he went to avoid a run-in with Bill Clinton in the UN bathroom in 1997 (lest he inflame Iranian hardliners).
Maybe I should be paying attention to the little things, like Morteza. Maybe I need to temper my daydreams with a heavy dose of the little changes weve already lived through. Maybe  just maybe  my co-workers are more willing to acknowledge that the nuke deal wont be the be-all end-all panacea than I am. Even for Mohsen, its the gradual changes that might make the wait worthwhile.
Look, all Im saying is that even if we regain our stature and honour in the international community - if the Iranian passport is a valid document again - that alone will make more of a difference to me than any improvement in our livelihoods, he says. So the next time somebody says Iran, people dont just turn around and look the other way.
I dont think it will have much of an impact on our lives, says Mahnaz of a potential nuke deal a day after I interviewed Mohsen in front of her. I think most of the benefit will accrue to the higher echelons of society: I mean, thats the way its always been. I dont know how this is going to be any different.
She continues: Just like [Mohsen] said the other day - if our countrys reputation improves in the eyes of the international community, that alone would be wonderful.

Thousands of Armenians have taken to the streets to protest against electricity rate hikes, marching on the presidential palace and staging all-night sit-ins around the main square of the capital, leading to fears in Moscow of a Ukraine-style popular uprising.
The protests in Yerevan, which began on Friday, escalated significantly after police fired water cannons to disperse seated demonstrators on Tuesday morning. By Wednesday evening thousands of people had gathered on Marshal Baghramyan Avenue near the presidential palace, chanting slogans and blocking traffic.
In the early hours of Wednesday, ruling party politicians and others formed a human shield between police and protesters, although negotiations over a potential meeting with the president, Serzh Sargsyan, fell through for the second night.
Smaller-scale protests spread to the cities of Gyumri, Vanadzor and Charentsavan, Armenia Today reported .
A lot more people came on [Tuesday] because they understood that you cant just drive people out like that, Nikolai Torosyan, a journalist at the site PanArmenian.net, who has been attending the demonstrations. They came to protest not just against the electricity price hike but also against the rough way protesters were dispersed.
The sit-ins began on Friday near Yerevans opera house. On Monday night demonstrators marched toward the presidential residence, where they remained through the night. On Tuesday morning riot police sprayed seated protesters with water cannons , then marched forward to force them out. In video of the events, several bulky men in civilian clothes can be seen grabbing protesters and dragging them behind the police line.
According to police, 237 people were detained and seven demonstrators and 11 policemen were injured. They were later all released.
Torosyan told the Guardian that although he was wearing a press badge, police knocked him down and kicked him as they confronted protesters on Tuesday. Other journalists reported having their cameras broken or confiscated by police.
The protests flared up in response to a decision on 17 June by the state utilities commission to raise electricity prices by 17 to 22%, at the request of Electric Networks of Armenia , which has a monopoly on distribution. The utility company is fully owned by the Russian company Inter RAO, which is headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of president Vladimir Putin.

The price hike, which will come into effect on 1 August, is the third in the past two years and provoked anger in the poor landlocked country of three million, where unemployment was reportedly 17% in 2014 and has been rising.
Armenias growing economic woes are closely tied with those in Russia. The rouble lost half of its value in 2014 amid falling oil prices and western sanctions over Moscows role in the Ukraine crisis. As a result, remittances sent home from by Armenians working in Russia have reportedly fallen by as much as half in dollar terms.

The state utilities commission remained unwilling to back down on Wednesday, with spokeswoman Mariam Stepanyan saying it had not made decisions that need to be corrected.
Although its daughter company was behind the price hikes that drew people to the streets, Inter RAO claimed that it had no role to play.
Inter RAO believes that the events in Armenia have become political, and were engaged in business in Armenia, not politics, and we dont plan to participate in these events, spokesman Nikolai Gorelov said on Tuesday, the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reported.
Amid the standoff between Moscow and the west over the Ukraine crisis, Russian politicians have suggested the Yerevan protests could be the start of a US-orchestrated colour revolution to topple the Armenian government.
Igor Morozov, a member of the foreign affairs committee in Russias upper house of parliament, said the unrest in Armenia was exactly the same as the beginning of the Maidan protests in favour of European integration that ousted Ukraines president Viktor Yanukovych last year.

The American embassy in Armenia is also actively participating in the current events in Yerevan, Morozov told state news agency RIA Novosti.
Liberal commentators have in turn blamed the Kremlin. Opposition activist Vsevolod Chernozub tweeted a photograph of Sechin, who heads state oil champion Rosneft as well as Inter RAO, with the caption, The State Department puppet whose company suggested raising electricity prices in Armenia by 40%.

Speakers at the rally in Yerevan have reportedly denounced the idea that they were being influenced by foreign organisations or governments, and protesters have tweeted that they were simply opposing the price hike and that the demonstrations should not be compared to the Euromaidan protests in Kiev.
Although some protestors had waved European Union flags, Torosyan said they included people from all political backgrounds. This weeks events are the first major protests since demonstrations over the presidential election in 2008, he added.
Its new people who are taking part, people themselves who use these services, they are coming out on street, Torosyan said. There are not just poor people, there are middle class, nationalists, liberals. Its a very wide swath of society, and there are no political overtones.
Torosyan said he planned to join protestors again as they assembled on Wednesday evening.
Alexei Malashenko, a Caucasus and Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Centre in Moscow, called the Yerevan demonstrations ordinary economic protests, but said Armenias economic situation would likely remain bad.
Sargsyan only just signed documents with Putin that Russia will sell Armenia cheap gas, and everyone was happy, Malashenko said, referring to a 2014 deal for customs-free sale of oil products that the federation council on Wednesday extended until the end of 2015. Then they raise electricity prices, no one likes this, and they hold up EU flags... Will there be a Maidan in Armenia? I doubt it, but the fact they harshly dispersed protestors has grown the demonstrations.

Rwandan spy chief's arrest exposes the intricacies of international justice
Emmanuel Karenzi Karakes Heathrow airport detention may be justified but will be used to confirm claims that African leaders are unfairly targeted, says Simon Allison

In the last week, the international community has seen three high-profile arrests, and three explosive debates about jurisdiction. First came the arrival of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir on South African soil , and the countrys failure to arrest him for alleged crimes of genocide in Darfur  defying both the international criminal court and domestic law.
Then followed the arrest of Al-Jazeera journalist Ahmed Mansour , detained at an airport in Berlin at the request of the Egyptian government  who had convicted the reporter in absentia for allegedly torturing a lawyer during the Tahrir Square protests in 2011.
And finally, news broke on Tuesday that Rwandan spy chief Lieutenant-General Emmanuel Karenzi Karake, head of the countrys notorious National Intelligence and Security Services, had been arrested while trying to depart from Londons Heathrow airport.
So what do these three cases tell us about international justice?
Where Bashirs is an example of the top-down approach  where an international body investigates and prosecutes crimes anywhere in the world  Mansours shows national agreements and organisations such as Interpol helping countries enforce their national laws in other jurisdictions.
The arrest of Karake  one of 40 Rwandans indicted by a Spanish judge in 2008 for allegedly ordering revenge massacres in the wake of the Rwandan genocide in 1994  is a good example of universal jurisdiction in action.
The term refers to the idea that a national court may prosecute individuals for any serious crime against international law  such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and torture  based on the principle that such crimes harm the international community or international order itself, explains the International Justice Resource Centre.
The majority of states  163 of the 193 UNs member , according to Amnesty International (pdf)  provide for some kind of universal jurisdiction, but few exercise it.
Spain is a notable exception: it has actively prosecuted international crimes committed in faraway places including Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala  and now Rwanda.
Karakes arrest is a major test of universal jurisdiction in action

Karakes arrest is a major test of universal jurisdiction in action. In addition to accusations relating to the post-Rwandan genocide massacres, Karake is implicated in the killing of hundreds of civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo during fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan forces in 2000, according to Human Rights Watch.
In 2009 a Finnish court tried Francois Bazaramba, a former Rwandan preacher, with genocide and 15 counts of murder for his role in the 1994 atrocity , exercising its law which allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.
Selective justice?
But although the legal case for Britain to extradite Karake to Spain is strong, there are political considerations that will impact on the process.
Britain and the Rwandan government have a close relationship: the east African country is a major destination for British aid, and president Paul Kagame has a  close working relationship  with former British prime minister Tony Blair.
Already, Rwanda is putting on heavy diplomatic pressure to secure Karakes release, with its ambassador to the UK describing the arrest as an insult.
Williams Nkurunziza, the Rwandan high commissioner to the UK, told the BBC World Service: We take strong exception to the suggestion that hes being arrested on war crimes. Any suggestion that any of our 40 leaders are guilty of crimes against humanity is an insult to our collective conscience.
But the British government wont be able to ignore its courts  like South Africa did over Bashir.
Which begs the question: why was Karake detained in the first place? According to media reports, Karake has made several trips to Britain since 2008 but has been permitted to leave each time. This implies either that something has changed  perhaps the furore around Bashirs non-arrest forced Britains hand  or that some border official was a little over-zealous in the execution of his duties.

Another factor that politicians will be considering is the ramifications that extraditing Karake will have on the already strained relations between the African continent and organs of international justice.
Karakes arrest is a public relations coup for African leaders looking for further justification that they are being unfairly targeted by the western justice.
In December Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, said the international criminal court is a tool to target Africa, while Rwandas own president Paul Kagame accused the court of selective justice . This is in some sense true: since its establishment in 2002, the ICC has heard 22 cases and indicted 32 individuals . All of them are African.
While there are sound reasons for the German court to have released Mansour  and for Britain to extradite Karake  these decisions could easily be portrayed by disgruntled African states as western judiciaries unfairly choosing to enforce only western arrest warrants (in the case of Spain and Karake) while neglecting African cases (in the case of Egypt and Mansour).
Britain is now in a delicate position. If it does go ahead with extradition proceedings it risks angering an important ally on the African continent and alienating their supporters  while giving self-interested leaders more fuel for their claims of western bias in international justice.
If it doesnt uphold the case, it will have to defy its own rule of law, potentially dealing a crippling blow to the concept of universal jurisdiction in the process. Its a legal and political minefield.

Lord Janner is to face justice in a trial of the facts after an independent QC overturned the decision of the director of public prosecutions not to charge him with child sexual abuse, the Crown Prosecution Service will announce on Monday.
The decision will increase pressure on Alison Saunders, the DPP, who has faced calls to resign over her failure to charge Janner with a string of sexual abuse charges dating back to the 1960s.
It is understood the review will recommend he faces a trial of the facts at which he is unlikely to be present.
Saunders said in April it was not in the public interest to charge Janner, because he suffers from dementia, but she was challenged by alleged victims in a formal process known as the right to review. It is believed to be one of the first times that alleged victims have overturned a DPPs decision.
Liz Dux, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon representing many of the alleged victims, said: My clients are delighted by this decision. It is a total vindication of why they challenged the original decision of the DPP. All they have ever wanted was to give their evidence in a court and have findings of fact established. They have been denied this right for many many years but now their faith in British justice is restored and they look forward to being listened to after so long.
The QC who carried out the review has found that the former Labour MP should be charged and face a trial of the fact in court. It will be the first time that allegations against Janner  which have been investigated in the past in three failed police investigations  will be aired in public in a courtroom.
Saunders said in April there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 charges of child sex abuse between 1969 and 1988, but she said his dementia meant it was not in the public interest to charge him as he would not understand the proceedings or be able to take part in them.
She overruled a specialist QC, Eleanor Laws, an expert in child abuse law, who recommended that the peer be charged. The DPPs decision led to an extraordinary rift with Leicestershire police, who spent two years investigating Janner in the latest inquiry and said Saunders failure to charge him was peverse. The force threatened legal action to overturn the DPPs decision.
The family of the 86-year-old peer have said he is innocent of any of the allegations.

Minimum alcohol pricing cuts serious crime, study reveals

Imposing a minimum unit price for alcohol leads to a dramatic fall in drink-related crime, including murders, sexual assaults and drink-driving, a new study shows.
Crimes perpetrated against people, including violent assaults, fell by 9.17% when the price of alcohol was increased by 10% over nine years in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Motoring offences linked to alcohol, such as killing or injuring someone with a vehicle and refusing to take a breath test, fell even more  by 18.8%  the study found.
The findings are the latest evidence that introducing a minimum unit price, a policy that David Cameron championed but later abandoned, yields major benefits. Previous studies have already shown that the policy cuts alcohol-related hospital admissions, saves lives and reduces consumption.
The research, published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs , shows how the big falls in those two types of crime occurred between 2002 and 2010 after the government of British Columbia put up the floor price of alcohol  that is, the legal minimum it can be sold for  by 10%.
Strong associations were observed between the values of minimum alcohol prices and both alcohol-related traffic violations and crimes against persons, the seven authors write. They were led by Professor Tim Stockwell, an international expert in minimum unit pricing, who is the director of the Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia.
It appears that minimum pricing is a powerful tool for reducing alcohol-related harm at the individual and societal level, Stockwell said.
The study prompted renewed calls for ministers to introduce the policy. We hope [it] will encourage the new government to act. With Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales planning to introduce minimum pricing, Westminster surely must take the same path to protect the health and wellbeing of its citizens, said Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the campaign group Alcohol Health Alliance UK.
Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: With a million alcohol-related crimes costing the economy 11bn each year, the government cant afford to ignore evidence for a policy that could reduce crime by 9%.
In 2012 the then coalition government committed to implementing minimum pricing. Its own consultation concluded that that would lead to 5,240 fewer crimes a year. But ministers did a U-turn in 2013, claiming that there was not enough concrete evidence to justify proceeding.
They instead brought in a ban on below-cost selling of alcohol products, often by supermarkets. But experts claim that that approach is far less effective than minimum pricing.
Minimum unit pricing remains a policy under consideration and we are monitoring developments across the world, said a government spokesman.

A protest against the closure of remote Aboriginal communities blocked streets in central Sydney on Sunday, as about 600 people marched against the Western Australian governments plans to wind back support for communities it deems arent viable.
The protest began at Town Hall at 1pm on Sunday and moved toward The Block in Redfern, closing George, Lee, Regent and Lawson Streets on the way.

Its the third national call to action and the sixth time protests have shut down an Australian capital city in protest against the plan to overhaul funding to the states 247 remote Aboriginal communities, which the premier, Colin Barnett, has said will result in significantly fewer homelands communities remaining open.

Barnett raised the prospect of remote community closures in November, saying that up to 150 communities faced closure after the Abbott government shifted responsibility for municipal services funding on to the state. The funding shift will see direct federal funding cease from 1 July, but WA has been given an extra $90m  equivalent to three years funding under the old scheme.

At the same time, WA has developed its own major reforms for service delivery in remote Aboriginal communities, which is expected to lead to the closure, through withholding services from some communities, of a number of less populated communities over the next few years.
Details are scarce and the full model is yet to be worked out. Nominations for Aboriginal leaders to join the regional working groups intended to steer the reforms closed this month.
Protest organisers, rallied around the #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA hashtag on social media, have been ramping up activities since Friday ahead of July 1  the day federal funding to WAs remote communities formally switches over to the state.

Within hours of the supreme courts Friday decision on same-sex marriage , people with a certain number of progressively minded friends found their Facebook newsfeeds dominated by rainbow-colored profile pictures created by a special link on the website.
The gambit successfully put Facebooks equality credentials in the spotlight. But it was challenged on Saturday at San Francisco Pride, an event the company sponsored.
The Radical Faeries, one of the more idiosyncratic groups at San Franciscos Pride, said the festival should dump Facebook as a sponsor because of the companys ban on adopted names.
The policy was unfair to LGBT people who use adopted names to avoid homophobia or to express their true identity, they said.
I dont like anybody telling me who I am or have to be, said Storm Arcana, 42, seated on a rug in the Faerie Freedom Village, a colourful camp near city hall.
Thats anathema to my essence. Im self-defined and self-described and that is my right. He objected to Facebook sponsoring Pride. Theres too much of a contrast between what they represent and what we represent.
The #MyNameIs organization has been fighting for Facebook company to change its name policy. It demonstrated against it at San Francisco Pride.
The group is led by San Francisco-based drag queens but also includes domestic abuse survivors, Native Americans and other people who feel that they should be allowed to use names different from those that appear on their birth certificate. Facebook, which has met members of the group, has slightly amended its policy but insists that it distinguishes itself from other social networks by refusing to let people be anonymous.
This policy directly harms LGBTQ people, especially transgender and queer people around the world who face daily discrimination, and use social media like Facebook to find support, build community, and express their authentic selves, said organizer and drag queen Lil Miss Hot mess in a statement.
Facebook may seem like a trivial waste of time, but for trans people and LGBTQ youth who face disproportionate rates of violence and suicide, it can literally be a lifeline.
The #MyNameIs group tried to ban Facebook from the parade with an online petition that collected more than 2,500 signatures. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.
But the company remained as a sponsor, to the dismay of the #MyNameIs organizers and the Radical Faeries, a group which blends counter-cultural values, queer consciousness and spirituality.
Many members said they had been expelled from Facebook because they could not supply documentation to prove their adopted names were real.
Lovely Day, a 48-year-old woman who adopted that name six years ago, said Facebook suspended her account on Christmas Day, saying she needed to prove its authenticity. The suspension came soon after she posted videos of controversial police shootings, prompting her suspicion that trolls who disliked her viewpoint alerted Facebook.
She lamented that the company was a festival sponsor.
Im not really into it but I cant change what corporate dollars do, she said.
Day had a consolation: she is still able to use a Facebook account registered as Bobbi Terri, the names of two plastic trans dolls she takes on trips.
I cant have an account, she said, but the dolls, sure.
Other Faeries accused the tech giant of wanting to use only names that appeared on credit cards in order to monetize data.
Stellara Solanum, 31, bristled that he must his birth name, Kevin Faulkner, on Facebook even though friends know him as Stellara, which he considers more meaningful.
My housemate spent a lot more getting to know me before naming me than my parents did, he said.
Solanum said he now struggled to recognise friends on Facebook because they were obliged to use birth names which he did not recognise.
Now its, who the hell is John Stone? Its disconnecting me.
The problem was gravest for queers facing homophobic threats, and native Americans, he said, adding: Theyre the ones I feel sorry for.
On Saturday, a former Facebook employee wrote on Medium that her profile was suspended because she goes by a name different from the one she was born with. She said the ban happened while she was at trans pride on Friday, the day the supreme court announced that same-sex marriage is legal in every US state.
If youre a marginalised person, such as a trans person, you may be left with no way to get back on, she wrote.
Facebook have handed an enormous hammer to those who would like to silence us, and time after time I see that hammer coming down on trans women who have just stepped out of line by suggesting that perhaps were being mistreated.

The mother of a man shot three times as he tried to save his fiancee from a terrorist gunman said she was relieved the couple were back on British soil.
Mathew James  from Trehafod, Pontypridd, south Wales  was hit in the hip, chest and pelvis as he shielded Saera Wilson from gunfire at the Tunisian beach resort of Sousse, where 38 people were murdered.
Kathryn Matthews said it was the most fantastic feeling seeing Saera, 30, step off the plane while her son was carried on a stretcher behind her.

As well as speaking of her relief, she told friends on Facebook that her son  known to pals as Sas  had held the hand of a dying man who had also been shot.
Writing on Facebook, she said: Sas and Saera are back on home turf and safe. Hes in good spirits and is getting the very best of care.
It was the most fantastic feeling seeing Saera step off the plane &amp; Sas stretchered off ... [they are] back where they belong. So proud of him, after being the first to be shot and making sure Saera got to safety, he held the hand of an elderly gent who lay dying next to him, totally overwhelmed by it all.
Matthews said her son was looking forward to being reunited with his children, Tegan, six, and 14-month-old Kaden.
In the meantime, donations to a fundraising page in honour of James, a gas-fitter, continue to flood in; more than 10,000 has been raised in less than 24 hours. The pages organiser Ian Spedding, 53, from Burnley, Lancashire, said he felt compelled to do something even though he did not know the Welsh couple.
He said: We heard about the story and were discussing it on some gas engineer forums, and it occurred to us that he might not be able to work for a while. Hes one of our own and we look out for our own. If hes not working, his family will need the support and its good to see everyone rallying around him.
Jamess mother said her family had been touched by peoples kindness and messages of support. It has done so much to help us through a very traumatic time. [There is] a long road ahead for Sas physically .... and emotionally.
His family issued a statement through South Wales police confirming he and his future wife had arrived back home. A spokesman said: Mathew is currently in a stable and comfortable condition in hospital. He and his fiancee Saera are doing well, and are happy to be back in the UK.
They wish to thank all of the medical teams in both Tunisia and the UK for all of their professional assistance, care and support. They would also like to thank everyone involved in ensuring their safe return to the UK and the support shown by family, friends and the public.

Lorna Carty, an Irish national, was on holiday with her husband, who was recovering from heart surgery. Family and friends said the break in Tunisia was a gift after her husband Declan, a dairy farmer, had his operation.
A mother of two, who was in her mid-50s, is believed to have gone to the beach alone when the gunman struck. Declan Carty, who was inside the hotel at the time, was uninjured and is said to be absolutely distraught.
Lorna rushed her husband to hospital about a fortnight ago after he was getting pains in his heart. He had to get stents in, a family friend said. They went out to Tunisia to have a bit of a holiday after the operation.
Carty was a nurse in a GP surgery in Navan. She has a son and a daughter, and the family are keen supporters of the local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Her son, Simon Carty, 21, is on the Meath Senior Gaelic Athletic Assocation football team and was looking after their small farm while his parents went away, according to Associated Press. Her daughter Hazel, 18, is understood to be on a separate holiday after finishing her school exams.
Simon Carty has flown out to Tunisia to be at his father Declans side. His sister Hazel has arrived back in Ireland from a holiday in Turkey as the Robinstown community in Co Meath prepare for Lorna Cartys funeral, which may take place this week.
Laurence and Martina Hayes from Co Westmeath, Ireland
The latest Irish victims of the Tunisian terror attack have been confirmed as Laurence and Martina Hayes, a couple in their 50s, who had one daughter, 30-year-old Sinead.
Laurence Hayes was a bus inspector for the Bus Eireann coach company and was well known in his home town of Athlone in the Irish midlands. His wife Martina originally came from a large well-respected farming family in Kiltoom, Co Roscommon, not far from Athlone.
Lana Lemaire from Namur, southern Belgium
Lana Lemaire, the Ukrainian wife of the injured Belgian national Emile Lemaire, lived in Namur, in the southern French-speaking region of Wallonia, according to Belgian media.
Lemaire had a grownup son and worked in the kitchens at the Saint-Luc medical clinic in the Bouge area of the city, reports say.
A spokesman for the municipal authority told local media her husband was a well-known figure on the local basketball scene, where he had been a volunteer for decades. Police have been mobilised to provide psychological support and appropriate assistance to Mr Lemaire and his family, a spokesman told La Libre.
Emile Lemaire, who was on holiday with his wife and two friends, related their ordeal on Friday in an interview with LAvenir . He described them taking refuge under chairs as the gunman opened fire on the beach, hitting him in the arm.
When he spoke to the media, his wife had been taken to hospital unconscious, but he had not known where. He was desperately trying to make contact with the Belgian and Tunisian authorities. He was told on Saturday that she had died.

Greek referendum call prolongs political uncertainty and raises capital fears

For Greek companies, the developments since Friday night could scarcely have been worse.
The calling of a referendum will prolong the political uncertainty that a senior company executive said was driving us nuts.
The failure of the Greek government to reach agreement with the rest of the eurozones finance ministers has raised fears of the European Central Bank (ECB) rejecting Greeces request for continued emergency lending to keep its banks afloat. The management of the ECB meets on Sunday, the current bailout programme for Greece expires on Tuesday and the referendum has been called for Sunday 5 July.
The ECB had already restricted the flow as the talks built to a climax. What has changed in the last few days is that instead of leaving us with a [cash] buffer of 3 bn, they have reduced it to 1 bn, said a senior banker speaking on condition of anonymity.
The ECB may now cut off the flow of cash altogether once the current bailout programme expires on Tuesday  if not before. The picture thereafter is unclear.
We have lost approximately 25% of our deposits since 2014, said the banker. What remains is going to have to be looked after carefully. Limits on how much depositors can withdraw from their accounts, restrictions on international transfers  and even perhaps shuttered banks  are all now on the cards.
We are ready for everything , said the executive, who works for of one of Greeces biggest conglomerates.
We have foreign banks ready to support us and enough cash to deal with payments inside and outside Greece We have ensured that, for a long period ahead, we have everything we need, she said. That included raw materials and other supplies, said the executive who requested anonymity on grounds of commercial confidentiality.
I am sure the five or six biggest Greek corporations have made preparations. But medium-sized and small firms, even if they knew how to, could not. Theyre exclusively based here and they work with the Greek banks, she added.
Much will depend on how long the crisis lasts. Companies have taken billions of euros from the banks. Bank of Greece figures show that, of the 134 bn private sector deposits at the end of April, only 19 bn were corporate.

But the country needs cash to keep operating. Michael Massourakis, chief economist of SEV, which represents Greeces 300 biggest firms, said: I find it unbelievable that this economy, which is basically a cash economy, can function for long without cash. Massourakis said that the payment culture has deteriorated: people had been hoarding cash and were failing to meet their obligations, even before the latest dramatic turn of events. That could only get worse.
It is going to be like a chain reaction, he said. If I dont get paid, I wont pay you, and so on.
Massourakis also believed that the stultifying impact of capital controls could be amplified by the state of Greeces bureaucracy. You will need special licences to import and export. But the public administration has suffered wage cuts and morale is low, he said. We risk going back to the Soviet Union.

Turnbull says US court decision will add to momentum for same-sex marriage

Malcolm Turnbull says the US supreme court decision that made same-sex marriage legal across the US will add to the momentum for marriage equality in Australia but Tony Abbott remains unmoved by the decision.
Turnbull said: There has been a remarkably rapid change in attitudes on this social policy issue and indeed now all of the English-speaking countries that we are closest to  Britain, Ireland, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, South Africa  they all allow gay marriage so the fact is there has been a sea change around the world.
The leader of the house, Christopher Pyne, described the decision as fascinating .
When we come back in spring theres every possibility that will be back on the agenda, he said, adding that a vote should be held this year.
But as opponents of same-sex marriage in the US vowed to move to Australia , Abbott said developments in Ireland and the US had not changed his views.
I note the US supreme court decision, he said. I havent had a chance to study it but, look, what happens in the United States is obviously a matter for the United States just as what happened in Ireland a few weeks ago is a matter for the Irish.

As for our own country, obviously, there is a community debate going on. I have views on this subject which are pretty well known and they havent changed.
The US supreme court decision on Friday made same-sex marriages legal across the entire country in what may prove the most important civil rights case in a generation.
Five of the nine court justices on the court determined that the right to marriage equality was enshrined under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.
Rodney Croome, of Australian Marriage Equality , said he had been in touch with Coalition supporters of marriage equality who felt the court decision would have a positive impact of the chances of reform.
If the Irish vote made Australias failure to move forward on marriage equality embarrassing, the United States decision makes it untenable, said Croome.

One of the reasons is because US supreme court is regarded as a relatively conservative court. Its not a radical judicial body and this lends their decision increased credibility.
The principles of the American republic, which are admired by many Australian politicians, have now been extended to same-sex marriage; principles like rule of law, equality, freedom and the separation of church and state.
There are many Coalition members who have a strong interest in american politics and look to the United States for leadership on a range of issues and for those members this ruling will be quite interesting.
Supporters of marriage equality in the Coalition are expecting the vote will be debated in the Liberal and National party rooms in August when the parliament returns after the winter break.

One by one they came, smiling for the cameras, voicing optimism that at long last this day had arrived: the day when Greeks could decide for themselves.
Any doubts that the leftwing government in Athens would cave into the demands of the international creditors keeping Greece afloat were firmly dispelled on Saturday as the countrys great debt drama entered another act.
In scenes that spoke more of defiance than fear, leading Syriza party figures applauded prime minister Alexis Tsiprass surprise decision to give Greek voters the final say over the terms of a bailout deal proposed by the EU and IMF.
The high-stakes move of calling a referendum only days away from the deadline for a 1.6bn (1.1bn) loan repayment to the IMF may have raised fears of default  and cast an even longer shadow over Greeces future in the eurozone  but in governing circles this weekend it was welcomed with nothing short of glee.
On 5 July Greeks will have the opportunity to say a resounding no to their brazen demands, deputy social security minister Dimitris Stratoulis told reporters before a parliamentary debate on the referendum. And that will arm the government with a new determination to apply its programme. I am optimistic, very optimistic.
After several days of heated discussions in Brussels, the Greek prime minister returned to Athens late on Friday, rejecting the 8bn worth of tax rises, pension cuts and wage cuts that creditors had set as the precondition for the release of desperately needed bailout funds. In exchange for the hard-hitting measures, the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund had offered to extend Greeces current rescue programme until November, propping up its near-bankrupt economy with 15.5bn in emergency loans.
In a televised address that followed a cabinet meeting at 1am on Saturday, Tsipras said that the offer amounted to an ultimatum at odds with the founding principles and values of Europe . These proposals, which clearly violate European rules and the basic rights to work, equality and dignity, show the purpose of some was not a viable agreement, but possibly the humiliation of an entire people, he said.
After five months of fraught negotiations with creditors, they were impossible to accept. It is now up to the Greek people to decide, Tsipras proclaimed, adding that voters would be posed with a simple question: whether they accepted or rejected the terms of the lenders latest financial lifeline.
News of the referendum sent shudders through Greece. Since late 2009, when it became clear that without help the Greek economy was heading towards insolvency, the country has lost more than a quarter of its GDP and seen unemployment reach a record 27% and poverty levels soar.
Fears that the population may now refuse to swallow the price of further assistance was evident on the streets yesterday, when depositors worried about imminent capital controls rushed to withdraw cash from banks.
The mood is very brittle, said Giorgos Christodoulakis, a newspaper vendor. Theres an element of uncertainty that has really unnerved people. If we do go ahead with this referendum, nobody can say for sure which way it will go.
Takis Kanellopoulos, an employee in a fur shop in Plaka, the picturesque district beneath the Acropolis, said he was concerned that many would not understand the consequences of a No vote. Everybody I have spoken to today has said they will reject the proposals, mostly out of spite for the Germans, he said. But that could have devastating effects for our economy.
The plebiscite, the first to be held since 1974, when Greeks rejected the monarchy in favour of becoming a republic, could be one of the worst mistakes the country has committed in modern times, analysts said.
Speaking to the Observer, Aristides Hatzis, a prominent professor of economics and law at Athens University, likened the decision to the government acting like a suicide bomber.
It is a very risky decision that could jeopardise Greeces position not only in the eurozone but the EU, he said. I thought Tsipras would be pragmatic and accept a deal that would ultimately have allowed him to consolidate his position on the moderate left. Instead, with this decision he has allowed his ideologue, Bolshevik side to take over. It is as if he wants to transform this country into Venezuela, but the problem is it would become a Venezuela without the oil.
Catapulted into power on a platform to end austerity, the leftwing Syriza government vehemently denied that it was posing Greeks with the dilemma of remaining in the euro or returning to its own currency.
They accuse us of wanting the drachma  there is no such thought, said the health minister, Panagiotis Koroumblis. But I defy any serious Greek to say that what [the creditors] have proposed is good for this country. If we adopt them, it will kill tourism, dismantle our pharmaceutical trade, totally demolish our productive base. We were voted in to end austerity, not kill off the country.
But in an electric atmosphere, it was becoming clear last night that the referendum would further polarise the country between those who want to remain in the euro at any cost and those who now want out.
Syriza is trying to make its own problem the problem of the country and that is immensely dangerous, said the former development minister Kostis Hatzidakis. The dilemma it is posing is false and, at great peril, could lead us into uncharted waters.

What happens on Monday when the banks open?
The Greek central bank has kept the main banks supplied with euro notes. Most branches that opened on Saturday were able to keep churning out notes with a few exceptions put down to administrative hiccups.
ATMs are also expected to be working on Monday, though it is likely that the long queues in some parts of Athens, Thessaloniki and other cities will have forced some of them to be closed.
Much depends on how united the government remains in the face of a backlash from Brussels, which forced the Papandreou government to abandon a similar referendum in 2011. A Northern Rock-style panic could see billions of euros withdrawn electronically by savers and businesses, as happened last week. This would force the ECB to supply further funds to the Greek central bank to cover the shortfall.
What happens on Tuesday when the current bailout expires?
At this point European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and the Frankfurt-based organisations board will need to decide if the decision to hold a referendum warrants an extension of its support.
The ECB has purchased Greek bank assets at a discount to maintain a flow of funds from Frankfurt to Athens. If the ECB freezes the operation, the Greek banks would soon run out of cash, forcing the government to impose capital controls.
Will the ECB maintain its funding operation?
Unlikely. Draghi has already made it known that he wants EU politicians  not the ECB  to decide on the fate of Greece . In the meantime Draghi will keep funds flowing to Athens. However, the agreement by EU finance ministers to cut off funding from Tuesday is expected to force his hand.
What about the repayment of 1.6bn to the IMF?
This payment will be missed. It is made up of three separate debt payments due this month rolled up by Athens and delayed until 30 June. A further delay puts Greece in arrears, the IMF said, but not default. Creditors know that calling repayment delays a default could allow private investors, holding about 100bn of debt, to demand their money back and push the country into bankruptcy.
How will a referendum resolve the matter?
It wont, unless voters accept the creditors terms. A vote to accept their demands will bring forward pension reforms (ending early retirement this week, not over a period of several years), higher VAT rates on medical supplies, catering and purchases made on Greek islands, while abandoning proposals to increase corporation tax rates.
Rejecting the demands will put Syriza back at the negotiating table to repeat its central demand  that expensive short-term loans with the ECB be swapped for cheaper long-term loans with the commission.
Would the creditors back down should voters reject their proposals?
Brussels and the IMF are likely to view the verdict as a preference for life outside the euro, where rules exist to borrow from a central fund and repay according to a negotiated timetable, just as the Irish and Portuguese have done.
The creditors have admitted mistakes in underestimating the damaging effects of previous demands for public spending cuts as the price of bigger loans.
However, it is now the view of most eurozone countries that pension reforms in particular are needed to stabilise Athens perilous finances, especially the need to prevent 400,000 people who currently qualify for an early retirement pension being able to somehow get under the wire and claim one.

I set my phone to silent, dressed myself entirely in black and walked calmly and purposefully through the hotel lobby. Outside I hailed a cab and directed the driver to take me to the point where the town ended, about 200 yards from the river. There, at the end of a row of low buildings, was the derelict house among the trees where I was to meet my mother and brother. I crouched down behind an old garden wall and waited. The place was cold and damp and smelled of mouldering leaves and animal droppings. I peeped over the wall and saw North Korean border patrols passing on the opposite bank of the river. In the half-tones beneath the trees, I felt camouflaged.
The sunset looked ominous, a palette of murky reds and yellows. On the other side of the water Hyesan seemed lifeless, a city dug from rock, or an intricate cemetery. A place of ghosts and wild dogs.
Min-ho had told me he would lead our mother waist-high through the water and help her up one of the ladders on the Chinese bank. The water must be freezing.
I checked the time on my phone every minute for an hour. Night had fallen like a cloud of ash. I could see nothing on the other side of the river. The power was out in Hyesan.
I had not seen my mother in 11 years. In the half-light I saw a strained, old face and a body moving stiffly
The blood was no longer circulating in my hands and feet. The temperature was dropping by the minute. I didnt know whether my teeth were chattering from cold or panic. Where are they?
Another hour went by. Then out of the darkness someone called: Ya! My heart went into overdrive. Along the North Korean bank a beam of light was bouncing on the dirt track. Border guards, patrolling in pairs, greeting another patrol. They were passing every two minutes. I didnt remember there being so many guards. They were just 50 yards away from me. I could hear their conversation.
One patrol had a dog, which turned its head towards me and barked, setting off a dozen other dogs. A memory came to me, long suppressed, of seeing blood on the ice one morning. A failed escape. I put my hands to my ears. If the dogs would stop barking
My phone was buzzing. Min-hos voice was fast and tense: Weve had a problem.
Quickly Min-ho explained that just as he and my mother had been about to cross they had walked straight into a border guard. Luckily he was someone Min-ho did business with. The guard told him there was a general alert out for a high-ranking family from Pyongyang that was attempting to escape this very night. There were extra guards all along the river, he said, as well as Bowibu (secret police) agents. The whole area was in lockdown. The guard then asked Min-ho to stay a while and keep him company while he kept a lookout. At that moment, my mother had said good night and had walked away.
Min-ho said he and my mother would try again to cross just before dawn. I returned to Changbai. I went back to the hotel and tried to doze for a while in my clothes. I must have drifted off, because the next thing I knew the phone was buzzing next to my face.
Well be there at six, Min-ho said. I jumped off the bed. Minutes later, as I was in the taxi, he called again. Were across. Were hiding in the derelict house.

I was elated. I had not seen my dear mother in 11 years, nine months and nine days. Now I was minutes away from her. I asked the driver to wait and walked across the rough ground toward the riverbank. The sky to the east was turning a faint duck-egg blue. Then there, about 50 yards ahead, next to the derelict house, I made out the silhouettes of two figures. They were walking at a crouch, coming toward me.
My Omma. In the half-light I saw a strained, old face and a body moving very stiffly. Min-ho was behind her, protective and guiding with his arm around her.
I ran to meet them, but there was no time for a reunion. We have to go, I said.
We were exposed, between the river and the town. I pulled out the clothes I had brought for them to help them blend in on the Chinese side. Put these on. Over what youre wearing. Quick. Once they were dressed I led them towards the taxi. Act normal, but dont speak. Hell think youre locals.
My heart went into overdrive. I didnt remember there being so many guards. they were just 50 yards away from me
We sat in silence for the 10-minute ride. The hotel lobby was empty when we arrived and the sole receptionist was engrossed in her cellphone. I closed the room door behind me. For a moment we looked at each other. Half a lifetime had passed since the three of us had been together. No one could speak. Then my mother broke down, weeping uncontrollably. Over her shoulder, Min-hos face looked immensely sad. Hed shared her pain all these years. And soon he would say goodbye to her and probably never see her again.
My mind still held the image of her face the night Id last seen her. She was 42 then, and a woman of so much energy she could hardly sit still. Now she was 54, but she looked much older. She was far thinner than I remembered, and her mouth was drawn and lined. I held her: the clothes she had on underneath were icy and soaking wet. Why are you so spotty? my mother said, as if no time had passed.
After theyd run into the border guard on the riverbank, Min-ho had kept the guard company for a few hours then gone back to Yoon-jis house, where hed been living with her and her parents. Their wedding plans were under way.
I couldnt let Yoon-ji know I was helping Omma escape, Min-ho said. If wed come over last night, I was just going to call her and say I was here on business and would be back in a day or two. She was still asleep when I left this morning. I wrote her a note.
Two guards had been patrolling when Min-ho had returned to the riverbank with my mother just before dawn. He told them she was a client meeting someone in China and would be coming back.
I told them she was paying me big money, so Ill have to give them something when I go back. While we were talking, more guards appeared. Suddenly there were nine of them. But the guys all know me. Its not a problem. I just said goodbye and crossed.

The irony was all too much. I started giggling and couldnt stop. The border crossing is the most dangerous moment for anyone attempting to escape. But my brother and mother had been waved off by every armed border guard along that stretch of the river. Next thing I knew all three of us were weeping with laughter.
As we went down in the lift the next morning I told my mother and Min-ho not to speak too loudly at breakfast. I was worried that Min-ho stood out. He was the youngest person in the hotel. The other guests were middle-aged or elderly.
After breakfast we ventured out, disciplining ourselves to say as little as possible. Strong North Korean accents would be conspicuous. We went shopping at a market so I could show them the wealth of goods on display. Then I took them to lunch at an upmarket Korean restaurant. Id figured, again, that this was the last place anyone would expect to spot escaped North Koreans. But I also wanted to treat them. Soon Min-ho would be leaving us, and I wanted us all to have a wonderful memory of our last time together.
Back in the hotel room, Min-ho turned his phone on. It rang straight away. It was Yoon-ji. She was shouting the moment he answered. My mother and I could hear every word.
Where are you? Whos the bitch you were with?
Why?
Dont you know whats happening?
Calm down. Whats the matter?
Everyone is going crazy here. The senior guard who let you across is here at the house. Hes in a panic.
Why?
Someone informed his commander that youd gone across with a woman. The commander says if you come back with her right now youll be all right. But if you come back alone youll be in deep trouble. And so will the guard, for letting you cross. Theyll accuse you of human trafficking.
My brother collapsed on the bed. If he went back to North korea alone, the secret police would break him
Min-ho hung up and collapsed onto the bed with his hands over his face. He was in an impossible dilemma. He had to go back but couldnt return with my mother  or theyd ask what she was doing in China. The answer could only be to meet me. If he went back alone, hed be accused of human trafficking and interrogated. The Bowibu would break him and quickly get to the truth  that he was helping his mother to defect. Hed face political prison, a zone of no return. His life would be over.
I went to the window and my forehead hit the glass with a thump. Not in any of the disaster scenarios Id envisaged had I imagined a complication such as this. For several minutes we said nothing, sunk in our own thoughts. I broke the silence.
Min-ho, if you go back youll be in terrible trouble, I said, speaking slowly and evenly. If you both go back itll be worse. Omma cant go back with you. That leaves us two choices. We can hope that your connections with the guards will get you out of this I was talking to him but he made no sign that he was hearing me. The other choice is dont go back.
My words filled the room.
Your friend the guard will be finished. Im very sorry about him. But were your family. Min-ho, you cant go back. You just cant. Itll be so dangerous. You have to come with us. I hadnt planned for this, but well figure it out somehow.
Min-ho was in shock. I cant go back. His voice was a whisper. We all know that. His phone rang. Yoon-ji again. Are you on your way? she asked. Its going to take me one more day, he said quietly. He was buying time to figure out how he was going to tell her. Her parents liked him and had connections that could help him. But if they thought he was running out on her, they also had the power to stop him getting far. The Bowibu were permitted to operate in China to track down escapers.
Youve got to come back, she cried. We could hear her weeping. Shed sensed he wasnt going to come.

In the morning we decided to leave Changbai as fast as possible. Min-ho was dreading turning on his phone. It rang within seconds. Yoon-ji was calling again. Tell me the woman youre with. Is she really a stranger? Or is she your mother? Just say the truth.
Shes my mother, he said. My sister came for her. Thats why I crossed.
She started crying again. Min-ho, please come back. She was begging him. You left me a note but all the time you knew you were going for good. How could you leave me sleeping without saying goodbye?
Min-hos lip trembled. Please believe me. I wanted to go back. I still do. But I cant take Omma back. So how can I go back alone now? Check the money in the drawer. Its all there. If I were going for good, would I leave it all there?
I believe you, she said. Just come back.
Min-ho. A mans voice, now. Stern. Yoon-jis father. Please return right away. Im begging you, for Yoon-ji. Min-ho didnt answer. He was breathing deeply. The look on his face was one I remembered from when he was a little boy and wished something wasnt happening to him. I took the phone from his hand.
This is Min-hos sister, I said, hearing the coolness in my voice. We want him to go back; he wants to go back. Whatever he does now is dangerous. But please understand that returning now is the more dangerous option.
I could hear Yoon-ji in the background crying almost hysterically. I ended the call and, without expecting to, burst into tears. I was exhausted. I looked over at my mother, who had remained silent this whole time. I could only imagine the guilt she was feeling. She had been the rock of our lives, always able to solve any problem, fix any situation.
Im going to take a shower, Min-ho said.
My mother shot me a puzzled look. He closed the bathroom door. We heard him turn on the taps and flush the toilet. Then the shower came on with a hiss. We could hear him sobbing. He had nothing left but his body and the clothes on his back.
A few minutes later he came out, dressed and towelling his hair dry. We pretended we hadnt heard. He had regained his composure.
So, whats the plan?
Were leaving in under an hour.

The barbed wire lacerated my back. I was trembling uncontrollably. After long hours spent waiting for nightfall, to avoid attracting the attention of Turkish soldiers, I finally raised my head and gazed up at the distant sky, darkening to black. Under the wire fence marking the line of the border a tiny burrow had been dug out, just big enough for one person. My feet sank into the soil and the barbs mauled my back as I crawled across the line of separation between the two countries.
I took a deep breath, arched my back and ran as fast as I could, just as they had told me to do. Fast. Half an hour at a sprint  thats the distance you have to cover before youve safely crossed the border. I ran and ran until we [my guides and I] were out of the danger zone.
The ground was treacherous and rocky, but my feet felt light as I sprinted. The pounding of my heart carried me, lifting me up. Panting, I murmured to myself: Im back! This isnt a scene in a film, this is real. I ran, mouthing, Im back Im here. Behind us, we heard gunshots and military vehicles moving around on the Turkish side, but wed done it: we were through and we were running. It felt like it had all been fated long ago. Id put on a headscarf especially and a long jacket and loose-fitting trousers. We had a steep hill to climb before we hurtled down the other side towards the waiting car. On this occasion, we werent part of a convoy of strangers. At the time, I didnt even know if I would ever manage to write about it later; somehow Id just assumed I would die, like so many others, when I returned to my homeland. Darkness settled in for the night and everything seemed normal, as expected, or so it seemed.
Later on, after I had made this crossing a number of times over 18 months, I saw many changes: the chaotic state of Antakya airport, near the border, would be ample evidence of what was happening to Syria . I stowed it all away in the back of my mind, along with everything else that testified to the rapid and profound upheavals taking place in my country.
Before crossing the border, I had visited a hospital in the Turkish town of Reyhanli, where there was a special emergency floor dedicated to Syrians wounded by shelling. One room after another reeked of putrefying patients laid out on white sheets, with mutilated feet, amputated limbs, hazy eyes. I was accompanied by Maysara [my guide] and his brother-in-law, Manhal, who was one of the first activists to embrace the revolution in Saraqeb.

Manhal warned me to brace myself as we entered the room of two young girls, four-year-old Diana and 11-year-old Shaima. Diana had been hit in the spinal cord by a bullet, causing permanent paralysis. She lay there frozen, like a panic-stricken rabbit. It seemed a miracle that her small, fragile body hadnt been completely blown apart under the impact. The little girl had been crossing the street to buy a pastry for breakfast when it happened. What on earth was the sniper thinking when he aimed his sights on her back?
In the hospital bed next to Diana was Shaima, whose leg had been blown off by a shell and whose left hand had been shattered by shrapnel. Her other foot was also injured and wounds covered her body. She and her family had been taken by surprise as they sat in front of their house. Nine members of her family were killed, including her mother. Her aunt stood at her bedside.
As Shaima looked at me, her gaze was an unsettling mixture of pleading and anger. A white bandage was wrapped around her pelvis, stopping at her upper thigh. There was an empty space where her leg should have been. We are made whole by our imperfections, I thought to myself. And we are incomplete when we are whole. But there was nothing I could say to this child. My fingers touched her forehead. She smiled.
Shaima and Diana were not alone on the floor. In the next room was a young lad waiting for his leg to be amputated after it had been blown apart by a shell. Yet he laughed with his eyes. Another young man was waiting to have his foot cleaned up and shrapnel removed, so he could return to Syria to carry on fighting. He was a group commander called Abdullah who, when I next met him during my second trip back, would make time to talk to me and we would become friends. I didnt know it then, but my third crossing into Syria would be undertaken with him and, in spite of the falling shells, I would have coffee with his beautiful fiancee.
In the wards of that Turkish hospital, just before the border, lay Syrians whose limbs had been left in the dirt. These young people, lying there with their mangled half-bodies, gazed out of the hospital window in the direction of their home country, so near you could smell it.
This was where I had taken my first real step towards crossing the border. Later I told [people in Syria] about sneaking through the barbed wire to the other side. How we had crossed from being lost in one wilderness to being lost in another. It had been a moment of oscillation, of teetering on the line between exile and homeland. There, on both sides of the fence, bodies suddenly emerged from the darkness, shoulders rubbing as they shuffled blindly on. We heard a voice greet us: Good evening. Voices came, voices went. We crept by stealthily, like cats in the shadows. The border beneath which Syrians disappear in the night is just a hairs breadth: no distance to speak of.
People go in, people come out; they traverse this distance in the peaceful still of night, although few will find peace at their destination. The barbed wire fence cannot hold them; its as useless as trying to contain jelly in a net.

As she sits at a cafe table in the 7th arrondissement  elegant and intense, waving around a Gitane for emphasis  its hard to imagine a more Parisian figure than the writer Samar Yazbek. Except that she is speaking to me mostly in her native Syrian Arabic (we use an interpreter). And for all her wit and charm, the stories she is telling me are horrifying. Over the past few years, Yazbek has been an eyewitness to the unfolding chaos and misery in Syria and she cant stop telling me about it  sentences tumble over one another and my questions are constantly interrupted by her flow.
The drama of the situation is heightened by the fact that our conversation is taking place less than 10 minutes walk from the Syrian embassy in the rue Vaneau. For the past few years, I have cycled past this place almost every day on the way to my office, noting the anti-Assad graffiti and the occasional obliteration of the official signage, depending on the Assad regimes fortunes in the war. The only constant has been the unmarked cars with blacked-out windows that stand guard. Today the signs are back, declaring that this is the Embassy of the Syrian Republic. As we sit and chat, Yazbek is all too well aware that these are people who would kill her if they could.
This is mainly because of her long-standing opposition to the Assad government before the uprising of 2011 and her activism during what she still calls, with shining eyes, the Revolution. Now she is even more of a target with the publication of her latest book, The Crossing: My Journey to the Shattered Heart of Syria . This is an account of what happened when Yazbek returned to Syria, making an illegal crossing from Turkey in 2012. This was the beginning of several visits  each more dangerous. Yazbek was not only wanted by the Assad regime, but as she travelled through what had once been her native land she became a suspicious character in the eyes of the jumbled-up brigades of rebels.
I begin by asking why she put herself in such danger. She looks puzzled. I was not frightened for myself. Not at all. Why should I be so? This was my homeland. This is where I had grown up. I spoke the languages, I knew the people. What did frighten me as time went on, and as I made more trips, was the way everything I had once known in Syria was being turned into something else, something I didnt quite recognise. This had once been a cosy place, a place of traditional loyalties and hospitality. But now the people have been scarred and mutilated. I dont know whether it will ever go back to what it was. That is what Assad has done.

Yazbek was born in 1970 in Jableh, a small coastal town. She also lived in Latakia and Raqqa, now the headquarters of Isis. When Yazbek was growing up, she says, these were gentle and tolerant places. Although provincial, her early years were far from parochial  she recalls her rebellious adolescence reading Virginia Woolf and wishing she was Mrs Dalloway. Such literary precociousness is hardly surprising, given her family background; she was born into an Alawite family, both cosmopolitan and privileged. The Alawites are the small but powerful minority sect that has effectively been the ruling class in Syria since the time of French rule, which finished in 1943. The Assads are also Alawite, which means that Yazbeks revolt against the government is also seen by her enemies as a double betrayal of her religion and class.
One of the problems she faced as she journeyed through Syria was to disguise her origins when confronted by non-Alawites  the Alawites are not only considered as pro-Assad but also as Shia infidels by Sunnis. She learned to shift her accent around whenever she became the object of suspicion: I am from everywhere, she said to one surly fighter who questioned her background.
But this is true, she said to me. Above all, I am Syrian and it is only now that the war has deepened these sectarian divisions that were never there in this way when I was a girl. I can still remember when Syria was a true country of the Levant, as was Lebanon, with all religions and groups part of what it means to be Syrian. Now it is as if you can only be Syrian if you are Sunni or Shia or whatever. From the outside, the Syrian war looks like a battle between dictators and people in revolt  which it is  but from the inside it is like a family conflict, with all the bitter hatreds that you can imagine that come to the surface.
She reserves special contempt for Isis, whom she describes as an occupying army of foreigners, and then corrects herself and says they are more like a group of thugs and bullies. In The Crossing, she notes with anger the Yemeni, Saudi, Somali and Chechen faces that man the Isis checkpoints, harass Syrians and have turned a place such as Raqqa into a hellhole. I can remember how it was, she says, and now it is something dehumanising, disgusting. You have a generation that is being lost to this cruelty.

She is especially angry with young Muslim women who have travelled from the west to join Isis. Of course I am a feminist, she says, and what they are doing is sending the condition of women in Syria back to some terrible place. But also what they are doing is to Orientalise Syria  these young girls are Muslims but they are creatures of the west. They know nothing of Syria and its ways. But they love the fantasy of the virile Arab warrior on a horse with a gun. This is a cliche and a fantasy and they come because its erotic and exotic  they are bored in the west and they need to rebel. But they do not understand Islam or Syria and that they are making things worse for the women who live here.
One of the most gripping sections of the book is a conversation between Yazbek and the Hajii, a commander of the Ahrar Latakia (Free Men of Latakia) battalion who had spent his life on the move, living between the Turkish-Syrian border and Syrias coastal strip. Yazbek and the Hajii are from the same part of world but now they couldnt be further apart. Depressingly, the Hajii says the conflict in Syria is now a religious war that will last decades and where genocide is a necessary weapon of war. Are you a murderer? she asks him. Yes, he replies unhesitatingly, this son of a taxi driver. And he will commit more murders. I wont kill you, he says. He tells her to stay away from this vile war and he pities the future for all Alawites in Syria.
There are other grim stories. Yazbek tells of a young man who refuses to rape a girl on the orders of his senior officer. His genitals are shot off as a military punishment. Everywhere Yazbek goes she meets ordinary people whose everyday sense of morality is similarly undone by random but regular encounters with horror. One of the most devastating aspects of the book is that she is constantly aware that, not too long ago, this was a country where people lived ordinary lives.
Her technique is to let people tell the stories themselves, and to this extent the book recalls Anna Funders Stasiland , an account of how a country can go mad under the burden of lies and the promise of violence. In Syria right now, however, the violence is not just a threat but an ever-present reality. Yazbek makes the point that this is only partly about geopolitics  from Isis to US foreign policy, Syria is being used as a laboratory for experiments in how to destroy a nation. On the ground, as she explains in The Crossing, the result is to break human beings, literally and metaphorically, into pieces: Syria will never be the same again, she writes in the epilogue. It has been hung, drawn and quartered.

The Crossing is not simply reportage or political analysis. It bears comparison with George Orwells Homage to Catalonia as a work of literature. Yazbek is a superb narrator who knows how to pace her text, craft dialogue and convey a universal sense of grief; this is how she crosses the line from journalism to high literary art. When I put this to her she blushes and lights another Gitane. But she is not falsely modest. Certainly I wanted to write literature. For one thing, so much is written about Syria that it is easy to be bored with war stories, but I think as well that only literature can convey the complexity of what is happening there.
I mention Orwell and Kafka. She admires both but Kafka in particular is a model. What is happening in Syria is like being trapped down a deep, dark tunnel where you can see no way out. I had hope in 2011  I believed that we could change ourselves and our lives  and now every time I have been back it has got worse and so quickly. But with massacres every day, on all sides, what can you expect? Its not politics, its not religion  its something worse  pure hatred.
Yazbek has written novels and poetry and was a TV presenter in pre-revolutionary Syria. In 2010, she was included in the Beirut 39 , a group of the best writers in the Arab world under 40 chosen by the Hay festival. In 2012, she shared the Pen Pinter prize , with poet Carol Ann Duffy, for her book A Woman in the Crossfire about the early days of the Syrian civil war.
The Crossing is a different kind of book, however  it marks a sea change in Yazbeks thought. I want to believe still in hope, she says, but now I wonder if I really do believe in it. I have seen such destruction that its hard to believe that anything good can come out of it. I feel like I have been dropped from a cloud into a deep abyss. My idea has always been that a writer has to write about change, has to be part of change. That is why I went back to Syria two years ago  it was an obsession. Now I have another obsession  that murder is happening in my country and I can do nothing about it.
Yazbek is now truly in exile in Paris and she finds it painful. If she ever goes back to Syria, it will be more dangerous than ever before and she is reluctant to chance her arm more than she has to. For this reason, she misses Syria more than ever. When I was young, I dreamed of travelling the world. I thought that where I came from was small-town, and I wanted to be glamorous, cosmopolitan and intellectual. I dreamed of Paris for example. But now that I am here, it is beautiful but it is not the same thing. I am in Paris but all the time think of Jableh, Latakia and all those other places.
I did not choose to be an exile  that is the difference. I did not come here to be an artist but because I was thrown out. Thats something that wounds you. Its very hard.
She is now 45 and feels that she has a different perspective on her writing and the terrible landscape that she covers. I never meant to write this kind of book or be this kind of writer. But now I cant get away from it. Although it is probably not be what she intended, it may be that Samar Yazbek has written one of the first political classics of the 21st century.

At least 15 Britons are now known to be among the 39 tourists killed in the brutal Tunisian beachside massacre on Friday. And the families of seven tourists still missing faced an agonising wait for news after the worst terrorist outrage to hit Britons since the London attacks in July 2005.
We fear more sad news is to come, said a Downing Street source. The Observer understands that seven British holidaymakers who were caught up in the attack are in a critical condition in hospital: two are in a coma, and a further three are in intensive care. The condition of 26 other injured people  of other nationalities  was unclear.
The gunman, Tunisian Seifeddine Rezgui , was shot dead by police after his 20-minute shooting spree on Friday. As security was being ramped up at tourist sites and public places across Britain after Fridays day of bloodshed, in which 60 people died in three attacks across three continents, the first among the victims of the Tunisian shootings were named.
They were 24-year-old photographer Carly Lovett from Lincolnshire; Adrian Evans, 49, who worked for Sandwell council in the West Midlands; his nephew, Joel Richards, 19, who played for Birmingam-based Gaelic football team James Connollys GFC; Irish nurse Lorna Carty, from County Meath; and Lana Lemaire, a Ukrainian who lived in Belgium. Lovett, a beauty and fashion blogger and graduate of the University of Lincolnshire, had travelled to Tunisia on Wednesday with her fianc, Liam Moore. Expressing their shock, her friends talked of how excited she had been about the trip. One, Dave Overton, said she was a friendly but also a tough character with a sensible and practical outlook on life.

A statement from Birmingham County FA, where Richards was a member of the youth council, said: A young, talented referee with the world at his feet, Joel was highly thought of and will be sadly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this tragic time.
David Cameron warned the public to be prepared for a rising British death toll. Meanwhile, there was frustration and criticism directed at British Foreign Office officials for being too slow, and rude and ignorant towards worried relatives, some of whom took to social media to post pictures of their loved ones. Conor Fulford, from Staffordshire, was trying to find his mother, Sue Davey. He tweeted photographs of her with the hashtag #FindSueDavey.
He criticised the information being given by the Foreign Office: They just said if they find any leads, they will let us know. Im at a loss for words at the minute.
Fulford later confirmed his mother was among the victims. He tweeted: Hi Everyone, Sorry to tell you we lost my mother Sue Davey tonight but i want to thank everybody that tried to help me &amp; my family.

A cohort of Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers and consular staff were sent out to the scene of Fridays beach massacre as travel agents scrambled to lay on extra flights and on Saturday airlifted 2,500 UK holidaymakers out of the north African country.
The Tunisian prime minister, Habib Essid, said that the majority of the dead were British and deplored the attack at the Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel , where Rezgui, a 23-year-old engineering student, shot his victims with a Kalashnikov rifle he had hidden in a parasol. It was one of three attacks on Friday by gunmen linked to Islamic State.
In Kuwait, a mass funeral was held for the 27 men and boys killed on Friday as they knelt in prayer at a mosque and the Gulf states government called for a day of national mourning. The suicide bombing of the Shia mosque in the capital, Kuwait City, left 227 people injured.
In France a man was decapitated in an attack at a factory in Lyon. Yassin Sali , 35, caused an explosion by ramming a car into an area where fuel canisters were being stored but was arrested at the scene.
On Tuesday, an Isis spokesman had called for militants to cause calamity for infidels and to step up attacks during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. David Cameron on Saturday insisted, however, that there was no intelligence to suggest the attacks were deliberately linked.
Cameron, speaking after Saturdays Cobra emergency committee meeting, repeated warnings that Britain was facing a long-term threat and promised to make a statement in the Commons on Monday to update MPs on the governments security plans as events developed in Tunisia and elsewhere. He also warned that the public faced a very severe threat in our country and we have done for many months and many years.
The UKs threat level for international terrorism is currently severe, meaning an attack is highly likely, and has been since last August in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria. It is one level below critical when an attack is believed imminent.
Announcing heightened security at major events, including Armed Forces Day and Wimbledon, which starts on Monday, Cameron said: If we work together, if we are vigilant, if we back our police and anti-terrorism forces, if we combat this poisonous narrative of Islamist extremism that is radicalising too many young minds in our country; if we do all those things and show the persistence and the determination that I have talked about, then we will overcome.
Police seized a drone hovering over Wimbledons tennis courts as part of a concerted tightening of security as Scotland Yards most senior anti-terror official announced police were looking to strengthen the protection and security of key sites, business and public places around the UK.
Tunisias prime minister has ordered a clampdown on radical mosques in the aftermath of Fridays attack. Police will close about 80 mosques associated by authorities with radical preachers within a week, with Essid saying they were spreading venom.
Thousands of tourists are joining what is threatening to be a mass exodus from the country, one of north Africas prime tourist destinations. An estimated 20,000 British tourists are in Tunisia, and many are clamouring to be brought home.
The Foreign Office updated its travel advice, warning against visits to areas of the country in the south and west, with its website saying there is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.

        <Description>France struggles to comprehend yet another Islamist terrorist outrage as hunt gets under way for those who radicalised the killer</Description>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
Again, they were saying in Lyon on Saturday, with an air of incredulity. Its happened again.
Just six months after the massacres at Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery shop, France finds itself struggling to comprehend another atrocity in its midst. The severed head of a businessman hung on a factory gate on Friday brought the horror of Isis-style beheadings in Syria, Libya and Iraq to a quiet corner of the Rhne-Alpes region.
Yassin Salhi, a truck driver with a history of radical Islamic ties, is in custody in Lyon, after allegedly murdering his employer, Herv Cornara, and crashing a truck into a US-owned chemical warehouse. He isnt speaking to investigators.
One of the other three suspects detained has been released. Paris prosecutors office spokeswoman Agns Thibault-Lecuivre said investigators have not yet established a motive or any link with Islamist terrorist groups.
In the centre of Lyon, a Unesco-listed city on the Rhne, there was disbelief that such a grotesque act of terrorism could have been visited on the region. Newspapers carried anguished editorials discussing how France should confront the first decapitation as an act of terrorism on its own soil.

We are not used to seeing this here, read a headline in Le Progrs. And yet, despite the shockingly barbaric nature of what happened, some things were very familiar about Fridays attack centred on a chemical plant some 40km (25 miles) from the city centre. As with previous attacks in Europe, Salhi had crossed the radar of the intelligence services. A Salafi  a follower of the radical strain of Islam regularly linked to extremism  the 35-year-old had been on a watchlist between 2006 and 2008.
In Saint-Priest, a suburb of Lyon, where he had lived for the past six months in a nondescript flat in a four-storey block, neighbours described him as a typical member of the community who liked to play football in the street with his three children. They are a very normal family, said a neighbour who gave her name as Brigitte. I only talked with madame; he didnt say hello or goodbye, the 46-year-old housewife told Reuters.
But it now appears that Salhi, who was born in France to immigrant parents, was radicalised before he arrived in Lyon. In the eastern town of Besanon, where he lived for several years, he fell in with a fervently Islamist crowd. A former friend said he started talking about Islamic State but only to ask my opinion, not to praise them.
Salhi lost weight, grew a beard and started spending time with younger men, mainly teenagers, dressed in khaki and black. They would spend hours discussing Mali, where French troops were stationed on peacekeeping duties. One neighbour became so worried at the change in Salhi she called the police to warn that he was being radicalised.
This weekend the hunt was on for those who had turned a man whom a former colleague recalled as always gentle and calm into a killer. According to his security services file, Salhi had attended a radical mosque in Lyon in 2006. There is speculation among some Muslims in the city that he had fallen under the influence of Grand Ali, an extremist imam of mythical status in the region.
If such a character exists, he is not short of recruits. The Rhne region is considered by terrorism experts to be one of Frances top five breeding grounds for radicalisation. Several Muslim men told the Observer that a small group of Salafis had been attempting a land grab on the citys mosques in the past couple of years. They are trying to take them over, one man said. They have targeted four mosques. They are turning people against each other. They are not true Muslims.
Yesterday Salhis neighbours were forced to contemplate the unwelcome attention their suburb had brought. We do not need this here, said one woman. This is only going to create fear. Around her several people nodded, but most refused to talk. Local people were not so cowed online. Many posted messages expressing disbelief that someone known to the security services was not being monitored more closely.
The authorities estimate that hundreds of French citizens have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria, and monitoring those who return is stretching them to breaking point. What hope, experts ask, is there of monitoring the lone wolves who show no indication that they will turn murderous? However, the Lyon attack fits an increasingly familiar pattern. In 2012 a spate of attacks carried out by Mohamed Merah, a 23-year-old petty criminal, resulted in the murders of three soldiers and four people, three of them Jewish children, in the south-west of the country.
In April, the prime minister, Manuel Valls, revealed that five attacks had been thwarted in the country since the Charlie Hebdo attack, including one on a church near Paris when a man armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle was planning to fire on the congregation.
But Fridays attack marks an alarming new direction. The attempt to blow up a chemicals company may have been clumsy in execution, but it represents a chilling broadening of ambition. This weekend, security at Frances nuclear power plants, electricity substations and other sensitive targets was being stepped up, with thousands of police and soldiers assigned to new protective roles.
Meanwhile, Lyons Muslim population fears that the attack will exacerbate racial tensions at a difficult time. France has witnessed a rise in Islamophobic and antisemitic attacks in recent months and the far right has been quick to make political capital out of the tragedy. The Front National attacked the government for doing nothing to combat fundamentalist Islam and warned that the country was at risk because of an immigration invasion.
It was difficult to square such alarmism with the scene in Lyon yesterday. In the baking sunshine, people enjoyed long lunches. The parks were full of children laughing. And yet the citys residents know they must ask themselves how, just the day before, a man from one of their suburbs came to decapitate another human being before turning himself into a human bomb.
In a Turkish restaurant on the Rue Pailleron, Jacques sipped a coffee. He was 63 and has lived in Lyon most of his life. Was he concerned by what was happening? He shook his head and repeated what many politicians had said in the previous 24 hours: We must not give way to fear. He repeated the phrase several times, rapping his knuckles on the table for emphasis.

        <title>The migrant crisis, Islamist terrorism, Grexit and Brexit: a perfect storm of crises blows apart European unity</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/eu-summit-migration-greece-crises-uk-referendum</Link>
        <Description>With disagreement over how to deal with migration and a failure to resolve the Greek problem, tempers frayed at the EU summit – while the UK in/out debate barely got discussed</Description>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
The time was shortly after 3am when David Cameron descended from level 80 of the vast Justus Lipsius building in Brussels on Friday. The birds were singing as he was whisked away for a much-curtailed sleep at the British ambassadors residence, five minutes up the road.
The prime minister is no novice when it comes to long and tedious discussions at European summits. But what he had just witnessed over a seemingly never-ending dinner with the other 27 EU leaders was something different altogether.
The immediate crisis under discussion was migration and what the EU should do to handle the many thousands who have crossed the Mediterranean from Africa and the Middle East and arrived via Italy and the western Balkans over recent months. Increasingly, Europe is a magnet for those seeking a better life. But the EU does not know how to react and the problems are spreading. Last week a strike by French workers at Calais caused huge tailbacks on motorways leading to both the ferry port and Channel tunnel as hundreds of migrants  mainly from east Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan  tried to take advantage of queueing traffic by breaking into lorries bound for the UK.
Against this background, a supposedly cordial working dinner, held high in the Council of Ministers building, rapidly descended into personal insults and finger-jabbing  which an exhausted-looking Cameron later summed up as lengthy and, at times, heated discussions.
Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister, was incensed by the refusal of several countries, including Hungary, which has taken in 60,000 refugees since the beginning of the year, and the Czech Republic, to agree to take part in a compulsory refugee-sharing scheme to help ease Italys burden. Cameron kept fairly quiet. The UK has opted out of EU asylum policy and Renzi, who was in an emotional state, did not need to be reminded of its non-participation. But others took up the cudgels as the row intensified across the table. Dalia Grybauskaite, the Lithuanian president, told Renzi in no uncertain terms that her country would not take part either. Bulgaria, one of the EUs poorest countries, took a similar line. Disputes flared. European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, prime mover behind the idea of compulsory burden sharing, and council president Donald Tusk tore strips off each other over what should be done, as inter-institutional solidarity broke down.

Angela Merkel said that the migration challenge was the most serious and difficult she had encountered in the EU during her time as German chancellor (Greece is also somewhat on her mind) as Renzi railed against fellow leaders for betraying the EUs values. A voluntary scheme was all that was agreed. Do as you like, Renzi protested. If this is your idea of Europe, keep it for yourself  you do not deserve to call yourself Europe. Either we have solidarity or we waste our time!
Solidarity is indeed needed these days in a 28-nation EU that is creaking, not just under the weight of one crisis but several. Greece has been on the brink of defaulting on a payment to the IMF for weeks, placing its future in the euro and the EU in grave doubt, and is now heading for a defining referendum next weekend which could truly lead to Grexit. Meanwhile the UK is heading towards its own in/out referendum, also causing anxiety across European capitals. Nerves and tempers are fraying, as the migrants pour in. The EU is used to expanding its borders, and deepening ties, not losing members and limiting its role. Those from outside who regard their mission as to expose the EU as an unnatural political-cum-economic marriage of nations unsuited to union sense their moment.
In a dapper blue suit, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was prowling around the Brussels summit on Friday, declaring that the triple crisis was the beginning of the end for the EU, the moment it would be shown to have over-reached itself  when the poorer south would fracture from the wealthier north, when the consequences of open borders would divide members, and all would begin to implode. It was already happening with Greece. I always said the euro would take 10 years to self-destruct and it is happening, he said.
Greeces problems haunted two days of talks. Meetings of heads of government and emergency gatherings of finance ministers and senior officials were called on and off in rapid succession, as a result of lack of progress but in full knowledge that a deal had to be done within days to avoid the first loss of a euro member and possible Grexit from the EU. All wrestled with how to reach a compromise with a leftwing government led by the combative Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras . Greece has to transfer 1.54bn to the IMF by Tuesday, to unlock more bailout funds from Brussels. Without the money, Athens cant afford to pay up and may be forced out of the single currency that was supposed to be the glue that bound Europes inner core of true believers together in perpetuity.

Diplomats oscillated between rushes of optimism that Tsipras might give ground and accept more reform at home, including cuts to Greek pensions and a growing realisation that, in his Syriza movement, there are forces that might never bow to austere demands from distant Brussels authorities for fiscal discipline, whatever the price for Greece.
As one EU official put it on Friday: We simply cant second-guess them any more. We thought they would do a deal when it came to it  There are some who think it may be best to let them go. Yesterday, ahead of the latest emergency meeting of finance ministers, there was more talk about a plan B for Greece (what to do to prevent a Greek default from causing economic contagion across the EU) than the endlessly discussed plan A (how to stitch a compromise together). Among diplomats there was a growing view that, if the wider damage to Europe could be contained, perhaps the EU was better off saying goodbye to Tsipras and Greece, than in spending endless time and money attempting to force a square peg into a round hole.
As for the British problem, it hardly raised its head during this summit. It was one crisis too many, and not the most pressing. That may not bode well for Camerons attempts to achieve a renegotiation of British membership before he holds an in/out referendum either next year or in 2017. The last thing EU leaders wanted was to spend precious time nit-picking over UK demands to amend treaties and change rules on founding principles, such as the freedom of movement of workers, which few will entertain anyway. Cameron had billed the meeting as the moment when he would launch his plans for reform and focus minds on the fact that the UK means business.
The original plan was that he would be given time at the start of the dinner meeting to lay out his stall in some style. As it was, they managed to squeeze him in for five minutes at 11pm  between their arguments over migration. Cameron said people in the UK were unhappy with the EU, but avoided much detail. One official said it was a welcome intermission which allowed people a little time to redraft the conclusions on migration  suggesting minds were not entirely on what the prime minister had to say.
Eight pages of summit conclusions on other matters ended with a fourth item of fewer than two lines, entitled just UK. It read: The UK prime minister set out his plans for an in/out referendum in the UK. The European Council agreed to revert to the matter in December. It is not that other EU leaders do not want to help Cameron, but more that they have not got much time or energy to do so. Talks will now grind on at official level for months over UK demands to curb welfare payments for EU migrants, demands to opt out of ever-closer union, demands to give more powers to national parliaments to block EU laws, and demands to ensure that what goes on inside the eurozone does not compromise the interests of those outside.
At this summit Camerons tone was different, less truculent. No doubt he realised that this was not the moment for UK grandstanding. He also seems to have accepted the need to build alliances, and that winning treaty changes in the EU for Britain requires a subtler, friendlier approach than when he came to Brussels to block things. This time he is the demandeur in the relationship, not the blocker. At his press conference after the summit, Cameron did something he has refused to do recently at home. He said clearly that he would prefer the UK to stay in the EU. I believe it is beneficial for Britain, he said, abandoning recent neutrality on the matter. A diplomatic memo leaked to the Guardian showed he had made a similar point to EU leaders.
Cameron opened his concluding press conference with a long, strong statement on the appalling terrorist attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait, stressing the need for global solidarity and cooperation to hunt terrorists and enhance security. Again, preaching about the national interest at such a moment would have seemed out of tune. With the EU so preoccupied, there were signs that Cameron may also now be soft-pedalling on his more controversial demands for treaty change, particularly the idea of banning EU migrant workers from claiming social benefits, such as tax credits or child benefit, for four years.
There was no mention of this specifically in his short talk at dinner, something that did not escape the notice of those who listened. It was whisked over in very general comments about reform as if it were just too incendiary to touch. The British problem as a whole was not of the moment. But, at some point soon, it will come to a head. If Cameron fails to achieve much more than the status quo  which may be the case  it will not escape the notice of Eurosceptics at home who will say it proves that the EU can never change and shows, therefore, that Britain should leave. EU leaders say they will do their best for Cameron, but not if he overplays his hand and refuses to speak up about the benefits of Europe.
As the EUs crises multiply, and migration and terrorism threaten, there may be ill temper, tension and division at Europes core but there is an underlying determination to hold together. They talk differently now about losing the non-believers.
We know the British debate, said one EU diplomat discussing the referendum. We really have to help where we can because the UK is important  but, in a way, it is like Greece: we cannot do so if the price is too high, and not if it means Europe cannot function as we want in the world.

Pope Francis urged Catholics to take care of the Earth. Photograph: Maurizio Brambatti/EPA
I am certainly not a Catholic apologist in any regard and I agree with many of Nick Cohens points but, as an avowed atheist, hes working from a different paradigm to people of faith. He is therefore ill-equipped to make sense of absolutely real convictions that are built on something other than deductive reasoning ( A liberal, free-thinking pope? Dont kid yourself , Comment.
In contrast, my terms of reference are as a Bible-believing follower of Jesus Christ who, in his life, death and resurrection provided us with all the instruction and example we need to live a life of radical love within the enveloping perfection of Gods will and purpose. A cracking example of this dogma-free, open-hearted faith is in Tobias Joness book extract in the same edition of the paper ( New Review ).
Whether or not Catholicisms stance on birth control is wholly or partially founded on divine displeasure incurred by the Old Testament character Onan I neither know nor particularly care; it prefers human-generated dogma over the love and compassion exemplified by Jesus and is therefore, in my view, A Very Bad Thing.
If that is the policys origin, it seems to me that those who designed it assumed, for whatever reason, that Onans transgression lay in his use of rudimentary birth control. I think it much more likely that the problem was his disobedience in refusing to provide an heir to his dead brother.
The pope may be imperfect  who isnt?  but credit where its due. In eschewing many of the excessive trappings of office and in initiating reforms and accepting corporate responsibility for wicked abuses that first happened and then went unpunished, Francis has boldly gone where lesser men have quailed so to do. The mere fact that he has ruffled so many feathers within the Catholic church is a sure sign that this pope is doing many things right and deserves the encouragement of us all, believers or not.

Nick Cohens article on Catholic dogma and the environment had me drooling. And yet In making a huge point, I wonder whether he has missed a massive one.
As I understand it, the bondage that religious people of all types voluntarily place themselves in is that God made everything and ultimately decides everything, and even wars and natural disasters must happen for a good reason, so who are we to protest? This especially applies to people such as the pope, whose job is to remind us to bow to the almighty. So, when he starts to pronounce on the need to protect the environment, even from a dogma-based perspective,surely he is questioning whether God really knows what he is doing?
If the pope really believes in what he is saying, he must be arguing for the non-existence of God, or at least suggesting that the divinity only occupies a partnership role in the universe.

Nick Cohen seems to have tired of praising the pope a little too soon. Francis made the valid point that each rich person bears a greater responsibility for global warming than a poor person (the scientific jargon is has a larger carbon footprint), but thats where Cohen lost him. The conclusion Francis draws is that the rich should reduce their carbon footprint, not that the poor should be shut out of Europe. After all, this is the pope who visited Lampedusa to give what help and comfort he could to boat people.
Cohen seems to treat the average western Europeans carbon footprint as a constant that cannot be challenged. The pope challenges it because he starts from a more reliable constant, the carrying capacity of the Earth and Gandhis dictum that the Earth has enough to satisfy mans need, but not his greed. So, he argues, it is more important and more effective to reduce the carbon footprint of rich Europeans than that of poor Africans.

The aftermath of the attack on a Shia mosque in Kuwait has resonated well beyond its borders into neighbouring Gulf countries, which have long shared both its worldview and its fears that Islamic State is stalking them.
On Saturday, Kuwaiti officials announced arrests linked to the Friday blast at the Imam al-Sadiq mosque, which killed 27 and maimed 200 more, as security at places of worship from Sharjah to Doha was tightened and rhetoric against the group intensified across the region.
Officials in Kuwait had long said an attack of the type carried out during Friday prayers would be very difficult to stop. The fact that it took place in the holy month of Ramadan, when worshippers were likely to be less on their guard than usual, made it even more so.
Isis had made no secret of its intentions to launch attacks during Ramadan, with its spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, releasing a speech earlier last week calling for strikes in the remaining three weeks of the fasting month, which would lead to greater blessings in the afterlife.
Kuwait is home to one of the largest Shia minorities in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and has often been named by Isis leaders as a legitimate target. Shias have been the most prominent foe of Isis throughout the past three years of the groups latest incarnation and during the decade prior to that, following the ousting of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, whose demise led to a loss of influence among the countrys Sunnis.
However, in the eyes of Isis, Kuwaits sins go further than harbouring Shias; the desert state maintained one of the largest US military bases in the world throughout the occupation of Iraq and has been a supporter of the air campaign launched last August against the terror group, even though it had not contributed military forces.
The UAE, Bahrain and Qatar have sent jets to bomb Isis targets in Iraq, although their contributions had begun to wane by late last year. Most had avoided publicising their involvement, with the risk of provoking some kind of backlash a central consideration.
The GCC views Isis as an existential threat to its members and is especially fearful of Isis being seen as a vehicle to advance political aims if states are unable to do so. Since 2013, Isis has used the area it controls in Iraq and Syria to consolidate a foothold in the Middle East and train militants sent back to their home countries to wreak havoc.
Up to 800 Kuwaitis are thought to have travelled to join Isis, and several hundred are believed to have returned. It is not yet known whether Fridays suicide bomber was a returned fighter, a homegrown local or a member of the group from elsewhere.
However, Isis is making much play of producing battle-hardened ideologues who will transplant the virulent ideology it espouses into other parts of the Middle East and north Africa. It already has active followers in Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Tunisia, all of whom have sworn allegiance to the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and has been trying to gain momentum in the Gulf states.
Of all the Gulf autocracies, Kuwait is considered to have one of the most efficient security structures. The UAE, though, is considered more formidable. Its rulers have feared a threat from political Islam, a stance that has placed them at odds with Qatar, which supports the Muslim Brotherhood across the region.
The common threat from Isis has, however, led them to set differences aside and present a united front against precisely the co-ordinated three-continent spectacular carried out on Friday. The tight timing of the strikes and their geographical spread make it highly likely they were centrally choreographed  something the organisation has not been able to do until now.
They are planning something big, a source close to Isis warned the Observer last week. They now have capabilities that they didnt have six months ago and they are determined to show you.
The source said that, while the US-led airstrikes had killed several dozen leaders and made communication between cells more difficult, they had not stopped Isis from securing strategic ground andwere acting as a rallying call for fighters around the region. They like using the message that Muslims are under attack from the Americans again. It helps them recruit people.

Five years of wrenching austerity that have left many Greeks traumatised and pauperised are about to get a lot worse.
Creditor governments meeting in Brussels on Saturday night pledged to halt Greeces bailout on Tuesday after the leftwing government abandoned five months of negotiations with its European lenders and called a referendum that may propel the country out of the euro.
The decision to end the bailout on Tuesday was taken by 18 countries, with only Greece dissenting. Its delegate, Yanis Varoufakis , the finance minister, then left the session which focused on damage limitation and preventing Greek financial turmoil from spreading to other vulnerable parts of the eurozone.
Its a sad day, said ministers from across the continent as Europe braced itself for more turbulence and leaders started shifting to avoid the blame for the debacle.
The climax to 10 days of fraught bargaining in Brussels and Luxembourg was the decision by Alexis Tsipras , the Greek prime minister, to call a plebiscite on the terms of Greeces bailout, stunning the other eurozone governments.
I am very negatively surprised, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch chair of the committee of eurozone finance ministers. The situation [in Greece] will deteriorate very rapidly  How the Greek government will survive, I do not know.
The committee has been in quasi-permanent session for the past week, as proposals and counter-proposals bounced back and forth between the two sides in a war of propaganda and what eurocrats have taken to calling paperology.
The finale came on Friday with a last offer from the creditors  the European commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund  which represented a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum, revamping the pensions system, creating a new VAT regime, slashing the defence budget, and cutting proposed taxes on business in return for a five-month bailout extension worth 15.5bn (11bn).

Greece has closed the door on future talks, says Eurogroup president.
Financial experts from both sides were still negotiating in Brussels late on Friday when the call came through from Athens ordering them to quit, Dijsselbloem said. Tsipras then went on television to announce the plebiscite.
The creditors ultimatum would have solved little, but it would have kept Greece in the euro at least until Christmas, giving both sides a chance to cool off, build trust and buy time all round.
Tsiprass referendum gamble upended all that. He promised to heed the outcome of the popular vote on 5July, but then made clear to the Greek electorate where he personally stood.
I call on you to decide whether we should accept the extortionate ultimatum that calls for strict and humiliating austerity without end, and without the prospect of ever standing on our own two feet, socially and financially, he thundered. We never considered giving in  These proposals prove that certain partners are not interested in reaching a viable and beneficial agreement for all parties, but rather the humiliation of the Greek people.
The decision and the manner in which it was delivered caught his negotiating partners off guard, not least as it came within hours of Tsiprass return from a Brussels summit of EU leaders on Friday, where he had private talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel and President Hollande of France.
At their post-summit press conferences, neither of the two sent any signals of the bombshell from Athens. Neither did summit chair Donald Tusk.

Some eurozone ministers called Tsiprass decision bizarre and said they were mystified about what he was trying to do. The question of Greeces eurozone membership has been officially opened, said a Deutsche Bank analyst.
The negotiations that have been taking place since Tsiprass leftwing Syriza movement won national elections in January have resembled trench warfare for months and, in recent weeks, have degenerated into a slanging match.
The referendum is to answer the question as to whether the Greeks accept more creditor-imposed austerity as the price of staying in the euro. This raises many more questions than it answers.
If the people vote yes when Tsipras has absolutely rejected the terms and advised voters to follow him, it would appear that he would have to resign.
If he stayed in office with a yes verdict behind him, there would be zero confidence on the other side of the table, especially among the Germans, in negotiating with him.
There are concerns of credibility, said Dijsselbloem.
There would also be no trust in Tsipras committing to a deal and implementing it. And it is not even clear whether what the Greeks are to vote on will still exist in a fortnight, since the bailout lapses on Tuesday. The Greeks could be delivering an answer to a phantom question.
But the legal and procedural problems proliferate. Without bailout funds, Greece is heading for a major default next month, when it has to redeem more than 3 bn of bonds with the ECB.
But there is no legal provision for ejecting a country from the euro. Indeed, all EU members, except those like Britain with an opt-out, are obliged to join the euro. Many people, such as Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, believe that exiting the euro means leaving the EU altogether.
The Eurozone finance ministers rejected Tsiprass demand to extend the bailout until after the referendum and then sent Varoufakis out of the room while they proceeded with talks about how to deal with a Greek financial collapse and prevent the panic spreading to other parts of the single-currency bloc.
Varoufakiss spokesman said the referendum decision meant an end to five years of waterboarding.
Alex Stubb, the Finnish finance minister, said a large majority on the committee of finance ministers was against extending the Greek rescue beyond Tuesday. The ministers sounded surprised by the referendum decision and voiced feelings of betrayal by Tsipras. In the marathon negotiations of the past 10 days, some complained the Greek officials had not told them of the referendum call and that now it was too late to do anything about it.

But the impact of a Greek collapse will impact deeply politically and economically on the rest of Europe, sparking recrimination over the conduct of five years of austerity and bailouts that, in the Greek case at least, have failed.
Greece owes 320bn, most of it to eurozone governments, and a full default will prove expensive for the others, not least Germany, which has 92bn at stake.
As the Greek parliament prepared to vote on staging the countrys first referendum in 40 years, eurozone finance ministers agonised over their so-called plan B  how to quarantine Greece inside the eurozones financial system in an exercise in damage limitation.
Whether capital controls would be imposed was up to the Greek authorities, said Stubb. This is a choice the Greek government has made. Im quite sad about it.
On Tuesday, Athens also has to repay 1.6m to the IMF. Without a rescue package in place, it is not clear where the money is coming from.
THE DEAL
Greeces international creditors want to strike a deal to stop Athens defaulting on its debt and possibly tumbling out of the euro by extending its bailout by six months and supplying up to 18bn (12.9bn) in rescue funds.
The negotiators representing Greeces lenders are also proposing to pledge debt relief, though it would come with strings attached and not as part of the current bailout package.
The creditors  the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank  want Athens to impose higher rates of VAT on areas that were previously given discounted rates and to accelerate pension reforms as the price of fresh loans and the possibility of debt relief. The purpose is to generate a 1% budget surplus that allows Athens to repay its debts while funding public services and welfare payments.
The six-month rescue extension being mooted would see Greece qualify for 7.2bn in bailout funds still to be disbursed as well as 10.9bn already lent to the country but earmarked for recapitalisation of its weakened banks. The latter sum could be quickly transferred to the government to facilitate debt repayments.

        <title>Tunisia attack: Foreign Office says 15 Britons killed and death toll may rise</title>

The UK home secretary, Theresa May, is to chair a meeting of the governments emergency Cobra committee on Sunday morning as it became clear that British tourists bore the brunt of the Tunisian beach attack by an Islamic State extremist.
Fifteen Britons died in the shooting in the coastal city of Sousse but the toll could rise further, the Foreign Office said on Saturday, in what it called the most significant terrorist attack on the British people since 7 July 2005.
The Foreign Office minister, Tobias Ellwood, said: At least 15 British nationals were killed in [Fridays] atrocity, but I should stress that the number may well rise as several more have been seriously injured in this horrific attack.
He said the act of evil and brutality demonstrated why this kind of extremism had to be confronted, whether it happened in the UK or abroad.
The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn that further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible and urged people to be vigilant.
The number of British holidaymakers confirmed to have been killed by the lone gunman on Friday rose steadily on Saturday.
The prime minister, David Cameron, warned earlier that the UK public needed to be prepared for the total to rise.
A total of 39 people were killed , including three Irish citizens , with one Belgian and a German also among the victims.
At least 1,000 holidaymakers arrived back in the UK on Saturday. Cameron said a full deployment team of consular staff, police and experts from the Red Cross would arrive in Tunisia on Saturday to help the victims and added that the government was doing all it could to assist them.

German tourist recounts horror of beach attack
The PM said: These savage terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and France are a brutal and tragic reminder of the threat faced around the world from these evil terrorists.
The UKs terror threat level remains at severe, the second-highest level, meaning an attack is highly likely.
Mark Rowley, Metropolitan police assistant commissioner and national policing lead for counter-terrorism, said it was fairly clear that the location of the Tunisian attack was chosen because of the number of westerners present.
A large number of officers had been sent to the resort, to gather evidence and help the Tunisian authorities, he said.
The Tunisian prime minister called for all citizens to work together to defeat terrorism as thousands of tourists prepared to leave the north African country in the wake of its worst terrorist attack.
Tourists crowded into the airport at Hammamet near the coastal city of Sousse where a young man dressed in shorts on Friday pulled an assault rifle out of his beach umbrella and killed 39 people, mostly tourists.
The fight against terrorism is a national responsibility, Essid said on Saturday. We are at war against terrorism which represents a serious danger to national unity during this delicate period that the nation is going through.
He announced a range of tough measures to fight extremism, including examining the funding of organisations suspected of promoting radicalism, closing about 80 mosques outside government control and declaring certain mountainous zones military areas.
Essid identified the gunman, who was killed by police after the attack, as Seifeddine Rezgui, a young student at Kairouan University from the town of Gaafour in the governorate of Siliana.
The Site Intelligence Group reported that Isis had claimed responsibility for Fridays attack on its Twitter account, referring to the gunman by his jihadi pseudonym Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani. Isis Twitter accounts have published a photograph purporting to be Rezgui posing between two Kalashnikovs and smiling.

Meanwhile, more survivors stories and details of the victims began to emerge. The British tourist Tom Richards, who faced the gunman in a hotel corridor , described him as being in his early 20s with long black hair and a beard. Richards, who was there with his mother, escaped when the gunman inexplicably stopped firing.

Matthew James survived being shot three times when he used his body to shield his fiance, Saera Wilson, during the shooting.
Ross Thompson and Rebecca Smith, from Coventry, were recovering after receiving shrapnel injuries. We managed to get the room barricaded, got down low and just hid, Thompson said.
Smith said she became separated from Thompson and hid in toilets with another woman and her son: We locked ourselves in and hoped for the best.
Dave Beardsmore, from Manchester, told Sky News: We ran for our lives. I heard bullets going over the top of my head; I just kept on running and we went to our room.
Tony Callaghan, who works for Norfolk police at North Walsham, and his wife were injured in the attacks. They both needed hospital treatment but their injuries were not life-threatening.
One of those killed has been named as Lorna Carty, a nurse and mother of two from County Meath in Ireland . She had been in the resort with her husband, Declan, who had recently undergone heart surgery. It is understood the couple were given the holiday as a present from a family member to help with his recuperation.
Conor Fulford, from Staffordshire, had posted a photo on Twitter of his mother, Sue Davey, who was staying in Sousse, in a bid to locate her. He later confirmed his mother was among the victims. He tweeted: Hi Everyone, Sorry to tell you we lost my mother Sue Davey tonight but i want to thank everybody that tried to help me &amp; my family.

The killings took place on the beach between the Soviva and Imperial Marhaba hotels in the town of Sousse, a popular destination for tourists from the UK and Ireland .
They came on the same day that a suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Kuwait killed 27 worshippers and wounded a further 220 in an attack that was later claimed by Isis.
The attack in Tunisia was the countrys worst and follows a massacre on 18 March at the national Bardo museum in Tunis that resulyed in the deaths of 22 people, again mostly tourists, and has called into question the newly elected governments ability to protect the country.

The carnage in Tunisia began on the beach, where tourists described hearing what sounded like fireworks and then ran for cover when they realised it was gunfire. Video of the aftermath showed medics using beach chairs as stretchers to carry away people in swimsuits.
The Tunisian interior minister, Rafik Chelli, said of the gunman: He had a parasol in his hand. He went down to put it in the sand and then he took out his Kalashnikov and began shooting wildly. He then entered the pool area of the Imperial Marhaba hotel before moving inside, killing people as he went.
A British tourist, Gary Pine, told AP he was on the beach with his wife around midday when heard the shooting. They shouted for their son to get out of the water, grabbed their bag and ran for the hotel. Their son told them he saw someone who had been shot on the beach.

There was sheer panic at the hotel, Pine said. There were a lot of concerned people, a few people in tears with panic and a few people  older guests  theyd turned their ankles or there was a few little minor injuries and nicks and scrapes.
Elizabeth OBrien, an Irish tourist who was with her two sons, told Irish radio she was on the beach when the shooting began. I thought, Oh my God. It sounds like gunfire, so I just ran to the sea, to my children and grabbed our things before fleeing to their hotel room, she said.
Since overthrowing its secular dictator in 2011, Tunisia has been plagued by terrorist attacks, although only recently have they targeted the tourism sector, which makes up nearly 15% of GDP.
Simon Calder, a London-based travel commentator, said: The Foreign Office will declare the summer effectively over for Tunisia, and it will destroy  besides the lives taken  the tens of thousands of livelihoods who depend on tourism for a living. Nearly half a million Britons visited Tunisia in 2014.
Jonathan Hill, professor of defence studies at Kings College London, said the attacks were a blow to Tunisias image as a stable, democratic nation emerging from its revolution in 2011. The terrorists are attacking Tunisias reputation, he said. Not just as a safe and welcoming destination for western holidaymakers, but as the one real success story to emerge out of the Arab Spring.

A family in Ireland has been informed by police in the Republic that their parents are among the 39 dead in the Tunisian terror massacre.
The Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin has been in contact with the loved ones of the husband and wife from Co Westmeath in the Irish Midlands, it was confirmed on Saturday night. The couple have been named locally as Laurence (Larry) and Martina Hayes.
Irish foreign minister Charlie Flanagan said: The process of full and formal identification of victims is continuing in Tunis, and will take a period of time before it is completed. The Irish ambassador and consul are on the ground in Tunisia , working closely with the Tunisian authorities.
The minister is now advising Irish tourists to exercise caution if travelling to Tunisia.
Flanagan said: My departments travel advice for Tunisia, which was changed in the light of the attack, is to exercise extreme caution. While the Tunisian authorities have declared this incident to be over, we would urge Irish citizens in Tunisia to remain vigilant and to follow any instructions given by the police, tour operator, and hotel staff.
Those wishing to contact my departments consular support service can continue to do so throughout the rest of the weekend by calling the main telephone line 01 4082000.
I have condemned in the strongest terms these terrorist attacks. I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the families of all the deceased.
The ambassador of Ireland accredited to Tunisia, David Cooney, also met EU counterparts in Tunis today to review the situation on the ground. The embassy team will keep me and the government updated through the days ahead.
Thee family of Lorna Carty, the first Irish citizen confirmed to have been murdered in the atrocity in the resort of Sousse, are said to be distraught over her death. Thee mother of two was on the beach when the gunman opened fire.
The Carty family are stalwarts of their local Gaelic sports club in Robinstown, Co Meath. A spokesman for the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Meath said all matches and training between local clubs Dunderry and Kilmessan had been suspended until further notice as a mark of respect to the Carty family.
The murdered womans son, Simon, was on the senior panel for Meath Gaelic football squad and played for the county at Under-21 level. He is a science student at University College Dublin, the same institution where several of the students killed in the Berkeley balcony tragedy also attended. His mother had been active in the GAA and a supporter of Dunderry.

On Thursday evening the gunman who would mow down more than 30 unarmed tourists in a luxury hotel went as usual to prayers at his mosque and walked down the streets greeting people he knew.
Neighbours of the family in the Hay Zuhour neighbourhood of the small town of Gaafour in the Siliana region of north Tunisia , said they were still trying to work out how Seifeddine Rezgui, a student at Kairouan university could have done such a thing.
A tweet from the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack and gave his jihadi pseudonym of Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani, which referred to the town, an ancient centre of Islamic learning, where he was studying for his degree, according to the Site intelligence group. He had taken out a Tunisian passport in 2013, but had never used it, an official said.
He was good, good, good! said a neighbour and family friend, Monia Riahi, 50, standing with her daughters at the entrance to her house. Ive known him since he was small. He was never in trouble with anyone ever. Maybe he was brainwashed or something. She added how sorry she was for the dead.
Rezguis father, a day labourer, earns less than 10 a day working on farms or the nearby railway line. He has been taken to the Tunisian capital for questioning by the police, along with his mother.
Rezgui was reportedly laughing and joking as he set about his murderous attack, and new pictures showed him wandering casually along the beach in shorts and a T-shirt, assault rifle in hands, as he began the killing spree.
I think maybe, just maybe, it was poverty that did it, said neighbour Ammar Fazai, 64. Theres that old saying: If poverty was a man, I would kill him. And maybe, like the lady said, they washed his brain and eliminated all the kindness from it.
Fazai explained that until the zinc and lead mines not far from the town closed in 1993, there was ample work, but unemployment in the area is now high, especially among the young. The Rezgui family also endured tragedy when a brother a year younger than Seifeddine was killed by a lightning strike aged 14 while out in the fields. Two other young siblings are currently staying with relatives while their parents are in Tunis.
Local people in the town say that there are many Salafists living there, following a hardline interpretation of Islam and based at the mosque that Rezgui attended daily. But one of the Salafist imams from the town denied that the group would ever incite young men to commit a massacre like Fridays attack.
Im as totally at a loss to explain this as everyone else. This is not the kind of Islam we preach here at all, said the imam of one mosque in town, a middle-aged man who declined to give his name.
He believed that the gunman must have been influenced by a far more radical strain of teaching, he added.
Confirming the gunmans identity, Tunisian prime minister Habib Essid said that Rezgui, 23, was not known to the security services.
The region of Siliana is not known for the presence of armed Islamist groups. However, over the past two and a half years the similarly impoverished regions of Kef and Kasserine to its west and south-west have seen ambushes, clashes and other incidents between armed Islamist groups and, attempting to tackle them, the Tunisian army and national guard.
Both Kef and Kasserine share long borders with Algeria, where armed groups remaining after the internecine conflict of the 1990s continue to be sporadically active, not far from the mountainous border with Algeria. The Siliana region has no border with Algeria
One such group was said by authorities to be behind the attack on Tuniss Bardo museum in March, when 22 people, most of them European tourists, were killed and around 50 others were injured.
The local produce includes peaches, apricots and melons, all now in season, which sold at roadside stalls. Throughout the summer, the landscape is arid as families in modest homes try to get by on frugal diets, a world away from the western tourist resorts an hours drive away.
Recruits from poor towns flock to Islamic State. Up to 3,000 are now fighting with them in Iraq, Syria and latterly Libya, where there have been a string of Tunisian suicide bombers.
Military sweeps in the southern mountains saw victories against pockets of jihadists and the killing of Algerian high-profile militant Lokman Abou Sakhr, a reminder that militants do not recognise national borders in their battle to create a caliphate.

EU ministers refuse bailout extension for Greece as referendum looms
Greek parliament approves referendum vote, as EU finance ministers seek to insulate rest of eurozone from anticipated financial mayhem

Europes single currency entered the stage of rupture for the first time in its 16-year life on Saturday night when 18 governments told Greece its bailout package would be terminated within days. The country plunged towards financial collapse after its leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , abandoned negotiations and called a referendum on his lenders terms for continuing the lifeline.
An emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers took place in Brussels on Saturday evening without Greece for the first time since the crisis began in 2010. It turned into a crisis planning session devoted to quarantining Greece and insulating the rest of the eurozone from the impact of anticipated financial mayhem.
Related: Greek crisis: Parliament approves referendum, after bailout extension rejected - as it happened
The weekends events threw Europe into weeks of confusion and turbulence as 10 days of intense last-ditch attempts to salvage an agreement between Greece and its creditors collapsed. Tsipras accused the countrys creditors of a vengeful act of humiliation against Greece and urged voters to follow him in rejecting the terms imposing more austerity in return for cash in the plebiscite on 5 July. Early on Sunday morning, the parliament in Athens voted in favour of holding the referendum.
The finance ministers refused to extend Greeces bailout beyond Tuesday, hastening the likelihood of Greeces ejection from the euro. Yanis Varoufakis , the Greek finance minister, refused to endorse the collective statement and left the meeting.
Tsiprass gamble, following an EU summit in Brussels on Friday, leaves Europes leaders, notably Angela Merkel of Germany and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank , with a stark dilemma  whether to let Greece sink or swim.
It was unclear whether the expiry of the bailout on Tuesday also meant that emergency financial assistance which is keeping Greece afloat would continue. The governing board of the European Central Bank will have to decide this.
Without a bailout in place, it will be difficult for Draghi to continue supplying Greece with billions in liquidity assistance, funds that are currently keeping the country from default.
Over the next 48 hours Draghi faces the biggest decision he has ever had to take. The powerful central banker who pledged in 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro has to decide whether he will and can save Greece, or at least keep it alive until after the popular vote.
Draghis and Merkels decisions will have grave consequences for Greece which is staring into the abyss of defaulting on its colossal debts and being ejected from the euro, but will also have major impact on the single currencys health and stability. Were going into totally uncharted waters, said Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister.
Saturday nights eurogroup meeting said the governments stand ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure financial stability of the euro area. Their meeting was the fifth to be held in 10 days. The decision to end the bailout, shunning the Greek requests to extend the rescue until after the national referendum, means that Greece is likely to go bust.
Greece ended the negotiations unilaterally. There is no basis for further negotiations, said Wolfgang Schuble, the hawkish German finance minister. I dont see any possibility for doing anything. On Tuesday the programme ends.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest
Greece has closed the door on future talks, says Eurogroup president.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chaired the meeting in Brussels, said with his referendum decision Tsipras had closed the door for talks with the creditors.
The ECB has been providing life support to Greece for months by supplying billions in liquidity to the Greek banks. If Draghi pulls the plug, he could be held responsible for potential riots on the streets of Athens and national unrest. If he keeps the funding channels open, he will be accused of acting illegally and overstepping his mandate by financing a eurozone government.
Related: Tsiprass shock call for vote on Greek bailout sets day of destiny for Europe
Dijsselbloem declined to say whether so-called emergency liquidity assistance could continue without a bailout programme in place. The ECBs governing council would need to take that decision.
Alex Stubb, the Finnish finance minister, said a large majority on the committee of finance ministers was against extending the Greek rescue beyond Tuesday. The ministers were surprised by the referendum decision and voiced feelings of betrayal by Tsipras. In the marathon negotiations of the past 10 days, some of them complained, the Greek officials and ministers had not told them of the referendum plan. Whether capital controls would be imposed was up to the Greek authorities, said Stubb: This is a choice the Greek government has made. Im quite sad about it.
The impact of a Greek collapse will have a deep political and economic impact on the rest of Europe, causing recriminations over the conduct of five years of austerity and bailouts which, in the Greek case at least, have failed. This is about our destiny, said Peter Kaimr, the Slovak minister.
Greece owes 320bn, most of it to eurozone governments, and a full default will prove very expensive for the others, not least Germany which has 92bn at stake.
Related: Greek bailout extension refused: a panel of leading economists give their verdict
As the Greek parliament prepared to vote on staging the countrys first referendum in 40 years, Greeks raided ATMs and hoarded euros at home anticipating bank closures, the imposition of capital controls, and the blocking of savings accounts. Such actions appear inevitable if Draghi cuts off funds to Greece.
On Friday Tsipras robustly rejected the creditors terms for extending the bailout until the end of November, bitterly accusing the Europeans and the International Monetary Fund of deliberately seeking to humiliate Greece. On Saturday he refused to back down. He spoke by phone to Merkel and the French president, Franois Hollande, insisting that his referendum would happen. It will take place regardless of the eurogroup decision, he was reported to have told Merkel and Hollande.
Athens also has to repay 1.6bn to the IMF on Tuesday. Without a rescue package in place, it is not clear where the money is coming from.

Survivors of the Tunisian massacre have criticised the initial Foreign Office response to the tragedy, with one describing its approach as rude and ignorant.
Witnesses described being left for hours in the aftermath of the shootings without information, while others said consular officials were slow to reach the scene of the slaughter, claiming that journalists had arrived at the site before them.
Conor Fulford, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, said that in the chaos of the shootings, as he tried to find news of his mother, Sue Davey, the Foreign Office was so dismissive it left him dumbfounded.
Fulford said: They just said if they find any leads then they will let us know. Im at a loss for words at the minute. It just comes across as rude and ignorant. They just dont want to talk to anyone. Its unbelievable.
Journalists arriving from the capital Tunis at the hotel in mid-afternoon on Friday  the shootings unfolded shortly before midday  found survivors milling around, uncertain what to do, and asking reporters for information.
Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood said he had spent much of Saturday on the phone with victims and families caught up in the appalling attack, adding that the Foreign Office was currently reviewing travel advice to the north African country. A second team of Foreign Office officials has flown out to help survivors.
Other residents criticised tour operator Thomsons response to the tragedy, saying that its office, close to the main entrance to the hotel Riu Imperial Maharba, one of the hotels involved in the shootings, had its door open but was deserted.
Witnesses also described survivors sitting in groups at tables in the atrium, some crying and asking people about the fate of missing loved ones. On the terrace, tourists  some still in their swimsuits  sat around being served drinks by equally distressed staff. Weve not seen anyone from Thomson: I dont know where they are, said one Scottish tourist, who asked not to be named, on Friday night. As journalists arrived, some asked if there was any information on what they should do, or whether they could leave the hotel
Concerns among survivors mounted when a team from the Belgian embassy, clad in day-glo jackets bearing their national flag, showed up. The Belgian officials fanned around around the foyer checking the welfare of their few nationals and briefing them on evacuation plans as British tourists waited for their consular officials to arrive.
Survivor Glenn Whitehead had been concerned about security in Tunisia following the massacre of tourists in March at the Bardot museum in Tunis, so he contacted Thomson on the eve of his holiday and claims he was assured that security was fine.
Whiteheads concerns meant that he and and his wife Anita decided not to leave the hotel to visit Sousse town during their holiday, believing the hotel was well guarded. Anita said: We havent seen anyone from Thomson. Weve not been told anything.
She said they had stayed at the hotel the year before, and were comforted then by the sight of daily patrols by police on horseback along the beach. Yet this year, she said, she saw the patrol only once, shortly before the gunman struck.
Despite being the premier location in Sousse, the Marhaba had no armed police or security staff, effectively allowing the gunman to roam the beach and the hotel shooting people at will. Security forces took more than half an hour to arrive.
One Thomson official at the hotel, who did not want to be named, said: The terrorists knew exactly what they were doing. This is the top hotel here. They knew the effect it would have.
Later on Friday, Thomson officials in blue T-shirts arrived and began to take names of tourists, drafting in personnel from other hotels.
A statement from Thomson said: We worked swiftly with the teams in the resort to establish the circumstances. Customer safety was our absolute priority. Staff worked incredibly hard in a very challenging environment. Ten Thomson Airways flights travelled to Tunisia to repatriate approximately 1,000 Thomson and First Choice customers; this all happened as quickly as possible.
 This article was amended on Sunday 28 June 2015. We mistakenly said that Conor Fulford from Staffordshire was staying in a hotel in Sousse. This has been corrected.

Tens of thousands of people, many decked in the colours of the rainbow, took to Londons streets on Saturday to celebrate the annual Pride parade just a day after gay marriage was ruled to be legal across the US.
To mark the historic judgment, which ensures that the 14 states with bans on same-sex marriage cannot enforce them, the United States flag joined those of Ireland and Mozambique at the front of the march in recognition of the progress recently in recognising gay rights in all three countries.
More than 250 groups were represented at the parade which ended in Whitehall. There was additional security after Fridays terrorist attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait, with the Mets deputy assistant commissioner, Helen Ball, saying the force would lay on extra security to help protect and reassure the public and to make sure the public are encouraged to continue with their plans to attend or take part in events as normal.

Ruth Hunt, chief executive of Stonewall, said Pride was a wonderful event that celebrates LGBT equality and how far weve come, adding: However, we must not lose sight of how much is left to do.

The number of reported LGBT hate crimes is on the rise across the UK, our government must address trans-law reform, LGBT people are still being bullied in school and isolated at work, and overseas, many Prides either take place under armed guard or not at all. In fact, its illegal to be gay in 75 countries and punishable by death in 10.
Organisers of the event said earlier this month that they had to wrestle with a difficult issue when deciding whether or not to allow a group from Ukips LGBT group to enter the parade. Despite having their application rejected in order to protect participants and ensure the event passes off safely and in the right spirit several reports on social media suggested that they had joined in without being challenged.

At the parade, campaigner Peter Tatchell held a sign which said: Northern Ireland! End the same-sex marriage ban. Equal Marriage.
Gay marriage is legal in Great Britain but not in Northern Ireland.
Robin Windsor, former professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing, said of the US ruling: Its unbelievable that it happened the day before Pride, and its put everybody in such a great mood and high spirits, ready for such an amazing weekend.

        <title>Urban life in a wheelchair: which city is the most accessible?</title>

This weeks best city stories from around the web describe how easy  or otherwise  it is to get around various cities in a wheelchair, explore the Barcelona project to put mobile micro-houses atop buildings, and reveal Philadelphians proposals for new monuments. Wed love to hear your responses to these stories, and any others youve read recently, both on Guardian Cities and elsewhere. Just share your thoughts in the comments below.
Wheels on the bus
Peter Apps, writing in CityMetric , gives a personal account of the challenges of using city transport in a wheelchair  and reflects on which places are better than others. Paris, apparently, is a nightmare. It has a relatively old metro system and only the bits built since the 1970s are accessible. The rest simply have too many stairs to be made reasonably wheelchair friendly at a non-ridiculous cost.
The same is true of much of the New York metro and London Underground, Apps says. Im lucky enough to live in Canary Wharf where most of the links are relatively new, he writes. I can access most of the immediately available public transport links. That simply isnt true in large swathes of London.
In Washington DC, however, there are lifts at every station. A wheelchair-bound person in DC can travel around with the same level of ease as an able-bodied person. The only other city where Peter found this to be true? Dubai.
Barcelonas top hat
Transforming underused space into housing, in an effort to contain urban sprawl, is nothing new. Rather than converting garages, basements and laneways, however, in Barcelona theyre taking the rooftops. As Mother Nature Network reports , extra floors are being added to existing apartment blocks, in the form of prefab units. These units are transported to site and hoisted up to sit atop the citys historic architecture.
Madrid-based developer La Casa por el Tejado (House on the Roof) argues that they provide a sustainable alternative to traditional development. Electrical and plumbing components are installed in the flat-packed units in advance, so you can just plug in and go. And if you get bored of the view, you can just pick up and move.

The fire that time
The central government in India claims to be providing space for the urban poor through its Housing for All initiative, but critics suggest that they are doing the exact opposite  namely, forcing poor people out of the city in the name of technological progress. In this illuminating Scroll article, Supriya Sharma explains how residents of the Shukra Bazar slum on Delhis periphery believe that the fire that destroyed their homes was a deliberate effort to evict them from the land.
The slum is surrounded by middle-class apartments and a luxury Radisson Blu hotel. Until last year, a colony of waste collectors had lived on the land undisturbed. But now, municipal authorities are demanding they move: government funds have been allotted to develop a smart city there. One resident scoffs: What is the point of installing CCTV and Wi-Fi when we still dont know how to manage our garbage collection?
Homegrown monuments
Last month, as part of the Monument Lab project , around 400 Philadelphians proposed new monuments for their city. Monument Lab has documented and mapped all of the proposals  oversized pretzels, abstract responses to gentrification, political sculptures against violence, memorials to the 1985 MOVE bombing and more.
Many of the proposed monuments commented on gentrification. Many proposals seek to combat displacement and the erasure of marginalised communities by making the experiences and struggles of those communities more visible, writes Sky Kalfus for Next City . So will any of them be built? Paul Farber, one of the projects co-curators, says the first step is to treat the ideas as valuable, constructive and precious parts of Philadelphia history.

        <title>Dirty boulevard: why Paris's ring road is a major block on the city's grand plans</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/26/ring-road-paris-peripherique-suburbs-banlieue</Link>
        <Description/>
        <MainBody>Share on WhatsApp
With 1.1m cars a day, the 35 kilometres of the Boulevard Priphrique are the busiest in Europe . Pariss inner ring road runs around the French capital, following the citys administrative boundaries almost perfectly and connecting the city proper and its banlieues, or suburbs.
Since its inauguration in 1973, the priphrique  measuring 40 to 60 metres wide and composed of up to six lanes  has been a concrete belt around Paris, making all too real what should have remained an invisible administrative boundary. This has reinforced the insurmountable contrast between Paris and the citys adjacent municipalities, adding a physical dimension to political borders and separating the Parisiens from the rest of France .
Architect Richard Rogers , who designed a strategic plan for the city , said: I dont know of any other city where the heart is as detached from its limbs. A number of studies published this year by Atelier Parisien dUrbanisme , the public agency in charge of urban studies, qualify almost the whole priphrique as a challenge for urban integration.
As a result, on the first day of 2016, the Mtropole du Grand Paris will come to life. The MGP aims to deliver a more integrated development to Paris and its suburbs, by creating a new metropolitan governance.
Pariss boundaries are defined by its fortifications  displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning
The City of Paris and its 2.3 million inhabitants will be merged with its petite couronne (small crown, or inner suburbs), adding about 4.6 million residents and an extra 128 local authorities to form a new metropolitan institution: the Grand Paris.
Where New York, Berlin and London have successfully created metropolitan governments, can Paris overcome its inner boundary, and convince inhabitants of Paris proper and the suburbs that they are all Parisiens? And to achieve this, should it sacrifice the priphrique, the citys most prominent physical and symbolic boundary?
The roots of the division between Paris and its suburbs run much deeper than the building of the road in the 1970s. To understand the significance, we need to go back to the fall of Napoleon. In March 1814, the Battle of Paris saw the defeat of the Napoleonic troops and Prussian forces storming the capital city.
Consequently, King Louis-Philippe and French prime minister Adolphe Thiers decided to transform Paris into a fortress and protect the city from any further intrusion, ordering construction of city fortifications in the 1840s. Completed in 1844, the message was clear: Pariss boundaries were to be defined by its fortifications  displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning.

Consisting of a thick wall, 10 metres high and protected by a wide ditch, the ramparts were also granted a 250-metre wide non-building zone. Yet, as the fortifications lost military relevance and became obsolete only decades after their completion, informal settlements mushroomed within the Zone, housing the Parisian proletariat.
The destruction of the fortifications was in the pipeline as early as 1882, but only started in 1919 and was completed in 1929. To put this into perspective, Berlin destroyed its last fortifications in 1740; London in 1760.
In Paris, the defunct fortifications were replaced at the beginning of the 1930s by a grand scheme of social housing. Yet the Zone remained untouched, full of zonards (still a deprecating term for someone from a deprived area who loiters suspiciously) and their insalubrious housing.
While the idea of an orbital road around Paris emerged in the 1920s, it was only in 1956 that the construction of the priphrique started. It addressed the increase in inner-city car use, and similar schemes were designed in cities around the world . The zone was cleared, its inhabitants evicted and the priphrique was inaugurated in 1973 , after 17 years of building work.
Cutting across the city, the priphriques viaduct structure is omnipresent in the working-class neighbourhoods of north-east Paris, but in well-off areas  such as Vincennes in the east, and Boulogne in the west  it discreetly passes underground as a tunnel. In the main, though, a formidable ring of concrete now stands where fortifications once did. London has its green belt, Paris its concrete one.

To explore the physical boundary created by the road, we must meet the people who have a direct relationship with it. All along the priphrique, the entrances to Paris are still named portes, as they are located where the fortifications gates used to stand. Walking from Porte Dore to Porte de la Chapelle, I encounter various types of transition between Paris and its banlieues. In some places, the transition is smooth and painless: the tunnel of the priphrique allows Parisians to easily access the Bois de Vincennes  one of Pariss green lungs, which sits outside the boundary but is under Pariss jurisdiction. Where Paris connects with the well-off cities of Saint-Mand and Vincennes, several effortless transitions are in place, allowing residents to move easily from one area to another, as resident Dorothe confirms.
In 1932, Dorothes in-laws moved into a housing block built in the place of the fortifications; she moved into the flat herself in 1969, as the priphrique was being completed. Living on the edge of the 12th arrondissement, she is within walking distance of Saint-Mand and Vincennes. In other spots, such as Porte de Montreuil, its really different  there is a real break between Paris and [those suburbs]. But here, we are well connected. Theres a real continuity.

The compact and humble houses evoke rural France
The Porte de Montreuil, a few kilometres up the priphrique, offers a starker contrast between Paris and the adjacent environs of Montreuil and Bagnolet. The roundabout, which connects the area with the priphrique by means of four access roads, is empty of almost any pedestrian or bicycle  and, although the Rue dAvron on the Paris side and the Rue de Paris on Montreuils side are very busy thoroughfares, they do not connect.
Bndicte, a Montreuil resident, describes the priphrique as a ditch between Montreuil and Paris. While the priphrique running below the roundabout leaves a wide void between the two areas, how it is built  its height, architectural style and condition  on each side of the road reveals another level of divide.
In Montreuil and Bagnolet, alongside glossy new office buildings sits the traditional suburban housing stock: 19th-century houses that are one or two storeys high. With its compact and humble houses, sometimes left in ruins, the streetscape evokes rural France, not the core of the wealthiest region in Europe. An unlikely vision when you consider that Paris is among the biggest property markets in the world.
Here you might be only 60 metres away from the capital, but you are not in Paris any more. Cross the priphrique and the value of properties drops by half , from 6,300 per sq metre in the 20th arrondissement to 3,800 per sq metre in Bagnolet. Yet it has good transport connections, with line 3 of the Mtro stopping here, plenty of buses to Paris, and docking stations for both Autolib and Vlib: the self-service car- and bicycle-sharing systems launched by the City of Paris.
As I continue my orbital journey along the priphrique, the divide between Paris and its banlieues changes many times. A few hundred metres further, I have to face the Bagnolet Interchange  Pariss very own spaghetti junction. A few kilometres later sits the Porte des Lilas: here the road has recently been covered, creating a whole new district and a new way to move between Paris and the adjacent town. A couple of kilometres later, arriving at Porte de la Chapelle, the contrast is even more pronounced.

But there is not only negative feeling for the priphrique. Carla, a resident of the 19th arrondissement of Paris who works in the nearby town of Colombes, and her colleague Aude, who lives in Saint-Ouen right outside the priphrique, explain that not all the points of passage on the priphrique are the same. For instance, at the Porte Montmartre there are always people, even in the middle of the night. It is always full.
I am very aware of the Paris-banlieue divide, probably because I grew up here: thats a very Parisian attitude
While some parts of the priphrique remain a hostile environment for pedestrians, it seems the residents close to the road have found ways to cope with the concrete beast. Sophie, who lives on the edge of Pariss 18th arrondissement, says the break between Paris and the banlieue is visible. Its physical. For instance, the cycle path between Paris and Saint-Ouen stops at the Porte Montmatre, where the priphrique starts. Yet, Anis, from the 17th arrondissement, says: The priphrique, its like a rampart, like a wall  but more or less invisible. Bndicte from Montreuil adds: The priphrique is both a connector and the separation between Paris and its suburbs.
Talking with the residents, I realise there is much more to this than just an urban design issue. While the road and its 1.1m daily cars does not help, the reconnection between the citys heart and its limbs might require more subtle intervention. Perhaps the last wall that will bring down the invisible rampart is in fact a psychological one.
Marko, from Clichy, and Bndicte believe the banlieue is a myth. Bndicte, who moved to Montreuil in the 1990s after a lifetime in central Paris, adds that Montreuil was a compromise: My husband [who did not grow up in Paris] had no prejudice about the suburbs. Meanwhile, I am very aware of the Paris/banlieue divide, probably because I grew up here: thats a very Parisian attitude.
Marko and Anis were interviewed in 2013 by citizen collective and NGO Mtropop for its project titled My Neighbourhood, My Heritage. Antoine Le Pessec, its president, tells me Mtropops objective is to question representations of the banlieues, to work on social prejudice, and to accompany Parisians and suburbanites towards founding a genuine Grand Paris. Beyond redesigning political institutions or the priphrique, the real challenge is in peoples heads.

From 1 January 2016, Bagnolet, Montreuil, Vincennes, Saint-Ouen, Colombes, Paris and more than 100 other municipalities will form the Mtropole du Grand Paris. For the first time since 1860, we will witness an institutional attempt to move Paris beyond its own boundaries, beyond the priphrique. Yet, in six months time, the road will still be standing, untouched and unchallenged.
Projects  of uneven quality and relevance  to get rid of the priphrique have regularly appeared in the media since the 1990s. Some parts have been covered, making the transition between Paris and the adjacent municipalities smoother. Yet a total coverage of the priphrique has never been seriously contemplated  it would be immensely costly  and nor has its destruction, as the city struggles with managing its car traffic.

Yet plans announced in May by Mayor Hidalgo to pedestrianise inner-city urban motorways along the Seine were, until recently, seen as ludicrous and unrealistic. They follow up on a similar successful scheme implemented by former Mayor Bertrand Delano in 2013, which was met at the time with fierce opposition from pro-car lobbies. Why cant the challenges of the priphrique be met with similar panache?
This iconic road remains an eyesore, as well as a major health hazard for the hundreds of thousands who live close to it. And, surely, dedicating hundreds of hectares in a central location to a single road is a lost opportunity in a city where land is scarce.
The main divide between Parisiens and banlieusards, however, remains a psychological one. While redesigning and reinventing the priphrique is certainly part of the solution, it is Parisians perceptions that must change if the ghosts of Pariss historic fortifications are to be eradicated for good.

'My children are suffering but what can I do?' Delhi's polluted air, by the people who live there
A family living in the middle of an eight-lane motorway, an autorickshaw driver struggling to breathe, a young woman who cant wait to leave ... the foul air of Indias capital affects all sections of society

For three years Mohammad Yunus, his wife Babli, five children and a handful of relatives have made their home on a patch of concrete in the middle of an eight-lane motorway, near a stretch of road named after Mahatma Gandhi. As lorries, buses and motorcycles roar past on either side of the familys cramped bit of south Delhi pavement, and a modern, concrete flyover carries several more lanes of traffic overhead, their evening routine unfolds.
A young woman in a pink dress squats to kindle a fire from wooden sticks and plastic bottles, then breaks a lump of dough into pieces to bake into chapatti bread. A three-month-old baby and a toddler sleep on a dirty mat just a few feet from the curb. The incessant blaring of horns makes conversation difficult, but does not rouse the children.
Delhis horrendous air pollution  the worst in the world, according to the World Health Organisation  is far from the only worry facing the Yunus family. But the poisonous fumes are doing them serious harm, and the children are particularly vulnerable to its health-wrecking effects .

Babli Yunus has a thick, phlegmy, hacking cough that she says never goes away. Her son Toufiq, who looks about nine (no one at this encampment knows their precise ages), has had a fever for several days. I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do? Babli asks as one daughter, aged about three, leans back in her lap, playing with a dirty yellow comb. This child has a cough and cold. So does this one.
Babli doesnt know whether the familys latest round of illnesses was caused by the diesel and petrol exhaust that gives the air an acrid smell and a heavy feel, or by a soaking rain that left their clothes and blankets wet. It all goes into our systems, she says. We end up eating a lot of dust.
Dust, dirt, everything, her husband echoes. This is a main road. It never closes.
It is hard to imagine an existence more wretched than that of the Yunus family, huddled together on this dirty rectangle of concrete about 10 x 4 metres, surrounded by traffic on three sides and pressed on the fourth against a tall metal fence. Mohammad brings home what money he can, working on construction sites and selling vegetables in the market. His children, who do not attend school, earn a few coins collecting discarded plastic bottles from around a nearby bus stop.
Mohammad says a total of 1820 people live in the space. Their belongings hang from the fences spikes: a plastic bucket, bundles wrapped in patterned cloth, a few blankets, a shirt. Pedestrians stream past just inches away, dodging traffic and carrying goods on their heads or under their arms. A few months ago, a girl of around eight living on the same stretch of road was struck by a car and killed, nearby families say.
Delhis foul air impacts all sections of its society. A 2010 study of more than 11,000 schoolchildren found 43% had poorly developing lungs, compared with 25% of a rural control group. The Delhi pupils were three times more likely to have severe impairment, and such deficits are believed to last for life.
I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do?
Babli Yunus
But the citys destitute  poorly nourished, often suffering from chronic illnesses, and unable to afford medical care  are the most severely affected. These people dont get any respite from the pollution, even at night, so yes I think it does [cause more death and illness among the poor], says Dr Neeraj Jain, a respiratory consultant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Its just their economic status that makes them more vulnerable.
A growing body of research also shows that those living within a few hundred metres of major thoroughfares suffer greater health problems. Everywhere in Delhi, the air is thick with toxins, and levels of the tiniest pollution particles  linked to ailments from heart attacks and stroke to cancer , respiratory infections and even dementia  reach 17 times the recommended limits in some parts of the city. Even in the springtime, when the air is far better than in the filthy, choking winters , the haze is visible night and day, shimmering in the headlights of cars and blurring buildings and bridges behind a gauzy grey curtain.
Mohammad and his relatives came to Delhi from their village near Lucknow because the high cost of land made it impossible for them to earn a living by farming. The family originally camped a few kilometres away but police forced them out so they settled beneath the flyover, unable to find anywhere better to live.
It was Gods will that we came here, says Yunus, a slim man in a worn grey shirt and trousers, his face freshly shaven but for a neat moustache. Where should we go? You tell us.

The autorickshaw driver
In Delhi, millions live much of their lives on the street. It is not just the homeless: vendors of everything from car parts and furniture to drinks and snacks spend their workdays beside busy roads. Rickshaw drivers wait at busy corners for fares, then pedal through heavy traffic, inhaling pollution deeply.
Sitting for hours in New Delhis gridlocked traffic, perched behind the handlebars of his open-air autorickshaw, Nand Lal Kumar coughs and coughs, struggling for air. His head pounds, my chest gets heavy, stomach gets tight and I feel suffocated, anxious.
I have difficulty breathing at the end of the day, my face is black with soot, says Kumar, waiting for his next fare on a noisy corner in south Delhi, beside a road jammed with honking cars, trucks and buses. But theres absolutely no other alternative. There are no other jobs.
Kumar, 38, left his village more than 20 years ago to seek opportunity in the capital, but he still struggles to scratch out a living. After fuel, maintenance and loan payments, he nets 300 or 400 rupees, about three or four pounds, each day.
I cant even pay my rent on time. I havent been able to pay my childrens school fees for a year or two. I pay half the fee, they go for a while, then they have to stop, he says. Nobody thinks about autorickshaw drivers in this country. Passengers are only concerned that we might overcharge them. Nobody cares about us or our families.
The doorless, green-and-yellow three-wheelers that clog Delhis streets were converted to compressed natural gas years ago, so they create little pollution. Their drivers, though, inhale the health-wrecking air on the roads all day. Scientists who measured levels of tiny, dangerous airborne particles in autorickshaws backseats said they were the among the worst ever found in a regular form of transport, up to eight times higher than Delhis already disastrous baseline pollution. Kumar, in battered sandals and a worn, blue-grey uniform, knows he suffers the effects.
He sees a respiratory expert every few months, to little avail. Take medicines and youll be fine, thats what the doctor says. It gets OK and then it gets bad again, he says. My cough doesnt stop for a month at a time.
I do worry about my future health, but theres nothing I can do, he says sadly. My job is a hazard for me.
The young family
As well as the 7.5 million vehicles on Delhis roads (with nearly 1,400 more added every day), smouldering garbage fires are everywhere in the city, and poor families burn wood and dung to cook and stay warm. Just beyond the city limits, thousands of primitive brick-making factories send plumes of black smoke into the air, while coal-burning power plants lack even the most basic filtration systems.
Dirty diesel generators power mobile-phone towers and provide back-up electricity for malls, hospitals and apartment blocks. Smoke from the fires that farmers in neighbouring states set to get rid of crop stubble after harvest settles over the city. Construction projects such as the expansion of the Delhi Metro  a long-term hope for reducing pollution  only add to the clouds of dust.
After Manjali Khosla and her family moved to Delhi from Dubai three years ago, she spent the first six months fighting pneumonia. She tried every brand of face mask she could find, to filter out the pollution she blames for her illness and keep others from catching it.
Born in India and raised in Hong Kong and North America, Manjali wanted her children to experience life in their parents home country and spend time with extended family. She and her husband did not understand until they arrived just how big a role Delhis filthy air would play in their lives.
You feel like theres like an ulcer inside you, somethings burning, and it takes a week for the feeling to go away

The children, a 10-year-old and twins aged eight, sometimes wear masks at school . Someone in the family is always coughing and Manjalis father-in-law suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a severe lung problem. She has a PhD in chemistry so she understands the science. Air pollution is Indias fifth-biggest killer, causing 620,000 premature deaths a year, and it terrifies her.
Manjali has bought filters for the familys house and plants that are said to purify the air. She finds indoor activities to discourage the kids from playing outside on the foulest days, and plans holidays abroad as often as possible  but still frets about what their years in Delhi may do to her childrens health. Ive even dreamed polyps coming out of their lungs, something very drastic, she says.
Returning to Delhi after trips away, the kids come off the plane holding their noses. Symptoms are always bad during the first days back: You feel like theres like an ulcer or something inside you, somethings burning, and it takes about a week for the feeling to go away, she says. The sinuses hurt, your head hurts, your eyes water.
But while many of the foreign families Manjali knows are contemplating leaving, she is determined to stay in Delhi for a few more years yet.
My kids say, Why are we here, why dont we just leave? But I say, If we leave, it doesnt solve the problem  your grandparents are still here, your cousins are still here. Lets stay and try to fix it. And in the meantime, wear masks.
The paediatrician
Dr Sanjeev Bagai has one word to describe what it feels like to see the wheezing children who stream through his surgery door every day: Helpless.
He can treat them with steroids and inhalers, and antibiotics for those with bronchitis  but he cannot clean the air that makes them sick.
In his practice, asthma cases are up by 40-45% in the last five years, poor lung function is common, and lowered oxygen levels caused by breathing difficulties can lead to long-term problems with vision, growth and brain development, says the paediatrician.
This morning, Ive seen five patients; three had wheezing. All of them were under six. Bagai, a burly man with cufflinks and a carefully waxed handlebar moustache, explains that asthma, once seen only in children over three or four, is now common in babies and toddlers. He once diagnosed it in a newborn, less than three weeks old. Rapid breathing, breathlessness, spasmodic cough, he says.  It can be life-threatening.
According to Bagai, asthma carries a stigma in India , and young patients often become depressed and withdrawn. They feel scared to play, they miss a lot of school days, he says. Very often kids say, Im taking all the medicine, but why am I getting this again and again? Why me?
The lorry driver

In the hottest part of a baking day, eight truckers are stretched out on a concrete platform in their companys bare, windowless office, waiting for 10pm, the earliest they are allowed to drive their hulking diesel vehicles through Delhi.
A dozen lorries are parked outside, their cabs decorated with scraps of sparkly tinsel. Its a tough life, but this is what I do, says Surinder Singh, sitting on a blue wooden table, a Hindi newspaper in one hand. If I had some other job, I could spend time with my children, relax, go to the market.
It is mid-afternoon and Singh, with a round face and boyish sweetness in his eyes, has not been home since last night; grey stubble covers his cheeks and chin. He plans to stop there for a nap, dinner and a bath before heading out with a load of iron pipes. There is no rest in this job.
An estimated 80,000 trucks crowd Delhis roads every night, spewing a toxic stew of pollutants . So Singh and other drivers have become a focus of the citys growing pollution concerns.
Now, their livelihoods are in jeopardy. In April, judges barred all diesel vehicles more than 10 years old from entering the capital. Truck drivers threatened to strike and the court postponed its order , but the threat remains.
My truck will be as good as scrap [under the rule], Singh says. He estimates the decision slashed two-thirds off the value of the lorry that became his in 2013, after nine years of repayments. How will I feed my children? How will I educate them if I lose my business, my job?
He feels the effects of dirty air himself  shortness of breath, itchy eyes, a cough. But he doesnt think truckers deserve all the blame. Look at the garbage fire right here, he adds, pointing toward a thick cloud of acrid smoke across the street. And what about the 20 and 25-year-old cars that drive on the roads of Delhi?
The wantaway Delhiite
Pavika Bakshi has swallowed live fish and drunk the waters of a healing stream in search of something to stop her wheezing. Aside from medication, the only thing that helps, she says, is yoga.
It wont be enough to keep her in New Delhi, though. Bakshis parents are searching for a husband for her, and she has told them to look beyond the city.
It could be outside India, it could be in India around the coastline, she says, perched on a chair in a quiet room at the yoga school where she practices. Anywhere I feel better.
Its not a happy situation to be in, because this is my city and I absolutely love it  but I wish it was minus this huge baggage. I keep asking my mother all the time, Why are we a part of this place? Why are we here? Can we not leave?
Bakshi, 32, says she feels well whenever she goes abroad, so is certain it is Delhis air that makes her chest grow tight and her breathing raspy. You come back glowing, because you are healthier, she says. But soon after returning, there is no energy and you are lifeless and you are dull.
Her friends talk all the time about leaving, says Bakshi, who has long, dark hair and a sparkling stud in her nose. Weve all been in good jobs, we are making good money here, but what am I supposed to do with that money? she says. It cant buy me clean air.

Dirty air, and the death and illness it causes, have become front-page news in India. Government ministers and the courts are taking heed, announcing a bevy of measures  from fines for burning garbage to coal-fired power plant upgrades. But many doubt the rules will be enforced.
At one level, Im confident that something will happen now, because the public outrage over this rising pollution is at such a pitch that a government cannot ignore it altogether, says Arindam Sen Gupta , executive editor of the Times of India. But how effective this plan will be is a matter of speculation.
I dont think theres a cohesive vision  we work in fits and starts. When the problem becomes acute, we wake up to it and then emergency measures are taken. Its usually pressure from below which works in India, from the people.

        <title>Chennai unchained: can India's first cycle cafe make bikes cool again?</title>

Before the sun rises over the East Coast Road south of Chennai each day, a lone rider speeds down the tarmac. Dressed in a fluorescent jersey and cycling shoes with a srichurnam  a red line of lime and turmeric paste  on his forehead, Ramanujar Moulana has followed exactly the same route every day for the past four decades  until now. For the past few weeks theres been a new stop on his agenda: Indias first cycle cafe.
Nestled in Kotturpuram, a plush neighbourhood in the south of Tamil Nadus state capital, is the Ciclo Cafe . It boasts a cycle spa, where riders can watch their bike get washed while they drink their coffee, a reading area stocked with books on cycling, and decor fashioned from bike parts  cycle-chain chandeliers and table legs made from front forks. A retail zone showcases high-end brands like Bianchi, Cannondale, Mongoose and Schwinn.
There is more to Chennai than ancient temples, Carnatic music and filter coffee, says Nidhi Kapoor Thadani, the co-founder of the cafe, who was partly inspired after a visit to Look Mum No Hands! in Shoreditch, east London. Thanks to the many recreational cycling clubs in Chennai the city has a strong cycling culture.
I gave up cycling in the late 80s. As the city grew, so did pollution, and cycling was pass
Mithra Massillamoney
Bikes ands taxis outside Chennai central station. Cycling has been a part of the city since the colonial period
Cycling has been a part of Chennai since the colonial period, when many British officers used bikes as their main mode of city transport. Nowadays, at least 37% of Chennai households own a bike, according to the Energy and Resources Institute; yet there is little in the way of local provision for cyclists and the city remains without a single urban bike lane.
Ciclo Cafe customer and longtime Chennai resident Mithra Massillamoney remembers that 1970s Madras, as the city was known until 1996, was friendlier to cyclists. I used to ride a cycle to work every day in the mid 70s. Madras wasnt so crowded back then. But I gave up cycling in the late 80s  as the city grew, so did pollution, and cycle was pass  motorbikes and cars were in.
Mithra wasnt alone. Cycling dropped significantly through the 1980s and 90s, as the city became known as the  Detroit of India  for its burgeoning motor industry  international companies including Hyundai, Renault, Bosch, Ford and BMW have factories in the area.
Since 1949, Chennai has also been home to manufacturing by TI Cycles  one of Indias big four bike-makers alongside Hero, Atlas and Avon, who together account for 90% of the 16m bicycles sold in the country every year. Yet, while India ranks among the worlds top bicycle manufactures, bikes lack the status of cars or motorcycles.
While Chennai doesnt have any cycle infrastructure, cities such as Delhi have built some bike paths. I definitely dont think Indian cities provide facilities for cyclists, says prominent environmentalist Sunita Narain, who suffered multiple fractures when she was hit by a reversing car in Delhi two years ago.

The Cycling Yogis on a ride. Its 2,000 members take part in organised rides to heritage sites in the city
In fact, we are going in the opposite direction. We dont see cyclists on the road. Urban planners consider them invisible people. The entire planning objective of the government is to widen the road to accommodate cars and even when cycling tracks are constructed in places like Delhi, they are not continuous and only cover a very small part of the city.
Data shows that the most vulnerable road users are cyclists and pedestrians. Our cities need cycle tracks and we need to increase penalties for those responsible for road accidents, and increase camera surveillance to investigate when somebody is hit. This is why the upcoming Road Transport and Safety Bill must look at the safety of cyclists.
The urban decay started in the late 1970s and continues today, adds Jasbir Singh, co-founder of Pedal Yatri, a recreational cycle group based in Gurgaon near Delhi. In the 1960s and 70s, every Biswajeet or Rajesh Khanna movie seemed to have at least one musical number featuring a group of happy girls cycling blissfully along, but in the name of urbanisation many switched to 100cc motorbikes and the bicycle was left to the economically needy, he explains. Given a choice, even the poorest people will not ride a bike because of safety concerns, and because they want to grow up in life.
Jasbir does believe that is changing, though, thanks to a handful of lifestyle and health conscious individuals.
Related: 'Nobody cycles across Mumbai.' But why?
In Chennai, a growing number of recreational cycling groups  the Tamilnadu Cycling Club, Madras Randonneurs and Chain Reaxion among them  are building on that heritage. At the forefront are the Cycling Yogis, founded by Ramanujar Moulana, whose 2,000 members take part in organised rides to heritage sites in the city.
He hopes Ciclo Cafe can help raise awareness about cycling as a viable mode of transport by, for example, profiling residents who bike-commute in the pages of the menu and organising rides for customers. If the cafe can stir the interest of non-cyclists about cycling, he says, it is definitely a good addition to the city.

        <title>Cape Town's death industry: 'If you’re buried here, it’s ​​as if they threw you away'</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/23/cape-town-south-africa-death-graves-xhosa-buried-eastern-cape</Link>

One recent Friday night just outside Cape Town , I sat on the side of the N1 highway and counted dead bodies. Kombi vans pulling coffins on trailers were converging at a tunnel that cuts through the mountains. Some call this the border between the city and the Other Side: the Eastern Cape, the rural heartland of the Xhosa people where hills are dotted with colourfully painted mud huts and pastures are grazed by sheep, goats and cattle.
Many Xhosas leave the family homestead to work in Cape Town. They make up the vast majority of this South African citys black population and spend most, if not all, of their lives there. But few want to spend their afterlives there too. So, every weekend, the reverse migration of the dead begins. Over the span of four hours, I counted 196 coffins.
The UNs Population Division estimates that, by 2050, nearly 80% of South Africas population will live in cities . But, among the Xhosa, this rapid increase in urbanisation is happening at the same time as a fierce reclamation of their connection to the old soil. They cinch that commitment with their bones. And its not just the newly dead who are being brought home. Those who have been buried in Cape Town for decades are finding their way back to the Eastern Cape, too.
Bukelwa Fortuin, 26, works just outside the city for First National Bank and lives in Site B of Khayelitsha, Cape Towns largest township. A few months ago, she started dreaming of her dead mother, who had been buried in Cape Town nearly 20 years earlier. Fortuin dreamed the same dream six times, and couldnt get her mother out of her head.
These drives can be perilous and they are expensive, too: the transport alone can cost upwards of $1,000

Every time she passed the cemetery where her mother was buried, she would cry. She would cry at other times out of the blue, and had a few strange experiences  such as the time she beat up a guy who was being disrespectful to an old lady at a taxi rank. When Fortuin eventually sought the guidance of a sangoma healer, she was told that her mother was trying to show she didnt want to be buried in Cape Town. She wanted to go home.
Fortuin talked to some Xhosa elders. They suggested she go to the grave to speak to her mothers spirit and try to bring it back to the Eastern Cape. No, she told them, I think she wants to be exhumed.
Fortuin talked to her father, Griffith, about the possibility of digging up her mothers bones and bringing them home. He explained that he hadnt originally wanted to bury her in Cape Town but wasnt working at the time, so had had no other choice. The regret he felt for burying his wife in the city meant he welcomed the idea of bringing her bones back to the Eastern Cape.
They hired an undertaker, found the death certificate, identified the grave, and planned a second funeral in their village in the Eastern Cape. Funeral policies do not cover exhumations, so the hefty price of the endeavour  around 15,000 rand ($1,300)  came out of their own pockets.
A date was settled on, so that a Cape Town health inspector could be present to prevent any active spores from diseases such as tuberculosis from infecting those unburying the bones. When the day came, Fortuin, her father, the undertaker, the health inspector and a few hired hands went to the graveyard in Maitland . Fortuin watched men with rubber boots, overalls, masks and gloves dig into the dirt.
When the men neared the spot where her mothers bones lay, Bukelwa stepped forward without saying a word. She clambered into the grave, plucked each bone out of the soil with her bare hands, and placed them in a pile on the ground. When she climbed out of the grave, she put the bones inside a new coffin. She didnt want one piece of her mother left in Cape Town.

In the latter half of the 19th century, once diamonds and then gold had been discovered in South Africa, men from all over the region began leaving their rural homelands in search of employment. Between 1871 and 1875, as many as 80,000 Africans worked in the diamond fields each year. Plenty of challenges came with being uprooted: the dangers of working the mines, the horrors of the living conditions, the distance from home. But nothing was as horrible as the idea of being buried in foreign soil.
Miners did all they could to avoid dying far away from home. The academic Tshidiso Maloka describes how, at one diamond mine in the Orange Free State , each Mosotho migrant contributed three pence a month to create a fund that would help the sick return home . These mutual aid funds became common among African miners, and are the basis for the burial societies still common in South Africa today.
These days, of course, its not just miners who live far from home. Families are spread out across the country, but amid this spatial dispersion, the fear of dying far from their point of origin has remained . It is now the reason for a growing industry that transports the dead across South Africa  an industry I came across while living on the Other Side in the small city of King Williams Town, whose streets seemed to boast more funeral parlours than convenience stores. You could buy funeral insurance there in drugstores, at the bank, or even via SMS.
Every Saturday, huge tents housing suit-clad men and dressed-up women would spring up throughout the surrounding countryside; the demand for burials in that much-loved soil came from both near and far. Many of the funeral ceremonies were for people who hadnt lived in the region in years  or, in the case of a growing generation of young Capetonians, who had never lived there at all.
A few months later, I began hanging out in the townships of Cape Town, where most of the citys Xhosa population now resides. I wandered from shack to shack, asking the people I met, Where do you want to be buried?
For bodies to make the journey to the Eastern Cape they have to be embalmed, which happens at the mortuary

People often chuckled at my forwardness and desire to talk about death so soon after meeting them  but almost everyone answered without hesitation: the Eastern Cape. People knew where they lived (the city), they knew why (to work), and they knew where their true home remained (the Other Side).
In one shack on a sandy road in Khayelitsha, a group of young people answered in unison that they all wanted to be buried in the Eastern Cape. Our great grandparents come from there, said Lwazi Lwasi, a young man in a striped collared shirt. Why would we be buried in the sand when theres proper soil back home?
If youre buried here, its as if they threw you away, said Vikela Qinga, a young woman with a floral T-shirt and grey leggings.
Siyabulela Duna, a tall man standing in the open doorway, shook his head at the idea of being buried in Cape Town. Not here, not here, he said. I dont belong here. I am a visitor here. Duna, like most of the young people present that day, was born and raised in Cape Town.
I turned to the others in the room, and asked if they felt like visitors here, too. All of them nodded. Im only here for a job, Mzyanda Mseleni said. I dont belong here. I belong in the Eastern Cape.

Mourners sing at a Khayelitsha funeral
Cape Towns funeral industry has responded to this hankering for home by modernising, and commercialising, the movement of dead bodies across what the academic Rebekah Lee calls the  rural-urban nexus . After someone in Cape Town dies, their family hires an undertaker. The undertaker takes care of the logistics: getting the body to a mortuary, organising the death certificate, helping the family pick out a coffin.
For years most undertakers were white, but once black entrepreneurs took over in the scene in the townships, they became cultural mediators and technological innovators. Unlike white undertakers, who may not have understood the desire to exhume bones or transport a body to a different location, Xhosa undertakers knew precisely why families wanted these things, and could advise customers accordingly.
For bodies to make the journey to the Eastern Cape they have to be embalmed, which happens at the mortuary. Embalming involves injecting a body with a carcinogen so that it doesnt rot, a practice that took hold in the United States during the Civil War, when northern families had their dead loved ones brought home from the south.
Most funerals happen on a Saturday so, come Friday night, there is one last service in the city. The undertaker takes the body from the morgue, puts it in a coffin, loads the coffin into the back of his car  most use old station wagons  and then drives it over to the familys house for the service.
After the service is over, usually around 7pm, the coffin is packed into a trailer and surrounded by clothes so it doesnt budge or shake on the 12-hour drive back to the Eastern Cape. Before family and friends crowd into the kombi pulling the trailer, one family member speaks to the body, telling the deceased that they are going home, and asking them for a safe journey on the way there.
These drives can be perilous  accidents en route to funerals have been dubbed  twice deaths   and they are expensive: transport alone can cost 10,000 rand (upwards of $1,000). But many Xhosa believe that, if you dont pay for a body to leave Cape Town immediately after death, youll only pay more later by organising an exhumation, as Fortuin and her father did.

According to the official census, 391,749 people lived in the Khayelitsha township in 2011, although many estimate that the population is larger. The township is a recent development; while Cape Towns growth accelerated with the boom of gold and diamonds at the turn of the 20th century, pass laws were put in place to keep the city segregated  including the Natives (Urban Areas) act of 1923 , which made all cities in South Africa white, and forced all black African men in cities to carry around passes. Those found without this permit would be arrested and sent back to a rural area.
When the National Party was elected in 1948, this geography of exclusion turned rigid with the implementation of apartheid. Within the city, the Group Areas act began to be enforced, which meant separating races into their own areas in what had been, for some 300 years, a mixed city. In neighbourhoods such as District Six, which was deemed a white area in 1966, many people were forced to leave their homes.
During this time, measures were also taken for influx control to keep Africans out of the cities and in their Bantu homelands  rural areas designated to different ethnic groups, some of which were separate nations until the end of apartheid.
Yet, despite all of these efforts at containment, by 1980 Greater Cape Towns population was nearly 1.9 million people. Pass laws were repealed six years later, and the city, especially the townships, experienced a whole new influx, which brought what is now Khayelitsha into being.

Noluthando Kapa (second left) and friends in Khayelitsha reminisce about home
The South African author Rian Malan described it thus:  It was as if a distant dam had broken , allowing a mass of desperate and hopeful humanity to come flooding over the mountains and spread out across the Cape Flats. They came at the rate of 80, 90 families a day, and built homes with their bare hands, using wooden poles, tin sheeting, bits and pieces of trash rescued from landfills and plastic garbage bags to keep out the rain. Within two years, the sand dunes had vanished under an enormous sea of shacks and shanties, as densely packed as a medieval city.
More than 20 years after democracy, the spatial separation and the sea of shacks and shanties remain: 99% of Khayelitsha residents are black Africans. Life in the township has its perks  cheap transportation, the possibility of work, young people to pass the time with. But, over and over, when I mentioned the idea of being buried in town, people here shuddered.
The watery ground of Cape Town is one of the most common reasons people say they dont want to be buried in the city. Most dwellings in Khayelitsha lie within the floodplain of the Kuils River, where the sand doesnt drain well. When the winter rains come, Khayelitsha floods. One study found that more than 81% of households in one section of the township always flood, and 11% of households sometimes flood. Another found that, during three winters in the late 2000s, between 32,000 and 34,400 people were displaced from informal settlements in Cape Town each year as a result of flooding.
This water is troubling in life  wiping out houses, spreading disease, forcing people to move  and in death, too. When Khayelitsha floods, so do its graves. As Lee notes in her article Death on the Move , a 2003 metropolitan cemetery study in Cape Town identified a looming cemetery crisis, with 16 of the 31 municipal cemeteries  subject to high water table conditions for up to six months of the year.
One afternoon, I talked with a group of women in a shack in Khayelitsha. One of them was an older woman named Noluthando Kapa. She moved to Cape Town more than 20 years ago, but laughed when I asked where her home was, and scoffed at the idea of being buried anywhere but the Eastern Cape.
How can we be buried in town? Be buried here and swim in the water? Water comes up to here, she said, pointing to her neck. When we die ,we need to sleep peacefully and rest, not drown. How can we die so many times?
When we die, we need to sleep peacefully and rest, not drown. How can we die so many times?

In just four hours one recent Friday evening, 196 coffins left Cape Town for the Other Side. Photograph: Diana Saverin
At 11pm on a recent Friday night, having counted 196 coffin-toting kombis, I stopped keeping tally and returned to Cape Town. On the ride back, I kept seeing the kombi vans zooming past on the other side of the highway: an ongoing procession of the homeward bound. People say the same thing happens during the holidays, only with more intensity: kombis full of Xhosa people bottleneck at the tunnel of the N1 highway, lining up to pay the tolls, lining up to go home.
In Marilynne Robinsons novel Gilead , a dying father writes a letter to his son. They live in a small town in Iowa that everyone, it seems, wants to leave in favour of the big city. The father writes, This whole town does look like whatever hope becomes after it begins to weary a little, then weary a little more. But hope deferred is still hope. I love this town. I think sometimes of going into the ground here as a last wild gesture of love  I, too, will smoulder away the time until the great and general incandescence.
For now, the midnight march of vans on Friday nights, from the big city back to the Eastern Cape, is a last wild gesture of love; an enduring gift for an unforgotten home.

Sound of the city
Trams have been crisscrossing Sofia since 1901. By the look of them, you might think theyre the same ones (they are mostly old, yellow and clanking). Recently some tram lines have completely closed because of our two expanding metro lines, but downtown and in neighbourhoods such as Krasno Selo, the rumble of the old trams remains a steady part of the citys soundtrack. Its not exactly romantic, but there is a certain old-world charm to it.
Best current venue

Anything outdoors; Swimming Pool was an instant hit. Sofias latest space for contemporary art is located in a charming pre-war rooftop apartment with a mind-blowing 360-degree view of the city, and a real  albeit non-functioning  swimming pool.
The latter serves as a blue cube to host artistic projects and performances twice a year. The first exhibition, Balconia, was curated by Swimming Pool founder Viktoria Draganova.
Whos top of the playlist?
A true poet and master of social satire, Itzo Hazarta is not a new kid on the block. The founder and frontman of Bulgarias all-time favourite hip-hop group, Upsurt, has been around for more than 15 years now. Singing strictly in Sofia dialect, Upsurt achieved cult status thanks to their razor-sharp, hysterical and completely untranslatable lyrics referencing Bulgarian culture, current affairs and daily life. These days Itzo Hazarta continues in the same vein, but solo.
Best local artist
With a physics degree, a job in IT and school friends who were imprisoned or shot, Svetozar Georgiev  AKA ghostdog  is not your average poet. His poems are a unique blend of rhythm and slang, self-deprecation, humour and sensitivity. His plays, on the other hand, ponder existential matters such as the phases of post-breakup recovery, what office culture might be like in purgatory and the inner life of a Russian cosmonauts wife, with the characters ranging from Homer to Tupac Shakur, Darth Vader to Alan Turing.
The look on the street
Hippy to hipster ... Sofia street style. Photograph: Mihail Ruev for U-lica.com (left and right) and Lora Slavova for Sofia Street Style
Sofia is not fashion-forward and you will rarely see avant garde or eccentric characters, but looks vary greatly, from chalga (a popular music genre based on Balkan rhythms, associated with simple lyrics and provocative clothes) to sporty and from hippy to hipster. Many women will only step out in full make-up and high heels. On the other hand, the cultural and creative communities take it easy in that understated, dressed-down Berlin way (a city some people say Sofia reminds them of). Western brands such as H&amp;M and Zara prevail, mixed and matched with secondhand finds. Lately a number of original Bulgarian designer brands have cropped up  Shevitza for scarves, Serendipity for jewels, Bogdanin Brothers for leather bags, 45 Street for hats, and Garderob , Sassa Bjorg and Knapp for clothes.
Comedy gold
The latest comedy hit is actually a staged multimedia sequel of a cult TV show. Aired between 1992 and 2004, the much-loved political cabaret Ulitsata (The Street) was based on brilliant improvisations and sketches about the life of small people after the fall of communism. A whole generation grew up with it, memorising lines from the show. Twenty years later, director Tedi Moskovs swan song did not disappoint loyal fans.
The best cultural Instagram
Boyscout is an online magazine, created originally as a guide for young men with good manners, but it has found a wider audience hungry for cultural media in a market where the only magazines are the Cosmos and the Playboys. Boyscouts weekly selection of popular culture is solid, stylish and diverse, covering music, fashion, design, events and arts both from the local scene and internationally.
Whats the big talking point?

Monuments are always controversial in Bulgaria (we are still processing parts of our past), but three weeks ago the newly erected Bulgarian Tsar Samuils monument in central Sofia prompted a fierce war of words . Academics and intellectuals criticised the tacky glow-in-the-dark eyes, setting off a number of internet memes on the monuments relation to Darth Vader. The pro camp said the critics were being unpatriotic and pretentious. The state failed to act and now the monument is there  not to honour Tsar Samuil, but as symbol of our societys deficiencies.
Moment in history?
While in 2012 the joke went that Greek protesters carried banners reading, Keep quiet, dont wake up the Bulgarians, in 2013 our civil society finally did wake up, and went out on the street to protest the governments nepotism and corruption. The protests were accompanied by artistic performances and a spirit of hope that something was happening. The legacy is still debated (the government did change, but not as a direct result), but one thing the protests are credited for is shaking civil society out of its coma.
Best street art?

An artistic take on the cyrillic alphabet, 30bukvi (30 Letters) is a project by Bulgarian graphic designer Georgi Georgiev. He printed his visual interpretation of the cyrillic on ceramic tiles and then secretly plastered them on to the streets of Sofia the night before 24 May last year (Bulgarian Education and Culture, and Slavonic Literature Day). The project was a bid to celebrate the alphabet as a part of the nations identity.

Will Google's $5m plan make cycling in the rest of Silicon Valley easier?
Cycling is safe and easy inside the search giants Mountain View HQ, but getting to the site from elsewhere in Silicon Valley means crossing fast-moving expressways and busy train tracks. Is Googles new bike plan the answer?

Inside the Googleplex  the tech giants headquarters in Mountain View, California  hundreds of multi-coloured bikes are scattered around. With bright yellow frames and big blue and green rubber tires, theyre seemingly everywhere  clustered at the edges of parking lots, lined near building entrances, or clumsily toppled over into the office park landscaping. The bikes make it easy for Googles employees to move between its many office buildings, spread over roughly two miles of land at the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay in a neighbourhood known as North Bayshore. Inside the Googleplex, biking is safe and easy.
Outside the Googleplex, not so much.
Getting to and from North Bayshore is not exactly pleasant, says Shiloh Ballard, executive director of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition. The neighbourhood is on the other side of a highway from most of the rest of Silicon Valley, and a bike ride to the Googleplex would typically involve crossing busy train tracks, navigating arterial roads with high speed limits and braving the valleys expressway system that has essentially turned many surface streets into mini freeways.
Ballards group is one of many that have become concerned about how people can bike from the residential areas of Silicon Valley to North Bayshore, where Google , Microsoft, LinkedIn and dozens of other companies are located. And, since the city of Mountain View recently made available more than 2.2 million square feet of commercial construction rights in North Bayshore, even more people will be heading to the area in the near future.

In an effort to improve the bicycle commute to North Bayshore, Google set out to rethink the areas bicycle infrastructure network. Working with the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition, the company commissioned an urban planning consultancy, Alta Planning + Design, to look not only at the area immediately surrounding the Googleplex, but at each of the cities in the general vicinity. The goal was to envision a bike network that would help people get from their homes to the tech offices in North Bayshore, but also for the entire community to have better bike access. The result is the recently released Bike Vision Plan for North Santa Clara County . The plan outlines a potential future for the area that moves away from its suburban office park present towards a Copenhagen-like future of bikeable streets and interconnected neighbourhoods.

Such a transition may be more vision than plan, but Google has already engendered a vibrant bicycling ethos in the valley, at least among its own employees. Roughly 9% of Google employees living in the cities immediately surrounding its headquarters commute by bike. Within a 9-mile radius of the office, 21% are bike commuters.
To bump that number even higher, and to grow overall bicycle commuting in the valley, Googles vision focuses on expanding the existing bicycle infrastructure in the area and targeting what it calls high-stress streets  streets where speed limits are 35 miles per hour or more. By adding strategic infrastructure like protected cycle tracks, multi-use paths and buffered bike lanes, the plan envisions a low-stress bike system that covers 277 miles of roadway in the area, up from 87 miles today. The plan proposes $5m in matching grants that Google will award to cities or other groups in the region who come up with the best ways to start building this system.

But some worry that Googles bicycle vision and a broad swath of other proposed community benefits linked to the companys development plans may be in limbo. In May, the Mountain View city council dashed Googles proposed plans for a 2.5 million square foot project in North Bayshore, approving just 515,000 square feet of the project. The city instead awarded 1.45 million square feet of developable land to LinkedIn. The public benefits package tied to Googles development plan  including affordable housing, infrastructure repairs, new bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and upgrades to two existing multi-use trails  would have been worth upwards of $200m.
The likelihood of the entire plan going forward, thats contingent upon a 2.5 million square foot expansion, says Ballard. We already know they didnt get that, so now its a matter of looking at these different pieces of it and asking whats going to move forward.
Mountain View City Council member Lenny Siegel says the bike vision plan will likely stay on the table. Google seems willing to invest in those benefits even if its not linked to a particular approval, Siegel says.
Google officials were not available to comment.

Siegel says Google can be an important partner for municipalities like Mountain View to kickstart projects like the bike vision plan. But he also notes that the company should take responsibility for some of its impacts on the community.
The rapid growth of Google and LinkedIn and the other companies has created transportation needs, and we have to figure out a way to use the wealth thats been accumulated by those companies to pay to address those needs, Siegel says. And right now, Google is the company thats most willing to do that.
Ballard is hopeful that the bike plan will help Silicon Valley to begin building out a more complete bike infrastructure network, whether to Copenhagen levels or not. And with Googles $5m pledge, she says the plan has a good chance of getting the cities in the area to take action  and to compete with each other to get the matching funds.
The idea here is, look, weve got a pot of money, whos going to do the best job drawing down this money and doing some great bike projects? she says. We can absolutely use peer pressure to get the cities to be doing innovative things.
Though Ballard concedes that $5m is only a small investment in a huge problem, its at least a starting place for cities in Silicon Valley to help spread bikeability beyond the Googleplex.

He was a prophet without imprimatur in his own city. Charles Correa , who passed away late on the night of 16 June, was among the great architects of our times. His institutional buildings across the world are all iconic. Yet, Mumbai, his lifelong home, boasts just one residential tower designed by him  an irony as much as a travesty. Though the cubist Kanchanjunga is eye-catching, its still high-rise: a genre caustically savaged by this patron saint of low-slung architecture.
It gets worse. Correas real passion was the designing of cities that are easy to live, work, play  and commute  in. But his karma was Mumbai, which can check none of these boxes with a straight face. The man who described cities as places of hope was fated to live in a city of disappointments . Its not just because its skyline resembles an alarming ECG. More specifically, Mumbai mindlessly sabotaged two of his masterful plans, each of which would have helped it regain its post-independence swagger as Indias showpiece.
One was his design for New Bombay across the harbour in 1964; the other his masterplan in 1996 for the textile mill-lands in the heart of what had by then been rechristened Mumbai. Ironically, he had been appointed for these visionary tasks by the very politicians who would later subvert them; one with myopic indifference, the other with unmitigated greed.

In a leap of imagination from prevailing wisdom, Correa envisaged a large, independent New Bombay, not a satellite town. He knew that nothing less would do to save a metropolis that was growing at a lethal pace. From 1951 to 61, the citys population had doubled; it would increase by 80.8% in the next decade. The City &amp; Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) was set up to give form to this wowing blueprint drawn up by him, Shirish Patel and Pravin Mehta. New Bombay could accommodate 2.1 million people, happily.
Instead, largely because the state government did not move its offices there as planned, it remained a dormitory town, and not a conducive one because the suburban railway lines were not extended. Correa was wryly vindicated some 40 years later when Mumbai finally burst at the seams, spilling over into Navi Mumbai  where real-estate prices on swanky Palm Beach Avenue now almost rival those on Mumbais art-deco Marine Drive.
The mill-lands, meanwhile, have turned into a nightmarish Gotham in a much, much shorter time. Before our eyes, chimneys give way to giant cranes: midwives delivering massive housing and residential complexes, whose hyperventilating billboards blithely ignore the antiquated civic utilities underneath.
By the time he died at 84, Correa had long been a disillusioned man
Correa may or may not have got smug satisfaction from this urban morass. His commissioned plan was a living, breathing document, developed along transit lines and integrating commerce, culture and ease of living. His canvas had been the open land which had fallen into decay after the fatal textile strike of 1982 , and which, after protracted legal wrangling over workers dues, was then opened up for development.
But with a rapacious sleight-of-hand, the relevant rule was reworded overnight: open land was redefined, and the promised 166 acres for public use shrivelled to a scandalous 32. Mill-owners and builders made a killing on the rest; the same can be said for much of Mumbai.

Correas sheer genius excused his arrogance. He worked with a manic stillness, and was caustically impatient with journalists unable to convey his nuanced urban vision  this writer included. I also still blush over a 2013 incident, when I invited him to launch my book on Mumbai at the Times Litfest . He adamantly refused at first, dredging up some long-ago lapse, then relented  only to lambast me from the stage for a bigger crime. I was the festival director, and our 11th-hour sponsor was exactly the kind of developer he routinely slammed for the citys destruction.
By the time he died at 84, Correa had long been a disillusioned man , compensating for the rampaging skyline at home with the accolades and commissions abroad he continued to execute. Ahmedabad-based Balkrishna Doshi, a believer in the same principles of architecture and planning for 60 years  and best man at Correas wedding  said he was overwhelmed by the new project plans his friend showed him on a recent visit. These included an extension for his awesome Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown : a research and treatment facility for neurosciences and cancer built on almost the same spot on Lisbons river Tigus from which Vasco da Gama sailed out on another voyage of discovery, five centuries ago. (Doshi also recalled how Correa would play Those were the days, my friend every time he visited him.)

Correas wife Monika is an accomplished art-weaver; his son-in-law, Rahul Mehrotra , also a globally acclaimed architect and planner. Monika and Charles were a striking couple for almost half a century on the citys cultural landscape  and the familiar faces of the cognoscenti that still holds on to the idea of Bombay were all there at the funeral mass this morning.
But there was much of Mumbai too  both students and unknown admirers. They gathered, undeterred by the unrelenting monsoon squall, in Salvacao Church : Correas expansive creation in congested Dadar, with its distinctive roof and circular, stained-glass window. From his signature mastery of light and space, Charles Correa departed from the city he tried to save  and which is paying the price of its greedy disobedience.

        <title>Epicentre of the Great Recession: what happened to Cleveland's Slavic Village?</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/18/epicentre-great-recession-cleveland-slavic-village-foreclosure</Link>

When Anthony Trzaska hears the words Slavic Village in news reports, he knows what is coming next. Its almost like when the media reports anything on Slavic Village, its followed with: Comma, where the foreclosure crisis in America started, says the 31-year-old resident. Its not like the foreclosure mess didnt happen. But it didnt just happen here.
Clevelands Slavic Village is widely perceived as the epicentre of the Great Recession . In 2007, when the media finally realised that the housing bubble was bursting wide open (about two years after 48 states had sued subprime lender Ameriquest for fraudulent loan practices), a few journalists decided to run some zip codes to see where the most foreclosures were happening.
The zip code 44105 popped up at the top of the list . And with that, the great international financial crisis of the 21st century was centred in an old neighbourhood in Cleveland, Ohio  one that had been declining since the 1970s. At the time, few reported that foreclosures were also hitting cities like Miami, Las Vegas, Detroit and Phoenix far worse than Cleveland. Instead, some claimed that what was happening on Fleet Avenue, home to Polish sausage makers, was influencing the International Monetary Fund s economic policy.

But what happened in Slavic Village  about five miles south of downtown Cleveland, on the eastern edge of the industrial valley  was symptomatic of greater issues across the cities of the American rust belt. For decades, old neighbourhoods had lost their economic reason for being; their factories were closing, their populations rapidly declining. They had too much housing in very poor condition, high poverty, high crime and little outside investment. When the housing crisis hit, many of the houses were abandoned, boarded up and left to rot.
After 50 years of decline, however, Slavic Village  named after the Polish and Czech immigrants who once settled there, with a current population of 22,000 that is now about half black and half white  is trying to crawl out of the wreckage. Never hip or trendy, it was, nevertheless, once the biggest retail district in Cleveland outside of downtown.

Trzaska is working to bring that back. The property developer is a native: his family still operates a funeral home in Slavic Village. Now he is buying up property to market to small businesses. The focus is on Fleet Avenue, which is currently being torn up as part of a $9m renovation project to be completed this year. His firm, Sonny Day Development , is hoping to encourage small businesses to take root in the old neighbourhood, with retail on street level and housing above  an old model that has fallen out of favour.
Slavic Village is playing the cards it has been dealt, Trzaska says. But I can see millennials approaching [local life] more in the way our grandparents did. Its not just that they want things close together  their work and social life, and stores they support  but they want to be a part of a neighbourhood. They didnt have that growing up in the suburbs.
The neighbourhood has a lot of natural advantages: it is 10 minutes from downtown, with solid housing stock. And part of the reason for Slavic Villages success in the fight against blight is the Slavic Village Recovery project . The private, for-profit entity has succeeded in fixing up decent, affordable housing for sale on the market  and has found that bypassing government subsidies to do so can actually make the houses cheaper.
The company is run by Robert Klein, CEO of Safeguard Properties, which manages foreclosed properties for banks. Klein, 62, knew from experience that banks just want to get rid of abandoned properties. But government regulations for non-profits trying to fix up foreclosed homes made the process too expensive  in short, taking public money meant you had to fix up homes too nicely.
We find we can do the basic refurbishments for about $40,000 to $50,000 and then sell a three-bedroom, 1,200 sq ft home for about $65,000, he says. We can make a small profit of about $7,000 on the house, and then put that money into doing more houses. We dont take a cent in public money.

Taking public money can make properties difficult to finance through bank lending. For example, to be eligible for tax breaks and other funding grants in Cleveland, a property must meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards: green regulations that exceed what is required by the Cleveland city building code. Meeting LEED can often require tearing all walls down to the studs  an expensive prospect. Third-party contractors must also supervise and certify parts of the refurbishment, which can further drive up costs. The difference can be big: about $100,000 total cost for a home certified under LEED guidelines versus about $60,000 for one that meets city building codes. Banks are less willing to lend $100,000 for a house with LEED certification in a neighbourhood where comparable homes are selling for $40,000, but will be more willing to loan up to $65,000 for a renovated home in that same neighbourhood that meets city building codes.
Because Slavic Village Recovery does not meet the full government green standards, its houses are not eligible for the citys 10-year tax abatement for refurbished houses. But, even without the tax break, the average monthly mortgage payment for a $65,000 refurb in Slavic Village comes in at about $450  whereas for a $100,000 home it would be $625, even after the $100 tax break.
It is pretty simple, Klein says. We can get people into a three-bedroom house in a neighbourhood that is coming back for less than most rentals in the area. And the buyers are not getting tax breaks, so the city isnt getting shorted, either. We found the government programmes were very slow, and didnt really help the neighbourhood much because it was one property here and another there. We work with the community development corporation to pick out houses we want to do, and try to concentrate on one neighbourhood first before we move on to other streets.
The community development corporation performs a sort of triage on the neighbourhood: those houses that dont make the grade are slated for demolition. About 150 homes  two-thirds of the ones theyve assessed so far  have been demolished in the past two years. These are usually houses with structural issues, especially ones that have been gutted by thieves stealing plumbing pipes and kitchen and bathroom fixtures.

This month, after two years of operation, the Slavic Village Recovery project will celebrate its 25th homebuyer. Another eight are under contract, with 30 houses total in the inventory and about 10 in the process of refurbishment. Klein says he has heard from other communities  in Columbus, Chicago and Atlanta  who want to do what Slavic Village is doing. Getting rid of blight isnt as complicated as it is made out to be, Klein says.
Eight years since it was written off, the housing market in Slavic Village seems to be on the up. Owning a three-bedroom home, 10 minutes from downtown, has practical market value. And retail follows rooftops that have people underneath them  shops and housing are each one half of an equation, both dependent on the other. Im pretty optimistic the worst is over for Slavic Village,says Trzaska. This neighbourhood has value, and thats what it was based on historically. Im seeing people realise that part of it once again.

Gender equality is a founding value of the EU, so why the lack of progress?
A report on Europes gender equality reveals negligible progress since 2005, with men still grossly over-represented in political and economic decision-making

We all know we are a long way from living in a gender equal world. Globally speaking, Europe is seen as a leader in moving womens rights forward, but just how far are European countries from putting men and women on an equal footing?
On Friday, the European Institute for Gender Equality published its second gender equality index . This kind of research is essential, because it provides credible and comparable data across EU member states.
The index focuses on eight domains relevant to EU policy: money, knowledge, time, power, health, violence, work and intersecting inequalities.
The results allow us to see if gender equality policies lead to progress and what additional measures need to be taken.
This years report, which analyses data from 2005 to 2012, shows that women are only halfway to equality with men, and that progress has stagnated since 2005.
In 2010, women were 52.4% equal compared with 52.9% in 2012. The picture is very diverse across the EU, with Sweden achieving an overall score of 74.2% while Romania is at 33.7%. The index also shows womens rights regressing in eight countries, including the UK and Austria.
Progress is particularly sluggish with regard to power and time. Men are still hugely over-represented in political and economic decision-making: more than 75% of parliamentarians and 84% of corporate board members in Europe are men.

At the same time, womens free time is limited, with an extremely wide gender gap in time spent on care work and educating children and grandchildren, as well as on cooking and housework.
There have been some minor improvements on pay and work, significant because these areas have been the focus of the most strategic action at the EU level. The gender gap in monthly earnings has decreased from 22% to 20%, and womens full-time employment rate has increased slightly.
How can we explain this lack of progress? After all, equality between women and men is one of the EUs founding values.
As far back as 1957, article 119 of the Treaty of Rome stated: each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied.
But recession and austerity in Europe have led to rapid change. Ideologically driven austerity has contributed to disillusionment with democratic institutions, driving disproportionate numbers of women into poverty, unemployment and precarious, low-paid jobs. This is not inevitable, but results from political choices made by male-dominated institutions. These choices have a worse impact on women than on men.
Despite the evidence that progress on gender equality in Europe has stagnated, the economic crisis is used to excuse a lack of political vision and the failure to bring in concrete measuresto support womens rights, representation and resources.
As the international community takes stock of the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action , a new post-2015 framework  the sustainable development goals  will be adopted, linking human rights and environmental sustainability. Womens rights and equality between women and men will be a standalone goal, and overall this new blueprint will provide a renewed opportunity for global, European and national feminist action.
To turn these goals into reality, we need more data of the quality provided by the gender equality index, in Europe and beyond. We need evidence about the shape and scope of inequality, the outcomes of political choices and programmes, and the links between gender equality and wider societal wellbeing.
We need better communication to make this information more accessible to Europes citizens, with more activism to raise awareness. We need the EU to champion legislation, strategies, and programmes in support of womens rights. We need to build feminist leadership, strengthen womens organisations and support women to take on political and economic leadership roles.
Gender equality institutions and womens organisations need resources to work with political leaders to build their awareness of what is at stake and what the solutions might be.
The European commission must stop stalling on the adoption of an ambitious new strategy on equality , which should set out clear, accountable commitments for EU action to ensure that, five years from now, we are not still only halfway to equality.
In Europe we have the experience and we know what works for gender equality. The time to act is now. We must commit, accelerate and invest in womens rights.

        <title>Albania makes headway in the battle against corruption</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/26/albania-battle-against-corruption-organised-crime</Link>
        <Description/>

In Albania , corruption has long been part of everyday life. People talk of taking a loved one to hospital and having to pay the doctor to get the best treatment, or of going to a property registration office and being asked to pay an extra fee to speed things up.
This culture of bribery has not only kept societys most vulnerable from accessing vital services but has also damaged Albanias international image. In a 2011 study , the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said Albanian citizens ranked corruption as the second most important problem after unemployment.
Since emerging from the decades-long dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, who turned Albania into one of the worlds most isolated states, the Balkan country of 2.8 million people has struggled to deal with corruption and organised crime.
When he took office in 2013, Prime Minister Edi Rama, the one-time flamboyant mayor who oversaw the repainting of Tiranas communist-era grey buildings, made it a priority to tackle corruption and improve Albanias international standing.
The centre-left coalition governments reforms have focused on improving administrative systems, enforcing the rule of law, and making it easier for people to report corruption.
Last February, the government launched an online anti-corruption portal to allow citizens to anonymously record instances of unscrupulous practices. The website covers 12 key areas, including police, health and customs.
Since then, 6,840 reports have been logged . Many of these involve complaints about poor service, but 777 cases directly relate to accusations of corruption, with 35 reports referred to prosecutors.
Rama insists Albanias poor international reputation is based on exaggerated stereotypes rather than reality, but admits that combating corruption is key to changing perceptions. To improve the image of a country, first you have to change the country itself, he said. I believe corruption becomes the alternative when a government is not able to serve its citizens in a transparent and efficient way. So we have to modernise, and modernisation is about reforms.
Another anti-corruption programme involves text messages being sent to citizens to ask whether they had to pay a bribe when receiving treatment at state-run hospitals.
The scheme, run by the ministry of state for local issues and anti-corruption, and supported by the World Bank , was launched in March and has reached more than 33,000 people, about 20% of whom have provided feedback.
The doctors are always late and the corruption continues as always. Without giving away money, no one takes care of you, said one person. Another person, who had gone to a hospital in the city of Durres, was more positive: I have been in hospital before, but this time you could feel the change. No one asked for a bribe.
The World Bank has previously supported a similar programme in Pakistan.
Low trust in government leads not only to informal means of obtaining services and less willingness to pay taxes, it also leads to lower resources for the government to provide public services, thus completing a vicious cycle of mistrust and corruption, Jana Kunicova and Zubair Bhatti, public sector experts at the World Bank, wrote in a blog . By proactively collecting citizen feedback and using it for management actions, this vicious cycle can be broken.
In its 2011 survey , the UNODC said on average 28.3% of Albanians aged between 18 and 64 had been exposed, either directly or indirectly, to a bribery experience with a public official in the previous year. But it noted that about 30% of bribes paid were actually offered by citizens themselves.
Albania, which ranks 110th out of 175 countries in Transparency Internationals 2014 corruption perceptions index, joins a list of other countries using the internet to crack down on corruption , either through naming and shaming or by bringing bribery and other corrupt practices into the open.
The UN Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting Albanias anti-corruption drive. The country, which was given a ninth millennium development goal on good governance, is now piloting the governance indicator of the new sustainable development goals , which will frame development priorities until 2030.

Between June and December 2014, the project focused on identifying indicators relevant to Albania. The second phase, which ends in September, will implement systems to measure the indicators.
The UNDP says Albania recognises that reforms in good governance are essential if the country wants to achieve European Union membership. Many Albanians are optimistic that acceptance last year as an official membership candidate signals a new start for the former communist country.
The governance indicators are very important for Albanias EU integration and for strengthening the rule of law, said the UNs resident coordinator, Zineb Touimi-Benjelloun. Controlling corruption and improving good governance remain a challenge here, but being a pilot country has proved to serve as a catalyst for the government to set up appropriate systems and improve service delivery.
After the first phase of the pilot, about 20 indicators were proposed and grouped into three target areas: improvement in governance to meet EU standards by 2030; better service delivery, with a focus on water, electricity and land; and improved economic performance, using foreign direct investment as a measure.
Rama believes his government is moving in the right direction. Albania suffered for many years from lack of reforms and badly made policies, he said. We have shown we can make positive changes but, of course, we have not solved all the countrys problems yet. Every month, we have something important scheduled to happen and, less than two years in, we are definitely where I hoped we would be.

Sustainable development must live up to its promise to leave no one behind
With the endgame nearing for the sustainable development agenda, leaders must commit to helping those worst affected by poverty and discrimination

When heads of state sign an international agreement on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in September, the document is likely to include a promise to leave no one behind.
The principle will be one of the most important in the entire agreement. Implemented properly, it will take the world beyond business as usual, marking an important difference between the existing millennium development goals and the new SDGs.

But if countries make impressive overall progress towards the goals while people suffering the worst poverty and discrimination see little or no change, then the whole project will arguably have failed.
So as negotiators resume talks on the SDGs in New York this week, they should push for an agreement that enshrines the principle of leaving no one behind in the outcome document. The concept has obvious appeal. Not only is it a prerequisite for ending extreme poverty by 2030, it can also be applied in every country, rich and poor alike.
Nonetheless, some are sceptical about the idea. It does not address the pressing issues of global wealth concentration and international inequality. Moreover, making it a reality will involve hard work. Addressing entrenched poverty and discrimination will require finance, including international funding , and the political will to make difficult decisions.
Governments around the world will have to integrate the idea into their own policy and planning and may have to contemplate economic, structural and fiscal reforms.
All countries will need to buy into the idea, but if it is to succeed there must be a focus on particular countries, such as least-developed countries, that need additional support.
Once agreement is reached, the hard work will begin. Every country should be required to develop national SDG implementation plans, identifying those people and communities at risk of being forgotten.
These groups may match up with some already listed in the existing post-2015 draft: women and girls, migrant workers and people with disabilities. But there may be other social groups that should be highlighted in national plans  minority groups, indigenous people and those affected by caste-based discrimination, for example.
Country plans should also include interim or mid-term targets. A 15-year timeframe is important for achieving long-term change, but stepping stones are also needed to ensure that the hardest tasks are not deferred.
Christian Aids new briefing on leaving no one behind tries to bring the principle to life, illustrating its global importance and suggesting how governments might start to implement the idea.
The briefing includes some shocking examples of the millions of people left far behind, from a wide range of countries across the world. Ghana, for instance, reduced its income-poverty level from 52% in 1992 to 28.5% in 2006. Yet, while the reduction in the south of the country was 58.66%, in the north it was just 8.87%. Maternal mortality rates are similarly uneven.
Every country should be required to identify those people and communities at risk of being forgotten
Brazil, meanwhile, despite laudable progress towards reducing income inequality, still has one of the worlds most unequal patterns of land ownership, with 3% of the population owning two-thirds of all arable land. Quilombola people , who are descended from slaves, are at the other end of the spectrum from the big landowners. Only 8% of their 3,000-plus communities in Brazil own the land on which they live, leaving them vulnerable to harm from private interests, such as mining companies, as well as government authorities.
In south Asia, the briefing notes: Poverty is overwhelmingly concentrated among those groups who face discrimination because of who they are and the work they do. Discrimination based on work and descent, associated with the practice of caste, is a root cause of inequality and persistently high levels of poverty  worldwide, it is estimated that 260 million people are affected.
Dalit women are particularly vulnerable, the briefing notes.
The SDGs have the potential to focus policymakers attention on the people who are left behind in their societies. With so many women, men and children so profoundly affected  and with less than 100 days until heads of state meet to finalise the new goals  the challenge of embedding the idea of leaving no one behind in the new development agenda could not be more important or urgent.

Paraguay deploys anti-narco top guns to combat economic need for weed
Led by a man whose Danger Zone ringtone belies his background as a hardened military campaigner, Paraguay has adopted slash and burn tactics to tackle cannabis growers. But there is a growing realisation that measures are required to help smallholder farmers find better ways to support themselves

Nstor was 14 when a local drug trafficker first hired him to help bring in the harvest. They need 20 to 30 people, because you have to harvest an entire hectare in two or three days while theres a gap in the rains, he says. When the marijuanas ready, you cant leave it for long.
Growing up on the outskirts of Pedro Juan Caballero, a lawless town on Paraguays north-eastern border with Brazil, wasnt easy. His father, a ranch manager, was away from home for three months at a time. His mother washed clothes to put food on the table.
Then they approach you, and say theyre going to pay you 80,000 guaranes [9.56; $15] a day, with an advance. You know how much your family is in need, so youre forced to take it. And then youre committed. Thats why everyone gets corrupted and goes to work there.
Thirty years later, Nstor  not his real name  is still in the business. He has his own plantation up in the mountains, the low fists of red sandstone that punch through the jungle of Amambay department. He employs a clutch of workers to live there, growing, guarding, and harvesting the crop. They are farmers who sold their small plots of land out of economic desperation, according to Nstor. They jump on the offer of any work, even if it means cultivating illegal crops.
Nstors small house in Pedro Juan is dotted with souvenirs from his plantation. A feral baby jaguarundi scurries out from underneath a wardrobe to snatch chunks of meat from his wifes hand. A pair of parrots sit on a tree out back, and watch as he brings out six bricks of pressed hashish  the potent, THC-heavy resin of the cannabis plant  weighing a kilo each.

It is a fraction of what Nstor can produce from Paraguays fertile red soil in two harvests a year. The landlocked nation of 7 million inhabitants is Latin Americas biggest producer of the narcotic after Mexico, and 80% of the countrys marijuana ends up in the megacities of Brazil, transported by criminal enterprises like Rios Red Command . Paraguay also increasingly serves as a corridor for Colombian, Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine bound for Brazil, Africa and Europe.
The marijuana and cocaine trades are fuelled by the underdevelopment that has dogged Paraguay since independence. Over the past 10 years, successive modernising administrations have produced a GDP boom by supplying Brazil with beef, wheat and soybean. But mechanised agribusiness has left many of Paraguays rural communities behind.
Paraguay is a rich country, but full of poor people, says Eladio Flecha, general secretary of the Partido Paraguay Pyahura (PPP; Party for a New Paraguay), a new political movement made up of several leftwing groups. The distribution of wealth is very unequal: 80% of land is held by 2.5% of the population, and 161 people control 90% of the wealth of our country. Sure, the economy is growing fast, but it doesnt reach the most vulnerable groups.
His partys name is a mix of Spanish and Guaran, the indigenous language spoken by more than 90% of the population, and as a first language by many. Lack of Spanish, the formal language of politics and business, joins other obstacles  such as low levels of education, poor communications and dirt roads that quickly turn to mud in the rain  to isolate rural communities.
Flecha says small-scale farmers scarcely earn 8,000 guaranes for a 70kg sack of the Paraguayan staple manioc. Over the past decade, more than 1 million small farmers and their families have migrated to informal jobs on the edges of towns, easy prey to the temptation offered by traffickers.
Stemming the flow of marijuana
Eradication operations are the only real way of diminishing the supply of drugs and financially hitting the plantation owners. Here, in a single day, I can take up to 150,000kg of marijuana out of circulation, says Captain Oscar Chamorro, from Paraguays overstretched National Anti-Drugs Secretariat ( Senad ), as 60 special forces troops line up in a hangar on the edge of Pedro Juan at dawn.
They check their weapons, pile into cars, trucks and helicopters, and make their way out to a rendezvous in the mountains. On the way, Chamorro  who has 21 years of military experience, with 10 in Senad  dismisses the notion that Paraguayans are turning to pot to escape poverty.
They dont do it to survive, they do it to earn money. Marijuana producers will tell you, No, I dont have anything else I can do. But in reality, if the campesino cultivated his 10 hectares of land well, or put 10 cows on it, hes going to earn enough to live on, Chamorro says.
Theyre just looking to boost their income. Theres not a single small farmer who doesnt have his cell phone, his motorbike. They can earn more with narcotrafficking, but I dont believe this is a valid excuse.
It is day three of a nine-day operation. Reconnaissance flights have already identified the marijuana plantations, dotted among private forest reserves. The helicopters drop off teams of six among the green stalks, where they work until the midday heat becomes too oppressive. Major Aldo Pintos jumps out and heads for a camp in the trees. A couple of tarpaulins cover a sleeping area, filled with colorful duvets and sacks of marijuana. A few toothbrushes are in a jar tied to a tree, and a pot sits over some glowing embers.

They hide when they hear the rotors. Theyre probably still nearby, says Pintos, cradling his assault rifle in one hand. With the other, he pours cooking oil over the tents and touches a match to the plastic. In the next valley, the soldiers burn presses used to make the bricks of marijuana. Then, they form a loose line and take out their machetes, walking forward and hacking the plants to the ground.
Chamorros men are highly motivated and disciplined: one of his officers was trained at Sandhurst, others by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which paid for the base in Pedro Juan. As they zoom around the hills, a casual observer might dismiss them as cowboys  Chamorros ringtone is Danger Zone from the movie Top Gun  but Senad put in the most hours of all of Paraguays public employees. It is, says Chamorro, a vocation.
You feel very proud knowing that youre preventing these drugs going out on the streets. We all have a friend, a relative whos living with the problem of drugs, and we know how much damage it does to society, says Chamorro. But we have a more modern drugs policy than many developed countries: we dont lock up the user, but treat it as a health problem.
Eradication eats into the traffickers profits, he explains, and prevents them from moving into the cocaine trade: a trend borne out by Nstor, who has spent time behind bars in Uruguay and Brazil for transporting the powder. Senad agents periodically swoop on hidden airstrips, light aircraft and makeshift laboratories used to bulk up Andean cocaine paste and export it across the invisible border.
The rivalry this lucrative business creates plays out to gory effect in Pedro Juan, says Cndido Figueredo, who has two decades experience reporting for the national daily ABC Color from his home town. Here, a life is worth absolutely nothing, he says. The police sometimes find a body near the border in the morning, and they dump it on the other side. Its less paperwork.
According to police figures, an annual average of 105 homicides occured in Pedro Juan between 2009 and 2014.
Drug trafficking was a familiar feature under the military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. Drug money has further infected national politics since the return to democracy, contributing to endemic corruption and a culture of silence.
Loads of politicians, especially ones from the border, are 100% contaminated by the mafia and receive mafia support for their campaigns. In this country, if you have money, you can buy anyone: from a journalist to a minister, Figueredo laments.
The few independent journalists who speak out do so at their peril: disgruntled narcos have twice riddled Figueredos bungalow in Pedro Juan with machine-gun fire, forcing him to accept round-the-clock police protection. He also carries a 9mm pistol whenever he leaves the house with his guards.
The mafia has killed four journalists since May 2014, including two within metres of the border between Pedro Juan and Brazils Ponta Por. In October, when gunmen shot Pablo Medina , Figueredos colleague, national soul-searching gave rise to a new term: narcopolitica. It emerged that a marijuana-trafficking local mayor, allegedly protected by a congresswoman, had given the order.
Before Pablo Medina died, we believed we were on the right track. We ignored the fact that the marijuana business had grown, and occupied political space, says Senad minister Luis Rojas in his office in Asuncin, Paraguays capital.

We realised that we couldnt just continue with the strategy of cutting and burning marijuana. We had to investigate the structures behind it, just like with cocaine  And we had to realise that we dont know how much marijuana there is in Paraguay . We dont know about its economic and social impact. We dont know anything.
Senad has since paid more attention to capturing and getting information from the kingpins. Rojas is creating a centre for research into marijuana trafficking, and is boosting rehabilitation and education efforts. The next challenge is to pass laws on campaign finance and property forfeiture, preventing drug bosses from controlling politicians and operating from jail. Its painful to admit the reality, but its the only way to build intelligent public policies. The rest is bullshit, says Rojas.
For the PPPs Flecha, the changes  if delivered  will not come a moment too soon. But he disagrees with the claim that poor farmers turning to drug cultivation for survival is a thing of the past, and with the militarisation of the countryside.
The Paraguayan campesinos form of subsistence is under attack from the big latifundistas [landowners] and agricultural exporters, says Flecha. Theres no escape, and so he falls under the control of the mafia. To genuinely combat the narcotraffickers, the government should have a policy for small producers, and strengthen traditional production.
Supporting smallholder farmers
The southern department of Alto Paran represents the problem in microcosm. While international agricultural firms show off gleaming rows of tractors and pesticide sprayers at a local trade fair , Francisco Pereira drives around the backroads, engaged in a tireless struggle to encourage local communities to hold on to their lands and forests and resist what he calls the soybean-isation of the countryside.
Pereira, policy director of the World Wildlife Funds Paraguayan chapter , points out the fields of the stunted crop, creeping up on both sides of the road and planted within two metres of a local schools windows, liberally sprayed with pesticides thanks to minimal restrictions by the state. From the production perspective, soy brings greater earnings for Paraguay, he agrees. But from the point of view of the schools, of the families who are left with the soil, its a problem. Theres a real risk of the misuse of agrotoxins having a severe effect on campesino and indigenous communities.
The health concerns and economic pressures prove too much for many farmers, who sell up and move to the towns.

But Pereira and a handful of local NGOs are helping communities diversify into small-scale production for local sale and export. Farmers can secure significant returns from medicinal plants, and crops like watermelon and yerba mate  the bitter leaf drunk nationwide. And such products provide employment for the whole community, planting the seedlings in the village nursery, transferring them to the fields, and eventually harvesting them.
Four years of encouragement from the WWF has turned things around in the village of Tavapy, says resident Simeon Luis. All these trees that are here now are proof, and the houses too. Before there wasnt anything. Were thinking about moving into floriculture, and weve planted over 200,000 yerba plants. Within three or four years, theyll begin making money. And then well be able to breathe.
Restoring optimism and technical knowhow to Paraguays small farming communities so they can support themselves is the missing component in tackling marijuana cultivation, Chamorro admits. The government is already investing more in schools, but improvements will take time. And for some, changing the habits of a lifetime will be hard.
Nstor is just getting started again after leaving jail. I know a guy who owns a favela in Rio. There, a kilogram of marijuana gets 1,000 reais ($300; 191), so a thousand kilograms will earn me a million reais. Then Ill be back in business, he says.

        <title>Foreign Office under fire over aid spent on game show and Facebook workshop</title>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has launched a review of its use of aid money following reports it has spent nearly 300,000 on projects including a TV game show in Ethiopia , a Shakespeare workshop in Ecuador and efforts to find mates for fish off Madagascar .
While the overwhelming majority of the UKs 12bn aid budget is administered and spent by the Department for International Development (DfID) , the Foreign Office was allocated 343m of aid money last year.
On Thursday, the Sun newspaper published a list of projects apparently funded by FCO aid money, ranging from a 7,000 anti-littering campaign in Jordan to a 970 programme designed to promote the safe and responsible use of Facebook in Laos .
According to the Sun, the FCO spent nearly 14,000 on the Ethiopian quiz show as part of its drive to connect with a younger generation of Ethiopians  [and] engage them on UK values of human rights and good governance. A further 5,000 went on Hamlet education workshops in Quito to mark a visit by the Globe theatre in London, claimed the newspaper.

In a box headlined Fish Called Squander, the Sun reported that the department also spent 3,400 trying to help find mates for two endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in London Zoo.
Although the FCO pointed out that the projects in question had cost a total of 278,000  0.08% of its total aid allocation last year  it said the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, had asked for the spending to be investigated.
The foreign secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCOs aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money, said a spokeswoman.
Building closer relationships with growing economies is important. The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show tax-payers cash is being spent wisely.
Some Tory backbenchers attempted to derail the legislative process, with one dismissing it as sop to Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, lentil-eating do-gooders with a misguided guilt complex .
On Sunday, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, suggested that more of Britains aid budget should be spent to discourage mass migration from Africa so that the UK does not have to fish refugees out of the Mediterranean.

International donors led by India and China have pledged approximately $3bn (1.91bn) to rebuild Nepal in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes that hit the country.
Sushil Koirala, the countrys prime minister, vowed zero tolerance of corruption and said all aid money would go to those affected by the disasters.
Nepal says it needs about $6.7bn (4.3bn) to recover from the quakes that occurred in April and May , which killed more than 8,800 people, destroyed nearly half a million houses and left thousands in need of food, clean water and shelter.

At a meeting of foreign donors on Thursday, Indias foreign minister Sushma Swaraj pledged $1bn to finance reconstruction, while China promised 3bn yuan ($483m) in grant assistance.
Nepals two giant neighbours have historically vied for influence in the Himalayan nation, and both were heavily involved in post-quake rescue and relief efforts.
Additional pledges of $600m from the Asian Development Bank , $260m from Japan, $130m from the US, $100m from the EU as well as an earlier announcement of up to $500m from the World Bank means the total assistance pledged now stands at roughly $3bn.
The Nepalese government wants all aid to be channelled through a new state body, raising concerns among some international donors that bureaucracy and poor planning will hamper reconstruction.
Koirala, however, urged delegates to work with us, the government of Nepal and vowed zero tolerance toward corruption.
I assure you that we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the support reaches the intended beneficiaries, he said as he opened the one-day meeting in Kathmandu.
Nepal  one of the worlds poorest countries even before the disaster  desperately needs assistance to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals destroyed or damaged by the earthquakes. .
One in 10 people are homeless and the Himalayan nations already weak economy has been hit hard, with annual growth forecast to fall to just 3%, the lowest in eight years.
But critics say Kathmandu is struggling to lay out a roadmap to recovery.
What is lacking right now is a clear strategy  the government needs to come up with a credible plan to implement reconstruction projects within a stipulated time, Chandan Sapkota, an economist at the Asian Development Banks Nepal office, said ahead of the meeting.
As pledges rolled in, participants said it was crucial to ensure the money was spent well.
Money will be important for building back a more resilient Nepal  but its not just about money, the World Bank president Jim Yong Kim told delegates in a video message. Just as important is how these funds are spent.
The international community pledged several billion dollars in aid to Haiti after a catastrophic earthquake struck the Caribbean nation in January 2010 .
But the pledges yielded little tangible progress as donors delayed implementing projects due to concerns over corruption and political instability, leaving thousands living in temporary shelters five years on.
Follow-up is extremely important  when pledges are made, the government formulates its plans accordingly and if the money doesnt come, it throws everything out of gear, said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the World Health Organisation s regional director for south-east Asia.
We have seen that happen in previous cases with devastating results, so I think we will lose our credibility as members of the donor community if we dont act on our promises, Singh said on the sidelines of the conference.
Dev Ratna Dhakhwa, secretary general of the Nepal Red Cross Society , said earlier he feared Kathmandus one-window policy for reconstruction would obstruct relief efforts, with political parties already trying to manipulate the system to siphon off funds.
People are using political influence to pressure officials and access funds meant for quake victims, by getting their names added to government-managed records, Dhakhwa said.

Ten reasons why European governments should back a global tax body

In a basement under the UN headquarters in New York, the worlds governments are negotiating an agreement that could strengthen the future course of global tax systems. A deal on this could also dramatically contribute to financing poverty eradication and environmental protection, securing development priorities for the next 15 years .
The talks  meant to lead to agreement on how to fund the sustainable development goals  will culminate in a global summit on financing for development in Ethiopia next month.
A core issue in this heated discussion is whether developing countries have a right to sit at the table when global tax standards are decided.
Aware that they lose more money to international tax dodging than they receive in aid , developing countries have demanded fundamental changes to the way global standards for cross-border taxation and financial transparency are decided.
They want a global body on tax cooperation under the auspices of the UN. Today, global tax standards are decided behind closed doors at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD )  also known as the rich countries club.
The result is a set of standards that disadvantage developing countries financially, and a broken global tax system, riddled with loopholes for tax dodgers.
This system also creates a race to the bottom whereby governments clash in tax wars  fighting to get multinational corporations to pay taxes in their own country, while at the same time providing loopholes for multinationals to dodge taxes in other countries.
The victims include national companies unable to compete with multinational corporations, and citizens, who face higher prices and poorer public services.
Developing countries want a new tax body to foster global cooperation based on the simple principle that countries should not destroy the tax systems of other countries. This would strengthen the ability of countries to set their own tax rates and decide their own national systems.
European states have different positions, but  in particular because of the UK and France  the EU is rejecting the proposal for a global tax body.
Related: EU must pull its weight to help create a better global financial system
Here are 10 reasons why the EU should change its stance:
A key step towards a coherent global system. The international tax system consists of a complicated web of legally binding bilateral tax treaties, and parallel international systems to regulate cross-border taxation. A global system offers the only way to remove this complexity.
Stronger cooperation between tax administrations. A coherent global system will improve working conditions for tax administrations, enabling more efficient cooperation to ensure multinational corporations pay their taxes.
Less unilateral action. Individual governments have resorted to blacklisting and aggressive national laws to protect their tax base. Under the status quo, we are likely to see more self-protective measures, which complicate the lives of ordinary people and those companies not evading taxes.
An end to the race to the bottom. The fear of losing investments is driving governments to introduce tax incentives, loopholes and harmful tax practices.
A better business environment. Diverse, inconsistent national tax systems create heavy administrative burdens, legal uncertainty and high risks for international business.
A level playing field. Governments fear that being a first mover on tax transparency will push businesses to register in other jurisdictions. Through truly global negotiations, governments can agree coordinated action and ensure a level playing field.

Stronger implementation. No government feels obliged to implement tax standards that were adopted, without consent, behind closed doors. The UN is the only global institution where all governments participate as equals.
Less double taxation and double-non-taxation. Mismatches between national tax systems explain why some get taxed twice on the same income while others dont get taxed at all. Only truly global cooperation can end these problems.
More financing for development in the poorest countries. The exclusion of the worlds poorest countries from decisions on global tax standards means that international systems often dont consider their interests. This means lower tax income and scarcer financing for development.
Fair and consistent global action against tax havens. Many governments try to protect their tax base through national blacklists based on criteria that are often unclear and inconsistently applied. The EUs controversial new  tax haven blacklist  omits countries like Switzerland and Luxembourg but includes, for example, Liberia  one of the worlds poorest countries and not a major player in the offshore world. Action against tax havens must be fair, consistent and globally coordinated to be effective.
There is also one last bonus reason. Right now, disagreements about the tax body are preventing governments from reaching an agreement on a wider financing for development accord.
This deal, meant to be finalised in Addis Ababa, would be the first step towards the adoption of the sustainable development goals in September and the drafting of a climate treaty in December . Unblocking the stalemate over a global tax body could pave the way for more multilateral breakthroughs.
Its time for EU countries to call their negotiators in New York and tell them to shift position.

        <Description/>
        <MainBody>While a significant number of governments have championed an ambitious standalone goal on gender equality and womens empowerment in the negotiations on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), discussions on financing have struggled to reach agreement on issues that are fundamental to women.
Last week, governments met in New York to draft the outcome document for the third international conference on financing for development (FFD) , which will take place in Addis Ababa in mid-July. Negotiations are continuing as governments struggle to agree on key issues such as tax, a critical source of financing for development commitments, human rights and gender equality.
The Addis Ababa conference is of crucial importance to women. Decisions made in the Ethiopian capital will determine how the SDGs will be financed.
Although no specific costing for achieving gender equality and womens rights within the context of the SDGs has yet been calculated, in the case of the millennium development goals (MDGs), which expire this year, the gender equality financing gap in low income countries was projected at $83bn (53bn) in 2015 .
Because the new development agenda is universal  and far more ambitious than the MDGs  the costs are likely to be even greater.
Yet it is not only the quantity of funds that matters but how funds are raised and who receives them. As women and men occupy different roles in society, different sources of money affect them differently.
According to research, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off
Across the world, women carry out at least twice as much unpaid care work as men , and this contribution is often invisible and unrecognised. At work, women are worse off too. According to recent research by ActionAid, if women were paid as much as men and had the same access to jobs, they could be $17tn better off . Governments need to value women and their unpaid work when thinking about economic policy.
The FFD process can and should address major structural issues such as tax dodging, which deprives developing countries of far more than they receive in aid . Lack of revenue forces governments to spend less on essential public services. This can have a disproportionate effect on women in poverty if, for example, you consider childcare or support for survivors of gender-based violence  both services that are used mainly by women. Governments should take the opportunity offered by the Addis meeting to accelerate progress on global tax reform that works for developing countries.
Aid will continue to be a critical source of finance for the SDGs, especially for the least developed countries, but the share of aid supporting womens needs is still too low. According to OECD GenderNet , in 2012-13 only 5% of aid had gender equality as a principal objective .
Governments must recommit to meet the long-standing target of devoting 0.7% of GDP to aid, and increase the share of aid dedicated to gender equality, while investing more in supporting the crucial work done by womens rights organisations on the ground .
To date, huge emphasis has been placed on the role of the private sector in financing development, especially multinational companies. While the private sector has a role to play in creating decent jobs and ensuring equal pay for women, the footprint of many companies has been harmful to womens rights at work .
Related: Less pay, more work, no pension: the 21st-century woman's lot laid bare
We need to move away from voluntary corporate social responsibility commitments towards a legally binding regulation to make sure companies are accountable. If businesses did this, and paid their taxes in full, it would send a strong signal that the private sector is serious about supporting sustainable development, gender equality and womens rights.
The current draft of the Addis Ababa Accord starts well by stating a commitment towards gender equality and womens rights, but falls short on staying true to this vision throughout. Lack of recognition of the structural causes of gender inequality, such as the disproportionate responsibility of unpaid care borne by women and girls, means it risks focusing only on what women can do for the economy rather than on how the economy must work in a way that supports rights for all.
As governments continue their discussions, they must reach a consensus on financing methods that can really make a difference for gender equality and womens rights for years to come. The vision for change is clear  now the money must follow.

The article warzone rape seen as costly failure , published on the Global development site earlier this month, raises, perhaps unintentionally, some of the crucial issues that need to be discussed as part of a strategy to combat gender-based and sexual violence in armed conflict.
What needs to be prioritised? How do we determine budget allocation? What are the appropriate responses and how should we measure results? These are big questions. The overriding issue, though, is why does sexual violence happen and what can be done to address it?
The Prevention of Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) set some very clear objectives, with ending the impunity of perpetrators the foremost. This, however, was merely a starting point.
Related: Revealed: how the world turned its back on rape victims of Congo
The reality is that if men think of women as property  if violence at home, or committed by family members, is considered a private matter; if society continues to judge the conduct and dress of women in sexual violence cases; if the state fails to insist upon political, social, economic and cultural equality for women in all fields, and fails to engage with men in resolving the issue  then sexual violence will continue.
The former British foreign secretary William Hague publicly asserts that the leading issue of these times is the empowerment of women. He speaks of the need to address the root causes of sexual violence and see sexual violence in conflict as a matter of international peace and security. And he is right. Rape destroys communities and the consequences are international, as peace remains unobtainable. PSVI is a component of a global agenda on women, peace and security that recognises the critical importance of womens and girls empowerment and gender equality.

It is wrong to look at short-term indicators. Results will take many, many years. Rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will not end before the conflict does, and even then it will continue unless attitudes towards women also change.
Legal frameworks have to be reformed and applied, mindsets transformed, social and economic systems put in place. These things can only be achieved by national governments. Hence the need to bring them on board and keep them committed.
Budget is also important. Funding has been provided, and must be spent wisely. Though 5m was spent on the summit hosted by Hague and Angelina Jolie, the investment  tiny in relative terms  got more than 100 states on board. This should be compared with the more than 250m pumped into the Nato conference in Wales in the autumn of 2014 to discuss military deployments.
Stopping sexual violence is an obligation under international law, but still it happens. Governments have made commitments by ratifying human rights treaties and the statute of the international criminal court but, as we know only too well, they commit only to walk away, with South Africas decision to let the Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir leave the most recent, shameful example . It does not mean that we should stop bringing them together to remind them of what they have to do. It gives civil society more advocacy possibilities and with the protocol, launched at the summit, a practical tool to work with .
There was a lesson from the summit for the present UK government too. There can be no serious engagement on sexual violence without respect for, and delivery of, human rights, including economic and social rights and equality. State legal systems must incorporate these fundamental obligations and they must be complied with.
PSVI has the potential to make a serious difference; it has started to do so and now needs to be strengthened. The UK must be robust in demanding accountability for sexual violence by peacekeepers and insist on the participation of women in all peace processes. Britain must also ratify the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women , to which it committed three years ago.
The principles Hague enunciated are above politics and are not negotiable. There is a manifesto commitment to continue with the work he started. Those of us who work in civil society want this initiative to succeed and will give it the support it merits. We also understand that there is no quick fix and that we all need to be in this for the long haul.

Sierra Leone poised to lift bar on pregnant girls being educated
UN and donors optimistic that talks with Sierra Leonean government over ban introduced in 2010 are about to yield major breakthrough

The decision to continue the school ban on pregnant girls in Sierra Leone could soon be reversed as the government inches towards an agreement with international agencies.
It had been expected that the government would lift the ban, imposed in 2010, when schools reopened following the end of the Ebola crisis but the education minister, Minkailu Bah, reaffirmed it .
Now, after weeks of talks with the government, senior UN officials and UK and Irish aid representatives say they are on the verge of a significant breakthrough.
It is estimated that a third of children in Sierra Leone are born to school-age children and there is anecdotal evidence that the incidence of teenage pregnancy rose sharply during the Ebola outbreak.
In a survey of 1,100 girls and boys between the ages of seven and 18, 10% reported that girls, especially those who had lost relatives to Ebola, were having to engage in transactional sex to cover their basic needs.
There were also reports of children being assaulted in quarantined areas.
This report confirms that Ebola has put an incredible strain on childrens lives and it will take time for them to recover. The impact on them has been huge, said Casely Coleman, country director of Plan International in Sierra Leone.
Aid agencies including the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Irish Aid and the Department for International Development are working with the Sierra Leonean government to find a temporary solution that would involve girls being educated outside the classroom.
They are insisting the girls should continue to receive formal education and not be downgraded to vocational studies.
Government and development partners want a way for these girls to stay in the formal education system and we are hopeful that we can find a solution. There is a flexibility and openness to find a solution, said Sinead Walsh, the Irish ambassador to Sierra Leone.
Walsh, who is responsible for discharging Irish Aid, which had a strong presence in the country before Ebola hit,
continued: This not a new problem for Sierra Leone and we have been working to find a solution before Ebola. Weve looked at a lot of African countries where teenage pregnancy rates are high and there isnt really a magic solution.
So this could be an opportunity for Sierra Leone to play a leadership role in the region and find something that works.
Aid agencies say off-site education is not a sustainable solution in concept, but would be a watershed for a country where the incidence of teenage pregnancy is so high.
A senior UN official in New York described the bar on pregnant girls going to school  a policy in many African countries  as irrational and a breach of human rights.
Kate Gilmore, deputy executive director of the UNFPA, said the ban would perpetuate the cycle of poverty and hold the country back economically.
Ebola may be going, but its presence and consequences for the country are enduring. This is a sign of how much the situation has deteriorated, she said.
Gilmore said the government should be concentrating on educating pregnant girls and ensuring they delivered healthy babies rather than stigmatising them.
We have a fantastic relationship with Sierra Leone over many many years before Ebola. Sierra Leone was doing an extraordinary amount to achieve a turnaround in sexual reproductive health and reduce infant mortality, particularly as a post-conflict country, so the tragedy of Ebola is intense on so many fronts, with the reversal of such hard-won gains alongside the loss of life, she said.
Sierra Leone is already one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth, with maternal mortality and child mortality rates among the highest in the world.
These are the most vulnerable, they are at risk of child marriage and maternal mortality, said one aid worker, who asked not to be named because of local sensitivity on the subject.
Gilmore said she can understand that antipathy towards teenage pregnancy in many countries, but said traditional belief systems were not a reason to hold on to a toxic norm.
She said it was possible to change social conventions: We have done it with smoking, seat belts, FGM, there is no reason why we cant do it with teenage pregnancy, Gilmore said.
You can understand that irrationality might dominate in the early phase but pregnancy is a health issue, not a bar to education. This is eroding their capacity, as future parents, to be literate, to be numerate, to be part of economic society, she said.
This is about the demographic dividend. There is an economic boom to be reaped here  that is there for the taking for Sierra Leone.

        <title>Uganda: NGO bill aims to muzzle civil society, say activists</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/24/uganda-ngo-bill-aims-muzzle-civil-society-say-activists</Link>

Ugandan civil society groups are warning that a bill to regulate non-governmental organisations is a blow to basic freedoms and threatens to curtail the activities of some groups, reducing essential services to some of the countrys poorest people.
The NGO bill , which was published in the east African countrys official gazette in April, must be debated in parliament before it can be passed into law. That debate is expected to take place in the coming months, but NGOs are urging MPs not to send the bill to President Yoweri Museveni to be signed.
Nicholas Opio, a human rights lawyer and the executive director of Chapter Four Uganda , said the legislation would extinguish the very character of non-governmental organisations and make them puppets of the state. It unjustifiably restricts the space for civic engagement, civic association [and] civic participation in governance and in service delivery.
The new law will replace previous legislation  described by rights groups as stringent. According to its preamble, the aim is to provide a conducive and enabling environment for civil society organisations.
The internal affairs minister, Aronda Nyakairima, wrote in an introduction to the bill that while NGOs provide key services such as health, education and water, the rapid growth of non-governmental organisations has led to subversive methods of work and activities, which in turn undermine accountability and transparency in the sector.
Opio estimates there are around 11,000 registered NGOs in Uganda  there are no comprehensive official figures  and activists admit there is some lack of clarity about what they do and who runs them. But they say this opacity is due to the dysfunctional nature of the official NGO board, which is meant to regulate the sector. The board will be given new powers under the proposed law.
Opio said Ugandas efforts to tighten state control over NGOs mirrored similar actions by other governments across the region, citing notably a 2009 law on charity funding in Ethiopia, which included a provision stating that any organisation receiving more than 10% of its funding from abroad was a foreign NGO, and thus banned from any activities concerning democratic and human rights, conflict resolution or criminal justice.
It began in Ethiopia in 2009 with an extremely repressive NGO law and it appears many of the countries in the east and Horn of Africa are learning from Ethiopia, Opio said.

Last year, Kenya shut down around 500 NGOs for non-compliance with the law, accusing some of using their charitable status as a front for raising cash for terrorism. In May, South Sudans parliament passed a law that would force aid agencies to ensure that no more than a fifth of their staff are foreigners. The bill is still awaiting the presidents signature.
Under Ugandas proposed legislation, the NGO board will register NGOs or community-based organisations and issue permits. NGOs will have to declare their sources of income and obtain permits from local authorities to operate. Groups that seek to operate without a permit could face fines, prosecution and criminal penalties of between four and eight years in prison for directors.
The NGO Board will be able to revoke permits if NGOs contravene their constitutions or the bill, or if in the opinion of the board it is in the public interest to do so. The NGOs must also not engage in any act which is prejudicial to the security and laws of Uganda.
The vague nature of these latter articles, in particular, have raised concerns. Livingstone Sewanyana, director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative Uganda , said the bill aims to create fear among activists. The fight against corruption, human rights abuses and maladministration will be seriously jeopardised, he says. It seeks to disable citizens who would have a say in how they are governed  and the outcome is dictatorship.
As well as providing basic services to many communities, NGOs have worked to preserve the land rights of Ugandans living near oil finds and spoken out against government excesses and rampant corruption.

Maria Burnett, a senior researcher in the Africa division for Human Rights Watch (HRW), says government control over civil society risks negating the very essence of freedom of association. We have documented threats to the operating space for civil society over many years in Uganda, [especially] groups working on oil transparency, human rights, land, governance, corruption and other sensitive issues, particularly when they publicly advocate for change, Burnett says.
Oil has been discovered around Ugandas Lake Albert but production is not expected to start before 2018.
Lawyer Isaac Semakadde, who works in a legal aid centre, says the bill, if it comes into law, will drive NGOs away. It will make it impossible to establish and operate an NGO; as a result, practitioners will be selectively allowed to stay [in the sector], and those organisations that advocate against the government side will certainly be told to give way, he said.
Under the bill, NGOs are also banned from fundraising or campaigning for any political party or candidate. Ugandans will vote for a new president next year, and Museveni, who has held the job for nearly three decades, is widely expected to run again for his National Resistance Movement party.
The 70-year-old leader has been criticized by some donors for hanging on to power, but there are no term limits in Uganda.
Cissy Kagaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition of Uganda , said NGOs would start to self-censor to avoid losing their permits. The bill wouldnt be bad if it intended to kick out quack [NGOs], but when you target whoever opposes the official position, then that does not work, she said.
Ofwono Opondo, a government spokesman, argued that the NGO bill was necessary to force the sector to be transparent and accountable. There is even duplication of activities; NGOs claim they are providing water and when you go there you dont find anything. We want them to specify their area of jurisdiction and what they want to do exactly, he said.
He linked opposition to the bill to anti-gay activists in a country with a growing anti-liberal movement, tough laws against homosexuals and a rise in religious conservatism.
Opio said the NGO sector was not against regulation, per se. What we are rejecting is control because we are non-governmental, he said.

Governments are failing to meet their international obligations to protect women from violence by starving womens groups of funding and closing the space in which they can operate, according to a report by ActionAid.
Laws and national action plans introduced to end violence against women and girls are routinely ignored, while efforts by local civil society groups to push for change are being thwarted by threats and intimidation, the NGO said on Tuesday.
A survey of 47 womens rights activists from more than 20 countries, conducted by ActionAid and Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition , found that more than 60% of women said they felt less safe in their work than they did two years ago. Of this group, 19% said they felt significantly less safe. Activists working on abortion, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights reported feeling particularly under threat.
Armed militias, governments, the police and religious groups were identified as the main instigators of threatening behaviour, which includes verbal abuse, sexual remarks, sexual harassment and assault.
ActionAid said rather than protecting womens rights, and meeting the UN resolution adopted in 2013 to protect activists , many governments are directly perpetrating violence against women, while failing to address cultures of impunity. And rather than supporting women in their struggle, many states are closing down the civil society space which all civil society, including womens organisations, need in order to be effective.

More and more women are facing the fear of violence and its consequences for them and their families, said Lucia Fry, head of policy at ActionAid. The work of fearless women standing up against violence is being eroded by increasing intolerance of dissent and the rising influence of fundamentalist agendas that are anti-womens rights.
As our survey shows, women activists from countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and the US have all seen threats of violence increase, making them insecure and hampering their efforts to improve womens lives and end violence in society.
The survey marked the launch of ActionAids Fearless campaign , which is calling on the UK to take a lead in working with the international community to fulfil its obligations to end violence against women and girls with practical action and adequate funding. Rights activists are hoping this year will be a catalyst for long-term change for women with the adoption in September of the sustainable development goals. A target to eliminate all forms of violence is expected to be included in the goals, which come into force for all countries next year.
Speaking at the Fearless launch, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the proposed SDGs were immensely powerful and had the substance on achieving gender equality that was lacking in the millennium development goals. She added that the issues raised in the campaign were so important.
This is a battle that if were not winning it, were losing it. There are many people in many parts of the world who think women have too many rights, that its gone too far and should go back to where it used to be, she said. I have a voice and have a responsibility to use it to speak for those who dont to make sure we are winning that battle.
Figures published by the World Health Organisation in 2013 estimated that almost 30% of women experience physical or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner, despite more countries passing anti-violence laws. According to the World Bank, 76 out of 100 countries surveyed have laws to tackle domestic violence, compared with 13 in 1995.

An ActionAid report published with the survey outlined numerous cases of women being attacked in the course of their activism. These include Atena Farghadani, 28, an artist who was placed in solitary confinement in Iran for posting a cartoon on Facebook criticising a government bill to limit family planning services, and Gladys Lanza , who was convicted of defamation in Honduras when she spoke in defence of a woman who had accused a government official of sexual harassment.
Samira Hamidi , former director of the Afghan Womens Network, said she had been repeatedly threatened by opposition groups in the course of her work. There are no prevention and protection mechanisms by my government where any women  but particularly women human rights defenders  can be supported.
ActionAid is calling on governments to adequately fund local womens rights groups, which it said are critical to ending gender-based violence.
A survey conducted in 70 countries over four decades found that the mobilisation of womens rights organisations was the most important factor in turning commitments to end violence into meaningful action  having more impact than the number of women in parliament, or the wealth of a country.
But, between 2012 and 2013, of the $28bn earmarked for gender equality globally, the overall funding for womens organisations was less than $400m, said ActionAid.
A global survey of 740 womens organisations conducted by the Association for Womens Rights in Development (Awid) in 2010 found the average annual income of these groups was just $20,000 (12,000). Organisations in sub-Saharan Africa often receive just $12,000 a year.

Doris Owusu Prempeh, a member of a community-based anti-violence team (Combat) in southern Ghana supported by ActionAid, said she had seen a reduction in gender-based violence locally in the five years since her team had been working.
The team, comprised of three women and four men, educate people about what constitutes domestic violence and why its wrong, and support those who have been attacked, with counselling and reporting the crime to the police. When we started, we had so many cases [of violence] but now it has reduced to one a month. When we started, we got more than six or seven a month because there was no education about domestic violence, she said.
But there is only so much the group is able to do. Police are sometimes reluctant to pursue an arrest unless they are paid by the victim or the family. We dont have money and our work is voluntary so that makes it very difficult for us to report cases, she said.

Economic inequality will make it harder for countries to weather crises such as natural disasters and social unrest in the future, a study has shown.
The 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) measured the ability of governments, businesses and civil societies in 127 countries to handle economic change and take advantage of investment opportunities.
It evaluated each countrys quality of governance by looking at macroeconomic frameworks, business environments and the rule of law. Researchers also considered the freedom and influence of civil society groups.
Economic inequality was seen as the greatest threat for many nations, leaving them vulnerable to financial shocks, according to the CRI, which was released on Tuesday by KPMG and Oxford Economics thinktank.
A recent study by Oxfam on extreme wealth inequality said 85 of the worlds richest people had the same wealth as half of the worlds population.
Worsening inequality can lead to or exacerbate conflicts and reduce social cohesion
Change Readiness Index
Uneven economic growth does not reduce poverty as quickly as growth that is spread across societies, the CRI said. It also warned that worsening inequality can lead to or exacerbate conflicts and reduce social cohesion.
The 2015 index said Namibia, Haiti and Guatemala had the least inclusive economic growth.
Some low-income countries ranked higher than expected in the CRI. Trevor Davies, executive director of KPMGs International Development Assistance Services (Idas), said this was because of economic diversification, a strong rule of law, and educational opportunities.
Weve found that the countries that do well are the ones that actually focus not just on the economic side, but also on bringing about good governance and improving the lot of their people  so making sure that the economic benefit flows through inclusively to their population, said Davies.
Mozambique, which came 80th in the index, performed better than any other low-income country, based on projections of gross national income. Uganda, Cambodia and Tanzania also ranked high in the index.
Timothy Stiles, chairman of Idas, said: Many countries compensate for lesser wealth with robust governance, a strong social foundation, and a positive business environment.
Algeria registered the biggest gain in this years rankings, because of impressive improvements in its enterprise and government capability, the report said.
The Philippines strong political institutions demonstrated the importance of good governance in recovering from natural disasters, according to Davies. Much of the country was devastated by typhoon Haiyan in 2013, but the Philippines effective policies and institutions have enabled it to persevere, and it is projected to be one of the worlds fastest growing economies in 2015.
The index showed that the volume of national income is the most significant factor in determining change readiness, with the top 22 spots in the index going to high-income countries. Small countries with high gross national income are the best positioned to handle economic shocks and take advantage of investment, the report said.
Singapore came top, followed by Switzerland, Hong Kong, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Qatar, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.
The report combined data from 22 primary survey questions that were gathered from 1,270 country experts around the world. Data sources included the World Economic Forum, World Bank, Legatum Institute, International Monetary Fund and United Nations.

Kenyan president's call to arms on self-sufficiency carries health risks
Resolving some taxing issues must be top of President Kenyattas agenda if he is to end dependence on aid without harming healthcare or education

During the 25th African Union summit from 7-15 June, Kenyas president Uhuru Kenyatta took to Twitter to urge his fellow leaders to move away from reliance on development aid from donor countries.
In his tweet at the conference in South Africa , Kenyatta said that sometimes aid only appears to be charitable and so often carries terms and conditions that preclude progress.
Kenyatta has been a vocal opponent of perceived Western influence and power in Africa  notably since he was charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . The charges, which related to post-election violence in 2007-2008 and were denied by Kenyatta, were dropped in December 2014 after key witnesses withdrew.
But despite Kenyattas bold call for increased African self-sufficiency, could Kenya do without aid in the near future?
Advocacy group Results has researched health financing in Kenya with the Kenya Aids NGO Consortium (Kanco). The study, Who Pays for Progress?, looks at the balance between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Domestic Resource Mobilisation (DRM) such as tax, and will be launched in July. The data so far suggests it would be a major challenge to move away from aid in the health sector, and also difficult in other areas, such as education.

Of the overall health budget, 45% is currently provided by donors and 55% by the Kenyan state. In some programmes, the dependency on ODA is even greater. In a series of interviews in March 2015, we learned that the HIV and Aids programmes are funded 70% by donors, and work on nutrition is around 80% funded from ODA.
Even these figures do not tell the whole story  for tuberculosis programmes, 23% of funding comes from domestic sources, and 17% from ODA, but 60% of the need is completely unfunded. At present the country needs to increase funding for healthcare if it is to fulfil the ambition stated in the 2010 constitution to achieve universal health coverage.
In the long run, all Kenyans would be happy to see a time when the country does not need aid, said Allan Ragi, director of Kanco. But at present, if ODA falls then we will be unable to deliver essential healthcare to the most needy.
In the medium term, there is more cause for optimism. Economists in Kenya see ample scope to increase domestic resources, for example by improving the efficiency of the tax system.
The Kenya Revenue Authority has identified a significant number of high-net-worth individuals who could increase their tax payments, and the same is true of some multinational companies. Kenya had around 8,700 dollar millionaires in 2014 and in Nairobi alone, there are at least 65 high-net-worth individuals with wealth exceeding $30m.
As well as improving tax revenue, the country could reduce illicit financial flows out of Kenya. According to authoritative research Kenya lost $4.9bn in capital flight in 2010 alone: this is approximately $120 per person. This ties in with global analysis that shows that while high-income countries collect an average of 34% of their GDP in taxes, low-income countries in Africa only collect 17%, or even less.
Related: Without leadership over development finance, talks in July cannot succeed
The government of Kenya has identified ways to close some tax loopholes and thus make more funds available for health and other development programmes. Capital gains tax of 5% was reintroduced on 1 January this year after an absence of 30 years. The National Aids Control Council has said it can increase the domestic funding of the HIV programme from 30% to 85%, but not until 2024.
If Kenya can raise more domestic finance through taxation, and devote a greater share of the national budget to health, then the current funding gap for essential health programmes can be filled. Chatham House health economists estimate that around $86 per person per year is needed to deliver adequate health coverage in developing countries.
President Kenyattas call to arms to fellow African presidents came just a month before the Financing for Development conference in Ethiopia on 13-16 July, where the world community will debate how to pay for development priorities over the next 15 years.
Kenyattas call for self-sufficiency will surely find a great deal of support in Addis Ababa, but health economists will be urging caution, and will want assurances that domestic finance for health is in place before ODA dries up.

        <title>68 million children likely to die by 2030 from preventable causes, report says</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/23/unicef-68-million-children-under-five-die-2030-preventable-causes-report</Link>
        <Description/>

Almost 70 million children under five will die by 2030 from mainly preventable causes unless the world is bolder and more strategic about helping the poorest and most vulnerable young people on the planet, Unicef has warned in a blunt final report on the millennium development goals (MDGs) .
The UN childrens agency says that while the MDGs have yielded significant achievements in reducing child and maternal mortality and improving access to drinking water, they have failed millions of disadvantaged children and even increased levels of inequality within some countries.
Unicef attributes the failures to a lack of ambition and planning, but also points to the way in which data was collected and used  and the fact that the MDGs inadvertently encouraged countries to measure their progress through national averages.
In the rush to make that progress, many focused on the easiest-to-reach children and communities, not those in greatest need, says the report, Progress for Children: Beyond Averages .

In doing so, national progress may actually have been slowed. This is because we were not strategic enough. Though it was once assumed that reaching the hardest-to-reach was unrealistic, we now know that investing in the most disadvantaged children can actually be more cost-effective.
The agency says that the sustainable development goals  which will replace the MDGs later this year and set the development agenda until 2030  must take into account lessons learned from their predecessors if lives are to be saved and futures altered.
Without concerted action to reach the most vulnerable children, Unicef estimates that by 2030, 68 million more children under five will die from mainly preventable causes; 119 million children will still be chronically malnourished, and half a billion people will still be defecating in the open .
In sub-Saharan Africa , the risk of a child dying before her or his fifth birthday in the region is almost 15 times higher than the risk facing a child born in a high-income country, while Unicef estimates that, at the current rate, it will take 96 years for all girls from the regions poorest families to complete their lower secondary education.

The report also notes that neonatal deaths currently represent a larger share of the total under-five deaths than they did in 1990: by the end of 2015, about 1 million children  16% of all under-five deaths  will die on the same day they were born. Eleven children are predicted to die every minute in 2015.
The differences within countries are equally stark: children from the poorest households are twice as likely to die before turning five  and far less likely to achieve minimum reading standards  as children from the richest households.
Although Unicefs executive director, Anthony Lake, insisted the MDGs as a whole had absolutely not failed the worlds children, he said the report had to serve as a wake-up call.
If the global community allows the current trends to continue, we will fail millions of children, he said.
This shows the huge stakes in achieving the goals of the SDGs and we believe that to achieve the most results, most efficiently, we have to focus ever more on the most disadvantaged children.
Lake said targeting the poorest children was the best way to reduce cycles of intergenerational poverty and improve the lives of families, communities and societies.
They are where the needs are greatest and our modelling over the years has shown that its the most cost-effective way to achieve results, because the results you achieve in the most disadvantaged areas almost always outweigh the additional costs of reaching those areas, he said.
Despite its bleak assessment of some MDG progress, the report highlighted a series of successes in the fight against poverty, disease and mortality levels since 1990.
It pointed out that under-five mortality dropped by 53%; that chronic malnutrition among children under five decreased by 41%; that maternal mortality decreased by 45%, and that 2.6 billion people gained access to improved drinking water sources .

Hugh Muir presents this edition of the Global development podcast, ahead of the UN's third international conference on Financing for Development. Having set in motion a bold agenda for a better world with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will drive development priorities over the next 15 years, member states now have to work out how to finance them.
The talks will cover everything from aid and taxes to the role of the private sector and trade  and success is crucial if the SDGs are to be achieved by 2030.
Clr N Chonghaile went along to a panel discussion, Financing the Future, at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), and asked participants what they hoped the Addis meeting would deliver. Research officers at the ODI Gideon Rabinowitz and Andrew Rogerson emphasise the importance of developed countries delivering on the 0.7% target of national income as ODA. We also hear from Rupert Simons, chief executive of Publish What You Fund, on his hopes for the Addis talks.
Joining Hugh to discuss the development financing agenda are Tim Jones, policy officer at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, and Paddy Carter, one of the lead authors of the ODI's report on how international public finance should fund a global social compact to eradicate poverty. We also hear from Jean Letitia Saldanha, senior policy advisor from CIDSE, the International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity.
Plus, Kary Stewart takes a tour of London's tax-dodging hotspots to find out just where the country's top corporate tax avoiders call home.

Corruption stymies Niger's attempts to stem flow of migrants to Europe
Despite a government crackdown on people-smuggling, police corruption means the migrant convoys continue on the perilous journey across the Sahara

In the desert town of Agadez in central Niger , almost anyone can point out the smugglers compounds where African migrants lie low before heading for Europe. Almost anyone, except the police.
At a checkpoint on the outskirts of town, police officers turn a blind eye as dozens of smugglers trucks packed with migrants drive past at nightfall. This happens every Monday as convoys start the three-day trek across the desert to Libya.
We cannot stop the migrant trucks. They do not pass by here, says one of the policemen, gesturing vaguely into the blackness. They go around us, far off in the desert.
After two migrant trucks pass, a turbaned fixer hired by a smuggler to pay off the police gets back on his scooter and drives away, his work done.
A confidential government report into illegal migration in Agadez concluded that corruption was so entrenched here that to tackle migrant smuggling would require replacing almost all military and police officials.

A record 100,000 migrants are expected to cross Niger this year into Libya, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), taking advantage of the chaos that has given smugglers an open door to Europe.
The EU believes just over half the migrants arriving in Italy travel first through Niger. More than 1,800 migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean this year alone and Europe is looking to Niger for action.
Last month, President Mahamadou Issoufous government passed a tough anti-migrant smuggling law that establishes prison terms of up to 30 years for smugglers. It said this was to protect vulnerable young Africans.
Not only are many migrants exploited by smugglers, falling victim to forced labour or prostitution, but others die in the desert when they are abandoned there, or when vehicles break down.
Officials in Niger, ranked as the worlds poorest country by the UN, know that implementing the new law means cracking down on endemic graft in a country where a young policeman earns less than $190 a month.
For a truck of illegal migrants to cross Niger and reach Libya, many officials must turn a blind eye, said Goge Maimouna Gazibo, head of Nigers National Agency for the Fight Against People Smuggling (ANLTP).
From now on, any official who allows a bus to cross a border will be considered guilty of smuggling and corruption, Gazibo added.
Niger has tried before to curb migration. After 92 migrants were found dead in the desert in 2013, the government launched raids on several smugglers compounds, known as ghettos, and replaced a handful of police officers.
Migrants and smugglers say they are obliged to bribe police, in a racket worth millions of dollars a year
Two years on, little has changed. Flows from countries like Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria, Mali and Ghana are higher than ever. Migrants and smugglers say they are obliged to bribe police, in a racket worth millions of dollars a year.
On the road north from Nigers capital Niamey, police systematically took migrants aside at checkpoints to demand payment. Although citizens of west African countries have the right to travel in Niger, many migrants say they prefer not to show their identity papers for fear they will be confiscated by corrupt police.
If they stop you, you have to pay, said Lamine Bandaogo, a lean 17-year-old fleeing Burkina Faso, as he stood in a bus depot on the route to Agadez. Bribes range between $2 and $20. If you have nothing, you must beg forgiveness.
Since winning power in 2011, Issoufou has made some progress in the fight against corruption. Niger has risen to 103rd in Transparency Internationals 2014 survey of graft perceptions , from 134th (of 175) the year he took office.

Yet some people question whether security forces are ready to forego lucrative revenues from migration. A confidential 2013 national police report concluded that Agadez, which acts as a gateway to the north, was an El Dorado for security forces. It found there were more than 70 smugglers ghettos active in the town, each one protected by a paid police agent.
A separate report by the Halcia anti-corruption agency said that payments to security forces and local authorities totalled $450 per vehicle and $30 per foreign migrant on the route between Agadez and the Libyan border.
The Halcia mission also found that bribes paid by migrants were essential to keep the security forces functioning as money earmarked in the military budget to buy diesel for vehicles, spare parts and food simply disappeared in Niamey.
The security forces recognise that they take money but they have no choice. That is money they use to do their jobs, said Ousmane Baydo, deputy head of Halcia.
In an effort to bypass corrupt security forces, the new law places the legal responsibility on transport companies to ensure travellers have valid documents.
Any transport company that doesnt check documents, well prosecute them for complicity, Gazibo said, adding this should help to reduce migrant numbers by next year.

Once we have confiscated two or three buses, the transport companies will start to cooperate, he said.
The justice minister, Amadou Marou, said Niger cannot tackle the problem alone and has appealed to neighbouring countries to adopt similar laws punishing those who profit from illegal migration and to agree terms for the repatriation of migrants.
Niger officials are concerned that any unilateral expulsion of west African citizens could sour relations with neighbours.
Niger plans to create welcome centres in Agadez to try to prevent migrants from falling into the hands of smugglers, to inform them of the risks of the perilous journey, and to return those wanting to go back to their own countries.
This is not a law to protect Europe, Marou said. We have done this to save lives because African governments also have a responsibility.
But with some west African states reliant on remittances from migrants, questions remain over how determined they are to combat illegal migration.
Marou said Europe needed to make legal immigration easier. If it is possible for European citizens to come to Africa , it should be just as easy for Africans to go to there.

Niger is the largest per capita recipient of European aid , with some 600m ($680m) earmarked between now and 2020. EU ambassador Raul Mateus Paula said that would be boosted by at least 30m this year.
An EU police training mission will open an office in Agadez and focus its activities on migrant smuggling. The EU will also contribute to the centres to inform and repatriate migrants.
Yet Niger and its European partners recognise that, if they are to stem the flows, migrants and smugglers alike need economic alternatives.
The 2013 national police report warned that Agadez lived off smuggling and any attempts to end it could lead to riots. With tourism devastated by Islamic militancy in the Sahara, many in the town say they have no other source of income.
A smuggler can make 3m CFA francs ($5,212) with just one 4x4 packed with 30 migrants  a fortune in a country where most people live on less than $2 a day. Dozens of ghettos lie behind red mud walls on Agadezs dirty backstreets, with metal gates offering glimpses of groups of young men inside.

They cannot stop migration completely. If there was no immigration, Agadez would grind to a halt, said Bashir, who owns a migrant ghetto. He says he is getting out of the business because of the new law and wants himself to emigrate.
If Europe would give us money, then we would stay here, he said.
Giuseppe Loprete, local head of the IOM, said migrants who have sold everything to pay for their trip are ready to die rather than return empty-handed to even worse poverty. Would-be migrants should be told more about the risks so they do not leave in the first place, he said.
The IOM is training members of western African communities in Niamey to explain the dangers. Djibril Sow  a Senegalese expatriate who has lived in Niamey for years  says he will seek out his fellow citizens in bus stations.
Loprete said: If they know that there is a 90% chance of dying, or getting held up, or coming back with nothing, then I think people will change their minds.

In three months, the UN looks set to adopt 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) that will guide the international communitys efforts to tackle global poverty, inequality and climate change over the next 15 years.
After years of negotiations among policymakers, NGOs and academics , a zero draft of the SDGs is now under discussion. But how will we know if we advance towards achieving these targets? What should be the indicators of progress?
The draft goals call for an end to poverty in all its forms everywhere and set the target of reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. But how do countries measure the multidimensional nature of poverty and track progress towards reducing it?
Multidimensional poverty measurement has been rapidly evolving over the past five years, both at the national and international level. Since 2010, the UN Development Programme s human development report office has published a Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), developed with and calculated by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford .
Related: Number of people in extreme poverty could be greatly underestimated, report says
The index complements traditional measures of monetary poverty and captures the multiple, overlapping disadvantages poor people can face  such as poor sanitation, malnutrition, poor quality of housing and lack of education.
According to the latest updates of the Global MPI , released by OPHI on 22 June and covering 101 developing countries, 1.6 billion people are living in multidimensional poverty around the world.
Of this number, most MPI poor people  69.6%  live in middle-income countries. In addition, looking at the 67 countries for which there is comparable data on both MPI and monetary poverty, 29% or 1.4 billion people are MPI poor, while 1.07 billion or 22% live on less than $1.25 a day.
In certain countries, including Mexico, Pakistan and Egypt, the number of those living in multidimensional poverty is twice the number who are living on less than $1.25 a day, and is more than 1 million people. This emphasises how the MPI complements monetary poverty measures, as both together better capture the true reality of poverty.
This month more than 100 policymakers and senior officials came together in Cartagena, Colombia, for the third annual meeting of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), a group of more than 40 governments and institutions that promotes the use of national multidimensional poverty measures.
In a communique released after the meeting, which was hosted by President Juan Manuel Santos and the government of Colombia, theparticipants called for an improved Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI 2015+) to be included in the SDGs.
Related: First draft of sustainable development goals exposes gaps, warn NGOs
This index would reflect progress towards tackling different dimensions of poverty, and could also be broken down to show exactly what poverty is like in different areas of a country, or among different groups of the population. Such information would help ensure that no one is left behind by the post-2015 development agenda.
The network supports governments designing national MPIs using indicators of poverty that are relevant to their specific country contexts. The governments of Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Bhutan, as well as the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, have already adopted official multidimensional poverty measures. And a rapidly increasing number of countries, including Pakistan, Philippines, Malaysia, Tunisia and Vietnam, are developing their own MPIs.
What is electric is how these measures galvanise action. By pinpointing exactly how and where people are poor, national MPIs enable governments to better target their resources and combat poverty more effectively through integrated and well-coordinated policy interventions.
The MPPN hopes that the global and national MPIs will receive support at the UNs conference on financing for development in Addis Ababa next month. It also hopes the MPIs will be recommended as indicators by the expert group that recently concluded its first meeting on the indicator framework in New York.
How we understand poverty is changing  its multidimensional nature is now widely acknowledged. But recognising this fact in the SDGs is, in itself, not enough. We must commit to measuring multidimensional poverty to ensure that the many overlapping disadvantages faced by the poor can be energetically and successfully tackled.

Peru harnesses ancient canal system to tackle Lima water shortage
Restoring a pre-Inca network of channels to ensure a steady flow of water from the mountains should help Lima meet some of its growing needs

In the mountains above the Peruvian capital Lima, the worlds second largest desert city, scientists are working with farmers to restore ancient canals, believed to predate the Inca empire, in an effort to tackle the citys increasing water shortage.
The system  known locally as mamanteo, a term derived from the Spanish word for suckling, or amunas  could help the city of nearly 10 million inhabitants to ride the seasonal extremes of floods and droughts.
It works by funnelling water from highland streams into the mountain itself, where it percolates through cracks and natural aquifers over months to emerge in springs and natural reservoirs.
Its all about building in delays in the hydrological runoff of these catchments because if the water continues through this stream it will reach the village downstream in a question of hours. Letting it seep through the mountain, we expect to build in delays of weeks and hopefully months, says Bert De Bivre, an expert on Andean water basins working with the Consortium for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Ecorregion , an NGO.
The delay means that the abundant wet-season moisture in these highlands at more than 3,500 metres above sea level can be gradually distributed during the dry season, which can last more than half the year.
Floods and landslides killed nine people, left thousands homeless and caused major infrastructure damage on the outskirts of Lima in March. Meanwhile, unusually warm autumn temperatures brought drought in other parts of the city, where at least 700,000 live without running, potable water, according to Sedapal , the citys water board.
A third of Peruvians live in Lima and up to 150,000 migrants continue to swell its infrastructure-starved peripheries every year. Authorities are struggling to supply the growing population, dependent on three rivers that flow from the Andes: the Rmac, Chilln and Lurn.
Regrouting and maintaining the pre-Inca drainage canals provides a cheap alternative to building modern hydric infrastructure, according to De Bivre. Experts believe they may have been built by the Wari culture as long ago as 700AD, yet De Bivre says it is clear they were developed over centuries by different cultures  and we are just one more of them.
State funding for the project began in March. Perus national water regulator Sunass multiplied the proposed budget, diverting 1% of consumer tariffs from Sedapal over the next five years  more than 70m Peruvian soles, or about $22m (14m)  to green infrastructure. This will include restoring amunas and recuperating highland wetlands. A further 3.8% of tariffs, approximately $89m, will be used for climate change adaptation and disaster risk mitigation.
The investment in green infrastructure would mean an increase in Limas water volume by at least one cubic metre a second, which makes it very affordable in contrast to building a canal, said Fernando Momiy, the president of Sunass.
Lima is a desert city which keeps growing and in five years there will be another 700,000 inhabitants who will need water. Thats why we need to look at combining grey infrastructure with green infrastructure, said Momiy.
Its the first time that a regulatory body has promoted this kind of infrastructure in Lima. We see that theres a lot of focus on grey infrastructure when we should be looking at green infrastructure, so as not to have to invest so much in expensive grey infrastructure.
Pointing to water crises in California, the UK and Sao Paulo in Brazil, Momiy said: Theres no reason to think that couldnt happen to us.
With a commanding view of the distant smog above Lima, the small district of Huamantanga feels far removed from the city that houses a third of Peruvians.
Here we count on the expertise of the local people who know all the water sources and springs, says De Bivre.

With nearly four million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, a heavy toll has been placed on local populations. Basic infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water supplies, has been placed under enormous strain.
But despite the pressures, many local communities have stepped in to help new arrivals. Refugees have also banded together to support each other. To mark World Refugee Day, the European commissions humanitarian aid and civil protection department (Echo) has partnered with the Danish Refugee Council to pay tribute to the everyday heroes supporting Syrian refugees.
There is a lot of media coverage highlighting the negative impact of the crisis on the refugee-hosting countries, but there are also many positive stories that never get reported, says David Verboom, Echos regional head of office in Amman, Jordan. This is an attempt to redress the balance a little, to shine some light on the generosity and friendship shown towards the refugees, and vice versa, that often goes unnoticed.
Syrian refugee Ahmad Khalif supports other refugees who arrive at Darashakran refugee camp, Iraq

Khalif fled Syria in August 2013 with his wife and six children, taking nothing but the clothes they were wearing. The quietly spoken 42-year-old now lives in Darashakran refugee camp, where he has become a father figure, helping more than 300 families access clothes, food and medicine.
They come here with nothing. [Just] the clothes on their back. Many have not eaten for days and they are scared. The children cry a lot, Khalif says. You become aware of those that are really struggling, so I make calls and talk to people and we share what we have. We dont make a fuss. We leave the clothing, food or blankets at night so it can be found in the morning.
We may not have much, but what we do have we share. Are we not called humans, after all?

It is not good enough to give a tent and leave them. We must ensure we offer dignity too, says Fathullu, one of the few female mayors in Iraq. She aims to offer a personal welcome to each refugee who arrives in the district, and has overseen the construction of Darashakran camp, home to 11,000 Syrian refugees.
She says the camp has reliable electricity, water and sanitation facilities, as well as green areas for children to play and families to meet. Our door here is always open because we, like our brothers and sisters in Syria, are humanitarian people who look after one another. From one human to the next, I offer my support. I want them to feel secure.

Dirani is the director of one of the few womens resource centres for Syrian refugees in Lebanons Bekaa Valley.
The stories I have heard from women I work with are often unbelievably heartbreaking. But at the same time, day by day, I see their strength grow, their heads rise and strength building as they learn new skills that help empower them, Dirani says.
More than half of the 400,000 refugees from Syria living in the Bekaa Valley are women and children.
Most days women just sit in their homes, cook, clean and worry about how they will be able to provide a good future for their children. Some women have been abandoned by husbands who take on younger, second wives. They struggle and even push their daughters into early marriage or pull their children out of school so they can work and earn money, Dirani says.

With food donated by local restaurants and food manufacturing companies, Terro runs a street feeding programme for refugees in Beirut. In the three years since the project began, Foodblessed has provided more than 190,000 meals to Syrian families.
Terro leads a growing team of more than 400 volunteers who make and distribute meals from food that would have otherwise ended up as waste. I used to think that people didnt care, but Ive found out that people just didnt know how, she says.
Journalist Ahmad Abu Hamad knows first-hand what it is like arriving in a new country as a refugee

Journalist Ahmad Abu Hamad is a Palestinian refugee who grew up in Jordans Madaba refugee camp. Having experienced life as a new arrival, he says his aim is to bring humanity into the conversation on refugees.
There is a misconception that people believe a refugee has no responsibilities. But to become a refugee, that person has had only three options to choose from  to be killed, to be imprisoned or to become a refugee. It is that simple.
Last week I interviewed a 20-year-old refugee girl. When we spoke I looked at her and thought, What has she done? No home, alone. A refugee because of what?

Many things have changed for 13-year-old Salam Al Jundi in the past 15 months, among them being able to smile and walk.
In March 2014 the young Syrian was walking with her young brother and cousin to a shop near her home to buy sweets when a bomb struck their path. Her cousin died, her brother was injured and Salam lost her leg.
With no treatment available near their home, her parents took the chance and sent Salam and her eight-year-old brother to Souriyat Across Borders , a medical centre in Jordan offering free treatment to Syrian refugees.
These kids do not only need treatment but also love and encouragement. Their disability is a mark in their mind and a lot of them lose faith in a brighter future, says Yaseen, a volunteer physiotherapist. I always ask them, Do you need your legs or head to think and attend school? That way I encourage them to believe that they can study and achieve their dreams.

More than half of the Syrian refugee population are children, and agencies are working to provide psychosocial support for children, both in refugee camps and host communities. One form of support is art therapy, which aims to help children express themselves and share stories with others who have had similar experiences.
Artist Hala Abu Said, a Syrian refugee herself, says she hopes she can make a small difference in the lives of the children she works with. This is the best gift I can give the kids as an artist. Every person has something to help Syrians, regardless of their nationality.

Aid agencies must rewire their approach to refugees' energy needs
In the rush to respond to crises, access to safe, reliable and clean energy for refugees is often overlooked. A new energy initiative could provide a solution

Many years ago, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, printed a poster of Albert Einstein with the caption Einstein was a refugee  a reminder of the enormous contribution that refugees have made to the world. But this World Refugee Day , instead of celebrating their contribution, we will unfortunately have to focus on finding solutions for an unprecedented global crisis.
Antnio Guterres, the head of the UNHCR, has spoken of a world facing an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement, as well as the response required, is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before.
There are now nearly 60 million forcibly displaced people in the world: thats almost the same as the combined populations of Canada and Australia. Half of these displaced people are children, and the overall numbers are increasing rapidly.
Related: Pakistan: 'Son, you brought electricity to the village and added 15 years to my life'
Addressing this problem demands coherent migration and refugee policies. Reversing the trend will require effective conflict resolution and prevention. These all remain a long way off. In the meantime, we must find practical, humane and cost-effective ways to respond to the needs of displaced persons.
Like everyone else, displaced people need access to safe, reliable and clean energy, whether for lighting, heating, cooking, sanitation, earning a living or communicating. They rarely get this. Every situation is different, but millions of people in camps depend on rudimentary or primitive energy solutions, such as three-stone fires and candles.
This has profound human, environmental and economic consequences. Accidents with naked flames can cause injuries and death, such as this months tragic example in a Syrian refugee camp in Lebanons Bekaa Valley, where at least four people were killed when dozens of tents caught fire.
Indoor cooking with open fires contributes to serious respiratory illness, chiefly among women and children who tend to be most exposed to the fumes. The same women may also spend hours each day gathering firewood, increasing the risk of gender-based violence, especially as areas around camps become deforested and the women are forced further and further afield in search of firewood.
Humanitarian agencies try to provide what energy they can but their efforts can often be inefficient and costly.
The potential benefits of doing things differently are obvious. They include reduced deforestation, carbon emissions and pollution; improved health and reduced levels of violence; and lower costs. Better energy access can also create livelihood opportunities and could improve relations between displaced people and local populations by supporting enterprise or generating benefits for both communities.
The celebrated UNHCR poster featuring Albert Einstein.
So why is access to sustainable energy not front and centre in responses that seek to address the needs of displaced people?
The problem is not technological. A breathtaking range of innovative products and services exists to meet needs for everything from lighting and cellphone charging to cooking and heating, water pumping and cooling. Some technologies, such as solar PV or panels and mini-grids, are highly advanced. Others, such as fuel-efficient stoves, are basic. All offer cleaner, safer and more reliable energy at an affordable price, and represent a significant improvement on the current situation.
However, a host of obstacles  political, financial and institutional  constrain humanitarian agencies in their efforts to meet the energy needs of displaced populations.
Governments and local authorities in host countries may be reluctant to facilitate energy access for refugees, particularly if local populations have unmet needs, or if they fear increased energy provision may prolong the existence of a camp.
Although most solutions offer very attractive payback times, agencies may struggle to find predictable, long-term funding to procure them. Within the humanitarian system, energy often falls through the cracks. Dedicated agencies, organisational arrangements and funding lines exist for basic needs such as food, water, shelter and health. But not for energy. This means that in the rush to save lives and respond to crises, energy provision is often an afterthought  uncoordinated and short-term.
The scale of these challenges cannot be understated. Success will require rewiring the humanitarian system, developing new funding models, building capacities and expertise where none currently exist, and persuading governments with responsibilities for refugee influxes to try new approaches.
Crucially, it will also require the involvement of the private sector, which is often where the deepest expertise and capacity for innovation lies.
The Moving Energy Initiative , a partnership between the UNHCR, GVEP International, Chatham House , Practical Action Consulting , the Norwegian Refugee Council and the UKs Department for International Development has been formed to address these challenges.
Working in different countries and with other collaborators, the project is designing and piloting new approaches and models for energy provision among displaced populations, building the case for reform and developing recommendations for systemic change.
This year the international community will agree a new set of sustainable development goals . As currently proposed, the seventh goal is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. If all is to mean everyone, the humanitarian system has to start changing now.

Revised US hostage policy creates new dilemma for Obama  a contradiction
Administration appears torn between tough stance against concessions to terrorists and allowing families to do whatever it takes to free their loved ones

On the day that President Obama announced a shift in the US policy on hostages this week, White House security adviser Lisa Monaco revealed that more than 30 Americans were still being held around the world.
That figure had previously been undisclosed, and the announcement served as a reminder that despite a number of high-profile incidents in which US citizens have been abducted and sometimes killed, the kidnapping of Americans remains a widespread  and often under-reported  international phenomenon.
According to a senior administration official, those 30 hostages include several people held by terrorist groups, but the majority have been kidnapped for ransom by criminal gangs. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to give further details out of concern for the hostages safety.
Some of the remaining US hostages have been publicly identified: Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared on Kish Island, Iran in 2007, while working as a contract employee for the CIA; Caitlin Coleman, who was pregnant when she was kidnapped along with her husband Joshua Boyle in Afghanistan in 2012; and Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria in 2012 . The State Department also confirmed that several Americans  at least four according to the Washington Post were  being held by Houthi rebels in Yemen.
In his announcement, Obama said that since the attacks on September 11, 2001, more than 80 Americans have been taken hostage by terrorist or pirate groups around the world.
Some of these kidnappings were motivated to a degree by political ideology, as with the Abu Sayyaf group in the northern Philippines and various al-Qaida affiliates around the world; but westerners are often prime targets for non-political kidnappings for ransom, according to Leslie Edwards, a leading hostage negotiation specialist. Nigeria and Somalia have seen several kidnappings for money in recent years.
Similarly, the State Department has warned that kidnappings in Mexico are on the rise: US diplomats received reports of 130 kidnappings of US citizens in the country between January and November of 2014. Most were ransom-based or express kidnappings, where victims are taken to ATMs or sexually assaulted before being released.
The Obama administration launched its review of kidnapping policy following sharp criticism from the families of the hostages killed in Iraq and Syria by the jihadi group Islamic State.
Family members had complained that they were ignored by officials or even threatened with prosecution if they attempted to negotiate with the captors or raise money for ransoms.
Officially, the long-standing US policy of refusing to makes concessions to hostage-takers remains in place, but Obama said this week that it would not seek to prosecute people who engage in ransom negotiations.
The last thing we should ever do is add to a familys pain with threats like that, Obama said.
The reaction from families has been ambivalent.
Austin Tices parents, Debra and Marc were among the 24 families of hostages who participated in the review. In a statement to the Guardian, they said that while they commended the president for a sincere and dedicated effort, they said they continued to have concerns about certain aspects of the policy.
Nonetheless, they said they thought the presidents actions were a strong start and will help their efforts to return their son home.
The stakes riding on such efforts are clear: during the seven months the White House took to carry its policy review, the more American hostages were killed: Kayla Mueller died after a Jordanian air strike hit the building where she was being held by Isis; Warren Weinstein was killed by a US drone strike in Pakistan, and Luke Somers was killed in Yemen during a failed US rescue attempt .
Announcing the policy, Obama appeared torn between wanting to maintain a tough official stance against hostage-taking and allowing families some leeway to do whatever is necessary to free their loved ones  a stance which some described as contradictory.
Republican House Speaker John Boehner framed the executive order as a kind concession in itself. We have had a policy in the United States for over 200 years of not paying ransom and not negotiating with terrorists and the concern that I have is that by lifting that long held principle you could be endangering more Americans here and overseas, Boehner said .
But according to Edwards, the new policy was a realistic approach to the agonising dilemmas faced by hostages families. People dont understand the difference between not standing in families way and actively paying for kidnappees, he said. This is just sensible pragmatism. The families are going to pay anyway, regardless of what the administration is saying. Its totally unrealistic to expect them not to pay or get involved.
The newly established FBI fusion cell , a government agency now tasked with improving communications between the administration and hostage families, will focus primarily on recovering US nationals held hostage by non-government entities or when their status is unknown or undetermined, the senior administration official said. Tice and Levinson fall under this category, as their captors are still undetermined.
But several American citizens are captives of government authorities in foreign states, including three US citizens arrested and detained in Iranian prisons: Jason Rezaian was arrested eight months ago and is standing trial on espionage charges in Iran. The White House has called his detention  unjust .
Saeed Abedini was sentenced to eight years in prison for conducting Bible-study gatherings, while Arizona-born Amir Hekmati was given a 15-minute trial on accusations he spied for the CIA, before being handed a death sentence, since commuted on appeal to 10 years.
Meanwhile, Sharif Mobley, a US citizen who was lost inside the Yemeni prison system after being held on terrorism charges which were since dropped, is now in the custody of Houthi rebels opposed to the Yemeni government, which first arrested him.
According to the senior administration official, Rezaian, Abedini, Hekmati and Mobley  and others held by purported authorities on alleged legal violations in foreign countries  are considered detainees, and as such, their cases are handled by the State Department. The official said that the new fusion cell will be able to monitor the status of these detainees and could assist the State Dpt, but will not have the responsibility for their resolution.
Regardless, families of those held abroad need as much official help as possible, Edwards said. We should support families, and not pass on the role of dealing with kidnap to families - thats placing an unfair burden on them, he said.

        <title>Anthony Kennedy: how one man's evolution legalized marriage for millions</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/26/kennedy-ruling-gay-marriage-supreme-court</Link>
        <Description/>

His prose may lack the fiery eloquence of his US supreme court colleagues Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia, or the razor-sharp precision of chief justice John Roberts, but the majority opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy  granting a constitutional right to same-sex marriage across the United States  will go down as one of the most important legal documents in the history of the American civil rights struggle.
Related: Gay marriage declared legal across the US in historic supreme court ruling
Court-watchers were left in little doubt where most of the nine justices stood on marriage equality after two and a half hours of extended oral arguments held the hushed halls of the nations highest tribunal spellbound in April .
On one side, the courts traditional liberals: Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were withering in their view of the arguments advanced by Republican-controlled states that wanted to hold back the growing tide of legal rulings that backed gay marriage.
On the other side of the bench were the more reliably conservative members of the supreme court  Scalia, Samuel Alito and the typically silent Clarence Thomas  who believed not just that marriage should remain solely between a man and woman, but that the court had no right to voice its opinion on the matter at all .
More inscrutable, however, were Roberts, who barely said a word throughout the entire hearing, and Kennedy, who seemed genuinely unsure which way to lean: he expressed concern for the consequence of either ruling.
Kennedy, the 78-year-old former lawyer from California appointed to the bench by Republican president Ronald Reagan a generation ago, is seen  in theory  as one of the conservative majority. But in practice, he has long been the most enigmatic of the swing voters on some of the most defining stories in American history.
On Thursday, he had joined Roberts in defending Barack Obamas healthcare reforms from yet another legal onslaught by conservative critics.
But on Friday, the day same-sex marriage became the law of the land, Roberts had decided to stay firmly in the conservative camp.
And so Kennedy became the one man to effectively determine a decision that will directly affect millions of Americans in love  and redefine a core legal and social bedrock for all of them, perhaps forever.

For a while, it looked as if the swing voters might have coalesced around a compromise on marriage equality, forcing all states to recognise same-sex marriages carried out elsewhere but still shying away from forcing them to carry it out themselves against the wishes of their voters.
This democratic challenge was of particular concern to Roberts, who was the swing vote in earlier judgments that upheld gay rights, but is known to be wary of polarizing the courts reputation by appearing to override state autonomy.
Campaigners were hopeful that Kennedy might prove bolder, particularly after his earlier support for gay rights in cases that longtime observers of the court believed would build up to the moment they had been waiting to arrive for so long.
He did.

Kennedys first flick in the direction of LGBT rights came in the 1996 case of Romer v Evans, when he authored a ruling striking down a constitutional amendment in the state of Colorado that barred efforts by local governments to discriminate against gay and lesbian people. The amendment, Kennedy wrote at the time, classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else.
He went on to author the opinion in a 2003 ruling that invalidated an anti-sodomy law in Texas, in which Kennedy argued that intimate relationships between gay couples involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.
It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons, Kennedy wrote. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.
Two years ago, Kennedys evolution in support of gay rights seemed all but final with the landmark United States v Windsor case that struck down key components of the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) and was viewed as the forerunner to legal same-sex marriage nationwide.
The federal governments refusal to afford same-sex couples the same benefits offered to heterosexual couples tells those couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy, Kennedy wrote. And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.
But where Kennedy might ultimately settle down this time  for the big one  remained a mystery until shortly after 10am on Friday, when the court surprised everyone by pulling its biggest decision of the decade out of the hat three days earlier than expected.
A powerful re-affirmation of dignity
Related: Americans face being 'labeled as bigots' over gay marriage ruling, justice warns
Any hope that Roberts might have had of preserving court unity was lost when four boxes of judgments materialised on Friday morning  one for the majority opinion written by Kennedy and the four liberals, and the others for an unprecedented four separate dissents from the conservative wing of the bench.
They may have differed in their precise reasons for opposing the decision, but these dissents, including a blunt warning from Roberts, were unusually withering.
Key parts of the majority opinion contained little more than the mystical aphorism of the fortune cookie, fumed Scalia.
But Kennedy was undeterred, drawing on repeated examples of the courts previous evolution on the subjects of marriage and civil rights to argue that it was time for the court to come down from off the fence on perhaps the last big outstanding civil rights question of the modern age.
Despite the dynamite conclusion of the long marriage equality fight at the supreme court, it was a dry legal argument that conveyed the news.
The closest Kennedy came to capturing the emotion felt by campaigners and protesters on both sides of the argument was when he was describing the institution at the heart of the argument.
No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family, he wrote. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were.
Those who know the court best are in little doubt as to the significance of Kennedys words.
It may be the most consequential decision by the Court in a generation or more, said former US solicitor general Neal Katyal. The Court powerfully reaffirmed the equal dignity of all to marry today; and this is a decision that will be read hundreds of years from now.
Roberta Kaplan, the attorney who successfully argued the Doma case, told the Guardian: I cant imagine this being a better decision.
It also capped an avalanche of legal and cultural change on an issue that has in recent years caught even the fiercest proponents of same-sex equality by surprise.
Todays decision acknowledging the right of same-sex couples to marry is the culmination of decades of litigation and the fastest shift in public opinion in American history, said Nicole Pearl, a Los Angeles lawyer who specialists in estate and tax planning for gay, lesbian and unmarried couples.
But on a day when a funeral for victims of the Charleston church shootings cast a long shadow over the ongoing battle for racial equality, the decision was a source of hope for many.
America should be very proud, said Barack Obama in an emotional statement from the White House rose garden.
Theres so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American, he added. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that weve made our union a little more perfect.

        <title>Tunisia: murder of holidaymakers in Sousse could kill tourism and hope</title>
        <Link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/tunisia-attack-terrorism-tourism</Link>

The slaughter of sunbathers and hotel staff on the beaches of a country that has always prided itself as a carefree, laid-back destination for package holidaymakers has dealt a huge blow to Tunisia.
The small north African country lit the first spark of the Arab spring four years ago, when its popular uprising toppled a corrupt dictatorship relatively peacefully. It is often looked to as the hope of the region. Unlike its troubled neighbours, it has managed to keep its political transition on course  crafting a new constitution, staging free presidential and parliamentary elections.
But with a struggling post-revolution economy that depends in large part on its beach resorts and foreign visitors, it was already facing the serious ongoing challenges of how to tackle unemployment, social unrest and strikes, and how to address the feeling among the poorest and the young that their demands, which inspired the revolution  the need for social justice, jobs and the fight to end corruption  are yet to be fully achieved.
In recent months, Tunisia was already grappling with a growing jihadi problem. Thousands of its young men  more than any other Arab country  have gone to fight in Syria, and porous borders with Libya and Algeria have raised the stakes. Yet the Sousse attack seems to cement a troubling new pattern.
Before this spring, the jihadi threa was aimed mostly at Tunisian security forces. But the March terrorist attack on the Bardo National Museum in Tunis that killed 21 foreign tourists and a policeman and now the Sousse beach massacre suggest a new focus on soft targets. The negative impact on the countrys image and economy is potentially highly damaging.
I think the effect of this will be even more serious than the effect of the Bardo attack in March, said Monica Marks, a North Africa analyst based in Tunis. Not all tourists who come to Tunisia want to visit the Bardo museum: a lot more  particularly the German and British  are Vitamin D tourists who want to spend time on the beach.
Sousse has the most package tourism of any other Tunisian resort on the coast, she added. Images of tourists dead across sunloungers will have a considerable effect. Tourism accounted for around 14.5% of Tunisian GDP last year. This will have considerable repercussions for the Tunisian economy. It also will also affect investor confidence.
Marks said that the attack on this scale could spark a loss of confidence in the government and dent its authority.
The government response will be crucial, particularly in a country where the balance between security measures and human rights is both delicate and important.
In December, a new parliament was elected. The president Beji Caid Essebsi is an 88-year-old secularist who served as a senior official in Tunisias previous regimes. His ruling secular party Nidaa Tounes governs in a coalition that includes the small presence of Ennahda, the moderate Islamist movement that won the first post-uprising election and has done much to make Tunisias transition a relative success.
After the Bardo attack, the immediate reaction of Essebsi was to spearhead new anti-terror laws and promise a crackdown. The tough new legislation has not yet been passed, politicians have argued over it and lawyers and human rights groups have raised concerns about freedom of speech and civil liberties, arbitrary arrests, detention and police harassment.
The balance between security and human rights is a delicate issue in a country that, under the authoritarian Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was a notoriously brutal police state. Tunisias post-revolution Truth and Dignity Commission is currently attempting to deal with the harrowing accounts that stem from the countrys recent history. The issue of torture, even after the revolution, has not yet been fully dealt with. This commitment to deal with the past is vital and Tunisia is unlikely to slide back to the days of Ben Alis oppressive state. But lawyers and rights groups are pushing to keep that balance between security and rights.
Tunisia prides itself on its continuing resilience in the face of its post-revolution challenges, including political assassinations and the jihadi threat. The Sousse attack is one of its biggest challenges yet.

In the past 10 days, there have been two demonstrations in Athens in support of Greeces continued membership of the euro and one to urge prime minister Alexis Tsipras and finance minister Yannis Varoufakis not to make concessions in their negotiations with its creditors. Quite a few people have been to all three.
This seemingly contradictory approach echoes Syrizas rhetoric: one of its campaign slogans was We will change Europe . But it also reflects public opinion.
The findings for Greece of the latest Eurobarometer survey are paradoxical. Asked What does the EU mean to you personally? the euro was the second most popular choice, behind freedom to travel, study and work anywhere in the EU  and, tellingly, just ahead of unemployment.

Yet when asked about their attitude to the EU itself, 76% of Greeks said they mistrusted it. It was the highest level of mistrust detected in any of the EUs 28 member states.
Greece, in other words, is a country in which people are generally keen on the single currency, but in which a substantial majority has grave doubts about the economic and political partnership that gave rise to it. Not to mention the institutions charged with overseeing it.
More Greeks mistrusted the European commission than in any other country  72% (compared with a modest 47% in Britain). And the same was true of the ECB.
All this represents a drastic turnaround. Twenty years ago, we didnt ask questions about Europe, recalls Kostas Panagopoulos of Alco Polls. We didnt think it was necessary.
As in the other countries of southern Europe that had experienced the trauma of dictatorship, the EU was a dream no one dared to question  a heaven of peace and prosperity and, perhaps most importantly, an assurance that the transition to democracy could never be reversed. For Greece, the EU also offered something else: the promise of protection against Turkey.
Once you were in, moreover, you would be showered with funds to ensure your economy was brought up to scratch. What on earth was there not to like?
If Europe was axiomatically good, it followed that the euro had to be better, holding out the hope, not just of tighter integration with the EU core, but of the lower interest rates southern European countries had been unable to manage on their own. A heaven within heaven.
In Greece, there was a problem of understanding; that staying in the euro also brought with it a series of obligations, says Eleni Panagiotarea, author of Greece and the Euro and a research fellow of the thinktank Eliamep. That did not filter down to the people.
Panagiotarea blames the politicians for not being frank. The same could be said of their peers throughout southern Europe: they told voters they would have to make sacrifices to get into the single currency, but not that they would have to accept radical changes to their economy  and their society  if they were to compete effectively once inside.
Now that this uncomfortable truth is dawning, there is a clear danger that Greeks will react with all the fury of a spurned lover. Panagopoulos says that between a poll his firm took a month ago and one two weeks later, support for Grexit leapt by 10 percentage points.
We still have a big majority in favour of staying in the eurozone. But we now have even members of the government saying Grexit would not be a catastrophe  and we also have a lot of reasons to be disappointed. Im afraid that, for a lot of people in Greece, Europe is becoming the enemy.

The former US treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, says she has a lightning-quick wit, a genuine warmth and an ability to bridge divides. Alastair Darling, the former British chancellor, also something of a fan, describes her as a formidable operator with an unorthodox approach who can cajole people into agreement and exercises immense influence.

She will need all of that. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund and  says Forbes magazine  the worlds sixth most powerful woman, is in a delicate position as Greeces latest repayment deadline looms and the country seeks a last-ditch deal with its creditors to stave off bankruptcy and exit from the eurozone.
The Washington-based IMF has ideological objections to Greeces current proposals, which rely mainly on tax increases to boost revenue rather than on spending cuts, arguing that the countrys tortured economy is already too heavily taxed and further hikes will harm growth. Nor does it feel Athens broader plans to revive the economy go nearly far enough.
But the organisation is also unhappy with the reluctance of Greeces other, European creditors  its eurozone partners and the European Central Bank  to come up with any concrete proposals on debt relief. The debt total now amounts to about 175% of Greek GDP and the IMF has long felt that without at least some long-term relief  writing off a proportion of the debt  Greeces borrowing is unsustainable.
The short-term future of Greece  and the integrity of the eurozone  may depend on how far Lagarde, a cool, always elegant 59-year-old Frenchwoman, manages to exercise influence, get people talking and bridge divides not only between the leftist Syriza-led Greek government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras and its creditors, but also among the lenders themselves.
Lagarde has, though, another imperative. Her term comes to an end next year and whether she decides to seek re-election or return to national politics - she was French finance minister before replacing the disgraced Dominique Strauss-Kahn as IMF chief - she will not want a failed entanglement with Greece on her CV .
It was Strauss-Kahn who first committed the IMF to Greece in 2010, after eurozone governments approached the organisation for help in devising a bailout. The funds continued European engagement  including its decision to replace much of Greeces private-sector borrowing with IMF money in 2012  has been controversial, particularly in developing countries.
Lagarde is not afraid to bang heads. She observed caustically last week that the long drawn out, on-off aid-for-reforms talks would benefit from the presence of some adults in the room . With Tsipras, however, determined not to backtrack on his anti-austerity election promises and eurozone governments insistent on getting their money back and averting the breakup of the single currency, she will need all the talents her former colleagues ascribe to her.
Born in Paris in January 1956, Lagardes parents were both academics. Her father, Robert Lallouette, was a professor of English and her mother, Nicole, a Latin teacher. She famously represented France at synchronised swimming as a teenager, a sport she has said endowed her with the useful political skill of knowing how to grit your teeth and smile.
After her baccalaureate and following the death of her father, she spent a year in the US aged 17, studying at a Maryland high school and spending time in Washington as a political intern on Capitol Hill. Back in France, she took degrees in English, labour law and social law at the university of Nanterre, and later a masters in political science in Aix, before returning to the US in 1981 to work for the international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie.
Starting out as an associate specialising in labour, anti-trust and mergers and acquisitions, Lagarde moved through the ranks to become a partner after six years and eventually head of the firm in western Europe . In 1999, she was elected its first woman chairman before being summoned back to France in 2005 by then-president Jacques Chirac to take up her first government post as junior minister for foreign trade.
By 2007 she was finance minister, the first woman to hold the post not just in France, but in any of the G8 countries. The Financial Times rated her Europes best finance minister in 2009 and a series of cool, commanding performances at forums such as the G20 raised her international profile further. She took over from Strauss-Kahn at the IMF in July 2011.
A convinced vegetarian and a gym, swimming and cycling enthusiast who rarely, if ever, touches alcohol, Lagarde is divorced, with two sons now in their early 30s. Since 2006, she has lived with a Marseille businessman. Her English is as immaculate as her tailored suits (she favours Chanel).
Although widely admired by her colleagues  Kenneth Rogoff, the IMFs former chief economist, describes her as enormously impressive, politically astute and a strong personality  she has not escaped controversy. A comment to the Guardian in 2012 appearing to confirm that she felt payback time had come for Greece sparked outrage in Athens.
She also remains under the cloud of an investigation for negligence over her role as finance minister in taking a long-running damages case brought against the state by businessman Bernard Tapie out of the courts and to an arbitration panel . Tapie was subsequently awarded more than 200m in damages. Her Paris apartment was searched in 2013 and she was questioned for two days over the affair, but has consistently denied any misconduct. There is no suggestion of personal profit.
By turns business-like and ineffably charming, straight-talking and surprisingly funny, Lagardes unusual mix of Gallic charm and Anglo-Saxon effectiveness is undoubtedly better appreciated in international circles than in France. The next few days could make or break her reputation.

Terror attacks in Kuwait, France and Tunisia echo Isis methods
The targets - Shia Muslims, French workers and western tourists in Tunisia - as well as the alleged culprits all share similarities with past attacks

Three different attacks, one overall suspect. The wave of killing on Friday will undoubtedly be attributed to Islamic State , which has already reportedly claimed responsibility for one amongst them, with strong indications of a role in the others.
Each attack hit a different target in a different way, and underlines the varied nature of a constantly evolving threat.
One involved Muslims killing Muslims in the Middle East itself: a bomb in a Shia mosque in Kuwait , a conservative Gulf state with a Sunni Muslim majority. This is part of the horrendous sectarian violence which has increasingly convulsed the region over the last five years and shows no sign of abating.
Outright war against Shias  seen as apostates by Islamic State  is a core aim of the terrorist organisation which goes back to its origins in Iraq a decade or more ago. This is a reminder that the vast proportion of casualties of terrorism are Muslims killed by co-religionists.
The second targeted western tourists in Tunisia . Hotels and holidaymakers have been a frequent target in recent years. Western tourists are both an obvious and vulnerable presence in the Islamic world. An attack on a hotel will attract global attention, mark a groups influence and badly damage the local tourist industry.
Historically such attacks have undermined local support but it seems unlikely Fridays attackers would have been bothered by this. The prime suspects for the Sousse attack are militants belonging to fragmented local groups, possibly based in neighbouring Libya and loyal to Isis.
Third was the attack on a US-owned gas cylinder plant in south-east France . The culprit in this strike appears to have worked for the victims company, but the French have nevertheless launched a terror investigation. He also appears to fit a profile that has become well established in recent years: a French male aged between 22 and 35 who was either born overseas before coming to France or whose parents migrated from Algeria or Morocco.
Some of these attackers have had links to overseas groups; while others have been closer to the classic idea of lone wolves. But all have been steeped in a broader environment of violent activism, extreme conservatism, homophobia and anti-semitism for many years before they acted.
They are lone actors only in terms of the actual organisation and execution of a terrorist attack; their world view is shared by a significant number of people.
An increasing number have either been inspired by, or actually fought for, Islamic State. When propagandists of the group tell individuals their duty is to take up arms in European countries  especially against the filthy French  they know already how receptive some will be to their call to arms .
The three strikes came almost exactly on the first anniversary of Islamic States declaration of its caliphate, and it is possible they were coordinated. If so, it would indicate a new level of strategic thinking and capability for Isis. If not, they nevertheless send a potent message: terrorists hope to to give the impression that they can strike at will, everywhere, anywhere.
This is clearly not the case: the attack in Europe involved one man; the one in Tunis, a gunman or two. We are still far from the mass casualty attacks of 10 or 12 years ago in Europe. We are also far from the doomsday scenario of highly trained Isis militants making their way to the UK, US or wherever to execute major operations.
But the sense of ubiquitous menace inevitably induced by Fridays killings will be difficult to dispel.

To misquote the first man on the moon: the EUs new migration agreement is one small step forwards for European bureaucrats, and one giant leap sideways for mankind.
On the plus side, the decision by the majority of EU members to accept 40,000 asylum seekers currently in Italy and Greece is at least a start. With nationalism and xenophobia on the rise throughout Europe, the argument goes, the continents leaders were still brave enough to share at least a fraction of the Italian and Greek burden.
Related: Mediterranean migrants: EU leaders agree voluntary intake after heated talks
The agreement to welcome 20,000 Syrians and Eritreans who still lie beyond Europes borders is also seen as an important gesture. Resettlement has not hitherto been seen as a major role of the EU. But this move, amid the biggest global refugee crisis since the second world war, is a tiny admission that it might have to become one.
But beyond the world of EU tokenism, the two decisions are next to meaningless. The redistribution scheme is voluntary  the UK has already said it will not take part  and therefore it is unclear how it would function in practice. It could work if there is goodwill behind it, but you have to wonder whether it will work, said Cathryn Costello, an expert on refugee law at Oxford Universitys Refugee Studies Centre . There are already comparable systems that dont work even though they are legally binding, she said.
More worryingly still, the 40,000 asylum seekers due to be shared throughout Europe form only a small proportion of the 250,000 migrants likely to land in Greece and Italy this year. Thousands more will continue to arrive in Bulgaria and Hungary , two other EU states that are on the frontline of the migration crisis but which will not be covered by the scheme. So even if all 40,000 asylum seekers are successfully redistributed, the four countries at the EUs border will continue to bear the brunt of what is essentially a European crisis.
Most significantly, the tiny number of refugees due to be resettled from outside the EU  20,000  will do nothing to curb the death toll in the Mediterranean. Time and again, refugees planning to make the voyage across the sea argue that despite the risks the Mediterranean is a more likely route to safety than the legal routes available to them. So few places are on offer to the four million Syrian refugees eligible for asylum from outside Europe (the UK has taken 187 so far) that the sea seems a more logical option.
Of course Im scared, but I dont have any choice but this one, said Houthayfa, a 21-year-old Syrian cook who plans to go by sea from Egypt in the coming months. Its like everything is closed in your face, so theres nothing else but the sea. Theres nothing but the sea as a way to get out.
The UN gave a cautious welcome to the EU initiative but also stressed that the numbers were a drop in the ocean compared with what was required. These are baby steps, said Franois Crpeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. One has to understand that 20,000 refugees taken by 28 countries is only one-tenth of the number of asylum seekers who arrived in Italy last year. This is a very, very small step forward.
Its a very small number. As the special representative of the secretary general of the UN Peter Sutherland said, I trust that the numbers will go up.
Crepeau has argued that in order to quell demand for migrant smuggling by sea, western countries need to make a credible commitment to welcoming as many as one million Syrian refugees , rather than a paltry 20,000.
To many, the size of this figure sounds fanciful. But spread among Europes total population of 740 million, it does not seem so large. And it seems tiny when compared with the burden the refugee crisis has already placed on Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon and Jordan. According to UN figures, the former houses a record 232 refugees per 1,000 residents , while the latter, in second place, has 87 per 1,000. Sweden, the most refugee-heavy country in Europe, has 15 per 1,000.
Such a grand resettlement programme has been achieved before. After the Vietnam war, more than 1.3 million refugees from Indochina were resettled in Europe, north America and other parts of the northern hemisphere. To begin to match those numbers would be a giant step forward, but it would not be an unprecedented one.
