China could be on the brink of a financial crisis (Picture: Reuters)
While all eyes remain on Greece, it looks like China could be on the brink of its own financial crisis.
Chinese markets have lost an estimated $3.25 (2.12) trillion since June  a loss 12 times the size of the entire Greek economy.
As well as having more than $3 (1.96) trillion wiped off the stock market shares have plummeted by 30percent, which is the steepest downward fall since the global crisis in 2008.
The Shanghai index was down 5.9 per cent when trading closed on Wednesday  with almost half of the market frozen.
Emergency measures have been taken by the Peoples Bank of China and the government; including allowing insurance companies to invest more assets in stocks and another programme to buy the shares of smaller companies.

Comic-Con is seen by many as a chance to dress up as their favourite fictional character and let their inner geek run wild.
Unfortunately it is also seen by some as a chance to leer at those whose chosen character is scantily clad.
Now a petition calling for changes to the San Diego Comic-Con , which kicks off this Thursday, has been started, and it already has more than 3,000 signatures.
It follows the Geeks for Consent movement, which was started by women who claim they have been harassed at convention events due to the way they dress.

Testimonies from women at events say they not only have to deal with lurid comments and inappropriate photographs, but also physical harassment from convention goers.
Some people have even been caught using subtle Go-Pro cameras to shoot candid footage of women at the events.

She said: There has been escalating tension within the convention going community regarding the physical and emotional safety of cosplayers.
This, and the continued discussion within my circle of cosplay friends has pushed my plans forward, and I now present to you the beginnings of my photo essay, inspired by #IneedFeminismBecause; CONsent: The Importance of Treating Cosplayers with Respect.

145 militants sat down for the iftar (Picture: Twitter)
At least 45 Isis militants have allegedlybeen killed after eating a poisoned meal.
According to reports, around 145 people sat down to eatthe iftar  the meal which breaks the daily Ramadan fast  in Mosul, Iraq.
But only 100 walked away alive. It issuggested that the food was poisoned, although it is not yet known if it wasdeliberate or accidental.
Haaretz reports that it is possible their food was targeted. In November, soldiers in the Free Syrian Army allegedly made their way into an Isis camp posing as chefs and poisoned their lunches, killing at least 10.

Those images were shared by anti-Islamic State activists Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently.

Tracy Barrell was awarded an Order of Australia medal for her athletic achievements (Picture: Facebook)
An Australian Paralympian with one arm and no legs was told she was not eligible for a disability discount card because she could ride a skateboard.
Two-time gold medal winner Tracy Barrell was awarded an Order of Australia medal for her achievementsat the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics, and has dedicated her life to campaigning for disabled and indigenous rights in her home country since retiring from swimming.
When it came to applying for a New South Wales Companion Card  which allows highly-disabled people to bring an escort to certain ticketed events for free  she had less success.

She was told last Friday that she was not disabled enough on the grounds she had proscribed aids, including a skateboard, wheelchair and modified car.
I was devastated, I actually cried for the whole day because I just felt lost as a person, she told SMH .
I wasbeing penalised for being able in certain parts of my life and living in a fully modified home but as soon as I step outside my home I need people to assist me.

A Change.org petition quickly racked up thousands of signatures, and Barrell was received a phone call from National Disability Services suggesting she appeal the decision.
She was finally granted the Companion Card after providing further information to an NDS spokesman, who called the selection criteria very strict.
Its not about whether you have a disability or not;its about whether you cannot leave your home on your own, even to go up to the shops, he said.

Remove all food from sight. The gross warning that comes with this video is mega.
Phone footage appears to show the moment a baby rat was pulled from a young persons belly button.
But opinion is divided over the authenticity of the disgusting video.
It shows a man poking around in a childs bellybutton before appearing to grab something.
A small amount of blood appears before he tugs the rodent from his stomach  which falls apart in his hand.
A liquid, possibly holy water, is seen being poured into the opening as the rat emerges from the bellybutton, tail-first, pulled out by the hands of the man.
In the background a person can be heard praying in Portuguese which is apparently being spoken with a Brazilian accent, leading many to suggest that the bizarre video was shot in South America.
It was posted online and many have branded it as fake.

        <Description>What wonderful characters you get to spend time with in a giant metal tube...</Description>
        <MainBody>Oliver Wheaton for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 8 Jul 2015 2:16 pm
Ryanair has recently announced a massive sale to celebrate 30 years of horrifying flight experiences.
Of course, the big sale isnt going to well (mostly because the only cheap flights are to places you would never want to go to anyway), but that hasnt stopped people buying up the tickets like crazy.
If you are one of them, let us take this opportunity to remind you who you will be stuck with in a metal tube for several hours.
The stag do
STAG STAG STAG! (Picture:Simon Rawles/REX Shutterstock)
A group of lads who havent quite figured out who the alpha male is yet  so they are all having a go at it.
Expect loud laughter (over-compensating for a lack of personality), loud singing (over-compensating for a lack of originality), heavy drinking, aggressively flirting with the stewardess and finally vomiting in the aisle.
The hen do
Guess which one the bride is? (Picture:Steve Black/REX Shutterstock)
Half of them will be wearing pink cowboy hats and sipping on poorly concealed Lambrini, the other half will be trying to read Cosmo and generally looking like they are hating life.
You might not hear them, but you will definitely feel their selfie sticks smacking you over the head as they try and get the perfect #WildWeekend photo.
The nervous family
No mummy, please dont make me get back on that plane! (Picture:Mint Images/REX Shutterstock)
Budget airlines are no place for a family, unless you want your children to have Vietnam flashbacks for the duration of the holiday.
The parents will try in vain to protect their little ones by puttingFrozen on the iPad and giving them headphones, but the drunk dude running naked down the aisle cannot be unseen by such young eyes.
The Scared old couple
Yet another war we have been forced to live through(Picture: alamy)
They will be wearing suits and carrying a copy of the Times. Why didnt anyone tell them how air travel has changed?
Get ready for some serious finger wagging directed at the stag dos. Speaking of which
Another stag do
We are definitely the most fabulous stag do (Picture:imageBROKER/REX Shutterstock)
Seriously? And now theyve seen each other they obviously want to fight  theyre like a pack of slightly less intelligent monkeys.
Oh god, now they are both trying to outdo each other with they terrible renditions of Three Lions on the Shirt.
This is why the rest of Europe hates us so much.
The angry business man
What do you mean you deserve business class? (Picture:Caiaimage/REX Shutterstock)
He missed his British Airways flight and now has to slum it with the commoners.
Good luck getting your laptop out and doing any work pal  your office this aint.
After a few hours of begging the stag lads to shut up he will give in and start hitting on the hen do gals (after subtly removing his wedding ring, of course).
The honey moon couple
they will holding hands on the plane as well, but out of fear (Picture:Image Source/REX Shutterstock)
Not the best way to start your life together.
They will tell everyone who will listen about their wedding and ask for an upgrade to businessclassbecause were newly weds.
Sadly the airline staff are more concerned about the people having sex in the toilets than your wedding rings, guys.
The unfortunateperson who is just trying to read
Just one more page, please! (Picture:Burger/Phanie/REX Shutterstock)
No TV, no legroom, and no food  but at least flying with Ryanair can give you a chance to kick back and finally finish that book you started two years ago.
Of course unless you have noise cancelling headphones and a super-human ability to ignore the drunk guy trying to tell you how great Magaluf is, you wont be reading anything.
You often spot this poor soul trying tokeep hermind intact by placing hernose firmly in a book, but its a wasted cause  she should just accept her fate and try to enjoy the stag lads football chants.
The air steward with the patience of a saint
Give her a medal (Picture:Photofusion/REX Shutterstock)
Whatever these people get paid, it isnt enough.
Their job now includes the role of babysitter, security guard, vomit cleaner, crowd controller and photographer  and they manage to do it all with a smile on their face.
We cant say for sure, but we like to imagine they are given PTSD treatment after each flight.

Laughing gas is much stronger than we previously thought
It turns out that laughing gas is much stronger than we thought.
Scientists at MIT found that laughing gas  chemical name nitrous oxide  controls the brain in a way no other drug does.
Electroencephalogram recordings found brings about a chain reaction of electrical firing that sweeps across the front of the brain once every 10 seconds.
While the wavefrequency is the same you might see in the brain of someone in deep sleep, the waves themselves are larger and more powerful.

What does this mean?
Nitrous oxide tends to be used at the tail end of surgery to keep a patient unconscious while stronger anaesthetics leave their system.
However, if thepowerful slow waves produced by nitrous oxide could be maintained for longer than a few minutes, it would make a super-potent anaesthetic from which a patient could wake up without any lingering grogginess.
We literally watched it and marvelled, because it was totally unexpected, Emery Brown, a professor of medical engineering at MIT, said.
Nitrous oxide has control over the brain in ways no other drug does.
The news follows the death of 22-year-old Aaron Dunford, a student from Brighton University whosuffocated after inhaling too much nitrous oxide.
His repeated use of laughing gas had given him chronic pain, his doctors said.

Alton Towers crash victim Joe Pugh said he willnever go on a roller coaster again.
The 18-year-old was left with life-changing injuries after both his kneecaps were shattered when two carriages on the Smilercollided.
Two of his fingers were broken and he will never regain the use of one, although surgeons were able to reattach the digit.
Mr Pugh was on a date with his girlfriend Leah Washington, 17, who had to have her leg amputated along with one other victim following the crash.
He told ITVs This Morning that she is fine and doesnt blame the theme park for what happened.

He said he had his eyes closed as they went round the ride and suddenly felt a bang.
Leah Washington and Joe Pugh have had their first date since the accident recently
The teenager said: I opened my eyes and saw blood and knees splattered onto the carriage in front.
My finger was cut open and I could see bone and the other finger was in half, I could have pulled it off.

Goodell met with Viviana at a friends house before going for a drive together, at which point he strangled her to death.
Hoping to hide his crime, he placed her lifeless body in the front seat of a carand adorned her with sunglasses and a hat.
He then slit his own wrists and, upon being noticed by the police, rammed the car containing Vivianas body into a van.
Despitetelling the police that Viviana had died in the car crash, the officers quickly saw through his lie.
Goodellwas jailed for 45 years  laughing as he was sentenced.
Stella has now started campaigning for stricter security in halfway houses  where Goodell was staying when he committed the murder.
If I can spare another family the same heartache, then at least my little sisters death will not have been in vain, she said.

First, a woman struggles with a clunky suitcase up some stairs in Shepherds Bush. When a man helps, hes greeted by a flashmob who sing for him and celebrate his gesture.
Would you wake this person up, or leave it to someone else? (Picture: YouTube)
Elsewhere, on a train, a man pretending to sleep has a sign on his lap reading: Wake me up at Clapham Junction. Ta :)
And sure enough, hes woken up by a Londoner.

Is it time to relax Sunday trading laws? Tesco, Sainsburys and Waitrose dont think so,surprisingly
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 8 Jul 2015 8:47 am
Shops could open for longer on Sundays under George Osbornes plans to relax trading laws.
Its a move youd expect supermarket giants to welcome with open arms.
But in a twist,Tesco, Sainsburys and Waitrose are all rallying against the change.
Thats because, according to insiders, it would mean fewer people heading to their smaller convenience stores where prices are higher.
However, Asda, Morrisons, Lidl, Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are among the chains which agree with the new change in law.
Tesco is against the change, but has declined to comment (Picture: PA)
The law
Supermarkets have taken advantage of the current laws which state that stores less than3,000 sq ft can open for longer on a Sunday.
This is why weve seen so many convenient stores spring up in recent years.

The move, mooted by the Chancellor, would give stores the opportunity to extend their opening hours for more than six hours on a Sunday.
The Chancellorpointed to research by the New West End Company which found two extra hours in the capital alone would create nearly 3,000 jobs and generatemore than200million a year in additional sales.
Mr Osborne said online shopping trends suggested there was a growing appetite for Sunday trading in high streets and retail parks, and a trial of longer hours during the London Olympics had proved a success.
But the move was condemned by the Association of Convenience Stores, which said it would force small shops out of business, had seen overall sales fall 0.4 per cent during the Games and was unpopular with the public.
It said a poll in February found 76 per cent of the public supported the existing rules with 60 per cent of those wanting change actually preferring stricter, rather than looser, restrictions.

Scientists have invented a condom that feels like human skin  and they need your help to make itsexy
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 8 Jul 2015 8:01 am

Scientists have created a condom that feels like human skin  but they need our help to make it sexy.
Earlier this year Australian researchers announced the super-sensitive contraception , created using hydrogel.
And the sexperts say it feels good.
Now theyre calling on us to come up with marketing ideas. They want to know how the condoms shouldbepackaged and branded.
The best idea will win an AUD$3,500 cash prize, with runners-up receiving AUD$1,500.
Im sure theres some free condoms in the deal too.
Operation Condom: The Grand Challenge
Condoms have been in use for about 400 years yet they have undergone very little technological improvement in the past 50 years.
Is it possible to develop a condom without stigma, or better? One that is felt to enhance pleasure?
If so, would such a product lead to substantial benefits for global health, both in terms of reducing the incidence of unplanned pregnancies and in prevention of infection with HIV or other STIs?
 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
The competition has been announced by Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, who received a US $100,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who promised 80 grants to anyone who could invent the next generation condom.
The Foundation has pledged further follow-up grants of up to US $1m to help develop, market and distribute the revolutionary new product.
Bridgette Engeler Newbury, a design and business expert at Swinburne, said: There are still parts of the world that are not purchasing and using condoms for many different reasons. It would be great if the packaging and branding tackled this issue.
Industrial designer Gianni Renda added: We are undertaking research into existing condom packaging and branding and we hope this competition will help further our knowledge.
The competition closes at the end of this month.
The genesis of Geldom
Universal access to reproductive and sexual health is one of the great challenges and human rights issues of the 21st century, say Swinburne University.
The lack of condom use, partially due to stigmas around a decrease in sensation, affects the health and well-being of many people in developing countries today.
We received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to realise a Next Generation Condom made of new tough hydrogel materials, in order to improve feeling and increase regular use.
The challenge of moving from having to wear a condom to wanting to use one goes well beyond materials development.
Our project has expanded to include engagement with key communities to identify barriers to condom acceptance and to collaboratively design novel solutions.

David Miller was murdered along with Hannah Witheridge (Picture: Enterprise News And Pictures)
The bodies of two British backpackers murdered on a beach in Thailand were found partially naked near blood spattered rocks, a Thai court has heard.
Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, were killed on the island of Koh Tao last September.
Their families have travelled to the nearby island of Koh Samui where Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, also known as Win Zaw Htun, stand charged with murder and rape.
The first policeman on the scene described getting a call at 6.30am that morning informing him that two bodies had been found on the beach.
I found a mans body lying on the beach with seawater lapping his body, said Lieutenant Jakrapan Kaewkao, a witness for the prosecution.
Then I found the womans body behind the rocks.

He added that the bodies, both of which were mostly unclothed, were several yards apart and said Ms Witheridges bore signs of physical assault.
He also said the rocks were spotted with blood.
A doctor who examined the bodies of the two Britons is expected to be called later.
The investigation into the deaths has been marred by confusion and allegations of police incompetence.
The defendants are said to have confessed under pressure from local police shortly after the killings but have since retracted those statements.

In statements issued today before the trial began members of both victims families spoke of the pain the deaths had caused.
Mr Millers family said: The act which ended Davids life devastated our family and his friends.
Just hours before he died David was talking to us with his usual enthusiasm, describing the beauty of Koh Tao and the friendliness of the Thai people.
Over the coming weeks we hope to gain a better understanding as to how such a wonderful young man lost his life in such idyllic surroundings in such a horrible way.
This pain will remain a part of us for the rest of our lives. We have borne our thoughts in silence as we have not wanted to influence any court proceedings, but simply want to see justice done fairly and openly.
Ms Witheridges family said they were united in grief with Mr Millers loved ones.
They said: Hannah was a beautiful person, inside and out, she brought a room alive just being there.
She was fun, honest and loved life.
Her bright future was brutally ended leaving those who loved her broken with no answers.Speculation, rumour and theory have been incredibly hurtful to our family and Hannahs friends, making an already unthinkable time harder to bear.
We of course want to see those responsible for the brutal murder of our precious girl brought to justice.
Verdicts in the case are not expected until October.

I ran upstairs trying to help save another lady that was still in there, he wrote on Facebook.
Officials said a dad-of-three was killed and five people were injured in the fire, which took hold at around 1.45am.
Thomas was on his way home when he spotted the blaze on Nostrand Avenue. He helped drag a mattress under a window so people could jump to safety from the third-floor.
After learning about the casualty, Thomas wrote on Facebook: Im really upset at myself. I felt helpless.
Local councilman Jumaane Williams praised the boy: His heroic actions quite possibly saved lives.
The fire department managed to bring the fire under control at about 2.30am, but the cause is still unconfirmed.

Its one of the harshest and most barren places on Earth.
But that hasnt stopped a group of ambitious architects come up with a plan for a skyscraper in the middle of the Sahara desert.
Its the brainchild of architect firm OXO, who claim that the project will promote sustainability and will be run using renewable energy including rainwater, solar power, and geothermal energy.
(Picture: Reuters/YouTube)
The majority of the building will be formed out of offices and hotels  while the remainder of the tower will feature a museum, spa, bar and restaurant.
According to plans for the skyscraper, it will collect up to 45,000 cubic metres of rainwater every year, which will then be transformed into steam for the buildings heating systems.
That same rainwater will also be used for toilets, and additional power will come from solar panels.

Call us presumptuous, but if you go to Valencias famous medieval gate, the Serrano Towers, you probably want to see, well, the towers.
Not a fetish film.
Bad luck, then, if you were visiting last week.
Tourists watched with open mouths as a tattooed man with slicked back hair pulled along a gagged, barely-clothed woman in a dog collar in front of the gate. Then the couple started having sex.
The couple were joined by a cameraman, but when officers eventually arrived to break up the porn shoot, the trio had vanished.
A quick in and out, then.

According to police, the girl was told he had to stay out there for a week and would have to meet someone at a fence at specific times to get food.
She was found on Friday, two days into her week-long punishment. She was in the tent during severe storms on Thursday night.

A man has been jailed for two and a half years for having sex on a Florida beach in front of families.
Jose Caballero, 40, and Elissa Alvarez, 21, were convicted in May of two counts of lewd and lascivious behavior.
They were filmedhaving sex on a Manatee County beach last summer in broad daylight. Witnesses testified that a three-year-old girl saw them.
Caballero told jurors that he and Alvarez were not having sex and that witnesses were mistaken. Jurors listened to graphic testimony from witnesses and saw a video of Alvarez moving on top of Caballero in a sexual manner in the middle of the day while others watched.

We are grateful that the state has offered two and a half years, said Ronald Kurpiers, defense attorney for Caballero.
He said Caballero planned to appeal his case. Alvarez, who was recently sentenced to time served, filed an appeal in her case in June.
Prosecutors say they were tougher on Caballero because he previously served eight years for cocaine trafficking. Both must now register as sex offenders.
The couple had faced 15 years in prison.
If you think about 2:30 in the afternoon on a crowded beach. It takes a certain type of person to do that in front of children a few feet away, said Assistant State Attorney Anthony Dafonseca.
Prosecutors said it was important that the community knew what wouldnt be tolerated on public beaches.

When uncertainty cannot be avoided our method prefers to blur detail which generates much more visually pleasing results compared to tearing or repeating, especially when animated, the researchers said in a paper published on Arxiv.
The algorithm tells the computer to compare the depth and colour of each pixel in the two images and use it to generate the in-between image, MIT Technology Review explains.
Of course, the tool is far from perfect, but Google researchers are optimistic that it will have a wide range of applications.

This is Emma Murphy. Shes a 26-year-old mother from Dublin and says she is a victim of domestic abuse.
Shes now posted this heartbreaking  but courageous and important  video on YouTube about her experiences to raise awareness in a bid to help other victims make a stand.
The five-minute clip shows Emma, who has a black eye, talking about how she thought shed met the love of her life only to have it torn apart.
The mum-of-two explains her life was turned upside-down when she says she found out he had been cheating on her.
Later that year, his lover phoned her to say she was pregnant with his child.
Emma took him back, and but she says he did it again and soon after the violence began.
The brave mum said she thought long and hard about making the video (Picture: YouTube)
She opens the video by saying: Im in a relationship with a guy who I thought was the love of my life. He was the love of my life. Loved him with all my heart. Weve had ups and downs. I cherished the ups. I wont missed the downs.
Unfortunately last year I found out he cheated on me with one of his clients. He denied it. She contacted me and told me she as pregnant.
With the stress I went into labour early. My world was turned upside-down.
You think you know somebody. It was such a hard time for me, I loved him so much I gave him another chance and took him back. And he did it again.
She continues: And when I confronted him, he denied it  of course. And when I threw away his phone he punched me in the face. It wasnt the first time. Last year he split my head open.
For the past year and a half Ive been told that Im paranoid, Im nuts, my insecurities will kill me one day. Even up until now he tells me that.
She stresses even once its unacceptable and adds: But to be made to feel that it is acceptable is even worse. Thats mental torture. And no man should do that to any woman.

Roger Critchell, director of operations for Crimestoppers, added: This is something that we have never done before but we believe that broadcasting these fugitives faces right in their back yards will not only encourage the public to speak up but show these individuals that there really is nowhere to hide.
There will be no avoiding the faces on this screen  theyll be broadcast in all the popular expat areas.
I would urge anyone who recognises any of those faces to contact Crimestoppers anonymously.
We dont take personal details and you wont have to give a statement or go to court.
Many of these fugitives are currently living a life of leisure funded by serious crime. They cannot be allowed to hide forever, they must be brought to justice. Do the right thing and help us find them.
Captura, an initiative between Crimestoppers, the NCA and Spanish authorities, is in its ninth year.
Here is a list of the remaining 18 individuals being sought by Operation Captura:

        <MainBody>Nicholas Reilly for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 7 Jul 2015 11:36 am
Sometimes, the internet can combine for the forces of good and the results are a thing of true, heart-warming wonder.
Thats what happened when the mum of 10-year-old Camden Eubank feared that no one was going to attend her sons birthday party, and turned to the internet for help.
Camden suffers from a speech delay known as Apraxia, and sometimes struggles to put words together when hes placed under intense social pressure.

So his mum took to Facebook, and issued an open invitation for a water balloon fight at the family home in Virginia  and the post received more than 5,000 likes.
But the family were stunned on the day of the party when 300 people showed up bearing cake, gifts, and most importantly  water balloons, for Camdens big day.
Hundreds of people turned up to the birthday bash (Picture: WDBJ7/YouTube)
And the youngster also received hundreds of gifts from people around the world who werent able to attend the bash- including concert tickets and a hand written note from Virginias state senator .
Presents came from Brazil, Germany, China, Canada, theres names on there I couldnt even tell you where they are, dad Wayne Eubank explained.

Bill Cosby has admitted buying Quaaludeswith the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with, documents have revealed.
A court deposition obtained by Associated Press revealed that he gave the sedative to at least one woman and other people.
The allegations were brought to light in 2005 bya former Temple University employee who said she had taken the drug from Cosby. Another woman in the case testifies the same.
An extract from the deposition reads: When you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use the Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?
Cosby replied: Yes.
He testified he gave her three half-pills of Benadryl.
Cosby settled that sexual-abuse lawsuit for undisclosed terms in 2006.
The AP had gone to court to compel the release of the documents; Cosbys lawyers had objected on the grounds that it would embarrass their client.
Cosby has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct.
The 77-year-old has never been criminally charged.

A man who planned to fly over a city in a balloon garden chair was forced to bail out after ascending higher than a plane. 
Dan Boria, of Calgary, Canada, misjudged the power of 100 balloons in his failed bid to promote his cleaning company on Sunday.
He had planned to fly over the city and crash a public event at Stampede Park.
But it all went wrong quickly after take-off. Footage shows him ascending much faster than he anticipated and he disappears out of view ten seconds later.

Eventually he was looking down on a plane and decided it was time to bail.
He jumped off and parachuted to safety  but was arrested shortly after his landing.
He spent more than $13,000 on the stunt gone wrong.
The winds were pretty fierce up there, no doubtthe winds were so strong, it pushed me back, Boria told the Calgary Sun.
I jumped out of the chair and landed about a mile away the grounds.
I cant specify the altitude I went toI was looking down at a 747, it was a surreal experience.

The tram derailed after an earlier incident (Picture: Alamy)
A tram was derailed after a group of young men commented on a mans pony tail  sparking a mass brawl.
Eyewitnesses say it kicked off on Friday after a man allegedly swore at a girl at St Werburghs Road station in Chorlton, Manchester.
The girls boyfriend then jumped onto a tram and continued making comments about his hair.
An argument ensued before objects were hurled across the tram, smashing windows and terrifying passengers.

It is believed that a missile landed on the tracks and later caused a different tram to derail.
The witness, who did not want to be named, told Manchester Evening News: There were youths sat at the station laughing at this lad with a pony tail, saying he looked like an idiot.
He told them where to go, and swore at them  I think at a girl. She got up and started shouting at him, before her boyfriend got on the tram and started trying to fight.
She continued: I pressed the emergency button. Everyone was on the floor and there were a lot of people screaming; everyone was terrified.
It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. Ive never experienced anything like it before.
Police and Metrolinkshave launched a joint investigation.
No-one has been arrested.

Mountain rescue leaders haverefuted claims that a hiker killed by lightning was carrying a selfie-stick.
The teams who climbed the Brecon Beacons to aid four walkers have ruled out that a camera-extension tool was to blame for the deaths.
Two people were killed and two others injured when walking on the highest mountain in the national park in the freak thunderstorm.
Mark Jones, deputy leader of the Brecon Mountain Rescue Team, said: There is no evidence whatsoever that there was a selfie-stick at the scene.
MORE: Two dead after lightning strikes in Brecon Beacons
It is upsetting to the families that the death may have been caused by someone using a selfie-stick. I have never seen one being used on the mountain.
Im told that many are plastic and wouldnt conduct lightning. We certainly didnt see one up there.
Pen y Fan is the highest peak of the Welsh mountain range and is regularly used in gruelling SAS selection exercises.
Police are still waiting to formally confirm the identities of the two dead. One is a Duke of Edinburgh scheme instructor believed to be in his 50s.
One of the two injured has been released from hospital but the other is still being treated at the specialist burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.

Six bankers were sacked yesterday for pretending to behead an Asian workmate (Picture: The Sun)
Six HSBC bankers have been sacked after footage emerged of them pretending to behead a colleague in an ISIS-style video.
The bankers were enjoying a team-building day out at a go-karting centre when they decided to mock up the grisly scene.
Five of them donned balaclavas and stood around their colleague who was dressed in an orange jumpsuit and kneeling on the ground.
In the short video, obtained by The Sun, the group is heard giggling and shouting war cries.
It was uploaded to Instagram and later deleted.
A HSBC spokesperson said: We do not tolerate inappropriate behaviour.
As soon as The Sun brought this video to our attention we took the decision to sack the individuals involved. This is an abhorrent video and HSBC would like to apologise for any offence caused.

        <Description>Peter Skyte didn't realise he was onboard the targeted train until the following day. </Description>
        <MainBody>Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 7 Jul 2015 8:51 am
Peter was on the Piccadilly Line when the attacks took place (Picture: PA)
London 7/7 survivor Peter Skyte has spoken of his ordeal for the first time since the attacks.
TheJudicial Conduct Investigations Office workertold Metro.co.uk about a pregnant woman, a stroke of fate,and how he didnt realise he had been onboard the targeted Tube until the following day.
Heres his story:
Peter's story
I was in the third carriage of the Piccadilly Line train, from memory by the second set of double doors. I had missed an earlier train at Kings Cross as it was full, and then tried to get on at the first carriage of the next train but again it was full. I walked down the train until I managed to squeeze into the third carriage. It was tightly packed and I was right by the doors.
I remember leaning out and seeing the digital clock at the front end of the platform showing 8.50.
Before the doors closed, there was a momentary flicker of the station lights, which I have never seen mentioned in any reports of the day. The doors started to close and I had to press into the other passengers to allow them to close completely. A young woman standing next to me pleaded to give her some space as she was pregnant.
The train set off and less than a minute into the tunnel there was a loud bang as if the train had hit something, the train rocked and lurched and then seemed to speed up for a moment before coming to a stop. All the normal train lights went out but the emergency lights came near the double doors where I was standing.
The carriage was filled with black acrid sooty smoke and breathing was extremely difficult. I put my handkerchief over my mouth and nose in an attempt to keep out the fumes and dust.
Someone started to shout but a couple of us urged them not to panic, and after that I did not hear any sounds of panic in this carriage. People were remarkably calm given the circumstances and the heat which built up in the carriage, so much so that I remove my coat and with difficulty in view of the packed carriage put it over my arm.
Some passengers suggested we should break the windows to get out but others including myself urged that we should remain in the carriage as the rail was probably still live. After about 30 minutes or so, people started to move back up the carriage and we exited by the rear single door, which had a smashed window. To this day, I do not know whether it was smashed from inside or outside.
We dropped on to the floor of the tunnel, which was about a six foot drop, which surprised me at the time but on reflection shouldnt have been so much of a surprise. We began to walk towards the rear of the train. One of the carriages, maybe the 4th or 5th, was still full of passengers, so I together with another man stopped to help the passengers get down from the carriage to the floor of the tunnel.
Once everyone was out of the carriage, I joined the line of people shuffling steadily along and we walked up the incline to the platform at Kings Cross. It was only here that I saw the first emergency or TfL staff walking down into the tunnel, although I may have missed others in the gloom of the tunnel.
As I arrived at the foot of the first escalator, passengers were disgorging from a tube train on the adjacent platform and asked what had happened. At that stage, I still thought the train had hit something on the track, or been derailed. At the top of the escalator in the ticket hall I came across the only injured person I saw that morning, who was bleeding from facial cuts.
Emerging from Kings Cross, there was a scrum of people outside with lots of emergency service crews arriving. I still had my cream coat over my arm and apparently this features in film footage of the day, although I have never seen this. I stood outside Kings Cross, along with many others, and tried to phone my then girlfriend to tell her something had happened. After many attempts, I managed to get though and told her that something had happened to the train, although I didnt know what, but that I was safe.
After standing around for a further few minutes, I crossed the road and walked to my workplace in Covent Garden through backstreets. The air was full of the sound of sirens, and although I must have passed close to both Upper Woburn Place and Russell Square, I have no recollection of seeing anything.
When I arrived at the office in Covent Garden, someone remarked that I looked as if I had been sweeping a chimney, such was the amount of soot on my hair and face. It was only when I looked in the mirror in a toilet that I could see my dishevelled appearance.
The next day, I decided to travel in to work by tube in order to overcome any possible fear. The Northern Line was half empty at the usually packed peak hour, and of course the Piccadilly Line was not running between Kings Cross and Russell Square.
Until the Saturday morning, I had thought I was in the train behind the one with the bomb in it, and it was only when I saw the reconstructions in the newspapers that I realised that I had been on the Piccadilly Line train with the bomb and bomber on board.
This is the first time I have recounted my memory of that day, now ten years ago. The line between life and death is on occasion a very fine one. Had I managed to get in to the first carriage of the train, I might have been one of the dead.
By chance and possibly fate, I was one of the uninjured survivors. Of such happenings are lives lived or lost.
My final thought is the hope that the woman who was next to me in that 3rd carriage had a successful pregnancy and birth.

A former model who gave up western comforts to go and fight Islamic State (Isis) in Syria has talked about the nightmares she witnessed on the battlefield.
Tiger Sun had expected to see some shocking things when she left Canada for the Middle East in March to join the Kurds.
But nothing could prepare her for watching a child getting blown up.

I watched a little girl die from her injuries from a landmine explosion because the Kurds have no medical training or equipment, the 46-year-old told Mail Online .
Sun, 46, decided to go to war following a breakdown of a relationship and after watching fellow Canadian John McGuire join Isis.
Despite not having any formal combat training she said she was put on the frontline immediately.

Although she denied she ever actually killed anyone, she did admit to identifying Isis fighters who were later shot dead.
Did I see violence? Did I see ISIS kill innocent people? Yes, I was in the fight. I saw them trying to kill us. We see Daesh (ISIS), we kill Daesh, and thats about it. Its actually quite simple, she added.
Sun, a mother-of-one, returned to Vancouver last week after being forced to leave the YPJ (Peoples Protection Units) because of malnutrition.

As far as deliberately provocative, ill-advised displays of defiance go, this is one of the worst.
Aman was beaten up by a group of party-goers after he took a confederate flag to an Independence Day party.
The stunt came only weeks after white supremacist gunman Dylann Roof killed nine people at a South Carolina Church  having previously posed with the contentious flag.
In the clip, the man can be waving the flag proudly before a mob closes in and begin attacking him.

He appears to beunconsciouson the floor, but the flag then appears to be taken up by a woman  who predictably receives a beating too.

The confederate flag has long been an issue of contention in America, with its critics saying that the flag is a racist remnant of slavery and segregation in the south of the country.
In the wake of Dylann Roofs massacre, high profile figures including President Barack Obama have called for the confederate flag to be removed from outside the South Carolina statehouse.

Theres a stereotype of Africa in the West.
War. Disease. Famine.
Its poverty porn. Emaciated, crying children with distended bellies surrounded by flies. Parents wading through massive piles of rubbish looking for things to sell.
We stamp an entire continent  millions and millions andmillions of people  with pity. Africa has become nothing tous but a byword for misery and hardship.
But it shouldnt be.
Thats why a group of young Africans on Twitter have created the hashtag #TheAfricaTheMediaNeverShowsYou  a friendly reminder that yes, there is suffering in Africa, but there is also plenty of happiness, thriving, vibrant culture and natural beauty.

In the Siberian city of Tomsk, a bear that had been caged for years in a caf finally snapped and reportedly ripped the arm off a female diner.
Incredibly, the bear was one of several cagedin the caf to draw people in off the street.
While a man went and ordered drinks, his wife decided to get a closer look at the animals. But she went too close.

One of the bears snapped and attacked the woman, ripping off one of her arms, local media said.
Tomsky animal control specialists inspected the caf to see if the owners had the permits required to keep bears there.
Were going toinvestigate it thoroughly, but based onpreliminary data, it appears that their documents are inorder, Valery Yermolenko, head of Tomsk animal control, was quoted as saying by Gazeta.ru.
Well thats okay then.

Who you would you rather have as the president of the US?
An avocado or Donald Trump?
This was the question posed by the Avocado Twitter account.
The answer was definitive.
Mmm. (Picture: Getty)
65,477 people said an avocado. 6,415 said Donald Trump.
Its easy to see why people chose the avocado. Its incredibly nutritious, and its buttery texture and rich taste make it the perfect snack.
Besides, the alternative is Donald Trump.
All thisbegs the question: why isnt an avocado running for office?
There was never really any contest. (Picture: Getty Images)

If theres anything thats going to put you off your summer BBQ and weep gently, its this vid.
It shows an adorable little girl in tears over dinner asking why animals have to be chopped up.
The child is at the table with her father when she sobs: I dont like what people eat  animals. I just dont want them to be chopped up.
Her dad argues they taste very good and shereplies: But I dont want to kill a horseyPigs are nice, chickens are nice and cows are nice. Animals are very nice. Who is chopping them all up?
She looks even more devastated when her father tells her farmers are responsible.
Farmers, of course theyre to blame.

A boy aged just two years old has lost a large part of his arm after he reached into the tiger enclosureat his local zoo.
The unnamed toddler was visiting the Yaan Bifeng Gorge animal park in Yaan in southwest Chinas Sichuan Province when he poked his arm into the area housinga white Bengal tiger.
Before anyone could pull the child away, the tiger had clamped its jaws around the lower part of his arm and ripped away a large amount of muscle and flesh.

The boy was rushed to the Peoples Hospital of Yaan for treatment, but doctors were unable to save any of his arm below the elbow.
So far, the boys family have refused to comment on the incident, but there are concerns that the safety at certain zoos in the country is not up to scratch.
Recently, a nine-year-old boy lost part of his arm while trying to feed a bear at a zoo in Henan Province. The parents of Cong Cong are currently embroiled in a legal battle with the zoo.

A happy weed smoker in Washington state (Picture: AP)
It turns out legalising marijuana in Washington wasnt such a bad idea.
Who would have thought (a few people actually did) that making weed widely available in the state would not be catastrophic.
If youre judging the decision based on money generated, it was certainly a good one.
Washingtons racked up more than $250 million (160m) in marijuana sales in the past year from around 160 weed stores  roughly $62m (39m)of which constitute marijuana excise taxes.
Packets of a variety of recreational marijuana named Space Needle (Picture: AP)
Thats beyond the states original forecast of $36m (23m).
And when state and local sales and other taxes are included, the total payday for the state and local governments tops $70m (45m).
But of course some people will argue there are a lot more stoners walking around these days, who lack motivation and have a huge appetite.
The drug is fully legalin Colorado, Washington, Alaska and Oregon.
Of course its still bannedin the UK but after this report, there could be a greater move to get that changed.

Sao PauloAirport was Roberts home for 18 days(Picture: Paulo Whitaker/Reuters)
Its hard to believe, but a London-based man actually got lost in anSo Paulo Airport for nearly three weeks.
Robert Wladyslaw Parzelskis unexpected adventure began after he took an opportunity for work.
The jobless 44-year-old, originally from Poland, was handed a one way British Airways ticket from London to Brazil by his friend who gave him a bizarre mandate: Bring home two phone handsets.
He slipped through customs on June 17, but found himself stuck without a return flight and unable to speak a word of Portuguese. The fact that he had no money didnt help, either.

Robert set up camp on a bench and survived off water, yoghurt and cigarettes  brought to him by cleaners who became concerned for his welfare.
Pictures of Robert emerged on social media and quickly caught the attention of local media.
One newspaper talked a 70-year-oldPolish doctor from So Paulo to head down and find out Roberts story.
Turns out his friend had promised to meet him but he never showed up  leaving him stranded.
But the doctor still couldnt get to the bottom of his odd business venture. A question mark still hangs over why someone would send him to Brazil to get two phones.
Parzelski finally left Brazil on Tuesday afternoon, onboard a Swiss Air flight bound for Zurich. From there he was due to head back to London.
Robert was reportedly seen sipping a pint of dark ale before boarding his flight last week.

Germany should follow the same approach that was shown towards the country after World War Two and cut Greeces debt, a leading economist has said.
Renowned economist Thomas Piketty has said that German conservatives are destroying Europe with austerity, and slammed the country for their appalling failure to remember history.
In 1953, creditors including Greece wrote off a chunk of West Germanys reparation payments, after the country was left devastated by the effects of World War Two.
The move, known as the London Agreement, is now considered to one of the most successful examples of international debt relief  and contributed to the beginning of what became later known as the German economic miracle.

Speaking to German newspaper ZeitOnline, Mr Piketty said: The younger generation of Greeks carries no more responsibility for the mistakes of its elders than the younger generation of Germans did in the 1950s and 1960s.
We need to look ahead. Europe was founded on debt forgiveness and investment in the future. Not on the idea of endless penance. We need to remember this.
He added: Germany is really the single best example of a country that, throughout its history, has never repaid its external debt. Neither after the First nor the Second World War.
MORE: This dog really isnt happy about his little brother coming to play
However, it has frequently made other nations pay up, such as after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, when it demanded massive reparations from France and indeed received them.
The French state suffered for decades under this debt. The history of public debt is full of irony. It rarely follows our ideas of order and justice.
And his calls are in line with those of the International Monetary Fund, who argued on Thursday that Greece needs substantial debt-relief alongside more than 60 billion euros in financing until the end of 2018.

        <Description>Fact: You're more likely to be killed by a cow than a shark. </Description>
        <MainBody>Thankfully, there are tips on how to avoid getting killed by a cow this summer.
Be bold
(Picture: REX)
Dont be afraid of them. Walk directly through the herd (if thats your line of path) and dont freak out if they move towards you.
Dont p*** them off
Obvious, but its best practice not to wind up cattle  especially when theyre with their young. Cows are not partial to a bit of banter.
Take a walking stick with you
(Picture:Reuters)
Not only will you feel like Gandalf, a stick offers a visual deterrent and could potentially be a life saver if youre ever charged.
Take a dog
As a last resort it may be necessary to unleash Rover and let him chase the beast away.
Avoid all cow fields
They are plenty of other fields you can walk through. Choose them instead.

The amazing weather is set to continue with the return of a heatwave this week  but only if youre in one half of the country.
Basically, anywhere below Milton Keynes will be bathed in glorious sunshine.
Above that line, you can expect storms and heavy rain.
John Griffiths, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: If you drew a line between Lincolnshire and Bristol then everything below that line is going to be nice and dry and over that line it will get wetter and wetter the further north you go.

The mercury this week is unlikely to hit the dizzying highs of last weeks record-breaking temperatures of 36.7C, recorded at Heathrow, while many other areas broke the 30C mark.
But forecasters have said it will remain warm despite the wet weather, with temperatures of 22C in the South East and London and 20C in Scotland today.
A large band of rain is to sweep northwest across the country before being replaced by warmer weather by Thursday and Friday, with highs of 26C in London and bright spells everywhere else.
Mr Griffiths added: There is quite a big split over the country. In the South East and south coast there will be some patchy rain but some good sunny spells and it will be mainly dry.
There is a big band of showery rain pushing north west from Ireland during the day today and covering northern parts of Cornwall and Wales. It should reach Scotland by the afternoon.
Lightning could strike parts of Scotland again tomorrow, he added, following the widespread thunderstorms over the weekend.

Chemists have come up with a new use for the material  a mixture of different carbon-based chemicals  originally developed for aeroplane wings.
The healing agent is poised to revolutionise a number of industries andLOreal is already in talks with developers to createsome kind of self-healing nail varnish.
Car windshields, paint,bicycle frames and wind turbinesare other things that could benefit from the material.

So how does it work?
Much like blood forms a protective scab to heal wounds, millions of microscopic spheres crack and release liquid.
The liquid moves into the newly formed cap and a chemical reaction causes it to harden like glue.
The result is a near perfect recovery.
The material, which has achieved 100 per cent recovery of mechanical strength in some cases, was further developed by chemists at theUniversity of Bristol.
Duncan Wass presented his groundbreaking findings at a Royal Society meeting in London last month.
He told the Independent: We took inspiration from the human body.
Weve not evolved to withstand any damage  if we were like that wed have a skin as thick as a rhinoceros  but if we do get damaged, we bleed, and it scabs and heals. We just put that same sort of function into a synthetic material: lets have something that can heal itself.

A 22-year-old man has died after launching a firework off the top of his head.
Devon Staples and his friends had been drinking Saturday night in the gardenof a friends home in Calais, eastern Maine, US, when he lit the firework and died instantly said Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety.
He explained: Apparently, he thought that was a great idea.
His friends they thought dissuaded him from doing it, and the next thing they knew, he ignited the fireworks and he was killed instantly.

Stapless brother Cody told the Daily News of New York that he was a few feet away when his brother lit the firework and was the first to come to his side after it exploded.
The 25-year-old said: There was no rushing him to the hospital. There was no Devon left when I got there.
Devon was not the kind of person who would do something stupid. He was the kind of person who would pretend to do something stupid to make people laugh.
Staples death is the first fireworks fatality in Maine since the state legalised fireworks in2012, authorities said.

Lawmakers had voted to repeal a 1949 law banning fireworks, reasoning the industry would create jobs and generate revenue.
State fire marshals were also investigating several other Fourth of July fireworks accidents involving injuries in Friendship, Jefferson, Lebanon and Woodstock. They said most of the accidents involved burns and eye injuries.
In Montana on Saturday, a 32-year-old man was killed at a Billings home in a fireworks accident involving a mortar tube.

Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis announced his resignation today afterthe No vote.
More than 60 per cent of Greeks voted No in a referendum on whether to accept the terms of a bailout offered by its creditors yesterday.
An estimated ten million people turned out to vote in the referendum  the countrys first since 1974  and with more than 70 per cent of the votes counted, 61 per cent rejected EU demands for further austerity.
MrVaroufakis departure is the latest in a series of twists and turns for the country which continue to raise questions about its future.

Q: What happens next?
A: Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has said that he will return to the negotiating table with the creditors with a mandate to demand a fresh deal.
He has suggested an agreement could be hammered out in just 48 hours  just in time for the banks to re-open as promised on Tuesday.
The creditors  the eurozone, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund  however have been adamant that a no means the end of negotiations.
That in turn would mean the withdrawal of the emergency financial lifeline from the ECB which has been keeping the Greek banks afloat.
Uncharted waters: Economists have painted some scar scenarios (Picture:EPA/KAY NIETFELD)
Q: So if the creditors refuse to negotiate, then what?
A: We are entering uncharted waters. Economists have however painted some scary scenarios for a country which has already endured five years of austerity.
One analysis suggested that an economy which has already shrunk by 25 per cent since 2008 could contract by another 25 per cent.
Tourists could be put off by fears of chaos, severing a vital flow of income, and business life will grind to a halt.
As remaining funds dry up, the government may have to start paying public sector salaries and pensions with IOUs  putting it on track to leave the euro.
That could see banks become insolvent and hyper-inflation erupt  potentially triggering unrest on the streets.

Q: Could talks start again?
A: The eurozones two biggest players  Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande  are set to meet in Paris to discuss the way forward.
Mrs Merkel has made no secret of her exasperation with the Greek negotiating tactics, but will she want to go down in history as the leader who presided over the break-up of the single currency?

Certain features of the comet, such as its black crust, are best explained as being the result of organisms living beneath an icy surface.
The Rosetta space craft orbiting the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has also picked up clusters of organic material that resemble viral particles.
I wanted to include a very inexpensive life-detection experiment. At the time it was thought this was a bizarre proposition, said astronomer and astrobiologist Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, who was involved in the planning of the mission.

Professor Wickramasinghe and his colleague Dr Max Wallis for the University of Cardiff believe that comets like 67P could provide homes for living microbes in the same way that inhospitable regions of Earth are occupied by extremophiles.
They have suggested that life found on comets or other planets may have been the origin of all life on Earth.
The pairs research has suggestedthat microbes withstanding temperatures as low as -40C could inhabit watery regions of the comet.

What were saying is that data coming from the comet seems to unequivocally, in my opinion, point to micro-organisms being involved in the formation of the icy structures, the preponderance of aromatic hydrocarbons, and the very dark surface, said Professor Wickramasinghe.
He added that our attitude towards alien life needs to change.
Planets that can harbour life are really quite abundant in the galaxy, and the next neighbouring system to us is only spitting distance away, he said.
I think its inevitable that life is going to be a cosmic phenomenon.

More than 60 percent of Greeks voted No today in a referendum on whether to accept the terms of a bailout offered by its creditors.
An estimated 10million people turned out to vote in the referendum  the countrys first since 1974  and with over 70 percent of the votes counted, 61 percent rejected EU demands for further austerity.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had urged the public to vote No, arguing that it would give some dignity back to Greece and strengthen his position at the negotiating table with the so-called troika  the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
The No vote will likely mean that Greece will leave the Eurozone and return to the drachma currency, despite the governments claims that wont be the case.

Celebrations are taking place in Syntagma Square in Athens and Tsipras said the clear mandate would allow him to push for a better bailout package from Greeces creditors.
Germanys foreign minister said before the vote thatcompromises between Greece and its creditors would become much more difficult should the country refuse the bailout terms, a comment echoed by Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who said new negotiations are difficult to imagine.
Meanwhile Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos tweeted that the Greeks proved they dont bow to blackmail, to threats.
Since Syriza was elected under an anti-austerity banner, a Yes result would have led to the formation of a national unity government until a new election could take place.

The thought of sprinting in them just makes your eyeswater.
However, these male competitors in the high heel race at the Madrid Gay Pride March in Spain are no novices and can seriously hustle.
Not only can they avoid the amateur mistake of rolling over their ankle, they even have ways of securing their feet.
The winner received a 400 Euro prize pot and a free dinner for two  not to be knocked.

Breivik says his isolation violates the ECHR (Picture: PA)
The man who murdered 77 people in two terror attacks in Oslo has sued Norway because he feels his human rights have been violated.
Anders Behrin Breivik was sentenced to 21 years in prison for twin attacks on 22 July 2011, and has so far spent four years in an isolated wing of Skien prison.
But Breivik is far from happy with his extreme isolation, and is now taking the Norwegian state to court on the grounds his human rights have been violated.
Breivik, who is the only prisoner in Norway held in his own wing, argues that his separation from other prisoners violates the European Convention on Human Rights.

The main reason for the lawsuit is the extreme isolation my client has been subjected to, his lawyer, Oystein Storrvik, told the VG newspaper.
Even in isolation, Breivik has been subject to threats from other inmates.
One fellow prisoner managed to break into Breiviks wing from the prison yard in April, and hammered on the door shouting If there wasnt a door between us, Id kill you.
The Norwegian government has previously ruled that Breiviks prison conditions comply with European law.

Kendrick Lamar has hit back at critics after he performed on top of a vandalised police car.
The US rapper was accused of inciting violence and perpetuating stereotypes by Fox News anchor Geraldo Rivera  after performing the song Alright at the BET awards last week.
But speaking to TMZ, Lamar said that the song, from latest album To Pimp A Butterfly, actually contained a message of positivity and hope.
How can you take a song thats about hope and turn it into hatred? he said.
The overall message is we gonna be alright. Its not the message of I wanna kill people.
He added that Riveras comments were at risk of taking away from the overall message of his performance  aiming to overcome police brutality through positivity.
The problem isnt me standing on a cop car. His attempt is diluting the real problem, which is the senseless acts of killing of these young boys out here, he said.
I think for the most part its to avoid the reality. Me being on the cop car, thats a performance piece after these senseless acts.

Austrian police have arrested a father and son who are accused of transporting 600 kg of cocaine on a yacht from Brazil to Europe.
A father and son were arrested after allegedly transporting 600kg of cocaine on a yacht from Brazil to Europe.
The pair were arrested by Austrian police, and it is believed that the father had spent time in a Croatian jail, where he met another drug dealer.
But when the pair were released they joined forces. The father and his 35-year-old sonreportedlybegan shipping drugs from Brazil to Spain and allegedlyreceived 250,000 (178,440) for 600kg of cocaine.
However, their alleged drug racket came under intense police scrutiny after a plane carrying 350kg of cocaine crashed near the Brazilian border  with the police providing information about a drug ring.
They were also reportedly in the process of planning another cocaine smuggling trip, the head of the department for the fight against organised crime has said.
Police first became aware of the drug smuggling ring in 2013, and have since arrested 30 people in Austria and Brazil, seizing cocaine, millions of pounds worth of cash, and weapons including Kalashnikovs.

There is a massive human cost to the crisis (Picture:Getty Images)
Tomorrow, Greece decides whether to accept the terms offered by its creditors.
A no vote means Greece will default on the repayments owed to the IMF. Its then likely that the country will abandon the euro.

The Background
In 2009, Greeces then-prime minister George Papandreou introduced a series of tough spending cuts to counter spirally public debt, i.e. austerity measures.
But these werent tough enough and by May 2010, the Eurozone had intervened, offering Greece 10billion in exchange for tighter austerity measures.
In July 2011, a further 109billion was given to Greece via the European Financial Stability Facility and by October 2012, the country was on its fourth bailout.

Meanwhile, the Greek public wasbecoming increasingly agitated. Unemployment rates soared, workers were striking and civil unrest becamecommonplace.
The so-called troika  the European Comission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European CentralBank  believed Greece was making some progress in cutting its spending. But when Alexis Tsipras and the Syriza party were elected this year under an anti-austerity banner, that all changed.
Tsipras argued that thetough spending cuts the country desperately needed to balance its books were not worth the human cost.

Why Greece?
Greece isnt special or unique when it comes to money, but it does have some unique features that have got it to its current predicament.
When it joined the Eurozone in 2000, it already had a high level of public debt and high inflation. In fact, there have been suggestions that the countrys poor financial situation was downplayed somewhat so it could gain entry. The euro currency gave Greece the opportunity to borrow at a lower rate  2 or 3 percent, rather than 10-plus  but this borrowed money wasnt used on the structural reforms the country needed to balance the books. Public sector pay doubled and pensions were increased.
Greece also suffers because ofmassive tax evasion. It is estimated that more than 20billion in potential taxes is lost as a result. Its a vicious cycle. Greece needs the tax money to pay its public sector workers, but it needs the public sector workers to crack down on tax evasion.
The current situation in Greece is dire (Picture: AP Photo/Daniel Ochoa de Olza)
Greece is less competitive than other countries that have suffered financially in the past decade.
For instance, there are laws restricting the number of pharmacies or bakeries in a given area. Compare that to the UK, where seeing a Boots and a Superdrug next door to each other isnt unusual.
Syriza (literally radical left coalition) coming to power hasnt helped the market freedom needed to improve GDP, but as Paul Mason, writing for Channel 4, says rather poetically, theGreeks themselves dont measure in GDP figures  they measure in extra suicides, a falling birthrate, the migration of 100,000 young people abroad, whole streets full of closed shops.
What happens if Greece leaves? (Picture: EPA)
The Grexit
This brings us on to the Grexit itself. Greece will have to issue its owncurrency to pay its bills.Its beyond the scope of this article, but essentially the currency will be devalued against the euro and the country will able to grow because exports will become cheaper. Holidays in Greece will be very cheap. Hurray.
The Greece economy will have to improve eventually, however, as the benefits of this devalued currencyare limited.
No-one can accuratelypredict what will happen to the rest of us if Greece leaves the Eurozone. Whats certain is that the currency markets will move and support for the Euro will drop, which in turn will likely cause a drop in the value of the currencies which rely on EU trade. Like our beautiful pound sterling.
By how much we dont know. For instance, the announcement that the latest round of talks had collapsed triggered a downward turn for the pound, but it was minor. Its also worth nothing that the Greek economy only accounts for around 3 percent of the EUs GDP as a whole.

Riots and strikes are common in Greece (Picture: AP Photo/Daniel Ochoa de Olza)
We  that is, Britain  are also 4.5 percent shareholders in the IMF, which owns around 32billion of Greek debt. This translates to just under1.5billion. Thats a lot of money, but its a paltry figure compared to Germanys56billion or Frances 42billion of Greek debt.
The Grexit does, however, show that other countries leavingthe Eurozone is a possibility, and the result of that is less confidence in the monetary union as a whole.
That said, there is an argument that a Grexit will be good for the Eurozone in the long-term for the same reason that a business will shut down a branch thats losing money.

You know youve got a fresh cut of beef when you take it home and its still moving.
Cheng Tan bought the slab from her local butchersin Sishui County, Chinas Shandong Province, and was about to prepare it when she noticed it violently twitching.
I was worried that there could have been parasites or some sort of harmful chemicals inside that was causing the twitching, she said.
Ive never seen anything like this, so I was afraid to eat it and decided to record the video.
In fact, her fears couldnt be more misplaced.
Food experts told a local news channel that the slaughter was so recent nerve endings in the cut had yet to die.
The twitching eventually stops, and you wont turn into a mutant zombie cow after consumption.

Is Brand off to Syria? (Picture: Mike Marsland/WireImage)
Russell Brand said he has a good mind to move to Syria if he gets bought a first class ticket.
He made the comment hours after he labelled the one-minute silence for the Tunisian beach massacre victims as bulls***.
On Thursday the comedian read out a news story about his controversial YouTube rant to an audience of around 100.
He then highlighted a comment left under the video which read: If he feels so strongly why does he not go and live in Syria and I would pay his fare for him. Anyone else contribute?
Brand told the audience he had a good mind to take him up on the offer as he may get to go first class, according to the Daily Star .
The controversial celeb denounced the one-minutes silence to mark the lives of 38 British tourists killed in Tunisia.
He pointed blame at Britains policy of selling arms abroad.

You really couldnt make this up.
Two television crews reporting on a deadly shooting in San Francisco have been robbed at gunpoint close to where the original incident happened.
Viewers got a first-hand glimpse of the drama when a camera man was seen running across the screen of rival news organisation KTVU Fox 2.
Cara Liu, who works for the station, was then seenrunning away after telling the anchor there was an incident.
Things really kicked off (Picture: YouTube/KTVU)
It later emerged her crew had been robbed at gunpoint, along with another one.
A cameraman was pistol-whipped during the incident near the citys waterfront, and suffered minor injuries.
The robber drove away in a black BMW with two cameras and two tripods from stations KTVU and KNTV.
Television and newspaper crews have been robbed in the San Francisco Bay Area several times in recent years and many of them now travel with armed guards when reporting in high-crime areas.
A 31-year-old woman was murderedat Pier 14 along the Embarcadero on Wednesday.

Two suspected rhino poachers were shot dead by rangers in Kruger National Park.
Rangers on duty were patrolling the South African park, which is roughly the size of Wales.
During their rounds, they spotted three men thought to be seeking rhinoceros horn.
A park official confirmed an exchange of gunfire had occurred at dawn and that two of the poachers were killed.
There was a shoot-out and two of the tree suspected poachers were fatally wounded, said a spokesperson.

Scroll to the bottom for the original advert:
Good grief.
The US governments latest fireworks safety advert is really weird.
It displaystext urging you to do such things as ensure a clear flight path for fireworks devices and then it illustrates the point by blowing the face off a mannequin, some of which are small and dressed up to look like children (you know, backwards-facing baseball cap etc.)
Of course, there is an important message to be takenfrom the advert and you should be careful around fireworks, but its just so bloody ridiculous its asking to be poked fun at.
The excellent team over at Gizmodo certainly thought so, and added what can only be described as lift music as a backing track.
The result is masterful.

This robot could show you the light when it comes to cleaning.
The days of having to swamp your home in chemicals to get rid of the germs could be over after a firm came up with a device that blasts them with UV light.
The self-powered UVe smart gadget uses special sensors to know when it has reached the edge of a surface  and is so intelligent it learns about its surroundings as it cleans.

Household cleaning is synonymous with chemical detergents and disinfectants, which come with some nasty health risks  especially for children, those with asthma, and anyone else with sensitive lungs, Ryan Lue, from inventors THAT!, said.
UVe does the work for you, and it gets the job done without contaminating the air you breathe.
While UV light has been used to clean commercially for decades, UVe is thought to be the first device to bring the method safely into the home.
But the productis not a certainty to hit the shelves and currently needs funding in the region of $50,000 (32,000).
The owners are seeking this amount on Kickstarter , so if you fancy supporting it head there.
Or you could pre-order the device through the THAT!website for $89 (56).

Carmelo Mercado, from Queens, New York, rushed to Ground Zero moments afterthe second twin tower collapsed and spent two days working to find and rescue and survivors.He took so much smoke into his lungs that he was forced to retire from theFDNY afterwards.
But Carmelo now has some good news: hes won the lottery.
$5 million (3.2million) to be exact.
I said, Holy mackerel, that looks like $5 million, he said.
My mind went blank. I was in shock.

Just in case you didnt know  this is how to sit on a toilet.
The bizarre signs can be found on trains in the Swiss Alps and are aimed at Asian tourists who, well, have a tendency to squat over the bowl apparently.
Other signs warn visitors fromSoutheast Asia and the Middle East not to throw their used toilet paper in the bin.
Roger Joss, director of marketing for the railway told 20 Minuten newspaper: It happens that guests mount on the toilet seats to do their business  and sometimes they dont know where to put the paper.
Marcel Furer, head of the regional tourist office, added: Tourists from the Gulf region or Asian countries are not very aware of our way of living.
Its happened that people relieve themselves in the shower rather than in the toilet.
Butvisitors from Korea and China told the paper the signs were unnecessary.
Frankly, theres nothing wrong with changing up your toilet routine even now and again to incorporate a squat.

From ashes to ashes, dust to dust we are all made of atoms and at the end well return to where we came from.
Now the same principle can be applied to urine.
Its the circle of life illustrated in one neat loop  drink beer, collect peed out beer for fertiliser, grow hops for beer, drink beer.
Organisers at Danish music festival Roskilde (the largest festival in northern Europe) have launched their piss to pilsner scheme and will be bottling up visitors personal amber nectar in toilets on the campsite from 2017.They plan to collect 25,000 litres of waste liquid to pee-cycle and fertilise barley crops.

Its about changing our approach to waste, from being a burden to being a valuable resource, Leif Nielsen from the Danish Agriculture &amp; Food Council (DAFC) said in the Guardian .
The huge amount of urine produced at festivals was having a negative impact on the environment and the sewage system. But beercycling will turn the urine into a resource.
They want your urine  and the wee of greater mortals too.
Weve got urinals right next to the stages where the acts will play, so were hoping to collect some rock star pee as well, Marie Grabow Westergaard from the DAFC said.
Headline acts this year include Pharrell Williams, Sir Paul McCartney and Florence and the Machine.

A sparkler could burn through your pretty summer dress.
Or someone could launch a screamer towards your face, which will then land in your eye and burn it away.
And if all that wasnt enough, theres a possibility your head could be blown off if you get too close, which would be terrible.
But at least they played some jovial music in the background.
That would make us feel better if we got one of our body parts blown off.

It looked something like this, probably (Picture: Metro)
Part of a beach has been cordoned off after a massive hole appeared and shot snails into the sky.
The coastguard was called to near Orcombe Point on Exmouth Beach in Devon at 12.47pm on Thursday.
The mystery holemeasuring 15ft wide and 15ft deep.
Big plumes of water were seen spewing from the cavity  which sent snails and plants flying.
Officials say thenatural phenomena is likely to have been caused by heavy rain.
The area has been cordoned off (Picture: PA)
A council spokeswoman said: Council engineers are currently on site investigating and report that the sand around the hole is soft underfoot, the spokeswoman said.
They will continue to monitor the situation over the weekend and between tides.
The beach is very popular with dog walkers and bathers who are being advised to avoid the cordoned off area.
Heavy rain yesterday may be the cause of the hole  a natural phenomena  to have opened up.

Getting a filling is bad enough, but this five-year-old was strapped down and restrained in what her parents called a body bag by her dentist so he could work on her front tooth.
Its a horrifying image and people across the world have been outraged at the technique used by the perhaps ironically titled Smiles-R-Us in America.
Staff at the Georgia dentist said all parents sign a consent form  and they use the technique on other patients too.
The practice uses whats called a papoose board to hold down uncooperative children, WSBTV reported.

We were sitting out in the waiting room and all of a sudden, we heard somebody screaming, her grandmother, Evelyn Crow said.
When James rushed in to see what was happening, he found his daughter left alone and physically restrained.
I couldnt see my kid in the body bag just strapped down to the bed, I couldnt handle it, he said.

This little girl was frightened I had to carry her out, she was shaking so bad, her grandmother Evelyn added.
When WSBTV phoned the dentist, they said parents always sign a consent form  but the Crows said the didnt remember doing so.
The only thing they said was they were going to put her on some laughing gas, James said.
When the TV station calledGeorgia Board of Dentistry, they said there are no rules against using restraints though there are warnings that they could inflict possible physical or psychological harm.

The mother of a child due to startkindergarten in autumn has slammed an application in which she was asked whether her sons birth was vaginal or caesarean.
Cara Paiuk said she was at an introductory event at Aiken Elementary School in West Hartford, Connecticut, when she and her husband were handed a packet of forms to fill out.
But she was alarmedwhen she read through a section on birth history and found a question asking her whether her son was delivered vaginally or by caesarean section.
I ripped it out of his [her husbands] hands and said, You cant answer that, its none of their business, she told Yahoo .

This is kindergarten, and they want to know about my vagina! I dont understand  theres no correlation between the two for me.
Cara said she would have made a fuss then and there, but was concerned it would affect her sons entry to the school.
When she eventually spoke to the school district, she was told that certain birth traumas could help staff understand if the child had any issues.
I thought it was BS, Cara said.
Wouldnt it be crazy if I thought something was wrong with your child and went back and looked at a form and said Oh, its because she had a C-section?

Charleston killer suspects sister launched a crowdfunder to pay for her cancelled wedding and people areappalled
Nicole Morley for Metro.co.uk Friday 3 Jul 2015 11:30 am
The crowdfunder appeared to be set up by Dylann Roofs sister (Picture: GAWKER)
Dylann Roofs sister apparently launched a crowdfunding website to pay for her wedding.
Unsurprisingly, people are pretty mad about it.
Amber is the sibling of Dylann Roof ,the 21-year-old man arrested on suspicion of gunning down nine people in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston last month.
Amber had to postpone her wedding to fianc Michael following her brothers alleged actions.
A GoFundMe site popped up online, trying to collect funds toenable a fresh start for Michael and Amber.
The page  which has now been deleted  hoped to cover lost wedding costs, to pay bills and to send us on our dream honeymoon.

It read: It was supposed to start our lives together with our new family. Our day was the exact opposite. Our wedding was full of sorrow, pain, and shame, tainted by the actions of one man.
The Charleston Massacre took place and our lives were forever changed. The media abused our privacy and published all of our wedding information and destroyed our dream day, the page continued; Destroying the first day of Michael and my life together.
The GoFundMe campaignattracted a lot of criticism by people appalled by the appeal, reports The Post and Courier.
This has to be the most self-centred and insensitive fundraising page Ive ever encountered. I cant imagine the anguish your brother has inflicted on so many wonderful and kind people and all the while, you are fantasizing about letting others fund your honeymoon.
THE NERVE OF YOU, said one commenter.
How dare u set up a gofundme under these circumstances, added another.
Amber was set to tie the knot on June 21, four days after a man believed to be her brother Dylann opened fire in a church prayer meeting killing nine people.
The crowdfunding campaign offered to give 10 percent of donations to the Emanuel AME Church.
The victims of the Charleston shooting: Clementa Pinckney, Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, DePayne Middleton-Doctor, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel L. Simmons Sr, Sharonda Singleton and Myra Thompson

As if it isnt impressive enough that this man speaks 18 languages, hes pretty funny, quite charming and he can draw as well.
Dutchman Wouter Corduwener said he learned English, French and German at school, but has since added 14 other languages to his arsenal almost purely through interacting with the tourists who walk by the stand where he sells pastel drawings and caricatures.
And when we say he speaks 18 languages, we dont mean just at a hello-how-are-you conversational level.
He tells jokes, talks about culture and happily banters away.

Everything will eventually be torn apart, scientists say
The Big Bang is how it all began, and the Big Rip is how it will all end.
The universe will expand to such a degree that everything from galaxies to planets to atoms will be torn apart  and then vanish from view.
Theres no need to panic, however, as this sequence of events wont happen for another 22billion years.
This is all according to scientists working at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.
MORE: Antidepressants affect your sense of morality as well as your happiness, study finds
No need to panic. Well not for 22billion years anyway
The idea of the Big Rip is that eventually even the constituents of matter would start separating from each other, mathematician Dr Marcelo Disconzi told the Guardian .
Youd be seeing all the atoms being ripped apart  its fair to say that its a dramatic scenario.
The team at Vanderbilt examined distant supernovae to see whether the Big Rip was possible. The further away these supernovae are, the redder they seem because the light has been stretched out as it travels through space to reach us.
The Big Rip isntthe only option for how well meet our eventual demise. Alternative theories include the Big Crunch, where the Big Bang reverses and everything contracts, and the Big Freeze, where the university reaches a point where itsso expansive it becomes too cold to sustain life.

Pong isnt exactly a thrilling game.
But its far more enjoyable when you know that your opponent will get hurt if they lose.
Thats the premise of the PainStation, a device that requires players to keep their lefthand pressed down on two buttons while they play with their right hand.
If they take their hand off the buttons, they lose the game, butif they lose a point and the right icon is hit, their hand is shocked, burned or whipped.
Its a hardcore way of playing pong, explains one of the players.
And hardcore is the word.Theres a reason it comes with a health warning.
Play it long enough and this machine will leave you bleeding from open whip-wounds and with third degree burns.
This is what lies in store if you play PainStation (Picture: izismile.com)

The findings could spell a breakthrough in the treatment of antisocial behaviour (Picture: Getty Images)
For those in doubt that our sense of morality is a physical thing as well as a philosophical one, this ought to change your mind.
A study has found that certain drugs, including commonly-prescribed antidepressants, actually change moral behaviour as well as influence mood.
Researchers from University College London gave175 healthy adults the power to administer and receive electric shocks to see how much pain people were willing to inflict or put themselves through in exchange for money.
But that wasnt all. Half the study group were given the antidepressant citalopram and the other half were given the Parkinsons drug levodopa. These groups were compared against a placebo group.
The Findings
Antidepressants made participants extra-sensitive both to receiving pain and inflicting it.
Dopamine-enhancing Parkinsons medication on the other hand made participants more willing to hurt others for money.
Researchers found that those given citalopram were willing to pay almost twice as much to prevent harm to themselves or others when compared to a placebo group, while the group taking levodopa were the most likely to harm others for the cash reward.
Our findings have implications for potential lines of treatment for antisocial behavior, as they help us to understand how serotonin and dopamine affect peoples willingness to harm others for personal gain, Molly Crockett, lead author of the research, told the Guardian.
Patients [taking these drugs] are tracked in terms of how their symptoms improve, but not necessarily in terms of how their behaviour changes.

How did they know? (Picture: Fox)
Things aint looking good for Greece recently, and many people are anticipating their exit from the eurozone.
But before you go running to economists for prediction, maybe you should consult The Simpsons.
The insightful show has called many global incidents before they happened, and the Greek financial crisis apparently didnt escape their orcale-like vision.
In the episode Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson, which first aired in January 2013, Homer appears on a tongue-in-cheek version of Fox News.
During his appearance the news ticker shows a headline which reads: Europe puts Greece on eBay.
Three years on this off-the-cuff joke has become eerily true.
The amazing prediction was spotted by Reddit user MyPenisBatman .
Maybe thats how the show has remained on the air for 26 years  the writers are actually soothsayers?

Another accident has taken place at Alton Towers (Picture:Joe Giddens/PA Wire)
Yet another roller coaster accident has taken place at Alton Towers  but its unclear how bad it was.
Eye-witnesses say one man was taken to hospital with head injuries after two carriages on Sonic Spinball crashed into each other at full pace this afternoon.
However, Alton Towers has rejectedthis account, claiming the carriages nudged and no-one was taken to hospital from the amusement park.
But they could not confirm if the customer sought medical attention after leaving.
So its either a crash or a nudge.
Which version of events do you believe?

Eye-witness Danny Robinson
The 24-year-old from Liverpool told The Mirror: I was stood with the bags watching them when it happened. The carriage came round to the end at full pace and crashed into one with a young family inside.
The mum in the other carriage was screaming. Two of my friends hit the back of their heads and another two hurt their necks. They spent about 20 minutes getting them out of the carriage.
All four were taken to the medical centre spent two-and-a-half hours getting checked over and heat pads on their necks. Afterwards one of them started throwing up everywhere and ended up going to hospital.
Alton Towers' statement
A spokesperson said: Two cars in the station area nudged each other at walking pace.
The guests on the two cars walked off and we advised that they attend our medical centre as a precautionary measure.
The ride re-opened shortly afterwards.
Guests were taken to the medical centre immediately after the incident.
They were given ice packs but no other medical treatment was given.
Alton Towers says it has absolutely no record of a head injury or any one being taken to hospital.

The Fourth of July in the United States means fireworks, parades and plenty offlag-waving.
Much like Christmas, it seems that the reason for Independence Day is becoming increasingly obscured with the Americans in this video unable to successfully explain the reason for its celebration.
A rather cruel interviewer, in the form of Mark Dice , asked people on a San Diego boardwalk different questions about the fourth of Julyand its historical significance.
MORE: Gay marriage was legalised in the United States today and a lot of people are pretty happy about it
Why do Americans celebrate Independence Day on 4th of July?
It was on thefourth of July in 1776 that 13 colonies in modern-day America officially declared their independence from Great Britain.
This revolutionary war lasted just under eight years until the Treaty of Paris in 1783 after the capture of 4,000 British troops at siege ofYorktown.
The declaration document was signed among others by Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.
When asked what Independence Day commemorates, one woman suggestedvictory in the Civil War.
Another confused citizen guessed thatthe document was signed in 1984 and was signed byUS President Abraham Lincoln (he was born 33 years later in 1809).
Thecountry America was declaring its independence from also proved a tough question withmany interviewees left stumped.

FGM cutter: When youre cut you wont be a slut looking for men like a prostitute
Rachel Wills for Metro.co.uk Thursday 2 Jul 2015 6:10 pm

Women who carry out female genital mutilation operations  which in extreme cases can involve sewing up the vagina  have spoken out about why they do it.
It is illegal in many countries but two women who perform the procedure said they have no plans to stop and expect to see more girls in the upcoming cutting season.
Some families use the school summer holidays to book their children in for the operation, when girls will be pinned down and have parts of their genitals forcibly cut out to stop them experiencing sexual pleasure.
Half-blind Anna-Moora Ndege, aged 86, has been a cutter in Kenya for more than 70 years and uses a razor blade on her victims.
(Picture: MailOnline)
MORE: Think your kids wouldnt let strangers into your home? This video might make you think again
She told MailOnline : Girls are cut to ensure they remain faithful because the sexual organ is not there anymore.
When you are cut you will not be a slut looking for men here and there like a prostitute.
You are docile, waiting for your husband because after you are cut, sex is for having children not for anything else.
In Europe there are an estimated 700,000 victims of FGM, with around 140,000 in the UK and 100,000 in France.
Despite it beingillegal in many countries, the practice still continues as people think their daughters need the operation to find a husband and will be outcast if they dont have it. One tribal leader claimed girls cannot control their emotions if they keep their normal genitals.

Another cutter, 62-year-old Agnes Kerubo, said: Circumcision is an important festival. Its a celebration like Christmas. It unites people. There is feasting and drinking and dancing.
When you are cut thats when you can grow healthily into a woman because the bad blood is not there anymore. In the body there is good blood and bad blood. After a girl is cut the bad blood is gone.
British victim Nimco Ali, 31, had the operation as a child
She said: Everyone thinks its not the girl in Manchester, in Cardiff or London being taken away and having FGM but its exactly these girls, they are not girls who are immigrants or here on holiday.
They are the girl at the back of your classroom or the girl you could bump into on Oxford Street but you dont know they have just been through FGM.
Anti-FGM campaigner Ester Ogeto said: Families worry that their girls will be made outcasts and be shunned if they are not cut.
She would be called names  told that she was smelly, told that her organ would grow until it touched the floor.
Cutters Agnes Kerubo and Anna-Moora Ndege (Picture: MailOnline)
Dixion Kibagendia, a cultural leader of Kenyas Kisi tribe, claimed if Africans dont undergo the barbaric practice they will become slaves of the West.
He said of women who have not been cut: These girls have no discipline and show no respect towards their relatives. The families become isolated in their own community, they become lost from their own culture and traditions.
In Africa culture is everything. If you are out of the culture you are lost from the community. Not being circumcised is a cultural taboo. Someone who is without their culture is a slave to another culture.

Supermodel Waris Dirie had the operation and now campaigns against it
In her horrific ordeal, her genitalia was cut and her vagina sewn up using thorns.
She said: The society I grew up in, girls and women are not respected. They [men] can abuse you, misuse you, rape you, mutilate you, beat you up and dismiss you, if they want.
People believe a girl will not be faithful if she develops any sexual feelings or pleasure.
Therefore they destroy the girls sexuality in cutting her genitals. It is the worst form of child abuse.

Thishomeless mans beautiful piano playing has been shared thousands of times around the world.
Now widower Donald Gould hopes his son might see the video and finally get in touch.
Passers-by have been stopping in awe to hear him play, with one woman so amazed to hear the perfect music as she walked down the Florida street that she uploaded a video to YouTube.
Interviewed the day afterwards, Donald asked: You got how many hits on that?

MORE: This amazing woman has spent 45,000 saving 800 dogs from the Chinese dog meat festival
He plays the piano almost every day it is there, and saidhis skills on the piano and were self-taught and he has been homeless for around six or seven years.
Hoping someone will see the video and offer him a job playing or teaching music, the interviewer adds: You have an amazing gift that is really important for this world.
People are now trying to crowdfund enough money for Donaldto get a home, car and the qualifications he needs to teach music.
The former marine lost custody of his three-year-old son when he became a drug addict following his wifes sudden death in 1998, a Florida television channel reported.
They took our child away from us, and my wife took a handful of morphine pills and died. She just went to sleep, he said. I couldnt keep it together and eventually social services got tired of it and they terminated my parental rights. Everyday its painful. Theres not a day thats gone by since they took him from me that I havent thought about him. He turned 18 last August 24th. I wish he would come and find me.

Widower Donald trained as a clarinet player (again, self taught) and thought he would try his handon the piano and just try to collect a few dollars to support him through the day, never imagining his music might move people to tears across continents.
He is not the first homeless virtuoso to gain overnight fame:26-year-old Alan Donaldsonplayed a stunning version of Beethovens Fur Elise while he was soaking wet, with his drenched sleeping bag over his shoulders in Newcastle Station in May.

Of course if there are aliens living on Pluto, they better have some pretty warm coats, because the planets average temperature is somewhere between-233 to -223C, making it nearly impossible for life to exist there.
New Horizons will be making a close flyby of Pluto on July 14, however it will not get a good look at the dark spots as they will be on the opposite side of the planet.
Britains Schindler who saved 669 children from the Holocaust dies aged 106
Dr Alan Stern,New Horizons principal investigator, said: Its a real puzzle  we dont know what the spots are, and we cant wait to find out.
The images have also given doubt to the theory that Pluto and Charon are the products between two earlier bodies in the solar system, by showing how different they are in colour.
Dr Sternsaid the longstanding and dramatic difference in the colours and appearance of Pluto compared to its darker and greyer moon Charon were puzzling.

Matt Payton for Metro.co.uk Thursday 2 Jul 2015 4:23 pm
Children are taught from a very young age not to speak to strangers.
But it appears from this video by Joey Salads as though the lesson just doesnt sink in.
Hespoke to two setsof parents to seeif their young children would allow him, a total stranger, to enter the family home.
The scary result was that in all cases he was happily invited inside by the children after explaininghe wasa friend of the family.
Joeyasked parents to watch the video and remind their children of the necessity of being careful when opening the front door.

This is not the first stranger danger video, Mr Salads has created.
He previously tested children to see if they would leave a public playground with him (once again with the parents permission) and the results were exactly the same.

This is the incredible moment strangers catch two women who jump from a burning building.
Dramatic footage shows an inferno rip through homes in Sandy Springs, Georgia, US.
Thick black smoke is seen billowing from a shattered window where two men are standing below.
They encourage the pair to jump from the raging blaze and into their arms.
A huge thud is heard as the first woman leaps from the house  but her fall is softened by the heroes.
Nearly 30 people have been left without a home after the fire which is still being investigated.
There are no reports of injury.

The chaotic scene in Washington (Picture: Sky)
Investigators have found no evidence of a shooter at the Navy Yard in Washington.
The campus wason lockdown amid unconfirmed reports of an active gunman on the military facility, the scene of a deadly shooting two years ago, the US Navy said.
Washington police said in a statement that someone had called from inside a Navy Yard building to report possible sounds of gun shots around 7.30am. However, investigators found no sign of a shooting, and no one was hurt.
A Navy officer who was inside the complex told CNN people scrambled for cover after hearing someone shout to get out of the building and stay away from the cafeteria.
But Lieutenant Commander Scott Williams said he heard no shots or saw any signs of a struggle.
We heard someone scream, get out of the building, stay away from the cafeteria and we saw everyone running for the exits or adjoining offices, he said.
The area is on lock down (Picture: CNN)
The Navy, which told people at the site to shelter in place, said via Twitter that no incident can be confirmed as of yet.
NavyYard Lockdown/shelter continues. No further info at this time. More to follow, it said.
Police cars converged on the scene in southeast Washington, and television images showed a huge traffic jam outside the complex.
Authorities stepped up security outside the White House, closing the pedestrian mall that runs along Pennsylvania Avenue and the adjoining Lafayette Square.
The Navy has yet to fully comment on the incident (Picture: Sky)
The campus was the scene of a mass shooting in 2013 (Picture: CNN)
The Navy Yard was the scene of a September 2013 shooting that saw a lone gunman fatally shoot 12 people before being killed himself in a shootout with police.
The Navy Yard houses offices of the US Navy and is the headquarters for a number of naval operations.
The incident comes with the United States on heightened alert ahead of the July 4 national holiday.
The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center have warned the public of an increased risk of attack during Independence Day weekend.

Dong-Pyou Han manipulated blood samples (Picture: AP)
A former university scientist who manipulated blood samples to make it look as if he was on the verge of finding a vaccine for HIV has been sentenced to four years in prison.
Dyong-Pyou Han, 58, mixed human blood with rabbit blood while working under Michael Cho at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 2008, a process that caused the rabbits to develop antibodies towards HIV, which was considered a major breakthrough.
Han continued to alter the blood samples to avoid disappointing his mentor, but he was found out in 2013 when a group of Harvard University researchers discovered the rabbit blood had been spiked with human antibodies.
Today, Han was ordered to pay $7.2million (4.6million) to the federal government agency that funded the research and was sentenced to four years in prison.

Here, there is little reason to believe that Dr. Han has not already been deterred from any future criminal conduct, his lawyer, Joseph Herrold, said.
His conduct is aberrational in an otherwise admirable life.
US attorney Nicholas A. Klinefeldt pushed for prison time so that Han would serve as a deterrent to others.
It is important that we stand up not just for punishing the fraud committed against the United States government, but for the research that should be legitimately taking place on this devastating disease, he said.

(Picture: Pew Research Centre)
People in every other country surveyed thought Germans were the hardest working and most trustworthy, but Greeks shunned Ms Merkel and instead put themselves top in surveys of attitudes averaged between 2012 and 2013.
Could it be anything to do with Germany demanding strict economic reforms from the country, hit so hard by the economic crash it may end up leaving the Euro?
Just look at her frolicking  no way Germans are heartless(Picture: EPA/Michael Kappeler/Pool)
This Sunday Greeks will vote in a referendum on whether to put in place more economic reforms demanded by Eurozone leaders, but finance minister Yanis Varoufakis would prefer to see ministers restructure the countrys debt so it doesnt have to pay back so much in bail-out funds full stop.
Perhaps thats why Greeks listed Germany as most arrogant and least compassionate in this 2013 survey, also by Pew Research Centre:
Greeks and Germans have had a falling out (Picture: Alamy)
Perhaps we should take the results with some scepticism though, as at number 2 on the least compassionate list came Britain. Surely not.

Note: Do none of the below and enjoy a long and successful career.
These are some of the most bizarre and outrageous reasons line managers have called for intimidate dismissal. And some are completely fair.
Marrying a dog

A US man was fired after posting a picture of him and his dog on Facebook.
In the caption,Ryan Uhler said he would marry his dog. He made the comment to celebratethe recent Supreme Court decision on gay marriage.
But the dog lover claims he lost his job over it.

The man who couldnt resist that itch has been sacked.
He was spotted in Pizza Hut giving extra cheese to customers.
Boasting about hitting a cyclist on the way to work
Social media is our undoing. But only if you post stupid things like this.
Rayhan Qadar was fired from his job at Bristol investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown after telling the world he hit a cyclist on the way to work.
Defending FHRITP live on TV
Remember this guy? He appeared live on TV after a football match and tried to defend the phrase f*** her right in the p**** to a reporter.
His comments were the pinnacle of douchebaggery and he was fired from his $100,000-a-year job.

When you are playing for a pot of $6,400 (4,098), dodgy decks of cards is not what you wantat all.
This is exactly what happened during the second day of the Super High Rollers Cash game in Las Vegas.
The players had been dealt their hands and placed their initial bets when the commentators noticed the dealer had produced two queens of clubs in the flop.
What is the Flop?
The Flop is the first three cards dealt by the dealer in the game of poker and is followed by another round of bets.

Competitor, Doug Polk, was the first at the table to notice the mistake in the flop notifying the dealer.
As pokernews.com reported, Polk cant be too upset as he ended up scoopingthe pot takinghis winnings to a whopping $255,000 (163,314).
In accordance to the rules, the hand was voided and the bets returned to each of the respective players before the decks were changed and the game continued.

Ashleigh near the churchyard where she was raped (Picture: PA)
An 18-year-old woman has spoken for the first time about how she was raped in a churchyard by a manwho forced her to call him master.
Adam Riding called Ashleigh Roscow fat and a little rape victim as he attacked her in a graveyard near her home in Southport, Merseyside, on May 17.
Miss Roscow, who has agreed to waive her right to anonymity to encourage other victims of sexual offences to come forward, told how she was on a night out with friends when she met Riding in a bar.
The pair got talking and sat on a bench near the graveyard.
MORE: Man raped and killed his mum while high on cocaine
Riding tried to kiss her and Miss Roscow ran off. He chased her, punched her in the back of the head and dragged her into the cemetery.
Then he raped me, she said. It was horrific.Throughout it all he made me call him master.
I thought I was going to die.
Adam Riding was sentenced to more than ten years in prison (Picture: PA)
After the attack Riding ordered Miss Roscow to walk naked down the street.
She refused, so he took hold of her mobile phone and bra.
I pretended to be his friend, she recalled. Even though I was in shock I knew I needed to stay calm.So I acted like I was interested in him and invited him back to my house.
But when they walked to Miss Roscows home she escaped and ran to a stranger and begged for help.
The police were called and he was arrested and charged.
It emerged Riding was already on the Sex Offenders Register at the time of the attack.
MORE: Woman held down another woman while friend raped her
She continued: I was punched until I was black and blue.I couldnt sleep my injuries were so painful.I didnt leave the house on my own because I felt too vulnerable.
I just felt like a prisoner in my own body.When I found out he had already tried to attack a stranger I was disgusted.
At the trial in December 2014 at Liverpool Crown Court Riding pleaded guilty to two counts of rape so Miss Roscow did not have to give evidence.
The court heard that four years before Riding, 24, of no fixed address, pushed a woman to the ground in Liverpool city centre shortly before 6am, banging her head on the ground.
He told her to be quiet and climbed on top of her saying he wanted sex and repeatedly punched her.
Riding was jailed for ten-and-a-half years.

A man who downed ten pints, sexually harassed female colleagues and told his boss to f*** off has won an unfair dismissal case after he was fired.
The outrageous scenes unfolded at a Christmas party (where else?), an employment tribunal heard.
The team leader at a road building firm, who has not been named, was sacked in January.
But interestingly, the Fair Work Commission (FWC) ruled that office conduct cannot be maintained at parties where alcohol is available.

Adam Hatcher, FWCvice-president, said his party conduct was isolated and aberrant in nature.
The ruling has spooked firms down under, and it could lead to a ban on alcohol at future work functions.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industrys Richard Clancy said the commissions ruling had re-ignited debate on the issue.

Its common for young children to have irrational fearsabout monsters hiding in the closet or under the bed.
For parents, the solution is to reassure their child that there is nothing to be afraid of.
So thats what Melissa Rodrigues, from Wellington, New Zealand, did for two consecutive nights last week when her three-year-old son complained of a man with a light outside his window.
(Picture: stuff.co.nz)
And then, on the third night, she heard a blood-curdling scream from her sons room.
Michelle and her husband rushed to the bedroom and the terrified toddler pointed to the window. The garden gate was open and there were footsteps in the frost.
MORE: Someone just nailed the perfect backflop
(Picture: stuff.co.nz)
The couple called police and set up a surveillance app on a smartphone called Salient Eye, which tracks movement and takes pictures.
At 4.40am the next night, the appstarted sending pictures through to Melissa and her husbandand, just like their three-year-old had said, there was a young man with a torch outside.
Police arrived and were able to track down the person in question  a teenage boy known to police for stealing cigarette butts.

To talk your way out of a parking ticket requires luck or, as onewoman proved, an eye for detail.
Andrea Cammelleri used the omission of a single comma in the local law to escape the fine on her pickup truck.
MORE: London parking fine letter apologises for any incontinence caused
The law inWest Jefferson, Ohio, lists several types of vehicles that cant be parked longer than 24 hours, including a motor vehicle camper, with the comma missing between vehicle and camper.
MsCammelleri successfully made the argument in the12th Ohio District Court of Appeals that her truck did not fit this motor vehicle camper description.

Judge Robert Hendrickson didstatethat the phrase was made clear in context but advised West Jefferson to rectify the mistake to prevent the repeated use of thisloophole.

A shop owner man put up a sign reading NO GAYS ALLOWED in the window of his hardware shop but it seems to have backfired, prompting so many bad reviews on Yellow Pages that the feature was suspended.

A Facebook page has been set up urging people to boycott the shop.
This would look better in the window, we think (Picture: Getty)
The owner has removed the sign and replaced it with another,trying to make the same offensive message sound better: We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who would violate our rights of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Captain Liao mistakenly switched off the planes only working engine (Picture: Rex)
The pilot of a crashed plane that killed 43 people mistakenly switched off the planes only working engine moments before the fatal collision.
Only 15 passengers on the TransAsia Airways flight from Taipei to Kinmen survived after the ATR 72-600 crashed upside down into a shallow river on 4 February after losing control, lurching between buildings and finally clipping an overpass.
And a report by Taiwans Aviation Safety Council (ASC) found that pilot Liao Jian-zong, 41, mistakenly switched off the planes only working engine seconds before the crash, saying Wow, pulled back the wrong side throttle.
MORE: It took police six days to work out man who died from gunshot wounds didnt die from natural causes

The report also found that Captain Liao had failed his simulator training back in May 2014, in part because he did not know how to deal with an engine failure on take-off.
All three pilots and 40 passengers and crew died in the crash.
Liao, a former air force pilot, had a total of 4,914 flight hours on ATR 72 planes. Reports from a failed simulated testfrom May last year showed he was prone to be nervous and displayed a lack of confidence, although he passed the same test a month later and was promoted to captain.

A Saudi prince is giving 28billion to charity.
We dont need to tell you thats a ridiculous sumof money.
Its also the entirety  more or less  ofPrince Al-Waheed bin Talals personal fortune.
The Saudi business magnate  thought to be the worlds 20th richest person  is a major shareholder in Citigroup and 21st Century Fox, and the owner of Kingdom Holding Company.

He has been called the Arabian Warren Buffett, and it seems that like his American counterpart, he wantsto give back.
The 60-year-oldhopes his donation will build a better world of tolerance, acceptance, equality and opportunity for all.
He adds that he hopes to build bridges to foster cultural understanding, develop communities, empower women, enable youth, provide vital disaster relief and create a more tolerant and accepting world.
The prince wants to give back to Saudi Arabia first and foremost (Picture: Getty Images)
We cant argue with that.
The Prince says he will donate the majority of his wealth to Saudi Arabia since most of his wealth was achieved from this blessed country but money will also extend to countries around the world.
Of course, 28billion out of 28.5-or-so billion still leaves you with a cool 500million to play with, and the Saudi princes many business interests will continue to make him millions, so his donation wont leave him living in poverty.
But that doesnt devalue the gesture, whichcould make a huge difference to many peoples lives.

A technician has been killed by a robot at a Volkswagen plant near Kassel, Germany.
A 21-year-old external contractor and a colleague wereinstalling the robot at the Baunatal plant when it suddenly struckhim in the chest and crushedhim against a metal plate, AP reports.
The man later died of his injuries.
According to Volkswagen spokesman Heiko Hillwig, the robot was not one of the a new generation of lightweightworkers designed to work alongside workers.
He added that investigations were ongoing, but initial conclusions indicated that human error was to blame rather than a technical defect.
Robots are usually kept behind safety cages and fatalities of this kind are rare. In this instance, the 21-year-old was inside the safety cage, the FT reports.

So he decided to play a game.
On his website, Mobster said: I noticed that graffiti painted within the red area was buffed with red paint. However, graffiti outside of the red area would be removed via pressure washing. This prompted the start of an experiment.
Unlike other works, I was very uncertain as to what results it would yield. Here is what transpired over the course of a year.

A toddler died as his mother pushed him on a swing for two days, police have said.
Concerned locals in SouthMaryland, US, contacted authorities when they noticed Romechia Simms pushing the lifeless body of three-year-old JiAire Donnell Leein La Plata park, Charles County.
According to Charles County Sheriffs Office, Ms Simms had been pushing him on the swing since the pair went to the park 44 hours before. An autopsy found the toddler had died of dehydration and hypothermia, and the death was ruled a homicide.
Ms Simms reportedly suffers from mental illness, and her mother took to Facebook to defend her daughters actions as those of an unwell woman, not a calculated murderer.

She posted a picture of JiAire and announced she would be setting up a charity in his honour.
It does take a village to raise a child. And yes, we are our brothers and sisters keepers. Each and every life has meaning and a purpose, she wrote.
Those that suffer from mental illness may life a very lonely and unproductive life if they dont receive the resources, support and love that is needed.
It could be a mother, father, sister, brother, a child, a family member or yourself. Mental illness touches every family in this country. Lets not shun them or look down upon them because it could be you.

An Australian woman suffering from amnesia may havebeen found in California.
The woman, who was described in an Interpol listing as an unidentified missing person, is in her 50s, 1.7m tall and 91kg in weight. She was found by Southern California firefighters on 1 February in dire conditions.
And Australian Federal Police have now confirmed they are cooperating with US authorities to determine whether the missing person is in fact an Australian woman suffering from something called retrograde amnesia, a type of memory loss that comes afteran injury or disease.
The result of this is that some memories are intact. In the case of this woman, many of her memories are from Perth, Cottesloe Beach, New South Wales and Cairns in Queensland, Byron Bay, and Hawaii.

She also speaks with an Australian-sounding accent, authorities said.
NCB [National Central Bureau] Canberra is working cooperatively with US authorities as well as its domestic and international partners in an effort to identify the woman, a spokeswoman said.
A Facebook page, Found Woman with Amnesia  Help Find Her Family , includes entries from the woman herself.
The amnesia I have is called retro amnesia and doctors have seen this before with the kind of antibodies that were found on the small volleyball-sized tumor that was on my ovary, she wrote.

People in Saudi Arabia arevery angry about this bad-taste selfie.
A photo taken by a teenager next to his dead grandfather has shocked the country and prompted an investigation by Saudi authorities.
Angry social media users called for a probe into the immoral selfie  called Good Bye, Grandfather  and urged hospital officials to investigate how a child managed to take a picturein the room.
The health authorities in Madinah are looking into the case and assessing whether the selfie was taken at a hospital in the area, Abdul Razak Hafedh, the head of public relations and media in the Madinah area, was quoted as saying by Gulf News .

Should that be the case, action will certainly be taken against all culprits for allowing or failing to prevent such an immoral act.
The security authorities will also be alerted to take action against the teenager for his irresponsible behaviour and for his violation of public morals.
The teenagers behaviour was punishable by law, a lawyer told the news site.
It is a terrible provocation of common feelings and a flagrant violation of public morals, he said.

When Girl Scouts USA were offered $100,000 (60,000) by a mystery donor, they were delighted.
But then they read the caveat: that it must not be used to support transgender girls.
So Girl Scouts gave the money back, along with a message: Girl Scouts is for every girl and every girl should have the opportunity to be a Girl Scout if she wants to.
It was a matter of principle over pragmatism, and Girl Scouts commitment to inclusivity struck a chord with thousands worldwide.

Within two days, nearly 5,000 people haddonated, raising a total of $250,000 (158,000)  a figure that is still rising.
Our vision at Girl Scouts of Western Washington is that EVERY girl in our region regardless of her race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity or geographic location is empowered to unleash her potential, build her future and transform her world, the IndieGoGo page reads.
The group said on Tuesday that the money would allow at least 1,000 girls to fully participate in all of the many life-changing experiences that Girl Scouts has to offer, i100 reports.

A Syrian terror group appears to be playing Isis at its own sick game, releasing an execution video in which dozens of jihadi militants are shot dead.
Jaysh al-Islam, the self-proclaimed Army of Islam, reportedly commands as many as 25,000 militants who fight a war on two fronts against the Islamic State and the Syrian regime.
In a video released today, Jaysh al-Islam fighters lead shackled jihadis dressed in orange jumpsuits to a path lined with trees, force the prisonersto kneel and then shoot them in the backs of their heads.

Allah did not make a disease without appointing a remedy to it, a commander announces.
Jaysh al-Islam operates out of war-ravaged Damascus. Their war against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is reportedly funded by Saudi Arabia,and the terror group boasts well-armed and well-trained troops as well as armoured tanks and other high-tech equipment.
The group is the result of the merging of over 50 factions wary of the growing power of Al-Qaeda and Isis in the country.

Someones worked out a way to make some cash out of a possible Grexit.
Predictably, that someone is from Europes foremost economic superpower, Germany.
Clearly not one to miss an opportunity, entrepreneur Uwe Dahlhoff has trademarked the word Grexit and plans to launch an alcohol drink with its name.

The lemon-flavoured vodka drink may be on shelves in Germany in just a few days. It will have a 16 percent alcohol content and bear Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and finance minister Yanis Varoufakis clinking bottles underneath the concerned face of Angela Merkel on itslabel.
The drink  which could retail for just0.59 (42p)  has the tagline sauer macht lustic (even sour fruit is good), a saying that roughly equates to the English expression when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Mr. Dahlhoff calls his drink a form of satire, and says hes aware that some people will not get the joke. He should be, as in the past he has mocked former chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Communist leader Erich Honecker with the drinks Helmuts Pear and Erichs Revenge.

Conspiracy theorists were left devastated when a UFO-shaped object over Dublin, Ireland, turned out to be a cloud.
Alien-lovers took to the internet when a picture of the UFO was uploaded by student Carla Whelan, 18.
But alas, the object in the sky was not a sign of an impending alieninvasion but a lenticular cloud, which is formed when rushing moist airruns into a mountain or hill, is forced upwards and then condenses on the downward slope.
I first saw the cloud at about five to 11 this morning and it was smaller at first and got bigger as the morning went on, Carla told the Mirror .

Eerie goings-on at this cafe in Lincolnshire.
When the owner of Larders Coffee House thought hed spotted a burglar on CCTV, he called the police who dashed to the scene armed with tasers.
But it turned out to be a ghost.
*Haunting music*
Four officers arrived at the cafe at 10.30pm last Wednesday but found no sign of a break-in.
After examining the eerie CCTV footage again, Michael Bristow is convinced his coffee shop must be haunted.

He said: The CCTV infrared sensors detected movement so something strange is going on.
Ive looked at it several times on a larger screen and there are dark figures in the room and strange movements.
It appears to show an average height figure wearing a T-shirt walking out of shot and a ripple appears on the camera.
He continued: When police arrived they found no burglar and no sign of a forced entry. Nothing was stolen and nothing was disturbed, the police told me it must have been a ghost.

Some of the girls who work here have noticed strange goings-on before.
A spokeswoman for Lincolnshire Police said: The owner of the coffee shop reported seeing a blur on the CCTV.
The place was extensively checked and there was no sign of a break-in or suspicious activity, so it has been classed as a false alarm.
Looks like a ghost after all.

Rogerio Zuniga, 54, ofSan Benito in Texas, was left with gaping wounds when the swarm attacked him this week.
He has driven his tractor into an irrigation pipe  home to a huge hive.

He got off the tractor and ran and apparently they caught up to him and he collapsed, and they stung his body to death.
The death has come as a shock to locals who are now fearing for their lives.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will accept all the bailout creditors conditions with only a handful of minor changes, a letter he sent yesterday reveals.
The two-page note was sent to the heads of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank, reports the Financial Times .
In the letter, Tsipras said that Athens would accept all reforms of his countrys added tax system with the caveat that a 30 percent discount would be brought in for Greek islands, many of which are difficult to supply because of their location.

The letter came as eurozone bankers prepared to increase pressure on Greece by restricting their access to emergency loans. The decision could topple at least one major Greek bank.
The bailout expired at midnight last night so an extension is no longer possible.
The new letter represents a significant shift in the Greek Premiers position and could serve as the basis of a new bailout, the FT reports.The new proposals will be discussed by eurozone finance ministers in a conference call at4.30pm BST.

Scientists believe they have found a link betweeneye colour and alcohol dependency.
The study, bygenetic researchers at the University of Vermont, found that people with blue eyes are more likely to become alcoholics.
The work was led by Arvis Sulovari, a doctoral student in cellular, molecular and biological sciences, and Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Dawei Li, Ph.D.
Li began his research in 2012 and built up a data base of 10,000 African Americans and European Americans. All of which had beendiagnosed with at least one psychiatric illness or an addiction like alcohol dependency.
The study was then narrowed down to1,263people struggling with alcohol addiction.

Now we definitely do not condone breaking the law.
But if you arethat sort of person, why on earth would you film yourself doing it?
Police in British Columbia, Canada, must have had a field day when they discovered a motorcyclist they pulled over for speeding had filmed his entire ride on his GoPro and had committed numerous other infractions.
Delta Police Traffic Section pulled over the motorcyclist when he registered 213kmh (132.5mph) on a laser speed camera.
When they watched the riders GoPro footage, they found he had in fact hit 220kmh, as well as split traffic by driving between rows of cars and weaved in and out of vehicles at considerable risk to himself and road-users.
The motorcyclist apparently learnt his lesson, and signed a release allowing police to publish the footage as a warning to other motorists.

You might be 20/20, but how good is your colour vision?
iGame has created a test that tells you how good your ability to detect colouris in animal terms.
For each round of the game, one box in a series of four or more will be slightly discoloured, and this boxs colour becomes increasingly similar to the predominant colour with each play.
The colour vision ranking begins with bat (0-4 correct answers) to hawk (25-29 correct answers).
Its much harder than you might think.

A man was overwhelmed with emotion as he returned home to his family after 22 years in slavery.
As a teenager, MyintNaing was tricked into becoming a slave on a fishing boat and told he would never see his family again.
When he eventually returned home to his native Myanmar, the emotion was almost too much to bear. For his mother, it was too much and she had to revived by neighbours after she collapsed.

Sadly, Myints story is not unique. In 1993, an agent promised him a job in Thailand that would allow him to feedhis poverty-stricken family back home for a year in a matter of weeks.
But after arriving in Thailand, he was stripped to Tual, a far corner of Indonesia known for its rich fishing grounds.
He regularly worked 24 hours a day on small amounts of food and water.
When he begged his captain to let him go, he was chained to the ship and left to die.
Mying Naing was told he would never return home (Picture: AP)
He escaped twice, at one point living in the jungle and growing vegetables.
His freedom only came following an expos by the Associated Press that prompted thousands of fishing slaves to be freed.
The fishing industry is a billion-pound trade. According to AP, much of the fish caught by slaves ends up in major supermarkets worldwide.

Who is burning black churches?
Thats the question spreading across the internet following the news of a seventh predominantly black church fire since nine African-Americans were shot in Charleston two weeks ago.
Dylann Roof is alleged to have opened fire on black churchgoers at the EmanuelAME church on 17 June, killing nine.

The Churches Hit
College Hill Seventh Day Adventist Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, which caught fire on 22 June. The fire department said the cause of the fire was deliberate.
Gods Power Church of Christ in Macon, Georgia, which was set alight on 23 June. Investigators are treating it as arson.
Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was destroyed on 24 June. Investigators are treating it as arson.
Glover Grove Baptist Church in Warrenville, South Carolina which was set ablaze on 26 June. Investigators say the cause is undetermined.
The Greater Miracle Apostolic Holiness Church in Tallahassee, Florida, burned to the ground last week. Fire officials said the cause was likelyan electrical fault.
Fruitland Presbyterian Church in Gibson county, Tennessee, which caught fire on 24 June. Investigators say it may have been caused by a lightning strike.
And though the cause of the seven fires since the incident is unknown, social media users have suggestedit is too unusual to be coincidental.
The most recent fire, at Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church, was infamously burned down by the Ku Klux Klan in 1995, and happened just 65 miles from Charleston.
Social media users have also hit out at the media coverage of thefires. @GermanCityGirl writes:If someone was burning down churches attended by white folk, news would cover it.

Greece is on the brink offinancial meltdown after becoming the first developed country to default on an IMF loan.
The nations left-wing Syriza government  elected on an anti-austerity platform  have been desperately trying to strike a deal and stave off economic disaster as conditions in the country rapidly worsen, with reports thathospital patients are having to undergo surgery without painkillers such is the damage to the public sector.

And the international crisis escalated today after the deadline for Greece to repay 1.6billion in debt passed.
The eurogroup of ministers will hold a conference call at 10.30am BST to discuss another proposal from Athens  but there are doubts progress can be made after German chancellor Angela Merkel refused to consider releasing emergency funds from the eurozone stability mechanism.

Meanwhile, global markets are bracing themselves for a possible Grexit, which is becomingincreasingly likely. The FTSE dropped almost 100 points yesterday in its second consecutive day of major losses.
In a national poll on Sunday, Greeks will vote on whether to deepen spending cuts and raise tax. Rejection will effectively mean Greece leaving the eurozone  and possibly the EU  though prime minister Alexis Tsipras.

Bill Levin initially planned for weed to be smoked at the service (Picture: Church of Cannabis)
The Church of Cannabiswill hold its first ever service today.
But no-one will smoke weed.
Strange, you might think, given that the sole purpose of such a church iscelebrating the stuff. Which would involve smoking it.

First Church of Cannabis founder Bill Levin had initially said that smoking weed would be part of the service despite warnings from local authorities that churchgoers would be arrested.
But Levin changed his mind on Monday, writing on Facebook that the church did not want to fight the case in criminal court.
Right now, we do not want to address this in criminal court because its not a strong hand, he wrote.

He added that his lawyers would file a civil suit after the law goes in to effect.
Those planning to attend the service were not impressed, and accused Levin of surrendering to scare tactics.

Civil disobedience is an honorable tactic that often works where other less confrontational methods fail, one wrote on Facebook.

Tunisian authorities suspectthese two men could have helped plan the beach massacre which claimed the lives of 39 holidaymakers on Friday.
They dont believe gunman Seifeddine Rezgui organised last Fridays attack alone and now want to find Bin Abdallah and Rafkhe Talari, pictured above.
The two are accused of helping Rezgui with his attack on defenceless tourists by providing weapons and offering advice on logistics.
People were relaxing on sunbeds in the North African resort town of Sousse before thekiller opened fire on them, having allegedly hidden his weapon in a parasol.

Police are already quizzing seven suspects, and one of Tunisias top security officials has confirmed Rezgui trained in neighbouring Libya at the same time as the attackers who killed 22 tourists at the Bardo museum in March.
Attempts to crack down on the terror threat in Tunisia are underway, withTunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi saying there will be armed police on beaches. Some 80 unregulated mosques believed to preach radical doctrines have been closed.
The so-called Islamic State, known as Daesh in the Middle East, claimed responsibility for the massacre and has called for more attacks throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends on July 17.
Downing Street confirmed that 21 Britons have been identified as victims ofshooting.
Tunisian president Essebsi told Europe 1 radio : It is true we were surprised by this affair. They took measures for the month of Ramadan but never did they think the attack would be on the beaches against tourists, and the system of protection was set to start July 1.
Prime minister David Cameron said the government is working closely with the families of those killed in Sousse, and has offered to arrange for the bodies of their loved ones to be flown by RAF plane to the UK.

A single inquest covering all the British victims is to be opened by the eest London coroner.
All wounded Britons are now back home, four of them severely injured.
Media reports linked Rezgui to Islamist extremists in the UK. The Daily Mail said the gunman was linked to Saifallah Ben Hassine , a fanatic who was based in London for at least three years and a disciple of the cleric Abu Qatada.
Claims have also emerged that Rezgui was part of a five-man terror cell which has been in existence for four years. A fellow student told Sky News that he loved everything (Islamic State) stood for.
Meanwhile, police, soldiers, emergency services and intelligence officials were taking part in Londons largest counter-terrorism exercise today . The two-day operation, planned before the Tunisia attack, is testing the response to a mass firearms attack in the capital.

Indian local council member Ratan Lal Jat, 35, married a six-year-old girl (Picture: Cover Asia Press)
Disturbing pictures have emerged which appearto show a 35-year-old councillor marrying a six-year-old girl.
Ratan Lal Jat, 35, is an elected local member of the Gangrar village council, in Rajasthan, West India.
On June 23, its thought that Ratan Lal Jat wed the extremely young child bride in front of five witnesses in a secret village temple ceremony.
Local marriage broker Jamuni Bai  notorious for arranging such marriages for fees  was said to be present.
Police explained that Ratan Lal Jats unsettling ceremony was to fulfil the requirements of Nata Pratha.
Anancient local custom, Nata Pratha dictates that any married man can have an affair with a married woman if he provides financial compensation, the two lovers must both be wed.
Because Ratan Lal Jat was single, he married the six-year-old girl in order to comply with the age-old tradition.

Brace yourselves Mormon allies are coming.
Thats the message of one group from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , fighting for everyone to have the same rights to love and a family life.
Theyre bored of hearing about Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve and say they have seen the light when it comes to LGBT rights.
It seems a split could be deepening within the religion, founded in19th Century America with more than12 million members world-wide, asthe official Mormon line following the Supreme Court ruling in the US legalising gay marriage in every state is:
The Courts decision does not alter the Lords doctrine that marriage is a union between a man and a woman ordained by God.
Pink News reported Mormons for Equality executive director Spencer W. Clark saying:
For over two decades Mormons have feared  and fought  civil marriage equality.It will take time to overcome and repent of our past, but as weve seen already, the more that we come to know same-sex couples and their children, the more we discover that our fears were misplaced.
Mormons believe in the importance of families, and for increasing numbers of Mormons, that means all families.

So while you might be enjoying a comfortable 21C outside, your dog could be suffering temperatures of up to 37C if locked in a car for just 20 minutes.
Even if you leave a window cracked open the temperature inside car can rise drastically over a short period of time, so the safest option is to not leave dogs in car at all.
Keep in mind that a child can die of heatstroke if their body temperature rises to 41C, and the average dog will die if left in a car that reaches 38C (this would only take half an hour if the outside temperature is 21C).
Cant bear to be apart from your canine companion during the hot weather? Heres some more tips and advice:
Reddit user ninjaspy123 suggests hydrating your dog (or dogs) properly before you go out to protect them against the heat.
If Im going out on a hike (hard to carry a lot of water), Ill give my dog a bowl of water with a 1/4 or 1/2 cup of low sodium Beef or Chicken Stock, they advise.
Dog chugs it down, we hit the trail and I can be have faith she isnt desperate for water as quickly as normal.
They claim this tip was actually suggested by a vet  however make sure the water contains STOCK, and not broth (broth contains onion which is bad for dogs).
Also make sure the stock contains no salt or bones, which can seriously harm your little pups insides.

Ever wondered what your child would do if they found a gun?
Thats the nightmarish scenario posed in a startling new video  which shows what happens when a group of children find a gun thats been left on a climbing frame in a play park.
And while the gun might be a dummy, the childrens curiosity gets the better of them as they pick up the weapon, and one youngster is heard to say shoot it.
(Picture: Joey Salads/YouTube)
One toddler is even seen to pick up the gun and climbs down from the frame with the weapon in hand  before running over to his mum.
You know what this is? Its a gun, she worriedly tells her son.
Its very very dangerous, you shouldnt pick it up.
The video is the work of provocative YouTuber Joey Salads, who previously tested whether young children would let him into their homes , and showed just how easy it is to have drugs slipped into your drink.

That tuna wasnt actually tuna (Picture: Getty)
Theres a chance that your last tuna sushi roll contained no tuna at all.
A study has revealed that nearly two-thirds oftuna sold at restaurants and stores in the US is a completely different type of fish.
In fact,non-profit organisationOceana found that 59 per cent of fish marketed as tuna was actually escolar.
And, alarmingly, this type of fish can lead to dangerous levels of diarrhoea because they feed on a fatty acid humans cant digest.
Cod and trout were among the other types of fish found in tuna cans.
Oceana ran tests on more than 1,200 tuna cans across the states.
The investigation found Southern California to be the worst offender with more than 50 per cent of tuna cans containing none at all.
Away from the supermarkets, sushi venues appear to be even worse. The study found that more than 70 per cent of venues mislabeled fish.

And heartache can lead you do make choices youre probably not proud of.
But  however tempted you may be  the best course of action probably does not involve slaughtering your mums chickens, documenting your crimes with acamera phone and then threatening to burn her house down.
Lovesick Hayden Smith, 18, wanted his mum to help him patch things up with his girlfriend.
Instead of asking totalk through their differences, he followed through on sadistic threats to kill one of his mothers chickens every 15 minutes unless shemended the broken relationshipwith his girlfriend. Wow, what a keeper.

Smith, from Alabama, gave his mother a noon deadline until he started slaughtering her chickens. He also threatened to burn down her house and kill any officers who turned up to investigate and commit suicide, according to the sheriffs office.
Smith sent his mother picture messages of each chicken he killed at 15 minute intervals. He managed to kill six before deputies arrived on the scene.
He was arrested on Thursday and charged with domestic violence third degree and criminal mischief.
Its not confirmed if he made up with his girlfriend. Were guessing no, TBH.

With his country on the brink of a potentially catastrophic financial collapse, Mr Tsipras appeared on national television to insist that the international creditors must respect the democratically-expressed will of the Greek people.
I expect them to respect this democratic process, not to kill democracy in its birthplace, he declared.
His defiance was sharply at odds with warnings by a series of European leaders that a No vote would see Greece heading out of the euro and possibly out of the European Union altogether.
The countrys current bailout expires today and without access to additional funds the radical left Syriza government will unable to make a 1.6 billion euro payment to the IMF, becoming the first developed country to miss such a commitment.

Uber is one step closer to taking over the world after buying Microsoft Bing mapping assets.
The firm is looking to lessen its reliance on Google Maps and the acquisition come just days after MicrosoftCEO Satya Nadella announced to staff in an email the company will be making tough decisions.
Around 100 of the Microsofts Bing Maps engineers will be moved to Uber after they were bought for an undisclosed sum.
A data centre, cameras and image-analysing software were also part of the deal.
An Uber spokesperson said: Were excited about the talent and technology this acquisition brings.

        <Description>Here are five other worst case scenarios that'll make you wish for an asteroid.</Description>

Sign the petition and save the world(Picture Rex)
Its Asteroid Day.
And in scenes that resemble a Hollywood film plot, you canhelp save the world from potential obliteration.
The Asteroid Days 100X Declaration, which anybody can sign on Change.org ,is a global petition to increase the speed and power of current asteroid detection measures.
Sure, the thought of a huge rock sparking Armageddon isnt ideal. But here are fiveother worst case scenarios thatll make you wish for an asteroid.
1.Global pandemic
(Picture: Getty)
While significant resources have been dedicated to medical research and combating disease, modern transport and dense populations allow infections to spread quickly.
A disease powerful enough to wipe out mankind would be incurable, fatal and extremely infectious. Sort of like a combination of Ebola, rabies and the common cold.
2. Supervolcano
Asupervolcano is defined as oneproducing an eruption 1,000 times larger than normal.
And rather than molten lava sent spewing over cities, the real danger is dust.
It would absorb the Suns rays and cause a global volcanic winter.
3. Artificial intelligence
(Picture: 20th Century Fox)
Thats right, just like i-Robot. Except therell be no Will Smith to save you from the deadly humanoid race.
Our guest to give consciousness to machines could eventually be our undoing when they uprise and take over the world.
4. Extreme climate change
Humans  were an awesome bunch. But we spew tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
This could increase the average global temperature  hitting third world countries the hardest.
Conditions would make parts of the world uninhabitable and cause mass death, famines and migration.
5. Synthetic life forms
(Picture: Barcroft)
Billionaire entrepreneur Craig Venter created artificial life for the first time in 2010 by adding synthetic DNA to another cell  christening his life form Synthia.
Professor Julian Savulescu, an Oxford University ethicist, said at the time: Venter is creaking open the most profound door in humanitys history, potentially peeking into its destiny.This could be used in the future to make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable. The challenge is to eat the fruit without the worm.

Are cakes really the frontline in politics?It appears so.
First we had bakers in court for refusing to ice a gay cake featuring Bert and Ernie , and now American supermarket giant Walmart has allegedly whipped up a tasty tribute to terrorist group Islamic State.
Chuck Netzhammer set out to prove a point on YouTube after the company refused to bake him a cake with the Confederate flag on. The red and white flag, dating back to the American civil war, is controversial for its association with slavery.
He wanted a cake showing this image:

When he didnt get it, he asked for this instead:
(Picture: YouTube/Chuck Netzhammer)
And hes not got a happy face (Picture: YouTube/Chuck Netzhammer)
But it seems the Walmart employee who made the cake simply did not recognise the Islamic State battleflag.
The supermarket said:
An associate in a local store did not know what the design meant and made a mistake. The cake should not have been made and we apologize.
Walmart banned confederate flag cakes after the racist attack on the Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 17 which killed nine people.
But Netzhammer claimed the symbol represented tradition, not racism.
Islamic State have taken over large parts of Syria and Iraq and probably wouldnt approve of anything as frivolous as a cake in any case.

Gina couldnt bear to leave Chris body behind
This British woman was shotin the face during the Tunisia beach massacre, but she could bear to let go of her husband.
Gina Van Dort, 30, and Chris Dyer, 32, were shot by a gunman wielding an AK47 at the Imperial Marhaba hotel in Sousse.
As paramedics tried desperately to get her to safety, Mrs Van Dort clung to Dyer, who died from a gunshot to the head.
She was left unable to speak after major facial trauma, but Mrs Van Dort found the strength to write a note to doctors asking for her wedding ring, which had been removed before tracheotomy surgery.

Recalling the moment she found her at the hotel, Dr Hajer Kraiem said: I went to the hotel and there were three victims dead and then I saw Gina, she was hugging her husband. She didnt want to leave him.
When we tried to bring her [to an ambulance] she held tighter. Maybe she didnt know he was dead.
Mrs Van Dort lost an eye and her voice after she suffered gunshot wounds and shrapnel injuries from a bomb or a grenade.
Later she found out shed been shot under the chin, the bullet travelled up exiting through her left eye.
Dr Kraiem added that Mrs Van Dort was very strong.
A total of 36 people were killed in the attack, so far18 have been formally identified as Brits but there are fears the number could be much higher.

Jim Boles has found evidence of helium leakage along a stretch of the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone in the Los Angeles Basin (Picture: UCSB)
It sounds like something straight from a big-budget disaster movie, but a huge fault in the Earths crust is leaking helium  and it could cause a devastating Earthquake.
The Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone lies in the Los Angeles basin and geologist Jim Boles found evidence that helium had been leaking across a 30-mile stretch of the fault line.
He made the findings after examining samples of gas from two dozen oil wells that ranged from LA to Orange County  and claims that his results are proof that the fault line is actually deeper than scientists had previously believed.
The results are unexpected for the area, because the LA Basin is different from where most mantle helium anomalies occur, Professor Boles explained.
Jim Boles found that the helium leak stretches forover 30 miles (Picture: UCSB)
The Newport-Inglewood fault appears to sit on a 30-million-year-old subduction zone, so it is surprising that it maintains a significant pathway through the crust.
He added: About 30 million years ago, the Pacific plate was colliding with the North American plate, which created a subduction zone at the Newport-Inglewood fault, Boles explained.
Then somehow that intersection jumped clear over to the present San Andreas Fault, although how this occurred is really not known.
This paper shows that the mantle is leaking more at the Newport-Inglewood fault zone than at the San Andreas Fault, which is a new discovery.
But Earthquake researchers have now taken Boles findings  and estimated that the likelihood of California experiencing an earthquake of magnitude 8 or higher in the next 30 years has risen from roughly 4.7 percent to 7 percent.
Scenes like this could become reality
Southern California Earthquake Center director Tom Jordan said: We are fortunate that seismic activity in California has been relatively low over the past century.
But we know that tectonic forces are continually tightening the springs of the San Andreas Fault system, making big quakes inevitable.

People are queuing at banks to draw out their money, politicians are meeting foremergency talks and the world is speculating on devastation if Greece leaves the Euro.
So whats left to do if youre Greek?
WellPretty much carry on as normal.
Posting on Reddit , people on the ground discussed what life is actually like behind the potentially historic headlines. One commenter said:
People here expect that we actually riot or something, burning everything and publicly executing our government on the Syntagma square [in Athens]. What we actually do is go to work, laugh about the people that surge ATMs and go on with our lives. Gonna hit the beach after work, so why worry?
I avoid news, Facebook and negative people these days. Im generally calm and collected but the idiocy is astounding. Dont worry though, this will blow over.

We either get out of the Eurozone (which means rebuilding our economy and returning to producing goods, stopping imports and a boost on exports and tourism) or we get a debt haircut and a new start. Either way its a win-win to me.
The worst thing possible would be to continue living in the zombie state that Greece has been plodding along for the past five years.
Referring to one of the countrys ancient philosophers he added: Since were at the point where we know we have to live frugally (which isnt bad in principle, Epicurus said that the surefire way to riches is to remove want) I dont mind going the extra mile (defaulting and starting over).

Everyone in the city seemed to be enjoying the fun, even the police.
One officer in particulardemonstrated his support for Gay Pride by grinding up on a dude like his life depended on it.
Onlookers cheered as the NYPD officer worked his magic, and he even gets a kiss and a sticker from his dance partner at the end.
The man he is dancing with is believed to be part of theLGBT Big Apple Softball League.

Disgraced health blogger who lied about having brain cancer claims shes a victim in TVinterview
Jimmy Nsubuga for Metro.co.uk Monday 29 Jun 2015 8:34 pm
If you lie about havingterminal brain cancer dont ever expect to get an easy ride on 60 minutes (or anywhere else).
Belle Gibson was chewed up yesterday night on Australian television, in her first TV appearance since revealing she never actually had the disease.
But rather than come clean and admit she had allegedlydeceived her followers, the 23-year-old wellness blogger claimed to be a victim as well.

She said she thought she had cancer because a man had seemingly used a magic box to diagnose her at home.
Gibson thought this man, who cannot be traced, was a real doctor (because thats how real doctors operate apparently).
Im not trying to get away with anything, she said.
But interviewer Tara Brown was having none of it and continued to ask her tough questions, including whether she thought it was right she should benefit financially from an app and cook book based on the supposed deceptions.
She added her followers had felt misled, especially those with cancer.
This seemed pointless however,as Gibson didnt seem to want to take responsibility.

White people can get away with things that black people cant.
Thats the theory that comedian Jessie Kahnweilerset out to testanyway, wondering whether her race is an automatic Get out of jail free card..
Watch her attempt to get arrested as she tries to deal antidepressants to police officers, play basketball in a public fountain and strip naked in the street.
Having a one-woman pool party might not seem so terrible but this montha US officer was suspended for pulling a gun on black teenagers in their swimsuits, something many claimed was racially motivated.
Watch her video as she high-fives officers, hugs random sheriffs and propositions the mayor whether he would like to open up his relationship.
When she asks a sheriff if hed like to buy some antidepressants, hes unmoved. Instead of bundling her into a police van, he just remarks: You know thats illegal, right? Those are prescribed drugs.
So fun it should be criminal?
One older man she speaks to says of course white privilege exists, claiming police beat him up once just because they noticed him running.
The experiment may not be double blind tested to avoid bias in data collection, but Jessies still posting on YouTube and doesnt seem to be in jail yet so draw your own conclusions.

Remember the two British drug mules convicted in Peru? One of them could be heading back to the UK very soon.
Melissa Reid, 21, wont be allowed to go homethough.
Instead shell have to serve the remainder of her six year sentence at a prison in her home country of Scotland after a transfer was approved.

As for her accomplice (and friend) Michaella McCollum, also 21, she also hopes to serve the rest of her term near herhome in Northern Ireland after her repatriation was approved in January this year.
Reid, from Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, and McCollum, from Co Tyrone, were working in Ibiza when they claim they were forced to board a flight with 24lb of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage.
How life is like in a Peru prison
The prison cells are cramped.
The lack of portable water means theres poor sanitation and toilet facilities.
No easy access to water also means its hard to keep the kitchens clean, and of course yourself.
You wouldnt expect the beds to be like the ones in the Savoy but theyre still quite bad, with super thin mattresses.
You also have to put up with intimidation from fellow prisoners.
They were caught in August 2013 with 1.5 million worth of drugs at Lima airport and later pleaded guilty to drug smuggling, each receiving a jail term of six years and eight months.
The pair had previously been held at Virgen de Fatima prison but were later moved to the Ancon 2 jail.
Reid could be home in weeks but a time frame has yet to be put on McCollums return.

Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis: catching up on his box sets? (Picture: Marko Djurica)
As Greek banks shut for a week in turmoil over a possible Euro exit, it seems finance minister Yanis Varoufakis could be a fan of political drama on screen as well as in real life.
Varoufakis, from ruling party Syriza, appeared to quote Machiavellian political TV series House of Cards on Saturday at an emergency meeting with European ministers.
Referring to a nationwide vote on further economic reforms due to be held on July 5, Mr Varoufakis said: To those who say that, effectively, this is a referendum on the euro, my answer is: You may very well say this but I shall not comment. This is your judgement, your opinion, your interpretation. Not ours!
Banks will stay shut until a referendum in Greece on July 5. (Picture:Getty Images)
Frances Urquhart, the ruthless wannabe prime minister in the BBCs original House of Cards drama, was famous for his plausible deniability catchphrase: You might very well think that; I couldnt possibly comment.
Described as the epitome of elegant evil, the murderous politician isnt necessarily someone Varoufakis wants to be associated with.

Lets hope the left-wing minister wont be taking any cues from Frank Underwood either, the politician in Netflixs reboot of the series played by Kevin Spacey, who confessed: Democracy is so overrated.
Varoufakis has compared politics to a card game previously  back in February he said a Euro exit was not at all part of his governments plans or those of other EU leaders: It is like a house of cards. If you pull away the Greek card, they all come down.
The politician is famously an expert in game theory, using maths to try and work out the best tactical strategy, although he stresses this has not affected his approach to the Greek crisis.

Theres a good reason why this now-married couple are covering their ears on one of the biggest days of their lives.
Its because theyre from Australia  a country where same equalmarriage is yet to be legalised.
But in a brilliant act of defiance against this, Abbey and Mitch Johnson and their 17 wedding guests opted to cover their ears at the part of the ceremony where the celebrant is made to repeat a line from the Australian Marriage Act that defines marriage.
Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life, they are made to say.
But this definition is just plain wrong  and thats the exact reason why the couple and their guests chose to cover their ears in an act of defiance.

Abby even clarified that she had fulfilled all legal requirements of the marriage, as she had spoken the all-important words  and her guests could still hear her.
Speaking to Mashable, Abbey explained: The purpose was to stand up and do something special.

Something that was important to us. To say to the government we are not okay with this.
A lot of people have been asking if anyone in particular inspired us to show this small act of defiance.
The answer is simply no. We did this because we believe in equality. We believe in love. It is as simple as that.

We were raised with lots of love in our hearts and taught to be open minded, just and kind.
The photos were posted on Facebook by photographer Thomas Stewart  after he became frustrated with hearing the same, invalidated line at weddings.
I loved how Abbey and Mitch took a stand during their ceremony against this archaic and offensive part of Australian law and I was very proud to be taking photos at that wedding, he said.
I also saw that the guests, with huge smiles on their faces, reacted very well to the situation and loved the gesture.

This video purportedly shows the shocking moment that a dying dog was discovered after his owners left him in a boiling car while they shopped at Ikea.
In the unverified footage, which was posted on LiveLeak, 14-month-old boxer Fidji can be seen desperately panting while a policeman smashes the car window to free the animal from his plight.
And after a bottle of water is thrown over Fidji, he is soon removed from the car.
But he had stayed in the vehicle for an agonising fourhours, according to a caption accompanying the video, and died at 8PM the sameday from internal bleeding  despite undergoing a three hour operation.

If you thought the problems in Greece had nothing to do with you here, you may want to think again.
European markets have plummeted following the decision by the country to close its banks until the weekend.
The FTSE 100 index in London fell almost two per centthis morning, with Frances Cac 40 and Germanys Dax share index also down.

The Euro also didnt fare toowell after it weakened in value, with 1 now worth1.4169.
Greece has less than 48 hours to pay back 1.6 billion euros (1.3b) of International Monetary Fund loans, and a default would set in train events that could lead to the countrys eventual exit from the euro currency bloc.
This came after the European Central Bank refused to extend a line of credit.
The country woke up to closed cash machines and a climate of rumours and conspiracy theories after talks with its creditors broke down.
The government will keep banks shut at least until after July 5, the date of the referendum, and withdrawals from automated teller machines  which are shut on Monday  will be limited to 60 euros a day when they reopen on Tuesday.

The death toll of British citizens in the Tunisianterror attack is expected to rise to 30, sources have reported.
The Foreign office has put the official number of British victims of the attack at 15, however ministers have said that number will rise, according to Sky News
Several media outlets have already placed to total death count following the attack by gunmanSeifeddine Rezgui at 38, however this too could increase over the next few days.
It has already been confirmed that the majority of people killed in the massacre were British.
Video footage of Rezqui strolling along the beach and brandishing an assault rifle during the attacks have emerged.


British tourist John Yeoman recently came to the defence of Tunisian locals who were criticised for apparently watching the gunman.
He claimed the locals were in fact formed a human shield to protect terrified tourists.

After the horrific events which blighted the country on Friday, the people of Tunisia have come together in defiance of terrorism.
37 people were killed when a gunman attacked the Sousse beach resort, 15 of them being British citizens.
However eager to show the world that they will not bow to hatred, Tunisians and tourists alike have taken to the streets, beaches and air in a demonstration against terrorism.
This is how they did it.
People took the to beach only 48 hours after a gunman turned it into the scene of a massacre, where they flew both the Tunisian flag and the Union Jack.

Horrific footage of Gay Pride demonstrators being blasted with water cannons by Turkishpolice have emerged from Istanbul.
Today saw the conservative countrys capital hold its annual Gay Pride march, however for reasons unknown police descended on the march and used water cannons and even rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.
Homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey, however many of the countrys majority Muslim population are against it.
Images saw demonstrators blasted off their feet and thrown several feet backwards after being hit by the torrent of water from the police water cannons.

Doing things in the privacy of your own bedroom might not be that private any more, a tech blogger has warned.
Brett Thomas has dropped the fear bomb on millions of men and women by claiming that every website you visit, even when in incognito mode (dont pretend you dont know what that is), could be released by hackers.
Thomas backs up his theory with the leaked naked images of celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton last year.
He claims the same processes could be used to expose embarrassing viewing by regular people.
Information onthousands of XBox and Playstation users, including passwords and personal information, was leaked last year as well.
Thomas says websites can hold you data even when incognito browsing, which hackers can in turn exploit.
However hesays he fears the policy measures that could be hastily enacted in response to such an event  yet another reason that the tech community should take a more proactive approach ensuring data privacy.

A SpaceX rocket carrying supplies to the International Space Station has exploded shortly after lift-off.
According to NASA, the Falcon 9 rocket craft exploded only a few minutes after taking off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, and debris could be seen falling into the Atlantic Ocean.
It took off as scheduled at 10.21 a.m ET, but became lost within minutes.
NASA commentator George Diller said the vehicle has broken up, but it is not clear how the disaster occurred.
The missions primary objective was to deliver the Dragon to the space station with more than two and a half tons of supplies, equipment and experiments  ranging from a new docking adapter for accommodating future U.S.-built spaceships to a virtual-reality headset for the stations crew

Last week the Supreme Court of the United States voted to legalise gay marriage across the country in a landmark decision.
While most people celebrated this progressive moment in the name of equality, a few bigots thought it was the perfect time to spew some nonsense, naturally.
Leading the charge was conservative loud mouth Bryan Fischer, who compared the Supreme Courts decision to 9/11  also known as one of the worst acts of terrorism in history.
Fischer, who hosts an anti-gay radio show for the American Family Association, wrote a blog post titled SCOTUS blows up twin towers of truth and righteousness, SCOTUS referring to the Supreme Court Of The United States.
In the post Fischer labelled June 26, 2015 as a date which will live in infamy.

No only does he claim America has become Sodom and Gomorrah, but even refers to supporters of the ruling as the Gay Gestapo.

Obviously if Fischer had ever read a single book about the Nazis he would know they were almost as anti-gay as he is.

The suspect accused of decapitating a man in France allegedly sent a selfie in which he posed with the victims severed head, a source close to the investigation said.
Yassin Salhi, 35, was arrested after he allegedly drove his van into a warehouse containing dangerous gases in Lyon, France. Police then found a severed head nearby.
And a legal source has said that Salhi reportedly sent a selfie in which he posed with the head via WhatsApp, though investigators are working to identify the recipient.
Father-of-three Salhi was described by a co-worker as being calm and mysterious.

Like a scene from Jaws, the shark circled the surfer for several minutes as he paddled through the water near Manly beach in Sydney.
The surfer can be heard breathing hard as he desperately tries to get back toshallower water without disturbing the Great White, the outline of which can be clearly seen underwater just a few feet away.
The man eventually made it back to shore, but he was one of the lucky ones. A surfer was killed by a Great White on Shelly Beach near Ballina, Australia, in February this year.

This caterpillar bears a startling resemblance to Donald Trumps hair.
Its a flannel moth caterpillar,something that looks fuzzy and cute but is actually covered in poisonous barbs that can cause humans to get headaches and vomit.
Like Donald Trump, some might argue.
The caterpillar has such a reputation for causing harm that other animals, including at least one Amazonian bird, have evolved to look like it to deter predators.
But even if they are nasty pieces of work, were still fans.

Honey bees hold several advantages over dogs (Picture: Getty Images)
As marijuana laws change across the globe, the number of active drug-sniffing dogs diminishes.
Dope-sniffing canineshave been forced into retirement because they are trained to give the same alert for all illegal substances and training them to detect only the amounts that are illegal is not cost or time-effective.
If a dog hits on marijuana, you dont know whether youre going to find one ounce in that suitcase or six pounds, Steve Davis of Lakewood Police Department in Colorado told Bloomberg .
But it seems scientists have found an unlikely solution: honey bees.

Sniffer dogs cant distinguish between different amounts of weed (Picture: Getty Images)
According to research at the University of Cologne, the humble honey bee is able to distinguish between any narcotic from caffeine to cannabis andperform individual alerts for each.
The bee has other advantages over the dog. They are inexpensive to produce and maintain and they do not form bonds with humans, which means biased detections  which dogs will occasionally do to please their master  are not likely to happen.
This is not the first time honey bees have been in the news this week. Only yesterday, it was announced that Oslo was constructing a bee highway to restore dwindling populations in the city.

More shocking news in the world of swimming pools: They can give you diarrhea.
Only last week we learnt that red, stinging eyes is caused by sweat and urine  not chlorine. And now cases of illness outbreaks in poolsis increasing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US documented90 illness outbreaks reported in 32 states and Puerto Rico for the years 2011 to 2012.
This affected nearly 1,800 people  95 of which were taken to hospital.
Cryptosporidium is the parasite causing all these problems. It leads todiarrhea, and vomiting.
Itcan survive for ten days or more even in water thats heavily chlorinated.
Michele Hlavsa, lead author of the report, told CBS News: This parasite is extremely chlorine-resistant.
Swimmers bring it into the water when they are sick with diarrhea.
Basically just dont ever swim.
TheCDC has issued guidelines on how to swim safely  they include not pooing in the water which is, you know, fairly obviously.

Yesterday, the world celebrated after the Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage across the United States.
But inevitably, not everyone was happy.
Step forward Fox News to provide some ill-informed ignorance.
In a broadcast hosted by anchor Martha MacCallum shortly after the ruling was announced, she questioned if the ruling now meant that three people could enter into a marriage together.
Were just trying to think about the ramifications, when a precedent is set, what it means down the road, right? she worriedly asked.
(Picture: Fox News/ YouTube)
So, suppose three people say We want to be a marriage. Were three people and we love each other and we want to be a marriage. Whats to prevent that under this?
Well its pretty simple really.
Same-sex marriage permits the union of a couple of the same gender. The key word there is COUPLE  TWO PEOPLE, DOS, DEUX, and ZWEI.

Rats just wanna get out and see the world man (Picture: Alamy)
Considering that theyre known for crawling through the sprawling subterranean networks of the world, it should come as no surprise that rats actually dream about the places they want to go.
Thats according to researchers from University College London  who claimed that when the rodents are shown an inaccessible food treat, theyre likely to dream about how they can get it when they nod off to sleep.
Or as lead researcher Hugo Spiers put it: Its like looking at a holiday brochure for Greece the day before you go  that night you might dream about the pictures.
The discovery was made by the team after they placed four rats at the bottom of a T-shaped pathway, where the animals could see the food but couldnt access it.

They were then encouraged to fall asleep in a nest  and their brain activity was recorded with 50 electrodes as they slept.
And after they were finally put back in the maze , the animals were seen to run along the arm of the T shape that had been previously blocked  which suggested that they had been carefully planning their strategy while in the land of nod.
But it gets slightly weirder too  as researchers have previously been able to alter the dreams of mice, reminiscent of the film Inception. They stimulated the brains of mice so that they were more likely to scamper to a certain place when awake  which sounds suspiciously like mind control to us.

He was found lying at the side of the road yelling in pain near the Quick Food convenience store on Southwick Road, according to a police report.
A worried passer-by raised the alarm as the man managed to stumble towards the store.
Officer Richard Mazza wrote in his report: The male party stated he was struck in the banana by a banana. When asked what he meant, he stated he was struck in the groin by a banana thrown out of the window of a passing vehicle.
The man was taken to Noble Hospital and got a sick note giving him the following day off work

        <MainBody>Miss Balch was sitting in the front seats alongside Miss Washington, Miss Washingtons boyfriend Joe Pugh, 18, who shattered his knee, and Daniel Thorpe, 27, a hotel assistant-manager from

Chandaben Chauhan, 49, of Wednesbury, West Midlands, also suffered injuries.
Miss Balch, who had a four-and-a-half hour wait for rescue, has previously told the BBC: It felt like slow motion. We banged into the car in front. I felt the bars go into my knees; we moved backwards and the car went into us again.
I passed out. I was awoken by Dan shouting my name. Everyone was screaming and I was in excruciating pain. I looked down and I could see blood all over.
The bars were in my right knee.
The only thought that was going through my mind for the hours and hours that we were stuck was that we were going to die. If I was going to survive I would never walk again, that was certain.
I thought it was never going to end. I just wanted to die.

Tourists reported hearing gunshots on the beach and a loud explosion in the city of Sousse, located in the north-east of the country, on Friday.
British holidaymaker Gary Pine told Sky News that he first became aware of the attack the hotel where he was staying became eerily quiet.
The beach tends to be full up very quickly so its the usual story of getting down to lay your towel at half past six to get a decent beach position, so all of the beach positions were taken, he said.
Theres a lot of people walking up and down, taking in this lovely weather, so its a very busy beach, but as I said it became apparent very quick that it was something more than firecrackers when you could hear bullets whizzing around, he added.

Rick Scarborough has some strong views (Picture: Getty Images)
The news that the US Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide is good news for supporters of civil liberty, gay people and, well, reasonable people.
But its not good news for this guy.
Rick Scarborough, a Baptist pastor from Texas, has some fairly strong opinions on the topic of gay marriage.
Hes so against gay marriage he saidhe would burn andin his battle against the idea.
Now, we dont want to put words into Mr. Scarboroughs mouth, but when he said he would burn, we assume he meant he would set himself on fire.
Which means hes faced with a pretty tough decision, as decisions go.
When Mr. Scarborough isnt threatening self-immolation, he runs a podcast called the National Emergency Coalition show, which is linked to a group run by the equally-charming EW Jackson called Staying True to Americas National Destiny (Stand).
Nice acronym.

The drones maiden voyage is from Frankfurt to an undisclosed location in Poland (Picture: Getty Images)
A pro-choice activist group is planning todistributeabortion pills via an Abortion Drone into countries where terminationsareillegal.
Which might upset a few people.
Dutch group Women on Waves collaborated with a number of other European pro-choice organisations for the Abortion Drones maiden flight, which will take it from Frankfurt, Germany, to an as-yet-undisclosed location in Poland, one of the few European countries where abortion is not legal.
For obvious reasons, Women on Waves are keeping quiet about the drones exact destination. Yet they remain confident they are not breaking any laws.
As the Abortion drone weighs less than 5 kg, is not used for any commercial purposes, will stay within the sight of the person flying it and does not fly in controlled airspace, no authorisation is required under Polish or German law, group founder Rebecca Gomperts told ScienceAlert .
MORE: Ed Miliband has become unstoppably sassy on Twitter
We want to create awareness about womens right to a safe abortion.
The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.
In Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals dont help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but its the women who dont have the means or access to information who are suffering.
According to the Guardian , some pro-life groups have threatened to shootdown the drone if it goes ahead with its mission.
Gomperts, however, isnt too concerned.
Its not easy to shoot down a drone, she said.

Its good to look afterbees.
Theyre only small.
Also, if they die out, we only have about four years left to live.
Apparently the people of Oslo, Norway, have realised this, as they are in the process of developing a highway for the beleaguered honey bee, the population of which has been dwindling in the countrys urban areas.
The bee highway consists of a network of flowers across buildings in the city which allow the insects safe passage, resting spots and places to live, The Verge reports.
Some firms have allowed their rooftops to become homes for new bee populations (Picture: Getty Images)

The programme is led by Bybi, an environmental group dedicated to rebuilding urban bee populations. Bybi approached local companies to secure funding, and some of these firms have gone sofar as to creatededicated homes for the bee on their rooftops.
We are constantly reshaping our environment to meet our needs, forgetting that other species also live in it, said Agnes Lyche Melvaer, head of Bybi.
To correct that we need to return places to them to live and feed.
A companion website, Pollinatorpassasjen , tracks the hives and movement of honey bee populations across Oslo.

Aftermath of terror attack in Sousse, Tunisia
Adevastating attack on a Tunisian beach resort left at least 27 people dead and many more injured today.
While many of the details surrounding the attack are still unclear, some reports now claim the gunman or gunmen arrived on the beach via an inflatable boat from the sea.
Tunisian radio Mosaique FM interviewed eyewitnesses of the attack who said they saw gunmen, some of whom were carrying grenades, exiting the inflatable boat before unleashing their attack.
One gunman has been killed, and it is unclear how many more, if any, were involved in the attack.
Many of the innocent people killed are thought to be tourists, with footage of people of still wearing beach attire while they are rushed to hospital emerging from the scene.

In a historic decision, passed by five votes to four, the court ruled that marriage is constitutional for all, bypassing individual state laws.
Gay couples could only marry in 37 states in addition to Washington DC before the judgement.

No union is more profound than marriage, wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion.
The decision is the culmination of decades of litigation and activism and came against the backdrop of fast-changing attitudes towards same-sex marriage, with recent polls suggesting the majority of Americans support same-sex partnerships.

One of the gunmen who opened fire on holidaymakers as they sunbathed at a Tunisian beach resort was dressed in shorts, a T-shirt and baseball cap to look like a tourist himself, it has been claimed.
At least 27 people, including foreign tourists, were killed today when gunmenopened fireat thepopular resort of Sousse.
A hotel worker described seeing one of the men dressed in shorts and a T-shirt as if he was a tourist himself.
These pictures appear to show one of the suspects  in shorts  being led away by police.
The hotel worker said: One attacker opened fire with a Kalashnikov on tourists and Tunisians on the beach of the hotel. It was just one attacker. He was a young guy dressed in shorts like he was a tourist himself.
 !Lionel Tunisiano (@LionelTunisiano) June 26, 2015
Police were still clearing the area around the Imperial Marhaba hotel and the body of one gunman lay at the scene with a Kalashnikov assault rifle after he was shot in an exchange of gunfire, a security source at the scene said.
Irishwoman Elizabeth OBrien, who was staying at a neighbouring hotel with her two sons, said there was panic on the beach when gunfire erupted.
I honestly thought it was fireworks and then when I saw people running I thought, my God, it is shooting, she told Irish radio station RTE. The waiters and the security on the beach started to say Run, run, run!
Sousse is one of Tunisias most popular beach resorts, drawing visitors from Europe and neighbouring North African countries. Tourism is also a major source of income for the government.
It was the second major attack in the North African country this year, and took place during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.

It was about 12 oclock and I just looked up about 500 metres from me and I saw a (hot air) balloon collapse down, then rapid firing, then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me  because I thought it was fireworks.
So, I thought oh my God, it sounds like gunfire, so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started saying run, run run! and we just ran to our room, which is like a little bungalow.
We are actually trapped in our room.
British tourist Gary Pine, who was also on the beach, said he thought he heard firecrackers going off and said his son saw someone being shot on the beach.
Sousse is located in the north-east of Tunisia
There wan explosion from the next hotel complex along, he said.
There was a mass exodus off the beach.
But you could see then quite quickly the panic that was starting to ensue from the next resort along from us which is about 100 yards away and so then people started exiting the beach pretty quickly, but only when you can start hearing bullets around your ears did you start to realise it was something more serious than firecrackers.
Speaking to Metro.co.uk, Ben Matthews:
We are OK. Shaken up but unhurt, thankfully.
Im here with just my wife at the Riu Club Bellevue Park. We believe the attack started just down the beach near the Mahaba Palace.
Wed just come for lunch in the main hotel when everyone outside started running into the hotel and there was what sounded like firecrackers going off on the far side of the hotel. After a few minutes the Animation team asked everyone gathered in the hotel communal areas to take shelter in their rooms, which we did.
Our room overlooks the outside of the hotel and we hid in the bathroom as what sounded like a fire fight took place outside in the street below.
Were currently in the restaurant, weve been told very little other than that the hotel is safe now and that the police are guarding the hotel gates and the beach, which is currently off limits. The tour rep knows nothing more than we do, but theres a chap here whos come in specially to tell us that.
One holidaymaker barricaded herself in her room after she was woken by gunfire.
I heard gunshots start a little while ago then I heard women screaming and crying, she said.
Now all I hear is silence.

The Paris protests are showing no signs of cooling off.
French taxi drivers have overturned cars, smashed windows and set fire to tyres to campaign againstlow-cost rival firm Uber.
Key highways in Paris were blocked by protesters  some of whom were wielding baseball bats.
Following day-long riots, Frances interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the firms UberPOP service was illegal and called on police and prosecutors to shut it down.

Despite the unrest, officials from Uber have insisted they will continue to pick up passengers until Frances high court passes a ruling on the service.

Another image posted on Twitter purportedly showed the body of a tourist who had been gunned down as he relaxed on the beach.

Rebecca Miles, a British tourist who was staying at the Royal Kenz hotel with her boyfriend told MailOnline: We were told to go back to our rooms because there were reports of a bomb.
It happened about half an hour ago  I heard a bang and I thought it was thunder but it was a clear sky so it obviously wasnt.
I heard sirens going off about 20 minutes ago and everyone came running back from the private hotel beach which is about 400 metres from the hotel. Everyone is a bit clueless about what is happening.
Tunisia attack - what we know so far
At least 27 people thought to have been killed
Sousse is known for being popular with British holidaymakers
British Embassy in Tunis said it is ready to provide consular assistance
At least one gunman thought to have been killed
People are anxious because they dont really know what is happening and we are now stuck in our rooms. There have been deaths apparently.
A British tourist identified as Gary told Sky News: There were several hundred people on the beach, it was quite busy because of the lovely weather.
You could hear bullets whizzing around, but at first I thought the gunfire was firecrackers.
Some reports claimed that militants parachuted into the town before the attack, however Gary told Sky News this may be due to the para-sailing activities many tourists undertook throughout the day at the resort.
Holidaymaker John Yeoman posted this image of a mattress that he forced up against the door of his hotel room for fears that the gunman would go room-to-room killing tourists.
John Yeoman barricaded himself inside his room
In a statement, the British Embassy in Tunis said: We are aware of reports of an incident in Port El Kantaoui and are urgently looking into them. We stand ready to provide consular assistance to any British nationals affected.
Sousse - a hotspot for British tourists
Sousse is one of Tunisias most important holiday resorts and is popular with Brits and other Europeans.
Situated on the east coast, it is the countrys third largest city and is around 87 miles from the capital Tunis.
Sousse combines family-friendly hotels with more high-end exclusive all-inclusive resorts.
Many of the hotels are on the seafront and have their own private beaches.
The city of Sousse stretches from the Medina or Old Town at one end up to Port El Kantaoui at the other.
The port is a popular place for wealth yacht owners to moor up while exploring the area.
Sousse is also a popular base for people travelling to the area to visit the Sahara desert and El Djem a Roman setllement that boasts the ampitheatre where Russell Crowes Gladiator was filmed.
Some 1,200,000 visitors visit Sousse every year and its hotels can cater for about 40,000 guests at the height of the summer season.
British holidaymaker Gary Pine told Sky News that he first became aware of the attack the hotel where he was staying became eerily quiet.
The beach tends to be full up very quickly so its the usual story of getting down to lay your towel at half past six to get a decent beach position, so all of the beach positions were taken, he said.
Theres a lot of people walking up and down, taking in this lovely weather, so its a very busy beach, but as I said it became apparent very quick that it was something more than firecrackers when you could hear bullets whizzing around, he added.
British Prime Minister David Cameron says the governments crisis committee, Cobra, will meet later today in response to the attacks. He offered his condolences and our solidarity in fighting the evil of terrorism.
Scotland yard has urged the public to remain vigilant but has not yet raised the terror threat level.
Our priority is safety and the security of the public. We would also like to reiterate our long standing advice to remain vigilant and alert, a spokesperson said.
The HomeOffice have set up a dedicated helpline for worried friends and relatives on0207 008 0000.

A video has emerged showing a dad swinging a little girl around his head in some bizarre father-daughter bonding.
While the little girl in the video seems to be smiling and giggling as she is flung about like a rag doll(however towards the end she appears a bit more distressed)many are claiming the video depicts child-abuse.
Several of the moves see the girlswung about by her feet, with her head coming dangerously close to the floor, while a woman watches and laughs.
One person commented on the video: This is a CHILD, not a rag doll, she is obviously crying. Please, never again.
The video is thought to have been shot in Russia.

A man has been beheadedand several others have been injured after terrorists stormed a factory in France.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve hasconfirmedthat a man, named locally asYassin Salhi (spelling unclear), has been arrested  having beenknown to security services since 2006.
He had been put under surveillance at the time for his links to salafist organisations,which endedin 2008as intelligence services thought he was not dangerous.
The police is currently searching his house in Saint-Priest, where he had been living for six months with his wife and three kids, according to local press.

The victim has also been identified, and was, according to AFP,a company CEO of a local business who was at the factory for a delivery.
According to AFP, the police are now actively looking for people who could have potentially helped Salhi, and have arrested his family, according to this tweet by a journalist from Le Monde who is on the scene:

(the family of the main suspect has been arrested by the Lyonpolice in Saint Priest)
Questions have been raised on how theattacker managed to getto the factory, as the industrial site requires vehicles to ask for access before being let in.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has condemned another Islamist terrorist attack in France, and is coming back from South America earlier than planned.

In an address to the French people, President Francois Hollande confirmed that one suspect had been identified, and further action would be taken in due course.
The attack comes only months after 17 people were killed in a series of terror attacks across Paris in January.
Two brothers launched a three day campaign of violence in the capital  when attacked on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo for publishing cartoons which supposedly ridiculed the Prophet Mohamed, killing 12 members of the magazines team.

A man pretended to be his girlfriend for more than a fortnight after he murderedher when she tried to break up with him.
The 24-year-old, who can only be referred to under South Korean law as Mr Lee, confessed to killing Sunny Kim, 26, on 18 May, two weeks after shedisappeared.
It emerged that afterSunny went missing, Lee had been replying to texts from her phone claiming to be her, apparently using her previous correspondence to mimic how she communicated.

It was really shocking to see how someone can really hide what they did in that way.
It also emerged that on the day Sunny was killed she had accepted a new job. Later that day Lee, pretending to be Kim, declined the offer, telling the employer she was going back to the US to study.

A transgender woman and her gay friendhavereportedly fled persecution in Russia to join terror group Isis.
Viktoria E and Aleksey T, both 22, left Kamchatka Krai in eastern Russia claiming they suffered persecution and abuse at the hands of families and locals in their town.
The pair, who had apparently watched an Isis recruitment video, then headed to Syria to join the terror group, the Mirror reports.

The strangenessof the pairs reported decision to join a group known for its brutal treatmentof non-heterosexuals wasnot been lost on Russian authorities.
We would always be interested in stopping people from joining a terrorist organisation but in this case there is a double motive, as our information is that this would not be accepted if they managed to get all the way to Syria, and it is unlikely that they would live very long once their sexual orientation was revealed, said police spokesman Alexander Vinogradov.
Viktoria, born Viktor, was confirmed to be undergoing hormone replacement therapy by her aunt.

The only bell Dustin Diamond will be hearing in the next four months is a prison one.
Theformer star of 1990s hit show Saved by the Bell is headed tojail.
Diamond was sentenced at a court in Port Washington, New York, today following two misdemeanor convictions that stemmed from a Christmas Day bar room fight.
The 38-year-old actor was cleared of a felony charge after a three-day jury trial last month, although they found him guilty of carrying a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct.
He told jurors he took out a knife to try to ward off people, including a woman who punched his girlfriend Amanda Schutz.

I sincerely apologize to everyone involved, Diamond said at the hearing today.
He was also sentenced to 15 months of probation.

Park in a disabled space in Brazil at your peril.
One man found out the hard way that parking your car in a spot reserved for people with disabilities is not a smart thing to do.
The mans car was covered  and we meancovered  in blue paper. White disabled symbols were made with sheets of white paper on the back and sides.
Even his wheels were covered in blue for goodness sake.
Aside from having his car made to resemble a smurf, the illegal parker also had to endure the taunts of the crowd, who cheered as he finally drove off.
Lesson learnt? We suspect so.

Nurse who suffocated eight of her babies says it was because they were a result ofincest

A French nurse who admitted to suffocating eight of her babies has told investigators that she did so because they were the result of an incestuous relationship with her father.
Dominique Cottrez, 51, is at the centre of the worst case of infanticide in modern French history following the discovery of eight baby corpses in a garden in Villers-au-Tertre, near Lille, in 2010.Now on trial in Douai, the nurse faces spending the rest of her life in prison if found guilty of multiple counts of murder of minors.
Cottrez, who has two adult daughters and several grandchildren, revealed today that the children were the product of a long incestuous affair with her own father  an affair that she didnt want to be discovered.
From 1989 to 2007, Cottrez said she killed eight children, two of which she buried in the garden and six more she hid in the house, she said.
The nurse faces spending the rest of her life in prison (Picture: AFP)
She claimed that despite completing eight pregnancies, her husband Pierre-Marie knew nothing about them.
He was briefly suspectedof helping to hide the corpses, but was released because of lack of evidence.
The corpses were discovered by sheer chance after the new owners of a house the Cottrez family once lived in started to dig a duckpond and found two bodies. Police later found the other six in the home.

Clodagh Cogley (Picture: Facebook)
Two collapsed lungs, a broken shoulder, a broken knee, five broken ribs and a broken spinal cord.
Those are the injuries 21-year-old Clodagh Cogley suffered after a balcony collapsed in Berkeley, California, last week thatkilled five fellow Irish students and an American friend.
But if you thought she would be feeling down about her potential paralysis youd be mistaken.
Instead she has vowed to live her life to the fullest in order to honour those who didnt survive.
The chances of me using my legs again are pretty bleak, she wrote on Facebook.
Not the best odds but Im moving to a great rehabilitation centre here in San Francisco for 2 months (it has dog therapy) and intend to give it everything Ive got.

Who knows maybe legs have been holding me back all these years and Ill realise my talent for wheelchair basketball.
Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the incident but Berkeley city officials already announced criminal charges were not expected.
Ms Cogley survived along with six other students.

A mother and her baby son have been rescued from the Colombian jungle five days after a plane crash which claimed the life of the pilot.
Maria Nelly Murillo Moreno, 18, and her five-month-old son, Yudier Stewart Moreno, were on a small Cessna plane that crash landed in the Choco province on Saturday.
The pilot died in the crash but when rescuers failed to find the bodies of Maria and her son in the aircraft they began to search the jungle, setting up loudspeakers in an attempt to make contact with the pair.

And five days after the plane went down, emergency crews have found Maria and Yudier. Maria had some minor lacerations and burns from the accident, but her son was unharmed.
Its a miracle, Colonel Hector Carrascal of the Colombian Air Force told AFP.
It is a very wild area and it was a catastrophic accident.
He added: His [Yudiers] mothers spirit must have given him the strength to survive.

If you werelying unconscious during an operation you wouldnt expect your doctor to laugh at your penis and suggestyou were infected with Ebola.
But that was exactly what happened to a patient inReston, Virginia, whoonly found hed been insulted because hedset up his mobile phone to record everything while he was asleep.
Anesthesiologist Tiffany M Ingham didnt know this and was subsequently caught making a fool of herself on a recording, the Washington Post reported.

After five minutes of talking to you in pre-op, I wanted to punch you in the face and man you up a little bit, Ms Ingham was heard sayingduring thecolonoscopy procedure.
She wasnt finished there.
When a medical assistant noted the man (known as DB) had a rash, the anesthesiologist warned her not to touch it, saying she might get some syphilis on your arm or something, then added, its probably tuberculosis in the penis, so youll be all right.
The patient was surprised by what had been said when he woke up (Picture: Getty Images)
Gastroenterologist Soloman Shah, who was examining the patient, also got involved when he jokedanother doctor they both knew would eat him for lunch.
The abuse cost Ms Ingham and the practice an eye watering 318,000 after the patient successfully sued them for medical malpractice and defamation.
Shell probably keep quiet next time.
Patient DBhad set up his mobile phone to record what was being said just in case he missed important information for his rehabilitation.

Bill Nye is known for his charm and wit as well as his scientific prowess.
The science guy is often credited with being able to explain complex scientific theories in simple terms, however this video takes the biscuit.
In what looks like a last-ditch attempt to convince people that climate change is very real and very serious, Bill has been forced to explain the process the only way us idiots will understand  through emojis.
While Bill is hopeful for the future, he admits that many innovations that could solve the energy crisis have notyet been invested.
Despite his efforts, poor Bills lesson obviously isnt getting through to some people.

Aprofessor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University, who was not involved in the study, Josh Miller told Live Science :The data and hypothesis are very intriguing, but much additional investigation is required to determine if this is a real cause-and-effect phenomenon.
Proof of a causative effect of B12 supplements on acne development will require randomized control trials with enough subjects to see a significant effect, if one exists.

Queen Elizabeth wants Europe to stay united (Picture:Reuters)
One is not amused by plans to divide the European Union.
The Queen has implored the need for unity throughout Europe on the eve of a Brussels summit where the Prime Minister is set to outline his proposed reforms to Britains EU membership.
During a state banquet atBellevue presidential palace in Berlin, Germany last night, she said pulling out of the EU could prove dangerous.
In the presence of German president Joachim Gauck, HRH added: In our lives, Mr President, we have seen the worst but also the best of our continent.
We must work hard to maintain the benefits of the post-war world, she added.We know that division in Europe is dangerous.

President Gauck told the Queen in his speech: We know that we need an effective European Union based on a stable foundation of shared values.
PM David Cameron intends to renegotiate Britains membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017.
While traditionally monarchs remain politically neutral, the Queens speech could be interpreted as a firm view on the EU debate.

This video of a drone ripping off a plane wing during take-off has taken the internet by storm.
Its terrifying.But fake.
The eagle-eyed among us cansniffclever CGI a mile off. But for newbies, the mobile phone footage is so realistic it sends shivers down our spine.
It was the work of Bruce Branit, of Brandit graphic designers.
Explaining the idea, he said: Lately, Ive been looking for little videos to make with no budget, an iPhone and some CGI.
After shooting this footage of NYC as we were climbing out of Laguardia (thanks FAA for finally letting us keep our phones in airplane mode during take-off), I thought it might be a challenge to make something go by or even strike the wing.
This is the same air corridor that Captain Skully ditched his Airbus A320 in the Hudson after a double bird strike, saving all on-board.
But I chose to make a drone zip past instead of a bird and tear off a section of the winglet.
Heres how he did it:

Japan has lifted a 67-year-old ban on public dancing, and we say its about time.
Since the end of the Second World War, dancing outside has been banned, and dancing inside has required the premises to own a dancing licence. Even then, a licenced premises couldonly allow itspatrons to dance until midnight, like some sort of rubbish fairy godmother.
The law was brought in primarily to stopprostitution, which was common at dancehalls.
MORE: Dog has really bad water slide etiquette
Of course, dancers gon dance, so people regularly flouted the law, and in the late 20th century police were content to turn a blind eye to it.
That changed in the 2000s, when celebrity drug scandals and nightclub brawls gave police a reason once again to crack down on illegal dancing.
But thanks to a campaign by Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto,Japan has introduced a law allowing dancing. It was ratified last week and will come into effect next year.

If youre thinking of working longer hours, weekends or with colleagues you despise so that you can earn more money, you might want to reconsider.
New research from career site Glassdoor found that while more money can make employees feel more satisfied with their jobs, there are other factors that are far more effective.
Glassdoor looked at salary reports and employer reviews for221,000 users from the same company over the past year.

What they found was that a higher salary only made employees slightly happier. A 10 percent increase in pay translated to just a 1 percent increase in employee satisfaction. In other words, the difference between earning 50,000 and 55,000 in terms of job satisfaction is minimal.
So what does contribute to job satisfaction?

The US National Security Agency spied on three French presidents from 2006 to 2012, Wikileaks has claimed.
In its latest reveal, the website published a series of files under the heading Espionage Elyse, citing top secret intelligence reports and technical documents from the NSA.
Wikileaks claims the secret files derive from directly targeted NSA surveillance of the communications of former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy as well as incumbent Francois Hollande and a handful of high-ranking ministers.
The revelations were met with anger byFrench officials, with one saying that spying between allies was unacceptable, reports the BBC .

Mr. Hollande is said to beconsulting security chiefs.
Files released by Wikileaks include Francois Hollande apparently discussing a possible Grexit. Another alleges that Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to resume peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
A file dated 2010 suggests that French officials knew they were being spied on by the US and intended to make their disapproval known.
A summary of the reported exchange involves Mr. Sarkozys diplomatic adviser discussing a plan to express frustration at US unwillingness to sign a bilateral intelligence co-operation agreement.

Two British teenagers have walked free from court after stealing historical artefacts during a school trip toAuschwitz death camp.
The two boys, both aged 17, spent Monday night in a police cell in Poland after being caught with items including a fragment of a razor, a piece of spoon, buttons and two pieces of glass, believed to have once belonged to inmates at the Nazi German camp.
A police spokesman had said earlier on Tuesday that they could face up to tenyears in prison.
The pairpleaded guilty at a court hearingandwere given suspended sentences and ordered to report to a police station back in Britain at regular intervals.

The death camp
Auschwitz, which is near Krakow, has become a poignant symbol of the Nazi German Holocaust that claimed six million Jewish lives across Europe during World War Two.
Around 1.5 million people, mainly European Jews, were gassed, shot, hanged or burned at Auschwitz during the war.
Part of the site is now a museum.

The pupils were spotted acting suspiciously on Monday afternoon near a building where Nazi German guards had stored prisoners confiscated belongings, said a museum spokesman.
Perse School, a fee-paying school in Cambridge, England, where the two boys are studying, said the pair had attempted to keep some items of historical importance which they found on the ground at the site.
We understand they have explained that they picked up the items without thinking and they have apologised unreservedly for the offence they have given, and expressed real remorse for their action, a Perse School spokesman said.

The latest goss trickled down by tech experts suggests the iPhone 7 will not have push-down home button.
Instead, the main menu button could be integrated into the touch screen.
The iPhone 7, likely to be called the iPhone 6s, is expected to be released in September at the usual Cupertino unveiling.

Its the news many of us have been waiting for  red wine can actually help you lose weight.
New research has found that an ingredient in grapes and berries turns your fat into calorie-burning brown fat.
Of course this ingredient, known asresveratrol, can be ingested without downingthe claret like youre Tyrion Lannister.
The compound is also found in blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and apples.

Testing on mice found that the ones givenresveratrol gained 40 per cent less weight than their counterparts when given high fat diets.
For those of you who havent darted off to the shops to buy a crate of cheap red wine, here is lead researcher Professor Min Du, from Washington State University explaining how it works.
I was nearly physically sick': Woman finds a chunk of metal in her KFC burger
He says: Polyphenols in fruit, including resveratrol, increase gene expression that enhances the oxidation of dietary fats so the body wont be overloaded.
They convert white fat into beige fat which burns lipids (fats) off as heat, helping to keep the body in balance and prevent obesity and metabolic dysfunction.
We think its time to celebrate, and now you can crack open a bottle of wine (enjoyed responsibly) and have a solid excuse to skip the gym today.

The accidental capture of one of the worlds largest species of sharkoff the coast of Australia has divided scientists and conservationists.
Listed as the second-largest species of fish in the world, the basking shark, which can grow to upwards of 8m (26ft) in length, has been given vulnerable status after years of being hunted.
So the accidental capture of one such shark by a fishing trawler off the coast of Australia has proved controversial, with conservationists branding the catch sickening and criticising trawler fishing and scientists voicingtheir excitementathavinga chance to learn more about the species.

In a statement on Facebook , Museum Victoria, where parts of the shark will go on display, said that the fishermen got in touch immediately after the catch rather than try to sell parts of the 6.3m (20ft) fishinthe lucrative meat or fin market.
It provides a rare opportunity to conduct scientific research into this species, the statement added.
MORE: Can Phil Jones still become a Manchester United great?
This will help Museum Victoria with conservation efforts and biological research.
But though the museum and scientists have acknowledged the catch as unfortunate, some commentatorshave been more critical.
Facebook user Prashant D, commenting under the statement, slammed the indiscriminate killing of the shark and the terrible damage that trawler boats cause to the ocean, adding thatthe incident should be used to educate the public about sustainable fishing techniques.

A mother of triplets has shared a picture of their dyed placenta to highlight the miraculous survival of one of the brothers.
After doctors delivered Sammi Edess three babies, they dyed the blood vessels in order to show which part belonged to each child as they developed in the womb.
But while sons Geoffrey and Hunter had a huge share of nutrients, third son Thomas was only able to access a tiny section of the food source, and doctors didnt think that he would survive.
Geoffrey and Hunters generous sections are dyed green and red and blue and white respectively  but Thomas paltry yellow section can also be seen on the top of the placenta.
Sammi shared the image on the Australian Multiple Birth Association Facebook page, and heralded her sons birth as a miracle, after the triplets were born at 30 weeks.
She wrote: When I saw the obstetrician who sent me this picture he asked if he can use it in a big seminar with head obs from around the world of course I said yes but asked why?
His response was Thomas shouldnt be alive and to be honest we dont know how he survived to 30+6 but he has and hes a little miracle.

I didnt understand until I saw the picture myself that we made the right decision to deliver at 30+6.
I thought I would share this picture with all of you guys as its something we as mums dont really ever get to see and this is our babies lifeline when inside us. Its pretty amazing to think that was keeping them alive.

Lego is one of the most popular toys ever created, perfectly combining creativity, imagination and bright colours.
However it is also made of one of the most environmentally unfriendly products  plastic.
Now the most recognisable brand in the world has decided to go green, and has pledged to invest $150million (95million) to find a eco-friendlymaterial for its product.
The Danish company plans to use sustainable bricks in all toys by 2030 (however it is unclear if this will make them any less painful to step on).
Artist creates incredible scenes showing Lego like youve never seen it before
Each yearLego uses 6,000 tons of plasticmade fromacrylonitrile butadiene styrene, the same product used since 1963.
Green Peace lobbied Lego last year to end their long running partnership with Shell with a moving video which referenced the hugely successful Lego Movie.
Following the ad campaign the toy manufacturer cut its ties with the oil company.
Perhaps everything is awesome again?

Fang Peng fell onto scaffolding at a building site (Picture: CEN)
A manis able towalk and talk again one month after athick iron bar smashed through hishead ina building site accident.
Fang Peng, 50, was working on a construction site in the city of Chaohu, in east Chinas Anhui Province, when he fell three metres from the scaffolding he was standing on.
He plummeted below into a batch of rusty iron bars, one of which penetrated the right side of his neck and lodged itself 35 centimetres (ten inches) into his head, stopping on the left side of his forehead.
Doctor Zhang Hong, head of the trauma department at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui, said Fang was on the brink of death when brought into the hospital.
He said: His face was full of blood, with brain tissue visible around the entry point of the iron bar.
Faced with the possibility of leaving Fang in a vegetative state or at the very least without the ability to speak, doctors performed a nine-hour surgery to remove the 75-centimetre (20-inch) long, 2.5-centimetre thick (one inch) iron bar.

Fangs tough first few days of post-surgery recovery were compounded with a number of conditions, including upper gastrointestinal haemorrhaging, high fevers, a cerebral oedema, as well as an infection in his lungs.
However, having overcome the conditions with the help of a full team of doctors from various departments, incredibly Fang is now doing better and on the road to recovery.
Doctor Zhang noted that it was both lucky and impressive that Fang had not suffered any seizures or convulsions since the high-risk operation was done on his head, and that he has become increasingly stable.
Even though Fang is now able to walk and talk, the doctor said that another three and a half months will be required for him to make a hopefully near-full recovery.

And while Xavier and his family now have a permanent home, the 10-year-old hasnt forgotten those they left behind, and spends his pocket money buying fabric, buttons and zips so he can make clothes for the homeless.
I think the idea came to him from everything we have endured and wanting to make a difference for other people, Xaviers mother Stephanie told the Huffington Post .

Is there life on Maaaaaaaaaaaaarrrssss?
We dont know. But there might be a pyramid.
Nasas Curiosity rover has captured images of what seems to be a perfectly-formed pyramid on Mars and, unsurprisingly, conspiracy theorists are excited.

The images were taken by the Curiosity rover (Picture: YouTube)
The pyramid is around the size of a car, and the sensible explanation is that it is a rock formation that has formed a pyramidal shape by chance.
But others have come to a different conclusion. Citing the near-perfect design and shape, conspiracy theorists are saying the pyramid is the creation of an intelligent being and therefore its possible it was built by an ancient Martian civilisation.
The premonitiontheory is that the pyramid is a rock formation (Picture: YouTube)
Some go further, suggesting that we on Earth are descended from this Martian civilisation.
Which seems unlikely.
But it isnt the worst idea. Even astrophysicist, scientific commentator and all-round good bloke Neil deGrasse Tyson has suggested in the past that if there werelife on Mars  and yes, its a big if  thenit is not impossible that human lifeoriginated there.

The suspect leaned over the seat and stabbed Aleksandr Lyamkin (Picture: CEN)
A routine roadside check ended with one police officerdead and another seriously injured after a drunk-driver launched a sudden knife attack.
In dashcam footage from the police patrol car, the two officers sit in the front seats while the suspected drunk-driver, a 38-year-old man who has not been named, sits in the back sit.
At first, it seems as if the suspect is about to pass out, but without warning he pulls out a knife, leans over the seat and stabs 36-year-old Aleksandr Lyamkin.

After repeatedly thrusting the knife into Mr. Lyamkin, the attacker then turns his attention to the other officer, stabbing and slashing him a number of times.
Both officers manage to get out the car but Mr. Lyamkin can only walk a few steps before succumbing to his injuries and collapsing. His partner, meanwhile, holds shut the door to prevent the suspect escaping and calls for back up.
Arriving officers arrested the attacker, who they later discovered had managed to find work as a truck driver despite his criminal record, and was afraid he would lose his job if booked for drunk driving.

He faces between 12 and 25 years in prison for the murder of the police officer. The second officer is recovering from his wounds in hospital.
The investigation is ongoing but this is a tragic day for all police officers, said police spokeswoman Ludmila Ryanzantseva.
The dead officer was married with a wife and two children, an 11-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter who will now grow up without their father.

The courts deputy prosecutor Julie Colaert said that every month she saw up to 10 British smugglers before the court, following promises to migrants of a guaranteed passage to the UK.
Aid workers have predicted the plight in Calais is set to worsen, and that more than 2,000 more migrants will flock there over the summer.
Such growth in migrant numbers has led to outbreaks of violence among their number and towards truckers, forcing some hauliers to avoid Calais altogether.
British truckers have spoken about facing daily threats of violence, intimidation, as well as fears of being fined if migrants clamber aboard their trucks.
Meanwhile, there was also an economic impact to the UK. The Fresh Produce Consortium estimates that some 10 million of fresh fruit and vegetables have been thrown away since the start of the year.

Islamic State has suspended two boys from a pole by the wrists because they ate during Ramadan.
Two boys  both said to be under 18  were punished in Mayadeen, Syria, for allegedly breaking the fast without religious justification.
The youths were made to hang from a beam by their wrists on Monday after being accused of eating during daylight hours by ISIS.
Residents in Mayadeen  in the Deir Ezzor province  reported two boys hanging from a crossbar near the headquarters of the jihadi police, Hissba.

The children have been suspended by ropes from a pole since noon, and were still there in the late evening, chief of the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman toldAFP.Apparently, they were caught eating.
A sign reading, They broke the fast with no religious justification, was said to be attached to the boys.
Through the month of Ramadan, Muslims are expected to abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and having sex during daylight.
Children, people in bad mental or physical health, pregnant, postnatal and menstruating women and the elderly are not expected to fast.
People who are exempt from fasting during Ramadan can make up the fasts at a later date.

Squatting in skinny jeans for a long period of time has been linked to damage of the muscles and nerve fibres in the legs, health experts have warned.
Doctors have described the case of a 35-year-old woman who collapsed and spent several hours lying on the ground outside, unable to move, before spending four days in hospital.
The case study, which is published online in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, said she had spent the previous day helping a relative move house, and had spent a number of hours squatting as she emptied cupboards.
She had also been wearing tight skinny jeans and recalled that they had felt increasingly tight and uncomfortable as the day wore on.
Later that evening, she experienced numbness in her feet and found it difficult to walk, which caused her to trip and fall. Unable to get up, she then spent several hours lying on the ground before she was found.

The womans calves were so swollen that her jeans had to be cut off her and she could not move her ankles or toes properly and had lost feeling in her lower legs and feet.
Doctors found she had damaged muscle and nerve fibres in her lower legs as a result of prolonged compression while squatting, which they believed her tight jeans had made worse.
Her fashion choice had prompted the development of compartment syndrome, or reduced blood supply to the leg muscles, causing swelling of the muscles and compression of the adjacent nerves, they said.

She was put on an intravenous drip and was only able to walk unaided after four days.
Doctors said previous side-effects of wearing skinny jeans have been limited to lesions of the thigh, and this was the most serious incident they had heard of.
Associate Professor Thomas Edmund Kimber, of the University of Adelaide in South Australia, said: The present case represents a new neurological complication of wearing tight jeans.

A former cobbler who has been dubbed Ugandas Ugliest Man has become a father for the eighth time.
Godfrey Baguma, 47, who is believed to suffer from a rare, unknown medical condition, and his wife Kate Namanda,30, welcomed a baby girl.
Baguma won the less-than-favourable title in 2002, after he entered the competition to make money for his cash-strapped family.
Before his marriage to Kate, Godfrey hadtwochildren with his first wife  but their marriage came to an end when he caught her cheating with another man.
Describing how he wooed Kate initially, Godfrey told KFM : I stayed with her four years before her people knew where she was. I didnt want them to see me until we had a child because they would definitely advise her to leave me.
She left me when she was six months pregnant but I think she later accepted her fate because she came back two months later.

I told her that I didnt choose to look the way I do and that if she feels I am a burden, she is free to leave me.
The couple got married in 2013, and now have six children together  after their first child was born in 2008.

Around 10,000 dogs have been skinned alive, cooked and eaten as park of a cruel annual tradition in China.
The Yulin government distanced itself from the festival and announced new restrictions, but eateries still did goodbusiness during the event held to mark the summer solstice.
Heartbreaking pictures show mans best friend stuffed into cages as they await their grim fate.
Many are puppies and thought to be stolen pets.
Adam Parascandola, director of animal protection and crisis response at the Washington DC-based charity Humane Society International, described the horror in Yulin on Sunday morning.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
He said: A man would go in the cage with a club and just start clubbing the dogs, just beating them and beating them, not killing them at that point the dogs are screaming and trying to get away and its really heartbreaking.
He said he was struck by the huge variety of breeds of live dogs, delivered on the backs of scooters and trucks, on sale at a market.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
I saw a Dalmatian and a chow and many dogs wearing collars that indicated the likelihood they were stolen pets, he continued.
Apparently concerned about the adverse publicity, the local government disavows any ties to the event, issuing a statement saying it did not officially sponsor or promote the festival.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
It said authorities would tightly control public order and punish any incidents of stealing or poisoning dogs. Traders would no longer be permitted to slaughter dogs in public, place carcasses on display or serve meals outdoors, it said.
Despite such restrictions, restaurant owners said the festival continued to attract enthusiasts for the dish.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
Ricky Gervais has slammed thefestival as disgusting.
The Office star has taken a stand in a series of passionate tweets accompanied by photos showing pets being tortured.
He posted: They believe torturing the dog makes the meat tastier. They beat them, burn them, skin &amp; boil them alive! Disgusting sub human c**ts.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
They steal peoples pets to torture &amp; eat. What would you do to someone who you caught torturing your dog? I hope youd stop them somehow.
Gervais is backing the Humane Society Internationals campaign to shut down Chinas cruel dog and cat meat trade.

This guy riding a moose is such an idiot.
Hopefully an animal jumps on his back one day when hes swimming in deep water.
Maybea lion, or an elephant?
A YouTube video showed him leaping on to a poor moose that already looked like it was struggling.
It let out a huge groan when the man landed on its back after he jumped from a boat.

Polygamy laws are some of the most controversial rulings throughout the world.
In many western societies polygamy, also known as polyamory, has been outlawed for centuries, however in some parts of the world it is still practised.
This map demonstrates just how many countries still allow polygamy (which is a marriage containing more than two people), and in which countries it is illegal but not criminalised.
Many advocates of the poly lifestyle claim that love is an endless entity, and should not just be limited to one person.
Konbini spoke to a 22-year-old woman British woman who claimed to be a polyamorous relationship.

She said: If I was ever to decide that I want a family or that I want to raise my children in a communal family there will be so many difficult legal entanglements that I would have to deal with.
I think I would be in a very precarious position particularly in regard to the public perception of the welfare of my children.
However as the world becomes more homogenised, one global society  Facebook  have clearly taken a stand against polygamy, as users are not able to be in a relationship with more than one person at a time.
Bigamy is a crime in the UK and is punishable by up to seven years in prison.

This video shows the nail-bitingmoment a toddler miraculously escapes certain death as a lorry reverses over him whilehe plays in the street.
In the remarkable CCTV footage, a truck driver in China can be seen reversing his vehicle over the child  but the boy lies desperately still and manages to avoid getting mangled under the trucks wheels.
Shockingly, the truck driver seems pretty unwilling to check on the child driving off without seeing if hes okay.
But the youngster soon gets to his feet and doesnt seem too bothered, running out of the road having presumably learnt his lesson.
Luckiest escape ever?

Still havent booked that week away in the sun this summer?
If youre looking for a cheap holiday then heading to Greece might just be your best bet  as the threat of a Greek exit from the Eurozone has led to travel companies slashing their prices by as much as half.
Its believed that tourists are being put off by the debt crisis, and Tour operators are cutting their prices in a bid to sell unsold package holidays to locations including Athens, and idyllic islands such as Crete and Zante.
At present, sun seekers can snap up a week on the Greek island of Thassos for just 384 per person, a price drop of 45 percent.
And theyre not the only ones  with travel firm Ionian Island Holidays offering a week in a one-bedroom flat in Corfu for just 405, hugely reduced from the normal cost of 809.
However, Thomas Cook remain confident that a Greek exit from the Euro wont impact existing bookings.

Some advice if you are going on holiday to Greece
If staying in a hotel during your trip experts advise to book in advance using Sterling, rather than paying with cash upon arrival or checkout.
If the country leaves the Eurozone during your stay your credit cards might not work, so take some cash.
HOWEVER, travelling withlarge amounts of cash is never advisable for obvious security reasons, so donttake too much.
ATMs are more likely to run out of cash on the Greek islands than on the mainland.
If Greece announces that they are to leave the Eurozone while youre visiting dont panic, it would take about 18 months for the currency to completely revert back to the Greekdrachma.
Greece continues to be an important destination for us and great value for our holidaymakers, a Thomas Cook spokesman told MailOnline.
Were working with our suppliers and closely monitoring the situation.
To date we have seen no drop off in bookings so far as a consequence of a potential Grexit.
We expect an exit from the euro would have no impact on the holidays costumers have already booked with us because we have existing contracts with hotels and airlines.
However, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) has advised tourists to take holiday cash in both euros and credit or debit cards  so theyre not forced to join long queues at local banks if the currency exit goes ahead.
Speculation about a possible Greece debt default, and potential exit from the Euro, has been current for some time, but at present remains just speculation, Abta explained.
Any changes would be highly unlikely to happen overnight, any switch to a new currency would take time and euros would likely be accepted in the interim.

In a statement that claimed responsibility for the attack, the Taliban said that it had been carried out to coincide with a meeting to announce Masoom Stanekzai as defence minister.
Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi has since confirmed that all the MPs inside parliament at the time of the attack are now safe.
MP Sidiqa Mubarez recalled how the parliament building had been shaken by a large explosion and those inside were wounded by flying shards of glass.
And only moments after the attack, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility on Twitter.
Several mujahideen have entered the parliament building, heavy fighting is on-going, he wrote.
The attack happened at a time when the defence minister was being introduced.

Afghan Police have denied that militants stormed the building, but instead claimed that the fighting had instead taken place outside.
It is a group attack by the Taliban on the parliament, Kabul police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi said.

The attack comes at a time when Taliban insurgents continue to gain control across the north of the country, having already captured two districts of the Kunduz province.
Embattled Afghan forces have struggled to defend territories against Taliban advances, after U.S. and NATA forces official withdrew from Afghanistan at the end of last year.

We always had a hunch, but we didnt want to believe.
The horrifying truth, my friends, is that sweat and urine cause stinging red eyes in public swimming pools  not chlorine *immediately washes body*.
Dr. Michael J. Beach, associate director of the Centres for Disease Control and Preventions Healthy Water program, said so.
He told Action Four News : Chlorine binds with all the things its trying to kill from your bodies, and it forms these chemical irritants. Thats whats stinging your eyes. Its the chlorine binding to the urine and sweat.

According to a poll by Travel Zoo of Americans,Brits, Chinese, Canadian and German travellers on travelling faux-pas, Americanspee in the pool the most.
Asked if theyd relieved themselvesin the pool or the sea while on hols, 64 per cent of Americans fessed up, followed by the Brits (46%), Germans (44%), Canadians (58%) and Chinese (41%).
While were busting some swimming pool myths, you may also be interested to know that the water doesnt change colour if you pee. Thats just a rumour spread by killjoys.

You can always trust Uncle Vlad to give back to the people and what better way than showing off Russian military might through a family friendly gun-filledtheme park.
Patriot Park just outside Moscow in Koblinka allows youngsters to fire grenade launchers and clamber over cutting-edge tanks.
According to the Guardian the food served on offer is all made fromarmy rations Yum.

Papa Putin explained that the park isan important element in our system of military-patriotic work with young people and used his speech at the opening to tell thecrowd and a nervous international community that he was adding 40 new intercontinental missiles (ICBMs) to the Russian Federations arsenal.
Just in case Western leaders were not nervous enough, the former KGB officer stated that these new ICBMs are capable of overcoming even the most technically advanced missile defence systems.

In Soviet times the army was a distant, faraway thing, but now we all feel closer to the army. The army is being romanticised and I see that as a good thing.
If we dont educate our own children then America will do it for us like we have seen in Ukraine.

Sabillon had an infection resulting from the surgery (Picture: Reuters)
Having something to get off your chest is never easy.
Smuggling a class A substance through customs inside your breasts  now thats a tough gig.
A woman from Honduras was arrested at an airport near the capital of Bogota in Colombia on June 20, wearing 3.3lbs of liquid cocaine in her breast implants.
Paola Deyanira Sabillon, 22, was en route to Spain when airport security noticed her looking conspicuously nervous in the security line, according to airport police colonel Diego Rosero.
X-rays later showed Sabillon had recently undergone breast surgery to conceal the cocaine.
Sabillon confessed she had taken instructions to deliver the contents in Barcelona without knowing what she was carrying, police said.
A preliminary investigation revealed the surgery was done in an obscure clinic in Pereira, a city based in western Colombia.
The implants were later removed at a Bogota hospital where Sabillon is being treated for an infection resulting from the surgery.
Colombia produces around 300 tonnes of cocaine each year.

The Vasalgel injection is expected to be seen on the US pharmacy shelves as early as 2018.
MORE: 22 ridiculous thoughts all women have about contraception
This injection is taken through the scrotum into the sperm carrying tubes. Just ouch.
Working in a similar way to a vasectomy, a singlepolymer injection prevents sperm enteringthe ejaculate for a matter of years.
Unlike vasectomy this contraceptive method is meant to be easily reversible with another injection developed to dissolve Vasalgel.
As reported by the Telegraph , there are many other male contraceptive methods being developed such as a pill that would allow a man orgasm but not ejaculate.
Another two pill-based options being trialled is Gendarussa ,which aims to prevent the sperms ability to inseminate the egg, and Anti-Eppin which attacks the sperms ability to swim.
All three of these contraceptive methods are non-hormonal  something some women will tell you is a major plus, asmost ofthe standard contraceptive pills supplied to women are hormonal.
Dont forget to practice safe sex out there, everyone.

It might seem counter-intuitive, but extreme music containing lyrics like theseby Five Finger Death Punchcalms you down and makes you feel happier, a study has found.
In a study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 39 regular listeners of so-called extreme music aged 13-34 years were deliberately angered by being asked to recall frustrating and irritating events in their lives, and then listened either to 10 minutes of music of their choice of spent 10 minutes in silence.
The research, which was conducted at The University of Queensland School of Psychology by honours student Leah Sharman and Dr. Genevieve Dingle, found that those who listened of the music, which was generally heavy metaland other similar music genres, became inspired and mellow after the 10-minute period.

A secondary aim for the study was to see what music angry participants would select from their playlist, Ms. Sharman said.
It was interesting that half of the chosen songs contained themes of anger or aggression, with the remainder containing themes like  though not limited to  isolation and sadness.
Yet participants reported they used music to enhance their happiness, immerse themselves in feelings of love and enhance their well-being.
All of the responses indicated that extreme music listeners appear to use their choice of music for positive self-regulatory purposes.

A calcified foetus has been discovered inside the body of an elderly Chilean woman and doctors think it may have been there for more than 50 years.
Local media in Chile reported that a woman, thought to be aged at least 90, was taken to hospital after a fall.
But when doctors X-rayed her, they found to their surprise a 2kg (4.4lb) calcified foetus  believed to have died during pregnancy  inside the womans abdomen and outside her uterus.
The phenomenon, the technical term of which is lithopedion, was called extraordinarily rare by hospital director Margo Vargas Lazo, who spoke to the Efes news agency following the discovery.
Because of the womans age, it is unlikely doctors will operate to remove the foetus, which occupied all of her abdominal cavity, reports the BBC.

The doodle animation shows fathers in various species looking after their children, from penguins to foxes to homo-sapiens.
Clearly these scenes of paternal love and care didnot occur during the Champions League final or the final round of the Masters.
The only question is: why is the doodle green?Is this the patron colour of fathers?
If the doodle doesnt start the oldtear-makers, then this Nationwide advert surely will  we all want that scarf.
It just gives you the wobbles, doesnt it.

We cant be sure, but were fairly certain this young man was the one who masterminded the Hatton Garden heist.
Three-year-old Brody probably spent months planning how to steal that chocolate bar, but unfortunately at the last minute his mum came in and caught him on camera.
Of course it takes more than a little security footage to out-do a mastermind like Brody, especially when he makes fantastic use of the old walk sideways and hide the chocolate bar behind your back technique.
He nearly makes it, until a slight hiccup (a table), causes him to drop his precious bounty.

A new device might soon be available which allows blind people to see using their tongue.
Having just been approved by the FDA (theFood and Drug Administration), theBrainPort V100could soon be on the shelves.
How does it work?
The BrainPort V100, developed by Wisconsin-based Wicab, uses a camera to grab the visual data, which is then translated into electrical stimuli.
This is fed to the blind person by a 400-electrode sensor array which is placed on their tongue.
The idea is to create a feel-based image which allows blind people to visualize objects around them.
MORE: A blind man and a man with no arms have been working together to plant trees for 13 years

Its tricky to explain, and even using it takes some practice to use, however 69 per cent of subjects who tested the device in trials said it enabled them to gain some sort of visual semblance about the physical world around them.
Robert Beckman, chief executive officer of Wicab Inc , said: People are able to learn to interpret these patterns of bubbles or stimulation on their tongue to know what object is in front of them.
We dont want to create false hopes, they need to learn the technology and practice with it. Its more akin to learning a new language than it is to ordinary perception.
The device is expected to cost about $10,000 (6,300) when it becomes commercially available.

A statement from the city council said: At 12pm there was an appalling incident in the centre of Graz, which has caused major alarm and left the city deeply shaken.
A killer used his car as a weapon and deliberately ran people down on a rampage. The perpetrator is in custody.

Were not sure whats more strange, the fact she allegedly stole 131 pairs of knickers or she thought shed get away with it.
Even the laziest of security guards would probably notice if someone tookall that underwear.
So its no surprise Julia Marie Jones was caught after she allegedly pocketed the briefsin a Walmart in Georgia, United States.

The 22-year-old apparently hid the knickers in her handbag and some plastic shopping bags.
We can only imagine shewas planning to sell the garments, which are worth $749.95 (472).
That, or she really loves her underwear.
Whatever the reason, she will still have to face a charge of felony theft by shoplifting after being arrested on Monday.
One thing we do know is Jones is definitely tired ofhearing about the incident after posting this Facebook message below.

Dylann Roof, the man charged with shooting dead nine people in a church, has appeared before a court via video uplink.
Flanked by two armed guards,21-year-old Roof heard words from family members of people who died in the massacre.
With little emotion on his face, Roof listened as many people said they forgave him for his alleged crimes.
Alana Simmons, granddaughter of Daniel Simmons who died in the shooting, said: Although my grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate, this is proof that they lived and loved.
One woman whose sondied in the shooting even said she would welcome him to our Bible study.

The Judge at the bail hearing said he was unable to set bond (bail) for the nine murders Roof allegedly committed, however bond for the fire arms offence was set at $1million.
He will therefore remain in custody until his next court appearance in October, followed by a another hearing in February 2016.

It was once claimed that he learnt at drive at the age of 3, so perhaps its no surprise that Kim Jong Un claims to have a developed a single drug which is capable of preventing and curing diseases such as Aids and Ebola.
Yes  an internationally condemned bloodthirsty despot claims to have emerged as an unlikely medical savour. Right.
Inevitably, theres little to back this bold claim up  but the official Korean Central News Agency has said that the cheese-loving dictators scientists developed miracle pill Kumdang-2 from ingredients including gingseng.
The pill is said to be responsible for preventing and curing diseases such as Aids, Ebola, Sars and Mers.
And perhaps even more astonishing is the claim that the same drug cured lethal bird flu epidemics in 2006 and 2013.

While the eurozone (countries which use the euro as their currency) has been around for 16 years, its still sometimes seen as project, and not everyone believes it is going so well.
Unless you have been living under a rock with no Wi-Fi for the last decade you willbe aware that the Greek economy has been having some difficulty.
After several bailouts due to the countrys ongoing financial crisis, several theorists believe both the country and the larger eurozone would benefit from Greece leaving the currency union.
But what effect would this have?
The British Government say they are preparing for serious economic risk should Greece default on their debt and leave the Euro Zone.
MORE: Fox presenter says its extraordinary to call Charleston church shooting a hate crime
Before you chime in with your belief that Farage was right all along, the eurozone only refers to the 19 countries which use the euro and is separate for the EU (European Union), which Greece canstill be part of even if, like the UK, it chooses not to use the Euro.
Greece has faced massive protests and strikes during its extended financial crisis, with critics claiming austerity measures brought in have been unfairly aimed at people lower down on the socio-economic scale.
Recent talks between Greece and its many creditors ended with the agreement that the country must pay back1.6billion (1.14billion) within two weeks to the International Monetary Fund, one of its creditors.
Unsurprisingly Greece have said they can not be expected the repay their debts without debt relief from the rest of Europe.

Oh Fox News  you cant help but usea horrific tragedy to your own political advantage, can you?
Fox News presenter Steve Doocy recently spoke topastor E W Jackson for his views on the killingof nine people in theCharleston church shooting recently.
The interview started off fairly regularly, with the pastor being asked about the effect on Christianity and church goers across America, before things got a bit weird.
Despite many people believing the gunman to be racially motivated, Doocy cant stop himself from questioning why the incident was called a racially motived hate crime, claiming instead that the it was an attack based on religion.

Doocy said: Extraordinarily they called it a hate crime, and somelook at it as, well it was a white guy in a black church.
Mr Jackson then added that because the gunman didnt attack a bar or a basketball court, this somehow certified itas a attack on Christianity rather then black people.
Since the interview suspected gunmanDylann Roof admitted to killing the nine people to start race war.

You could be getting short changed, just like customers at this market stall allegedly were.
A YouTube video apparently showed the female seller adding weight to a bag attached to the scales before customers paid for their fruit and vegetables.
Is she scamming her customers? (Picture: YouTube/Onliner)
This meant they would pay more because it appeared as if their products had a higher weight.
The video from Russia, which was posted last week, has unsurprisingly irked a few people, with one reader sarcastically calling the seller kind, generous and helpful.
So the next time you shop at a market you may want to check if there are weights behind the till.

Thousands of people have come out in support of a Malaysian gymnast after her revealing outfit sparked anger.
Farah Ann Abdul Hadi, 21, took home goldin the womens floor exercise final at the SEA Games.
In celebration, a Malaysian TV channel uploaded a picture of her after the event to its Facebook page  but was later taken down.
People bombarded the thread with their outrage over her gymnastic outfit which they believe showed her aurat, meaning private areas.
But in response, a fan page was created on Facebook which people are flocking to togive praise.

Muslim groups have waded into the debate.
The student arm of Islamist group Ikatan Muslimin Malaysia (Isma) said Muslim women should stay away from activities which are not Shariah-compliant, reports the Malay Mail Online .
Roszida Kamaruddin, of Isma, said: If Jakim had recently been able to provide a guideline for concerts in Malaysia, I am optimistic Jakim will be able to provide a guideline for sports next.
Gymnastics comes from the Greek word gymnastikos, meaning skilled in bodily exercise. This, in turn, originated from the archaic Greek word gymnos which means naked, as athletes in ancient Greek competed without clothes.
Women should not be stopped from sports, but they must priorities the Islamic codes in sports attire. Furthermore, there are many Muslim female athletes who succeed even by covering their aurat.

Plankton is more evil than we could have ever imagined.
After the jealous Bikini Bottom restaurateur stole the Krabby Patty recipe, he offed Mr Krabs and all of his friends.
This scene on a San Diego beach looks like asinister Spongebob Square Pants twist.
Thousands of tiny red tuna crabs have been washed upon Southern California coastline.
Such strandings take place periodically and are not necessarily a threat to the species, according to Linsey Sala, collection manager for the Pelagic Invertebrates Collection at the University of California, San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
Experts have warned beachgoers not to eat the crabs (Picture: REUTERS)
She said: This is definitely a warm-water indicator.Whether its directly related to El Nino or other oceanographic conditions is not certain.
Scripps has cautioned people not to eat the crabs because the creatures may have ingested toxin-producing phytoplankton.
Scientists have noted the presence of a toxic algae bloom in the Pacific Ocean stretching from California north to Washington state that might be the largest ever detected off the US West Coast.
Experts arent sure if plankton caused the death of so many crabs, but such analgae boom cannot be ignored.
Its only a matter of time before Plankton strikes again.

Gary Glenn sensationally claimed schools should be held liable for STDs (Picture: YouTube)
This is Gary Glenn. Hes everything wrong with the world.
The Michigan legislator has sensationally said that schools which say its okay to be gay should be held criminally liable if students get a deadly STD.
The representative was speaking during a documentary released this year called Light wins: How to overcome the Criminalization of Christianity.
He says: If some young person hears at school that its okayto be gay and then comes down with a fatal disease as a result, school officials should be held legally liable, individually and in their official capacities, financially and maybe even criminally.
Say what now? Its right here:
The interview was filmed in 2013 but the clip was highlighted and uploaded to YouTube this week.

Despite his views, Mr Glenn has since said he does not have plans to introduce lawto penalise school officials if gay students later contractand STD.
He did say he still stands by his comments, however.
Mr Glenn said: If the school environment is teaching children that homosexual behavior is normal and healthy, and children, in reliance on what theyre taught from authority figures, decide to experiment or engage in such behavior and suffer negative health consequences, somebody ought to be held accountable.
Yvonne Siferd of LGBT group Equality Michigan said hiscomments would be laughable if they werent hyperbolic and so very dangerous.

Left handers  it turns out that you can count kangaroos among your ranks.
Thats according to a new study, which suggested that wild kangaroos favour their left hands during everyday tasks such as feeding and grooming.
Scientists from St Petersburg State University discovered the remarkable findings after travelling to Australia to spend hours observing the marsupials in the wild.
And it was a trend that all Kangaroos seemingly followed  with two species of roo and one wallaby appearing to favour their left hand for everyday activities.
But wildlife ecologist Janeane Ingram, who collaborated on the study, explained that the findings had not been widely embraced by the scientific community.
You want some?
Speaking to the BBC, she said: Unfortunately, even my own colleagues think that studying left-handed macropods is not a serious issue, but any study that proves true handedness in another bipedal species contributes to the study of brain symmetry and mammalian evolution.

Lead author Dr Yegor Malashichev said that the study was solid confirmation that we are not alone in the Universe; we are two  humans and kangaroos.
And when it comes to why kangaroos are left handed, researchers believe that posture plays an important role  with left handedness only seen in species that stand on their hind legs, using forelimbs for a variety of tasks.

This is the moment suspected killer Dylann smiled at cameras as he was led away in chains after his capture.
The 21-year-old wasseen later at 6.20pm wearing a pinstripe jumpsuit as he was escorted onto a plane back to Charleston with chains around his ankles and his hands handcuffed behind his back.
He was caught in Shelby, North Carolina, 250 miles from the church where he allegedly gunned down nine black people attending a bible study group and prayer meeting.

Coleman-Singleton, 45, DePayne Middleton, 49, Cynthia Hurd, 54, Ethel Lance, 70, Susie Jackson, 87, and Reverend Daniel Simmons.

The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime.
Greg Mullen confirmed the arrest during a press conference. The Charleston Police Chief said: This case could not have been cleared at quickly as it has been if not for all the investigation involved in the operation. I cant say how grateful I am. Some of them have worked tirelessly.
Mayor Joseph P Riley added: Weve had extraordinary cooperation. Because of all of that work, we can announce that that awful person  the terrible human being who went into a place of worship when they were playing would kill them  is in custody.

The shooting marks one of the most notorious attacks on a black church in the South since the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed four girls and helped galvanize the U.S. civil rights movement. The bombing was tied to the Ku Klux Klan.

The bloodshed in Charleston follows a wave of racial tension and protests stirred by recent police killings of unarmed black men in cities across the country, that have sparked a renewed civil rights movement under the banner of Black Lives Matter.
In one such case in neighboring North Charleston, a white police officer was charged with murder after he shot Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, in the back.

The group is seen chatting around a table with papers scattered on it. It is believed that Roof sat with them for an hour before opening fire and allegedly killing nine people.
The video was obtained by Mashable, who confirmed its authenticity with four of Tywanzas friends.
I didnt notice until now that Dylann was just a few people away from Wanza, one friend told Mashable.You can slightly see him in the right corner of the screenshot.
Many expressed their shock at the footage.

Heinz has apologised after a QR code on the back of bottles of ketchupdirected users to a hardcore porn website.
The QR code  the matrix barcode found on the back of some products  was supposed to link to a webpage where you could design your own ketchup label, and it did between 2012 and 2014.
But when the link expired this year, Fundorado, a hardcore porn site, registered the website for itself.
Its incomprehensible that [they] didnt reserve the domain for one or two years, said Germancustomer Daniel Korell, who discovered the mistake.
It really doesnt cost the Earth.
Heinz wrote on Facebook that they regret the event very much.

 Pope Francis (@Pontifex) June 18, 2015
We imagineyoure unlikely to find Louis Armstrongs What a Wonderful World on the popes iPod.
Going by His Holinesss latest tweet, Pope Francis is disgusted by the current state of the planet, which he says is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.
The pope has been fiercely critical of ourtreatment of Earth, and inhis latest encyclical  released today  he called on the rich in to change their lifestyles or watch the planets ecosystem be destroyed.
The 192-page letter, titled Laudato Si, On the Care of Our Common Home accuses the human raceof seeing itself as lords and masters, entitled to plunder at will.
He further attacks humanityscollective selfishness, which he says manifests itself in consumerism.
In its stead, he suggests a moral approach tothe environment, urging the whole human family to come together to seek sustainable and integral development.
We know that things can change, he writes.

Somehow, a drivermanaged to execute 12 vertical loops in the largest death cage in the world, a 40-foot tall sphere in Vilnius, Lithuania.
Death cage drivers know that speed is critical to executing the stunt successfully: so long as the car goes fast enough, it wont succumb to gravity.
According to YouTube user Vecord, who uploaded the video, the driver experienced forces of 7g  the same as byApollo 16 on re-entry.

If youre concerned about privacy, you might want to think twice next time you open WhatsApp.
Anew report recommends you stay away from the app, which it ranks as the technology company that is least protective of user data.
The Electronic Frontier Foundations annual Who Has Your Back? report was stronglycritical of the instant messaging app inevery criterion, and recommended that users useApple applicationsor Dropbox for IMand file exchange.

Adobe, Wikimedia, WordPress and Yahoo also received high marks for their defence of user privacy, though the EFFsgrading of Google and Microsoft werefar less complimentary.
Facebook, which owns WhatsApp but was rated separately, was given four out of five stars, as was Twitter.
The Who Has Your Back? report assesses technology companies in five criteria: whether they follow best practices for data security, whether they inform users when the government requests data, whether they are open about their policies on holding on to user data, whether they tell users when the government demands the removal of content, and whether they publicly oppose so-called backdoors which give the government access to data.

It might seem half a century late, but Russia is to launch an investigation into the American moon landings.
According to Russian newspaper Izvestia, an investigation will seek to discover why original footage and a lunar rock from the first moon landing in 1969 disappeared.
Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Russian governments Investigative Committee, stressed that he and the department are not saying the landings didnt happen (perish the thought), butthat they are simply curious as to the whereabouts of certain artifacts which are part of the legacy of humanity.
We are not contending that they did not fly [to the moon], and simply made a film about it, he wrote in an op-ed forIzvestia.

But all of these scientific or perhaps cultural artifacts are part of the legacy of humanity, and their disappearance without a trace is our common loss. An investigation will reveal what happened.
Reuters reports that Nasa has admitted to erasing the original footage the save money, though it was later restored in better quality using other recordings.
Mr. Markin said that the investigation might uncovernew information aboutthe various spacemissions.
While it seems odd that Russia would launch the investigation more than 50 years after the moon landings happened, Mr. Markin didcomplain in his op-ed piece that the US authorities had crossed a line in their probe of nine Fifa officials.
US prosecutorshave declared themselves the supreme arbiters of international football affairs.

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out (Picture: Google)
When Morrissey sang There Is a Light That Never Goes Out, he was surely referring to this traffic lamp in Germany, which has stayed red for the past 28 years.
The light in question stands at the intersection of four different streets in Dresden, just south of the river Elbe.
Drivers can turn right at the light at any time as long as they take due caution, but if they want to drive straight ahead, they might be waiting a while.
The light isnt faulty, however. In fact, the city council designed the light always to be red.

The light lies at an intersection in Dresden (Picture: Google)
Because the green light means transport is free to go all the other lights in conflict to this one must show red,a spokesperson told The Local .
The red light instructs: stop at the intersection. After stopping one is also allowed to turn right if there is a sign to the right of the traffic light that shows a green arrow on a black background.
Because on Ziegelstrae one is only allowed to turn right, in accordance with regulation 27 section 37 of the transport regulations, we can do without using the traffic signals green light.
Apparently, a simple stop sign wouldnt do because they dont fulfill the same set of regulations.
So much for German efficiency.

At the height of the War on Terror, the CIA collaborated with a major toymaker to develop an Osama bin Laden doll, the face of which would peel off to revealred skin and demonic eyes.
It was to be distributed among Afghan children in an attempt to stir up anti-bin Laden sentiment among the general populace.

Even the most level-headed adults would freeze if faced with a gun-wielding murderer.
But a super smart five-year-old girl managed to survive the Charleston Church shooting by playing dead, suggests a local news station.
A slim white gunman named by local media as 21-year-old Dylann Roof opened fire and killed nine people during a prayer session in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church  one of the oldest historically black churches in America.
Roofs uncle Carson Cowels, 56, reported him after he recognised his nephew on the CCTV footage released by police.
He said Roofreceived a gun as a birthday present for his 21stin April. A.45 calibre pistol. Its not yet known if it was the same gun used in the attack  which is being investigated as a hate crime.

Relatives of the girl said to have survived the attack told ABC News 4  a station based in Charleston  that the youngster had dodged the killer by keeping quiet and pretending to be dead.
Its thought that shes currently recovering from the ordeal in the nearby Medical University of South Carolina hospital.
Journalist Rob Mallia, who is reporting from the scene tweeted: Family says 5 year old survived by playing dead. Child resting @MUSChealth @ABCNews4.
An intense manhunt in underway to locate Roof, from Lexington. Police are now surrounding his mothers house, but it has not been confirmed if he is inside.
A local newspaper suggestshe is currently on bail for drugs charges, while court records say he was charged with trespassing in April.
The gunman apparently sat in a religious meeting for an hour before gunning down members of the congregation.
Among the dead are six women and three men, including Reverend Clementa C Pinckney.

Someones put an Oyster card under their skin to save time and it doesnt even workproperly
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Thursday 18 Jun 2015 3:52 pm
Warning: Graphic content
A Russian man has gone to pretty extreme lengths to cut out barely any time at all.
Vlad Zaitsevsliced open his hand and slipped in the equivalent of an Oyster card to speed uphis commute in Troika.
Now the engineer only has to touch his mitt on the card reader to ride the subway. But at what cost.
He underwent surgery to implant the pass inhis skin and has been left with a big scar.
Vladinsists that it didnt cause any pain and there were no complications afterwards.
He said: It is the perfect solution to not have to worry about losing an expensive season ticket, although I admit its not going to be everybodys cup of tea.
He does admit, however,that the plan has not worked as well as he had hoped.
Vlad continued: Not all of the scanners seem to have a very strong signal to read the Troika card, and they dont always manage to read the chip.
Fail much?

Anyone else suffering this season? (Picture: Getty)
If youre reading this, congratulations  you havent scratched your eyesoutyet.
It feels like a particularly bad year for hay fever sufferers, and its only going to get worse as the pollen count is set to soar over the next couple of weeks.
But dont let those A-hole plants and trees steal summer. Here are some of the best hay fever remedies and prevention teckkers.
Eat chilli peppers
The fiery food contains capsaicin which, when consumed, has the ability to reduce congestion by opening up our nasal passages.
Just dont chow them down like theyre M&amp;Ms.
Lemons help too
(Picture: Getty)
Or any food high in vitamin C for that matter.
This includes oranges and grapefruit. A combination of vit C andbioflavonoids present in the fruit makes and naturalantihistamine which relieves symptoms of the nightmare that is hay fever.
Around1,000mg of vitamin C a day should do the trick.
Self-hypnosis
Research suggests you can actually train yourself to relax your body when feeling symptoms of hay fever.
The amazing teckkers is taught through breathing techniques.
This does work best before the season, however.
Acupuncture
(Picture: Getty)
Ouch! It doesnt look like the most pleasant treatment, but acupuncture has been known to help itchy eyes and a blocked nose.
Honey
(Picture: Getty)
Fight nature with nature: Its an old wives tale but honey produced by your local bees could actually stave off hay fever.
Studies have shown that as a healing agent it is better than over-the-counter remedies forcommon colds.
And thousands of people swear by it, claiming a spoonful of honey a day is the best way to build up an immunity.
Immunotherapy
(Picture: Getty)
Time to break out the big guns.
Immunotherapyinvolves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen,such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction.
It can be given either as an injection or a tablet to dissolve under your tongue. Over time itll build up a tolerance to the allergy.

        <Description>The month-long fast begins today. </Description>
        <MainBody>Ross McG for Metro.co.uk Thursday 18 Jun 2015 12:10 pm

Ramadan begins today for millions of Muslims around the world.
But what does it mean and why do Muslims fast for a month?
Here is everything you need to know about Ramadan.
1. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar
It is believed that the central text of Islam, the Quran, was first revealed to the prophet Muhammad during Ramadan, which begins and ends according to the moon, meaning Ramadan moves 10 or 11 days forward each year.
2. Fasting during Ramadan is known as sawm
Sawm is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, the foundation of Muslim life, which also include faith, prayer, charity and at least one pilgrimage to Mecca in a lifetime if able.
3. The word Ramadan means dryness or scorching heat
4. Muslims must fast for one month
Because of the moons cycle, Ramadan will either last 29 or 30 days. Between dawn and sunset, Muslims must refrain from eating food, drinking liquids, smoking and having sex.

5.Fasting is obligatory once Muslims reach puberty
However, children can fast if they wish. Those exempt from fasting include the elderly, the sick, people who are travelling, and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or menstruating.
6. As well as fasting, Muslims try to refrain from bad behaviour
During Ramadan, Muslims are also asked not to use swear words or talk about others behind their backs.

7. Ramadan begins with the sighting of the crescent moon
Muslims look for the crescent moon  or the hilal  to let them know the new monthis beginning.
8. Fasting Muslims have a meal before dawn and one after sunset
The pre-dawn meal is called the suhoor, while the evening meal is known as the iftar.With the iftar, the first food taken to break the days fast is usually dates, what Muhammad is believed to have taken to break fast.

9. Muslims give more during Ramadan
It is common for Muslims to give more money to charity  one of the Five Pillars of Islam  during Ramadan than in any other month of the year.
10. Reading the Quran is encouraged
Many Muslims read the Quran during the month of Ramadan, reciting the book as a special prayer.

11. In some countries, there are penalties for breaking the fast
Breaking the fast in public is considered a crime in some Muslim countries and offenders may be sent to prison. In other countries, an offence is punishable with fines and community service.
12. Ramadan is about cleansing the soul
Muslims take part in the fast to bring them closer to God and to their community  the evening iftar meal is often shared with friends and family. Fasting is about learning self-discipline and generosity.

13. Fasting times vary throughout the world
There are 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, but they have vastly different fasting times during Ramadan because it follows the hours of daylight. In Iceland, for example, there are more than 21 hours of daylight, while a daily fast in Australia might only be 11 hours.
Muslims in polar regions of continuous daylight can adjust to the hours of their nearest city, or they can follow the fasting hours of Mecca.
14. Fasting can be healthy if done right
Short bursts of fasting in Ramadan can help with weight loss and release endorphins that improve mental well-being, according to a report by the NHS . But binging at the end of each fasting day is not advised.
15. Ramadan contains the holiest night of the year
In Islam, the Night of Power, or Laylat al-Qadr, is when the first verses of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad by God, and is considered the holiest night of the year.
But the Quran does not identify which specific night it fell on, although it is believed to be one of the odd-numbered dates during the last ten days of Ramadan.
On this night, Muslims believe angels come down to Earth and that God forgives all sins.

16. Ramadan ends with a celebration
The end of Ramadan is marked by the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which heralds the beginning of the next lunar month, Shawwal. Fasting ends and Muslims praise Godfor helping them through the previous month.
Muslims greet each other by saying Eid Mubarak (Happy Eid) and there are processions in the streets. It is celebrated by exchanging gifts and visiting friends and family.

It could be another tale of star-crossed lovers  or will it be heart-crossed lovers?
In a move that shouldnt really bother anyone but obviously will, Twitter are apparently planning to change their favourite icon from a star to a heart.
They are testing the potential change so it will only affect a small number of users (mainly android users), but that doesnt mean everyone and their mother will soon have an opinion on it.
Oh wait, they already do  and guess where they are heading to vent their frustration (or appreciation).
Would love to see Twitter switch to hearts over stars. Most users get really confused by "star" and "favorite" https://t.co/0cnRyBLrRI

A teenager has been shot dead after using a mobile tracking app to findhis missing iPhone.
Jeremy Cook, 18, from London in Ontario, Canada, went on a hunt for his smartphone after leaving it in a taxi.
He downloaded a tracker app which lead him to a car where he confronted three men.
But he was shot when the car startedto drive off and he grabbed the handle of the drivers door.
He died from multiple gunshots wounds.
London policemanKen Steeves told The Canadian Press :Its certainly extreme, no one ever would have predicted or even thought that a loss of life would have resulted from a loss of a phone.
It wasnt the app that took away Jeremys life, it was the individuals, which would be rare, who happened to be armed with a gun.

A gang of child snatchers is reportedly luring British children into cars by dressing as waiters to trick unsuspecting parents on holiday.
Holidaymakers weremoved to another hotel in Cyprusafter three children on a Thomas Cook breakwere stopped at the last minute from getting intothe cars with the men.
Police have launched an investigation after the incidentat the Anastasia Beach Complex, near Protaras.
The kids were targeted on Tuesday night after up to ten men were spotted loitering around the hotel and taking photos.
Greg Letford, 28, from Dundee, was part of a wedding party. He told the Daily Record : This Romanian couple were leading the two young children towards a waiting car, another person had a third child up against a wall ready to go, too.

Someone spotted what they were up to and stopped them. If he hadnt been there those kids would have gone.
One of the men got away and we heard the getaway car crashed a short distance away too.

He continued: When the police turned up, they took the man and woman into an office in the hotel and a crowd built up in the foyer  there must have been about 60 or 70 really angry people. It was chaos.
The police got them into a van through a window for their protection. One of the hotel staff later told us they were Romanian and that one of them used to work at the hotel.
The children are safe.
Thomas Cook has since relocated a number of customers to a new hotel.
A spokeswoman said: Thomas Cook have requested an increased and immediate security presence at the hotel.

The safety and welfare of our customers is always our first priority and, upon hearing about the incident, we immediately deployed our experienced resort team to the property to provide those customers in residence with individual support.

Not advised: Eating a bowl of cereal behind the wheel.
But apparently this womans schedule is so tight she simply has no choice but to chow down on her Crunchy Nut while on the move.
A very excitable cyclist caught the bizarre scene on camera, and took great joy in confronting her.
The helmet cam footage shows the man cycle past a red Land Rover in Hampton Court.
He then cuts across the road and shouts through the window: Put that down, youre on camera, youre going to the police, Ive got your number.
The motorist doesnt react initially, and then throws a few hand gestures.
The cyclists proceeds to tell the driver behind her, because he can.

A white man has opened fire on people prayinginside a historic black church, killing nine people, in what has been described as a hate crime.
The man, who is believed to be in his early 20s, was said to still be at large last night.
The shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston was carried out last night as the people inside took part in a prayer meeting, police said.
There are believed to be survivors, but it is not knownhow many, or how many were inside at the time of the shooting.

It was unknown whether the pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, was one of the victims.
Police Chief Greg Mullen saidbelieved it was a hate crime, but would not elaborate.
The only reason that someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is out of hate, said Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley. It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine, and we will bring that person to justice.  This is one hateful person.

As police and the citys mayor updated the news media, a group of pastors huddled together praying in a circle across the street.
Police moved members of the news media back away from the site due to what they called an imminent threat. They did not release any details.
The campaign of Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush sent out an email saying that due to the shooting, the candidate had canceled an event planned in the city Thursday.
The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charlestons Methodist Episcopal church.
One of its founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. He was caught, and white landowners had his church burned in revenge. Parishioners worshipped underground until after the Civil War.

A teenage girl has been arrested after policefound a number of mobile phone photos appearing to show her receiving oral sex from a pit bull.
Police in Bradenton, Florida, had accessed the audio manager application on the phone of Ashley Miller, 18, while working on a sexual battery investigation.
But when officers opened a folder called 2-face fun, they allegedly found 17 photos of a dog  later found to be named 2-face performing oral sex on Miller.
Miller explained that she would call 2-face into her room, take her pants off, open her legs and 2-face would lick he(r) vagina, a police report reads.
Miller believes 2-face has licked her vagina approximately thirty to forty times.
Miller admitted to police that she kept the dog at her grandmothers house and would go there when she wanted oral sex, pix11 reports.
She also allegedly told detectives that her previous dog, a Rottweiler-pit bull cross named Scarface, did the same thing to her years earlier and that she did not have to push her [the dog] to do it.
Miller faces two counts of misdemeanor sexual activities involving animals.

A murderer who killeda model in South London has admitted raping another woman  a crime for which adifferentman has spent 12 years in prison.
Mark Dixie, 44, murdered 18-year-oldSally Anne Bowman in 2005, and has now admitted to the brutal rape of a woman in Spain,a crimefor whichDutchman Romano van der Dussen was found guilty.
He remains behind bars today  yet theDutch National Forensic Investigation Agency have this week carried out DNA tests which allegedly prove Dussen is innocent of the crime.
When Dussens lawyer questioned Dixie over these allegations last week he allegedly broke down and confessed to sexually assaulting a Spanish woman in Fuengirola while high on drink and drugs in 2003.
Hero who died saving woman after she jumped onto train tracks was a family friend
In a statement, PrisonLAW, a law firm specialising in overturning miscarriages of justice, said: Mark Dixie confessed that in 2003 he was living in Fuengirola and he remembers committing a rape that Romano van der Dussen has been convicted of.
He also stated that he is sorry that another person has been in prison for such a long period of time for that rape.

Dixie was living inFuengirola, a party town on Spains south coast, in 2003 when three women were attacked within two hours of each other.
Dussen was arrested three weeks after the attack when one of the victims picked him out from photographs on police files.
Even though no DNA evidence linked Dussen to the attacks he was charged with the crimes and jailed for 15-and-a-half years.
Sally Anne Bowman was stabbed several times and raped while she lay dying on the floor of her flat in 2005.
Dixie was linked to the crime ayear later after being arrested for a bar fight. It was found when he was arrested that his DNA matched the sample found on Sally Anne.
He was sentenced to life for the murder and told he must serve at least 34 years behind bars.

I saw them playing with dolls and I wanted to do the same, but I never did for fear of prejudice, he said.
When he was 17 Mauricio started taking acting classes  only to discover he wasnt considered beautiful.

So he decided to go under the knife, having a nose job and polymethylmethacrylate fillers injected into his face.
After Mauricio had undergone eight surgical procedures he was dubbed the human Ken doll by the media, and adopted the nickname.

Vodafone blocked a boring LGBT community website on the grounds that it violated the companys content control because it includes LGBT-related keywords, the sites founder believes.
Peter Burnett, who co-founded financial advice website lgbt.co.uk, said he was contacted by a Vodafone user who said they were unable to access the site because a Vodafone content control wasin place.
But according to Mr. Burnett, nothing on the website is remotely inappropriate and most people would even find it quite boring. He believes that Vodafone, like some other sites, may have blocked it on the grounds that it contains LGBT-related keywords.
If you open the webpage and read the script, you can see it is a site giving LGBT financial advice so I can only presume that someone at Vodafone or the listing people that provided them with the advice or list has just included certain terms, he told Cable.co.uk .

Mr. Burnett asked Vodafone to lift the block, and says there are literally thousands of websites that are harmless but contain similarkeywords to those found onlgbt.co.uk  and thereforecouldalso be blocked.
A Vodafone spokesperson said: Vodafone UK, along with the rest of the UK mobile operators use the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to define which content is unsuitable for customers under the age of 18.
We use a third party supplier to provide automated technology to block sites which are unsuitable under that rating system and have recently changed our supplier, which clearly has slightly different categories than those of the provider we used before.
We believe that the new automated system blocked this site by mistake. As soon as the issue was raised, we went back to our supplier to ensure it was unbarred with immediate effect.

There are more mobile phone blackspots in Liverpool than any other UK city, a study has revealed.
The research, carried out by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS), also found that around 40 per cent of Brits have a mobile phone blackspot in their home  with kitchens being the worst location.
It also revealedthat all of the big four UK operators are having problems extending their 4G/LTE networks into British homes.
GWS polled 2,000 people across the nation and quizzed them on how badly theysuffer from a lack of signal in their home. Staff alsospent six weeks collecting and analysing data from inside London homes.
Cardiff, Bristol and Norwich are some of the worst places after Liverpool.
One in every 14 test calls GWS made using devices locked to the EE network failed inside houses, the study goes on to claim.
By way of contrast, O2s voice network blocked less than one per cent of calls during testing, while Vodafones blocked and dropped only one per cent of calls.
An array of 12 Samsung Galaxy S5s with three different sim cards were used for the research.
Paul Carter, CEO of GWS, said: The UK is no longer a fixed line nation. When were at home we dont just receive calls on our mobiles  we make them too.
The best phone is the one youve got on you  not the one sitting in its dock out in the hallway. But that presents a problem for operators  many of whom are clearly struggling with the brave new world of in-home mobility.
Only by gathering and analysing accurate data on the performance of wireless networks will operators find a solution that genuinely benefits consumers  consumers who are currently not well-served by the kind of crowd-sourced data operators too-often use to bolster unrealistic claims about the level of service they offer.

Women have been told that they should freeze their eggs by the age of 35 if they want to have children, as their changesof giving birth decrease significantlyas they enter their late thirties.
A 12-yearstudy was carried out on nearly 4,200 women undergoing 5,841 IVF cycles and aged between 38 and 44 at Barcelonas Hospital Universitaro Quiron-Dexeus.
The study found that would-be mothers were 18 times less likely to have a baby through IVF at 44 than at 38, when the chances of successful fertilisation are just 24 percent. Lead researcher Dr Marta Devesa concluded that women should be encouraged to have families earlier, and failing that they should look to freeze their eggs by the age of 35.

There is a clinically relevant decline from 41/42  but the prognosis is really futile from 44 and onwards, she said atthe European Society of Human Reproductions conference in Lisbon.
Women should be encouraged to have families earlier but if you cant change society then we should encourage them to freeze their eggs by 35.
Indeed women of 44 or older should be fully informed about their real chances of a live birth and counselled in favour of oocyte (immature egg) donation.

Professor Adam Balen, who is chairman of the British Fertility society, told the Telegraph that people should not assume they can have children late because some celebrities managed to do so.
While you hear lots of good news stories about celebrities who may have given birth at an older age, nobody knows the number of celebrities who may not have been able to have babies, either because of infertility or possibly even having had fertility treatment that has been unsuccessful, he said.
There is always a strong possibility that many of these celebrities may well have sought the assistance of a fertility clinic and may have conceived either with IVF or donor eggs.

If you thinkangering the Gods by stripping off on a volcanois the most bizarre way toland yourself in hot water abroad, think again.
Because, believe it or not, this isnt the most peculiar crime you can commit in a foreign country.
Theres a host of odd offences worthy ofa fine or even jail time.
Letslook at some of the craziest.
1. Going commandoThailand
(Picture: Andre Camara/REX/Shuttershock)
Look, we know its tempting to free the beast all over the inside of your shorts or skirt, but just dont, okay?
Its an offence to leave your home in Thailand without a pair of panties on. But what qualifies as underpants is unknown. Still wouldnt risk it with a TOWIE-esq willykini though.
2. Running out of fuel on the Autobahn
(Picture: PA)
Germans dont take kindly to motorists running out of fuel on the countrys biggest road. Probably because it has no speed limit. Wait, shouldnt there be a law against that?
3. Driving in flip flops in Spain
(Picture: Getty)
While were on the subject of driving  this should be avoided any where in the world. But Spain actually clamps down on weirdos who drive with rubbery material strapped to their feet.
Seriously, who does that?
4. Wearing high heels in Greece
(Picture: Getty)
Again, practical footwear, people! If you happen to trek around the ancient ruins of Greece in high heels, you could be fined.
Thats because officials dont want history sullied by your sweet Kurt Geigers.
5. Chewing gum in Singapore
The ban came into force in 2004 as a result of huge maintenance fees the government was dishing out to repair pavements and buildings.
Importing or selling gum comes with a fine in the hundreds of pounds.
6. Eating, drinking or smoking during Ramadan in Dubai
None of this. The Foreign Office regularly warns Dubai holidaymakers not to eat, drink or smoke in a way that disrespects the Ramadan holiday.
Failing to do so could result in jail time.
7. Thailand stepping on currency

You wouldnt step on the Queens face, would you?
8. Feeding pigeons in Venice

200 years ago Napoleon was defeated at the battle of Waterloo.
This was seen as a pinnacle moment in the downfall of a tyrant andone of the proudest hours of the British Army (which is probably why we named one of Londons biggest stations after it).
Like any epic battle that took the lives of thousands of men, it will almost certainly look better in Lego, which is why Reuters have created this video to commemorate its 200 year anniversary.

A teenager who had his arm bitten off by a shark has described the moment he escaped death.
Hunter Treschl, and his cousin were swimming just off the beach at Oak Island, North Carolina, when he felt something bump into his left leg.
The 16-year-old thought it was a big fish, so he moved away, but the shark then bit his left arm off above the elbow.
In an interview released by the hospital where he is being treated, New Hanover Regional Medical Centre, Hunter said his cousin helped him to make it back onto the beach before others came running to help.

Hunter said: I didnt see it coming. I was in waist-deep water and I felt something hit my left leg.
Then it just hit my arm. I saw it was biting up my left arm. I got it off eventually, I dont know if it swam away, but I was able to move.
He added: I got out of the water with the help of my cousin.
Despite losing his dominant hand during Sundays attack, Hunter said he is going to try to live a normal life.
In a separate attack on the same beach just 90 minutes before, 12-year-old girl Liersten Yow also lost an arm and seriously injured a leg after being bitten by a shark

But for the foreseeable future, people have to be extra vigilant.

On Tuesday it was reported that all the animals were either dead or re-captured.
Zoo spokeswoman Mziya Sharashidze said eight lions, all seven of the zoos tigers and at least two of its three jaguars were killed. Only two of the zoos 14 bears survived, while nine of its 17 penguins died, she said.
Ivane Daraseliya, chief veterinarian for the zoo, said staff on Tuesday found the carcasses of three lions, a tiger and two wolves. Most of the animals appeared to have been killed when water and mud inundated their enclosures.
However, a young white lion named Shumba, one of the zoos most beloved attractions, was found shot in the head on zoo territory on Sunday.
The flooding also killed hundreds of homeless dogs at a private shelter near the zoo, shelter staff said.

Certainly Leahs father was aware for many an hour that his daughter was on the ride, he told the BBC. The only comfort, if thats the right way to put it, was that it wasnt clear early on the full extent of the injuries.
The lawyer believes compensation for the victims could run in to million of pounds.

These are the faces of the six students killed when a balcony collapsed at a 21st birthday party in the US.
Oliva Burke, 21, Eoghan Culligan, 21, Niccolai Schuster, 21, Lorcan Miller, 21, Eimear Walsh, 21, and AmericanAshley Donohoe, 22, died in the early hours of Tuesday.
Emergency services were called to Berkeley in California at around 1am.
Structural engineer Grace Kang said the fourth-floor balcony may have been overloaded if, as city authorities have said, it was holding 13 people.
She said: They were packed like sardines, and then they were moving, she said, adding that movement further exacerbates the strain.
The families of the six are expected in the university town of Berkeley, California, today.

It is truly terrible to have such a serious and sad incident take place at the beginning of a summer of adventure and opportunity for so many young people on J-1 visas in the U.S.

The building is owned by BlackRock, the largest asset-management fund in the US, according to city officials, and managed by Greystar Management, whose website says it operates more than 400,000 units in the U.S. and abroad.
In a statement, Greystar extended condolences to the victims families and added: The safety of our residents is our highest priority and we will be working with an independent structural engineer and local authorities to determine the cause of the accident.

Then, on the fourth try, she yanks it free and gasps at its size.

Earwax is necessary to protect the lining of the ear, but too much can lead to problems.

If youve booked a flight to the United Arab Emirates, you might want to bear this in mind.
A newly-passed law in the country reportedly states that anyone caught swearing online could face a fine of Dh250,000 (43,500) and be deported.
In fact, the Federal Supreme Court overturned two convictions of a man fined Dh3,000 (522) for swearing at someone at WhatsApp on the grounds that it was too lenient, and did not conform to the new legislation, Emirates 247 reports.
Under the new legislation, natives canface jail time if they do not pay the fine and holidaymakers or expatriates living in the countrymaybe deported, reports suggest.
FSC supported the prosecutors appeal and affirmed the need for the enforcement of the law governing information technology crimes involving a Dh250,000 fine and deportation from the country,Emarat Al Youm daily said.

Everest was shifted 3cm (Picture: AP Photo/Jody Kurash)
The Nepal earthquake was so powerful that it changed the direction of Mount Everest, a geological survey has revealed.
Because the worlds largest mountain sits on the border of China and Nepal, and therefore straddles the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, it is always moving in some way.
But according to research by the Chinese governments National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation, the scale of the earthquake that hit Nepal in April was so large that Everest moved 1.2in (3cm) in a different direction to the one in which in which was moving before.

The mountain has been constantly moving to the northeast, and the earthquake made it bounce a little bit in the opposite direction, Xu Xiwei, deputy head of the Institute of Geology at the China Earthquake Administration in Beijing told China Daily.
The 7.8-magnitude quake killed nearly 9,000 people anddevastated parts of Nepal, India, China and Bangladesh when it hit in April this year.
The tremor triggered an avalanche on Everest which killed 18 people and damaged climbing routes. Authorities called a halt to the 2015 climbing season as a result.

Legalising weed did not trigger an increase in teenage smoking (Picture: Getty Images)
Legalising medical marijuana doesnt lead to more teenagers smoking it, a study has found.
Critics have long said that the legalisation of weed, even if only for medicinal purposes, leads to a more relaxed attitude towards the drug amongteenagers, which in turns leads to increased usage and eventually, harder drugs.
But a government-funded US study found no increase in teenage smoking in states that had legalised cannabis and even saw a decrease among certain age groups.

Researchers even saw a decrease in smoking in some age groups (Picture: Getty Images)
Our findings provide the strongest evidence to date that marijuana use by teenagers does not increase after a state legalizes medical marijuana, said lead author Deborah Hasin, of Columbia University in New York.
Researchpublished in the medical journal Lancet Psychiatry and presented at a medical conference in Phoenix, Arizona,showed that weed usage among more than 1million students in 48 states had not significantly increased.
Among 13- and 14-year-olds usage had dropped, something researcherssay may be because young people no longer see weedas recreational.
They also suggest that some parents are working harder to stop their children smoking weed because they know it is more readily available.

For anyone unfamiliar with the series, it is set in a post-nuclear war USA in a society where bottle caps are used as currency.
One eager (and sassy) fan has apparently blurredthe lines between fantasy and reality and is trying to buy the game using bottle caps.
The gamer, known only as Seth, posted an image of the estimated 2,240 bottle caps he is hoping to use to purchase the game and a letter to developers Bethesda to Imgur.
Seth said he has been saving bottle caps since I played Fallout 3 for the first time seven years ago.

A civil rights activist accused of pretending to be African-American has defended herself againstcritics, claiming she identifies as black.
Rachel Dolezal resigned from her role as President of the Spokane branch of theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) following allegations  including from her own parents  that she was pretending to be African-American.
But Ms. Dolezal defended herself against accusations of dishonesty and blackfacing on the Today show, telling host Matt Lauer that she identifies as black.
I did feel at some point I would need to address the complexity of my identity, she said.

Ms. Dolezals parents said previously that their daughter began to alter her appearance after adopting four African-American children, The Huffington Post reports.
Ms. Dolezal says, however, that she has identified as black since she was five.

Happy #Bloomsday to you!
Not sure what we mean?
Well, its a day to celebrate the life and work of Irish writer James Joyce, whos probably best known for writing Ulysses.
The book tells the story of a day in the life of protagonist Leopold Bloom as he walks through Dublin and a whole load of strange events happen.
But it all happens onJune 16 1904which also happens to be the date that James Joyce first cemented his relationship with wife Nora Barnacle.
The iconic novel, which began being serialised in 1918, has been previously described as a flow of consciousness  which seems like a totally appropriate description for the books often rambling and unpredictable structure.
But despite this, its still hugely popular, and people are going all out to celebrate it.

Ms. Heller says food wastage is morally unacceptable (Picture: CEN)
Its one of those phrases you hear all the time as a child.
Eat your food  there are children starving in Africa.
Its a simple and effective way of teachingyoung people to takeonly the food that they need, and to appreciate that they are lucky to have it.
But apparentlythe guests at one Swiss hotel were never told this, andthe managerhas seen fit to put notices on tablesin the restaurant featuring graphic images of malnourished children.
It might seem an extreme measure, butBrigitte Heller, who is the manager of the four-star Monopol Hotel in Lucerne, said the quantitiesof food taken from the restaurant buffet by guests and then left uneaten forced her hand.
The notice, which is written in both English and Chinese, reads: The malnourished children die and in Switzerland people waste food and throw it away.
This is in Switzerland ethically and morally unacceptable.

The Monopol Hotels measure has proved divisive (Picture: CEN)
The notice features fivegraphic images of emaciated African children, one of which has a caption reading: The vulture waits until the malnourished child dies.
How would you react?
Unsurprisingly, its been a divisive measure.
A great initiative, Mark Natusch told local newspaper Blick.
When Im in Lucerne I will stay at the Monopol. You have to support such an action.
One commentator, by contrast, criticised Ms. Heller for apparently blaming Chinese guests for the food waste.
Franz Tschigung said: The hotel director is unfairly accusing the Chinese. Why doesnt she serve food that Asians can eat?
In China you can get international food in every small hotel. This should also be possible in Lucerne as well.

If these maps are anything to go by, our planet is going to be really hot by the end of the century.
Scientists at Nasa ran simulations usingmore than 11 terabytes of data in an attempt to accurately predictthe world climate, including greenhouse gas concentration, temperature and rainfall, in July 2100.
Londoners may findaverage daily temperatures of 25C bearable (or even quite nice) but for those living in South America, Africa or the Indian subcontinent its a different story.

Those areas will likely experience45C every day (the current average is a little less than 39C), and Los Angeles and New Yorkmay seesimilar temperatures as well.
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will have reached 935 parts per million, Nasa predicts, which represents around 0.1 percent of the atmosphere. At the moment, carbon dioxide constitutes around 0.04 percent, or 400 parts per million.
Nasa believes this data will help scientists understand what challenges the planet is likely to face and better plan for the future.

Theres something suspiciously ratty about this KFC.
Devorise Dixon had to double-take after unwrapping his deep-fried chicken inWilmington, California.
He uploaded photos and a video to Facebook with the description: As I bit into it I noticed that it was very hard and rubbery which made me look at it. As I looked down at it I noticed that it was was in a shape of a rat with a tail.
It sent deep chills throughout my whole body! Ive been feeling weird ever since. Its time for a lawyer, be safe dont eat fast food!

But KFC stressed there is no evidence to suggest it was a rat.
A KFC spokesperson said: This happened in the US and, following an immediate investigation, no evidence was found to support this claim.
Food safety is our highest priority worldwide and we take allegations of this nature extremely seriously.

Some people are just so darn funny its unreal.
Like this complete goofball for example, who posted an unconventional advert on Gumtree looking for a time machine traveling companion. Oh, the mirth!
The user, fromExminster, Devon, needs someone to join him/her on theiradventures through the spacetime continuum.
Being forced to listening to their amazing jokes along the way is in the fine print.
The advert
Hi
For the past few months I have been working on a design for a time machine in my garage. So far I have been able to make mice disappear but I dont know if they are going back or forward in time?
Im looking for a time travel partner, male or female who is open minded with a good sense of humour to accompany me on my first human transportation.
Owner drivers would be a plus as the machine needs to be taken to a wide open space like a beach to prevent property damage. Happy to split fuel costs :-)
Looking forward to hearing from you soon
Thanks

Five Irish students have died in the US after a balcony collapsed during a 21st birthday party.
Eight others are serious injured after the fourth-floor balcony gave way in Kittredge Street, Berkeley, California, at around 1am, according to local reports.
Dublins Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said: It is with great sadness that I confirm that a number of young Irish citizens have lost their lives, while a number of others have been seriously injured following the collapse of a balcony in Berkeley, California, earlier today.
My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of the deceased and those who have been injured in this appalling accident.

My department in Dublin stands ready to provide all possible consular assistance to the Irish citizens affected by this tragedy.
It is reported the balcony fell on to a footpath from the top of a four-storey building shortly after midnight local time.
Berkeley Fire Department and city officials are on the scene, which has been sealed off.
At least four people have beentaken to the Sutter Alta Bates Summit Medical Centre.
Five have died and either others are seriously injured (Picture: Corbis)
Jennifer Coats, a spokeswoman with the Berkeley Police Department, told local media that many of the injured have critical, life-threatening wounds.

A man has died after ordering a glass of wine in a cafe and instead being given dishwasher detergent which he proceeded to drink.
Andreas Lorente ordered a glass of wine on Sunday afternoon, however he was served the colourless industrial cleaner which was in an empty wine bottle left in the fridge by one of the staff in the cafe.
Upon drinking the odourless detergent Mr Lorente suffered sever burns to his throat and stomach, and was rushed to hospital in Vinaros, Spain.
Sadly he died before he could be airlifted to a specialist centre nearby.
Police are now investigating the incident and have arrested the cafe owner on suspicion of manslaughter and have released him on bail.
He is due to appear before a judge today for further questioning.
The Mirror have reported a source close to the investigation saying: Everything at the moment is pointing towards a tragedy caused by negligence rather than ill-intent.
The source added that Mr Lorente only took a small sip of the liquid.

Alexander McDonald, 27, appeared at Exeter Crown Court and admitted manslaughter (Picture: Police handout)
A man raped and killedhis mother while high on cocaine after downing four bottles ofalcohol at a wine-tasting event, a court heard.
Alex McDonald, 27, ofNorton Fitzwarren in Somerset, denied murder but admittedmanslaughter at Exeter Crown Court on Monday.
The court heard how he used three or four different weapons on his 57-year-old motherCatherinewho died from stab wounds and strangulation.
McDonald, a restaurant worker,got drunk during a wine tasting sessionat work and then snorted cocaine before returning to his mothershome near Taunton late one night lastSeptember.
The jury heard he exchanged some sexualised texts during the smallhours of the morning and prosecutor Simon Laws QC said only childMcDonald was in a state of sexual excitement.
Mr Lawssaid the victim, who worked as a carer for elderly people,wore ear plugs in bed to help her sleep  but she was still wearingthem when her body was found.
He said: The evidence suggests she was attacked while she was in bedasleep. It was a surprise attack. She stood no chance against her 27-year-old son who is well over six feet tall.
He used at least three and in all probability four weapons againsther. Catherine McDonald died as a result of being stabbed andstrangled.

Mr Laws told the court McDonald had used knitting needles to stab her inthe neck and one was still in place, and a pathologist said she wasstill alive when this happened.
There were scratches and bruises on her face, body, arms, legs andneck as she struggled for survival in the attack.
Mr Laws said on her neck there were also small cuts which had beencaused by a pair of nail scissors used to poke and prod her neck.
He told the jury McDonald used the scissors to force her to submitto a sexual assault and Mr Laws said he raped her.

A condom was found and DNA was discovered on the victim. He said afterwards he fetched a knife from the kitchen to stab hismother and strangle her with the cable.
The court was told McDonald tried briefly to clear up the scenebefore he fled in his mothers Smart car taking his passport andemptying her purse.
But he later crashed the car, flipping it over near Tiverton,Devon, and he was later arrested by police who then went onto discover his mother had been murdered.
At one point he texted an ex girlfriend to say that he would eitherbe dead soon or in jail.
Mr Laws said: He knew perfectly well what he had done.
He said virtually nothing in police interviews and officers said heappeared quite nonchalant.
When he was told about the rape of his mother, he said that was abit of a shock to him.
McDonald denies murder and his trial continues.

Davina Tavener died from heart problems (Picture: Facebook)
A mum-of-two died on a Ryanair flight to Lanzarote after she suffered heart problems and there was no medical equipment on board to revive her.
Davina Tavener, 47, collapsed in the planes toilets 20 minutes before the flight landed  but fellow passengers were left shocked when they discovered there was no life-saving apparatus on board.
And while paramedics rushed on board when the plane landed, Davina failed to regain consciousness and was pronounced dead.
Now, a coroner at the inquest into her death has urged airline bosses to ensure that medical equipment is placed on-board all flights.
If you are trapped in an aircraft without access to any other facilities that authority needs to consider the equipment to be carried on these aircraft whether short haul or long haul, Coroner Alan Walsh said.
Davina Tavener was described as a very intelligent and successful lady (Picture: Facebook)
It is difficult to know if any equipment would have assisted because she was in the toilet 5 to 10 minutes prior so we do not know how long she was unresponsive.
And while Ryanair were found to be compliant with all regulations, Mr Walsh said he would write to the Civil Aviation Authority, European Aviation Safety Agency, and Irish Aviation Authority asking them to consider making the equipment compulsory.
Another man charged with historic paedophile offences at posh private school
He added: I do not believe there is any difference between short haul and long haul flight. It takes a second for someone to have a cardiac event and it will not choose if it is 10 minutes or 10 hours into a flight.
They can happen at any time. For her to get on an aircraft and to go on holiday with her husband, it is unimaginable what happened on the journey.
The inquest heard that Mrs Tavener worked for HSBC, and was a very intelligent and successful lady who had been travelling around India, China and Hong Kong only a month before her death.
The incident occurred when Mrs Tavener and husband Andrew flew to Lanzarote for a week.
Pathologist Dr Emile Salmo was unable to establish the cause of Mrs Taveners death, but said: I think it is necessary to have basic life support equipment and probably a defibrillator which are very simple these days  portable and friendly.
In a statement to Metro.co.uk, Ryanair said: While we dont comment on legal matters, Ryanairmeets all regulatory requirements in terms of medical assistance provided on its flights andis not legally required to carry defibrillators on board.
All our crews are trained in first aid and are responsible for the safety and security of the cabin. Should an incident occur in flight which requires medical intervention, our crew divert to the nearest suitable airport and request medical assistance to be on standby before landing. We offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved.

What having Aspergers is like': Moment dog stops owner self harming as she has violentbreakdown
Amy Willis for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 16 Jun 2015 10:52 am
Warning: Content some may find distressing
A young woman with Aspergers syndrome has released footage of herself suffering a violent breakdown to raise awareness of the condition.
Danielle Jacobs, who published the video on YouTube, is seen crying and self-harming in the clip before her dog jumps up to stop her.
She hits herself several times in the head and on the chest while her dog Samson uses his paws to tryto calm her down.
Danielle is seen hitting herself in the footage (Picture: Youtube)
Eventually Danielle drops to the floor and Samson curls up next to her and licks her face.
Danielle said: This is whats considered a meltdown.Yes, Samson is alerting. I trained him to alert to depressive episodes [or] self-harm [but] not both, but [still] he alerted.
Samson is then seen using his paws to stop her (Picture: Youtube)
She added: It appears the response is late, but its actually supposed to be, because as Im coming out of the meltdown I tend to have a panic attack after.
Danielle, from Arizona, uploaded the video in the hope it will help people understand the struggles people suffering from the autism spectrum disorder go through.
She specifically asked people to refrain from posting negative comments about her self-harming.
She wrote: This is what having Aspergers is like.Please no negative comments this really happened and its not easy to open myself and share what its like on a daily basis.

The second-in-command of Al Qaeda has been killed by a U.S drone strike, the terrorist group has confirmed.
Nasir al-Wuhaysi, who was described as the designated successor of leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, is thought to have been killed by strike in southern Yemen on Friday.
Former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel claimed that al-Wuhaysi was responsible for running Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which he described as the most effective part of al-Qaeda.
AQAP claimed responsibility for Januarys Charlie Hebdo attacks earlier this year, and U.S. officials have confirmed that the strike aimed to directly target the group.
Confirming al-Wuhaysis death in a video statement, senior member Khaled Batarfi said: We in al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula mourn to our Muslim nation that Abu Baseer Nasser bin Abdul Karim al-Wuhayshi, God rest his soul, passed away in an American strike which targeted him along with two of his mujahideen brothers, may God rest their souls.

A $10 million dollar reward had previously been offered by the US government for anyone who could bring al-Wuhaysi to justice.
The US State Department said he was responsible for approving targets, recruiting new members, allocating resources to training and attack planning, and tasking others to carry out attacks.

But its not time to change our diet just yet, warn scientists (Picture: Getty)
Yes. Just, yes.
Eating more than two chocolate bars a day has been linked to alower the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Research led by the University of Aberdeen found that compared to people who ate no chocolate, those with a higher intake had an 11 per cent lesser risk of cardiovascular disease and a 25 per cent reduced risk of associated death.
It was also linked with a nine per cent lower risk of hospital admission or death as a result of coronary heart disease, while it was similarly associated with a 23 per cent reduced risk of stroke, even after taking account of other factors.
The perfect amount of chocolate to eat is up to 100g, the research suggests. The average Cadbury bar is around 45g.
But its not time to change our diet to pure Cadbury just yet, warn scientists.
MORE: 90s chocolates ranked from worst to best
The study, which came from analysis of almost 21,000 adults taking part in the EPIC-Norfolk study, which is tracking the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women in Norfolk, concluded that there is no evidence for cutting out chocolate to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Around one in five participants said they did not eat any chocolate but among those that did, daily consumption averaged 7g (0.25oz) with some eating up to 100g.
MORE: You can now buy chocolate hummus (like Nutella, but healthier)
Those who ate the most also tended to be younger, have a lower weight, waist to hip ratio, and blood pressure, and were less likely to have diabetes and more likely to carry out regular physical activity  all of which add up to a favourable cardiovascular disease risk profile, researchers said.
Eating more chocolate was also associated with higher energy intake and a diet containing more fat and carbohydrates and less protein and alcohol.
The study authors pointed out that dark chocolate is usually said to have more beneficial effects than milk chocolate, but milk chocolate was more frequently eaten by the Norfolk participants.
Professor Phyo Myint, of the School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry at the University of Aberdeen, said: Our study concludes that cumulative evidence suggests higher chocolate intake is associated with a lower risk of future cardiovascular events.
The study is published online in the journal Heart.
Why we shouldn't get too excited
Dr Tim Chico, reader in cardiovascular medicine and consultant cardiologist at the University of Sheffield, said: This study adds to the evidence that people who consume chocolate tend to have lower rates of cardiovascular disease, although such studies cannot say whether the chocolate is the cause of this protective effect.
There is evidence from other studies that have randomised people to be given chocolate that this can have effects that might reduce cardiovascular disease, such as a reduction in blood pressure. These studies taken together suggest that there might be some health benefits from eating chocolate. However, it is also clear that chocolate has the potential to increase weight, which is unequivocally bad for cardiovascular health.
The message I take from this study is that if you are a healthy weight, then eating chocolate (in moderation) does not detectibly increase risk of heart disease and may even have some benefit.
I would not advise my patients to increase their chocolate intake based on this research, particularly if they are overweight.

This isCalbuco volcano in Chile. Until April it had not erupted since 1972. The eruption came as a surprise to scientists, but thankfullyTimestorm Films was on hand to capture the entire thing over a beautifully hypnotic time-lapse.
The HD footage shows clouds of ash billowing into the orange sky.
Filmmaker Martin Heck saidhe and his crew had been visiting a neighbouring volcano and were heading south when Calbuco blew its top.
They quickly set up camp and this is the amazing result:

So what was in that mystery bag winched over a prison wall during live FOX News TVcoverage?
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 16 Jun 2015 8:08 am
Theworld isobsessed with a mystery package that was winched over a prison wall on live TV.
FOX News reporter Molly Line was covering the story about the two prisoners whoescaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York when the bizarre scene unfolded.
In the background, a man is seen walking over to the prison wall with a package. Suddenly, its winched up the wall and disappears. The man leaves promptly.
Obviously, speculation was rife at the time.
But it turns out that was a legitimate delivery. It was confirmed by theGreta Van Susteren show after journalists did some digging.
However, a question mark still hangs over what was inside the box.

More than 800 police officers continue their search for Richard Matt and David Sweat as the manhunt enters its tenth day.
Local schools have re-opened but the main road leading to the community remains closed.
The murders made the headlines after they used power tools to dig through several barriers and tunnel more than one mile away from the prison.

First there was Weaselpecker . Now meet Gatorcoon. 
When thisamateur photographerwent walking through Ocala National Forest in Florida, he came across something quite odd.
Richard Jones, who was out in the forest with his family, spotted a raccoon riding on the back of an alligator.
Mr Jones said he believed the raccoon had leapt aboard the alligator after being startled by his son taking a picture of the reptile.
He said he snapped a lucky picture right when the gator slipped into the water and before the raccoon jumped off and scurried away.
Without the context youd think the raccoon was hitching a ride across the river.

Guinea pig is a delicacy in parts of Latin America (Picture: Getty Images)
A man was discovered roasting a guinea pig over a flame in a New York park on Saturday and police saidit was perfectly legal.
Cops were called to Brooklyns Prospect Park followinga call by a concerned resident who thought someone was torturing a squirrel.
But arriving police instead found a man having an early morning snack of roasted guinea pig, which is a delicacy in his native Ecuador and other parts of Latin America.
You might have expected police to intervene (given that in New York a guinea pig is more commonly thought of as a pet rather than breakfast) but officers were happy to letthe man to go back to his meal.
He wasnt holding an animal down and torturing it, a police source told the New York Daily News .
If he wants to feed on guinea pig thats his prerogative.

It might look like a thinly drawn line on a black background, but it is actually something far more impressive.
It shows the International Space Station (ISS) and it was taken by an eagle-eyed passenger on a Southwest flight from New York to Chicago.
It wasnt easy for Trevor Mahlmann though.

The wannabe astronaut had to find out what time the station would be viewable from his plane (it was 10pm) and then use his GoPro camera to take 30 second exposures over ten minutes.
Once he had the images he merged 12 of them mid-air and with the help of Adobe LightRoom software was able to publish the final picture.
And it was so impressive Nasa tweeted it out from its ISS account.

The 2.5-mile-wide zone separates North and South Korea
Leaving North Korea is not easy.
You can flee to China or Russia, but you willalmost certainlybe deported if discovered by the authorities; you can try and obtain a student visa to somewhere like Pakistan and thenattempt to escape from there; you canbrave the waters and try and finda boat to take youto mainland Japan or, most dangerously, you canattempt to cross the heavily-guarded demilitarised zone and get to South Korea.
Thats what one teenage soldier managed to do today, braving a2.5-mile-wide zone of electrical fences topped with barbed wire, minefields and guard poststo get toHwacheon in South Korea.

It is not clear how exactly he managed to get through, but a South Korean spokesman said there was no violence.
It did not trigger an exchange of fire between the two sides, he told the New York Times .
Upon his arrival,the teenager told South Korean officials that he decided to defect because of the widespread beatings and abuse he saw within the North Korean military.
He has become the first North Korean serviceman to defect to the South in three years. In2011, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un tightened border controls, almost halving the number of refugees entering South Korea in that year.

Cab drivers really dont get paid enough to put up with this.
A passenger who launched a sickening Hannibal Lecter style attack on one by repeatedly biting his face has been jailed.
A video showed drunken Colin Riley, 44, locking his jaws around terrified Paul Tostevin and then trying to bite off his earduring a ride in Weighbridge, Jersey.

The shocking assault was caught on the cabbies own CCTV and showed Riley launching himself at Mr Tostevin after verbally abusing him.
He was caught ten daysafter the incident on December 12.
Mr Tostevin, 55, was left covered in injuries and suffering from depression, but has bravely spoken out after his attacker was jailed for 12 months at Jerseys Royal Court.
I honestly believe that if I hadnt managed to get him away I would have part of my ear missing now, he said.
He was growling and grinding his teeth  he was like Hannibal Lecter.

Laquanda Newby, 25, was charged with leaving a child in a hot car at the Henrico County Courthouse in Virginiaafter she went to hand herself in to police.
But she is now facing three counts of contributing to the delinquency or abuse of a child after police reportedly discovered her two children sat in her hot car outside the courthouse.

Police initially found Newby outside her car  and the child inside it  on 26 May, but could not arrest her because they had not witnessed the alleged crime.
Officers swore out a warrant if Newby promised to turn herself in later. But when she did so, she left both her children  aged six and one  inside the hot car, police said, with surveillance footage showing they were there for over an hour.
No windows were open and temperatures were at least 32C, officers said.
The children are now in the custody of their father.

        <MainBody>Nicholas Reilly for Metro.co.uk Monday 15 Jun 2015 3:17 pm
Rented tuxedos. Theyre a firm staple of high school proms and weddings, even if the wearer is often left looking like a walking, talking penguin.
But it seems that the combination of a dicky bow, a dinner jacket, and a ruffled shirt might have had its day after a leading clothes rental firm said that business had been down 2.8 percent in the last quarter.
It isnt for sartorial reasons, but because people arent getting hitched  the U.S marriage rate is at its lowest level for a century.
Douglas Ewert, the chief executive of Mens Wearhouse, said: There are indicators that the overall wedding business is slowly shrinking due to shifting cultural attitudes toward traditional weddings.
MORE: Final four announced for Labour leadership battle
However, price is also believed to be a factor too, with the price gap between renting and buying a tuxedo rapidly shrinking.
And a move away from traditional weddings also plays a part, with hosts opting for a more casual union, a world away from the high-end fashions of tuxedos.
Ewert added: We believe this is a function of a movement toward more casual and destination weddings.

A man who accidentally entered the wrong poker tournament ended up going home with the top prize of 52,000.
Christian Pham, from St Paul, Minnesota, thought he had registered for the $1,500 (966) Texas Hold Em game at the World Series of Poker tournament in Las Vegas, only to sit down and be given the wrong number of cards.
Mr Pham suddenly realised he had accidentally entered the no-limit deuce-seven lowball  a game he had neither played before nor heard of.
But that didnt stop him from going home with the top prize  $81,314 (52,345).
When I got to the table, and I got dealt five cards, I realised something was wrong,he said.

I said, Oh my god! because in Minnesota they dont have this game.
This was the first time I played it, but I tried to learn the game from the people at the table.
Mr Pham told PokerNews.com that he had to fold hisfirst seven hands and have the rules explained by the person sittingnext to him.
But, after calling a huge bluff, he took in 100,000 chips and became chip leader.
In the future for sure I will register for this game. I love it now, he said.

The house boat was raided earlier this year (Picture: Cascade)
Police seized a bag of icing sugar that was going to be used in a banoffee pie.
Richard Nicholson isdemanding compensation from Essex Police for the cost of the door to his houseboat, that wassmashed in the drugs raid.
Mr Nicholson, owner of the barge Blacksmith at King Edwards Quay, Colchester, said: When the police came and I was not there they smashed the door which cost 850 to replace.
I think you need more than a couple of malicious phone calls to do something like this.
They found a bag with decanted icing sugar because my girlfriend wanted to make a banoffee pie so had brought some and put it in the kitchen cupboard.
Essex Police defended its decision to raid the boat.
A spokesman said: Police executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act after acting on intelligence received.No illegal substances were found.
We can confirm Essex Police has received a claim for a replacement door.
While it is unfortunate the door was damaged, Essex Police may not be held responsible in such circumstances for damage caused as officers carried out the entry and search of the property under a legally obtained warrant issued by the magistrates court.
The raid took place in the morning of Thursday March 5 this year.

Michael gave up his job, flat and car to volunteer with orphans in Asia (Picture: Cascade News)
A British man volunteering in south east Asia has been killed by mosquito bites.
David Murray, originally from Lancashire, gave up his job as a lorry driver and sold his BMW to venture overseas to help orphans in Laos.
The 39-year-old went into shock after mosquito bites on his legs became infected.
He died of typhus, a disease caused by Rickettsia bacteria and dengue fever, on June 7, a blood test revealed.
David  fondly known as Muzz to his mates  was three months into a year-long voluntary role when he was rushed to hospital at the Sae Lao Project in Nathong, Laos.
His father, Michael Murray, said: He was really dedicated. He was giving something back in life. He was a saint to the people in Laos.
He was very quiet and did not brag about things, but all this time he has been doing this good work.
His mother Rita added: We spoke to him on Skype four days before he died. He was so happy. He found something good in life, thats our only comfort.
Its thought that Michaels body will be flown back to the UK via Manchester Airport this Wednesday (June 17) and a coroners investigation is likely to be launched.

Talha Asmal from Yorkshire is Britains youngest suicide bomber
The family of a teenager believed to be Britains youngest suicide bomber said they have been left utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy of his death.
Talha Asmal, 17, who reportedly detonated a vehicle fitted with explosives while fighting for Isis in Iraq, has been described as a loving, kind, caring and affable teenager.
But in a statement, his family said those who sent himto his death had preyed on his innocence and vulnerability.
The teenager fled his home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in March to allegedly join Isis along with his friend Hassan Munshi, who was also 17.
They said despite him never exhibiting any extreme or radical views, he had been exploited by extremists on the internet.
Unbeknown to them and completely against their will, they said he travelled to Iraq via Turkey and fell under the spell of Isis handlers.
The family said: We are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us.
The 17-year-old has been described as loving and caring (Picture: PA)
We need time and understanding to come to terms with our unimaginable and painful loss. As a family we would like to take this opportunity to unequivocally state that Isis are not Islam.
They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like Isis to hijack our faith.Isis  not and never in our name.
West Yorkshire Police said they were unable to confirm the identity of the person who had died but were continuing to support families who have loved ones that are believed to have travelled to Iraq and Syria.
MORE: Islamic State fighters execute at least 400 people  mostly women and children
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster said people who travel to Syria and parts of Iraq are likely to witness extreme violence and could become victims of violence themselves.
He said: As part of the Prevent initiative West Yorkshire Police is committed to working with communities and local authorities, to highlight the dangers associated with radicalisation and travel to regions such as Syria and Iraq.
We are all working together to help identify vulnerable members of our society and intervene and engage them before it is too late.
If anyone has concerns that a friend or relative may be vulnerable to radicalisation, expressing extreme views or contemplating travelling to Syria or Iraq, it is vital that we work together to try and prevent that person from travelling.

Two teenagers have suffered serious injuries after they were badly mauled in separate shark attacks.
One victim, believed to bea12-year-old girl, had her arm amputatedand could lose her leg following the attack off Oak Island, North Carolina, US, on Sunday.
Beach-goers rushed to her aid after hearing screams from the water.
She was flownto a hospital in Wilmington where her arm was removed at the elbow.

He suffered serious injuries to an arm, which could be lost, according to the mayor, Betty Wallace.
Video footage from local TV stations shows a boogie board with large chunks taken out of it.
Town officials are meeting todayto decide whether to officially close the beach to the public.
Mayor Betty Wallacesaid: I dont want everybody to think this is one of those areas where you really have to worry about shark bites.But for the foreseeable future, people have to be extra vigilant.

A woman has been jailed for failing to return a video she rented in 2005.
Kayla Michelle Finley, of South Carolina, US, had VHS tape Monster-In-Law sitting in her home for a decade.
She rented theJennifer Lopez movie from Dalton Videos  now out of business.
Finley, 27, was at a police station on another matter when officers unearthed an arrest warrant for her, CNN reports .
The stores owner had even contacted the police in a bid to get her to return it.
She was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of failure to return the videoand spent a night in jail because her hearing could not be held until the following day.
CNN quote Finley as saying: Im no criminal, but Pickens County Sheriffs office sure made me feel like I was.

If youre running to become president of the United States, its pretty important to deliver a campaign thats filled with authority, power and conviction.
But try telling that to Jeb Bush, after the Republican hopeful unveiled this logo for his campaign  complete with a weirdly placed exclamation mark.
It certainly doesnt look like the hallmark of a man whos trying to get into the Oval Office, but instead comes across like some kind of short-lived domestic sitcom from the 1980s.
Apparently, hes used the logo for all his political activities since 1994, but that doesnt make it any less shouty and overly familiar.

JEB! it screams at you, while being burned into your cerebral cortex.
Twitter had a few ideas about what it resembled, too.

Hes got a point yknow
The important thing about the Jeb logo isnt the exclamation point that is there. Its the last name that isnt there.

But if the whole presidential thing doesnt work out, it looks like a career as a masseuse awaits
