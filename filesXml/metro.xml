A naked man found himself on top of a 100-foot tall drawbridge this weekend in Fort Lauderdale.
For those of you not familiar with American geography, thats in Florida, where its quite hot.
It isnt unsurprising, therefore, thatwhen police finally got to the man, he was looking a bit rouge.

Once youre up there, I would imagine you realize that you dont want to be up there anymore, said afire department official.
Theres no place to go. Theres no way to climb down.
Bizarrely, the man didnt plan to go up the drawbridge. He just happened to be strolling across the bridge naked  as you do  at a really bad time.
The naked man was taken to hospital to be treated for burns to the buttocks, reports WPLG Local 10 News .

This could be useful ammunition next time youre asking your boss for a day working from home.
Workers who spend more than 20 minutes commuting to work are at risk of burnout, according to University of Montreal researchers.
Burnout is a result of chronic stress, which leaves sufferers cynical, exhausted and emotionally wrecked  and the longer your commute, the more you are at risk, the researchers say.
The study of 1,942 people found that commuting stresses workers out  even before they arrive at work.
Lead researcher Annie Barreck says, A correlation exists between commuting stress factors and the likelihood of suffering from burnout.
Managing employee commuting flexibly would increase employee efficiency  and employers have everything to gain from facilitating the mental health of their employees.

The Smart Floating Farm is the brainchild of Javier Ponce and Jakup Dycha (Picture: Caters)
The first designsof offshore floating farms have been released and their creators believe they could be the solution to the growing food demand as the worldpopulation rises.
It is estimated that by 2050 the global population will hit 9.1billion, which willin turn create an increase in the demand for food by around 70 percent.
To prevent a potential food scarcity crisis, futurists, artists and engineers have proposed various solutions fromvertical city farms to precision agriculture and genetically-modified crops.
MORE: This is what London will look like in the near future, experts say
A bold set of designs showsanother solution: floating farms.
Architect Javier Ponce and Jakup Dycha, who created the Smart Floating Farm (SFF) concept, are proposing the use of buoyant offshorerigs to farm, which have the advantage over their vertical city equivalentin that they take up no land space and can harvest fish as well as crops.
These farms would would be built or moved toplacesmost in need of food, and would have a three-tier design, with the bottom level responsible for fishing and storage, the second level responsiblefor crops and the third level holdingsolar panels to power the rig.

Facing the current challenges of cities growing, land consumption and climate change, I believe projects like the Smart Floating Farms can help change some of the existing practices, Mr. Ponce said.
These practices have led us to the present situation and open new possibilities which can improve the quality of human life and the environment.
Based on a floating multi-layered strategy, which combines aquaculture (fish), hydroponics (crops) and photovoltaics (solar power), we aim that these floating farms can be located close to areas where food is more needed and potentially become automated farm clusters run by the use of software.

A baby born with 12 fingers and 12 toes has left doctors baffled  but his Mum says, I quite like the extra fingers.
There were no signs that there was anything wrong with seven-month-old Jacob Duffy before he was born in November last year.
But mum Rachael Hendry, 24, and dad John Duffy, 28, found that baby Jacob had four extra digits  and an undiagnosed complex syndrome which has left him with a number of defects, including a hole in the heart and eye conditions.
Rachael said: We joked around a bit at first and said that at least he will be good on the piano but obviously we quickly realised that things were a bit more serious.
I quite like the extra fingers and I dont really want the surgeons to chop them off but kids are quite cruel and I could hardly send him to school with them.
Doctors aim to operate after he is 12 months old  and hisparents are now trying to raise cash for a sensory room to aid his development.
The pair have already raised1,000 in just six weeks of campaigning with proceeds also going towards the Hawthorn Family Support Centre in Leeds where Jacob visits every week.
Rachael said: Hes doing really well now and the focus is on how he develops like any other baby.
Doctors are keeping a keen eye on him and were waiting on test results to see exactly what condition he has.
He has so many defects that it cant just be coincidence.
You can donate to help Jacob buy his sensory room here .

MPs being sworn into the House of Commons have been given the option of taking a gender-neutral title.
The title Mx was coined in the 1970s by those who identified as both genders or neither and who felt that the current choice of Mr., Mrs., Miss orMs. did not accommodate them.
Now for the first time, MPs swearing their loyalty to the Queen upon entering the House of Commons will be able to tell Parliament chiefs they would like to be know as Mx in what represents a huge step forward for transgender rights.
This is great news, political campaigner Peter Tatchell told The Sun .

Itsends a positive signal to transgender people that they and their identities are welcome in Parliament.
The news follows the adoption of the title  which is likely tobe added to the next edition of the Oxford Dictionary  by government departments, businesses and others.
The Sun quotes a veteran MP as saying that Speaker John Bercow ordered the change as part of his campaign for increased equality in the Commons.

Considering that hes been in power for five years now, it seems only right that David Camerons waxwork receives an update that reflects the demands of being Prime Minister.
And thats exactly whats happened at Madame Tussauds, with the refreshed figure of the Prime Minister now featuring a few grey hairs and facial lines.
Compared to the youthfulness of the previous figure, the new mannequin  decked out in a dark blue Paul Smith suit  appears more matured.
But staff at the popular tourist attraction stressed that all of their exhibits are updated to display the ravishes of time.
We often update our figures to reflect changes over time, PR manager Nicole Fenner told the Telegraph.

Weve done the same with George Clooney and Brad Pitt in recent years.
The Prime Minister is one of our most photographed wax figures, so as soon as news of his re-election broke we began work to make sure the figure more closely reflected the man as he is now  a head of state with five years of leadership behind him.

Adult film producers are concerned the new regulations will force them out of state or underground (Picture: REX Shutterstock)
We dont know if theres such a thing as goggles porn, but if there isnt, there mightbe soon.
New state proposals in California would have all porn actors and actresses wear protective eye gear during shoots (pun intended, and we apologise) as part of an attempt to reduce the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases within the industry.
The 21-page draft calls for condoms and other barriers  including the eye gear  to be used in all sex scenes. It also requires producers to pay for medical visits and hepatitis B vaccines for adult film performers, the Los Angeles Daily News reports.

Diane Duke of the Free Speech coalition called the regulations unworkable (Picture: REX Shutterstock)
These are regulations designed for medical settings, and are unworkable on an adult film set  or even a Hollywood film set, said Diane Duke, the CEO of the Free Speech coalition.
There are concerns within the industry that excessive regulation willdamage business andforce directors and producers underground or out of state.
The proposals follow a letter sent by Michael Weinstein of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation to the state agency which complained that poor enforcement and vague wording was allowing adult film producers to circumvent currentrules requiring actors to wear condoms.

Children have become adept at conversing through the use of emojis,often usingthem a playful and concise way to express themselves.
This is why a Swedishcharitycalled BRIS have come up with the app Abused Emojis.
Rather than the usual cheerful faces and humorous icons, BRIS have created a set of emojis which show sad or abused children.
Normally, emojis are happy and joyful. But if youve been hurt, mistreated or feel sad, theres no emojis to represent those feelings, a BRIS spokesperson said.
MORE: Emoji is the fastest growing language in the UK
The emojis can convey that a child is experiencing physical abuse, that their parents drink, that they feel alone, or even that they have been experiencing dark thoughts.
The app was created following the news that 19,100 cases of assault against children and youth in Sweden were reported last year.
It is hoped these emojis will help children who might struggle to find the right words express themselves.

Some birds are too fat to fly, others are simplytoo lazy.
This redwinged blackbird is the latter.
It was spotted catching a ride on the back of an eagle flying over Sterling, Illinois, by wildlife photographer Dave J. Tackett.
I was drifting down river looking to get photos of an eagles nest coming up when I saw the eagle take off from a tree along the river near its nest and two redwinged blackbirds were flying with it, harassing it Mr. Tackett said.
Just before the eagle landed on a tree the blackbird took off, flew around in front and above the eagle and dived down and passed the eagle within a short distance.
I didnt know one was riding on top until I got home and looked at the full size photos.

Erections, sweat and fear: Here are some of the weird and horrible things spider bites can do toyou
Oliver Wheaton for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 26 May 2015 6:04 pm
Not surprising we all fear them really, is it (Picture: Getty)
Are you scared of spiders?
Well, yeah, of course you are, because youre normal ( and new research suggests that it actually means youre highly evolved ).
People often pull out of the factthat of the many thousands of different spider species only about a dozen have the ability to kill a human, but that doesnt stop them from being a truly terrifying creature.
Let stoke the flames of this common phobia by running down some of the nastiest thingsspiders can do to you.
TheBrazilian wandering spider can kill you (and give you a massive erection)
Please do not use it as a form of viagra(Picture:Alamy)
While the Brazilian wandering spider is often considered to be the most venomous spider in the world, many stores in its native habitat of tropical South America stock anti-venon and deaths from being bitten are rare.
However a bite from one of the little fiends can also cause men to experience painful erections that can last for several hours.
Before you make the standard lurid joke, be aware that this can also lead to victims of the spiders becoming impotent.
Sweat it out
Hold it carefully! (Picture:WEST/AFP/Getty Images)
The Australian widow spiders bite effects the nervous system by blocking signals to the rest of the body.
When the nervous system cannot contact the muscles they contract repeatedly, causing the victim to start sweat profusely.
Some victims of the Australian widow are reportedly found sitting in puddles of sweat when paramedics arrive at the scene.
Repeat prescriptions
Fear me! (Picture:BROKER/REX_Shutterstock)
As we said theBrazilian wandering spider is the most venomous spider in the world, but that doesnt make it the most dangerous.
That accolade goes to the notoriously aggressiveSydney Funnel-web spider, which is known to attack anything or anyone who threatens it.
The little warrior also uses his legs to latch onto the victim, delivering repeated bites to ensure the venom has been delivered.
Oh, andits fangs can penetrate shoe leather.
Ouch.
Dangerous aim
Guess why its called a Redback spider? (Picture:Ian Waldie/Getty Images)
The Redback spider, native to Australia, is known for its venomous bite which can be fatal if the victim is either very old or very young.
There is an effective anti-venom (which is handy becauseup to 10,000 people are bitten by them a year), however its attack method is truly terrifying.
A large number of people are bitten on the genitalia, which only serves to increase pain levels.
Luckily the number of recorded bites in this area is reducing due to less people relieving themselves outside.
Yet another reason to praise indoor plumbing.

A test track for Elon Musks 745mphHyperloop train is to be built in central California, it has been announced.
Mr. Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, first proposed a system whereby passengers travel in pods through low-pressure tubes at high speed in 2013.
Unable to find the time to invest in the project, engineers crowd-funded their own research and the idea became Hyperloop, a low-cost, energy-efficient method of transport that could take users from Los Angeles to San Francisco  a distance of 382 miles  in just half an hour.

The train can theoretically travel at 4,000mph, engineers say (Picture: YouTube/SpaceX)
Now Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. has struck a deal with landowners in central California to build the worlds first test track for the train at a reported cost of $100million (64,900,000).
The 8km track will not be long enough for the Hyerploop to reach top speed, but, as ScienceAlert notes, its a crucial first step for atechnology which could revolutionise the way we travel.
On a 160km track, the train could hit 745mph. Engineers have told Wired , however, that the train has the potential to reach 4,040mph. That could take you from New York to China in two hours.

If successful in trials, the technology could change the way we travel (Picture: YouTube/SpaceX)
There is a lot that can go wrong, however, as retired physicist and co-inventor of the superconducting magnetic levitation concept James Powell told LiveScience .
The whole system is vulnerable to a single-point failure, he said.
The guideway [track] has to be built to very fine tolerances, because if the position of the wall deviates from straightness by a few thousandths of an inch, you could crash.

Left-handed people never tire of telling the rest of us that it isnt a myth  and left-handed people really ARE more creative.
Whether that makes up for the drawbacks of being left-handed, suchas getting ink on your hand, is open to question.
But a scientist has lent weight to the whole creativity thing this week, in a talk at the Hay festival.
DrHannah Critchlow said there is now some evidence that left-handers really are more creative.
Stimulating the brains right hemisphere (more active in lefties) seems to energisecreative thinking, Dr Critchlow said.
Dr Critchlow says you can even buy electrode caps which stimulate the area.

When Jiang Ming was eight years old, he accidentally boardeda train andwas separated from his family.
After four days of wandering aimlessly around Sichuan, south-west China, which was at the end of the train line, he was found starving and scared by a local family and adopted.
He had a new home and a new name, but he never forgot his family back in Ziyang County and promised himself that he would one day track them down.
Now 37 years old, the moment where he reunites with his mother Lin has been captured and the pain and joy on the face of the woman who thought shed never see her son again is clear to see.

Most boyfriends would react pretty angrily upon discovering that their other half has been playing away  and would furiouslydemand to know who theyve been seeing.
But one boyfriend opted for a calmer, more measured approach by connedhis girlfriends new lover into buying him a Chinese takeaway.
Posing as his girlfriend, he saved her newman on his phone as f**kboi#3, before pretending that she was in dire need of Chinese food.
I want delivery to my house u gonna order it or nah, he wrote.
Giving the demands as to exactly what he wanted, he added: Can I get a shrimp panzit orange chicken and a lemonade please??
AND IT WORKED.

MDMA is prized by clubbers for its love drug effects  and now researchers believe those same effects could help people with autism.
A pioneering study is to investigate whether the stimulant could help autistic people overcome social anxiety.
A preliminary survey found that 72% of users said the drug made them more comfortable in social settings,  and 12% reported that this effect persisted for more than a year after taking it.
The researchers at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute believe that MDMA could help autistic people where other drugs have failed.
Previous studies have shown that MDMA can have positive effects in patients suffering post-traumatic stress disorder.

There are at least seven current studies investigating the drugs use for beneficial purposes  including a study researching its impact on terminal patients with just a few months left to live.
The researchers write, Conventional anti-anxiety medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), MAOIs, and benzodiazepines, lack substantial clinical effectiveness in autistic adults.

His attempt started early on Monday. Organisers placed a number of queen bees on his body to attract the workers. Boxes of bees were then dumped on his feet in increasingly large quantities until he was almost completely covered.
He was stung over 2,000 times and his body temperature rose to over 60C (normal body temperature is around 37C), but he survived the ordeal and set a new record, smashing the previous oneof 85.5kg.

It was supposed to be a fun day out for all the family.
Instead, parents and children were greeted with long queues, filthy toilets and shoddy look-alikes.
Dozens of parents in south Wales complained following Margam Country Parks Bank Holiday Superhero Family Fun Day, with one calling it the worst trip weve ever had.
The special event was organised so children could meet their favourite characters fromSpiderman and the Hulk toAnna, Elsa and Olaf from Disneys Frozen.
Parents are now demanding their money back, however.

To be honest, it was the worst trip weve ever had, said 26-year-old John-Paul Gillies, who went with a large family group that included daughter Annabelle, six, and son William, two.
It was shambolic, none of the staff seemed to have any idea what they were supposed to be doing.
My mother had to wait half an hour to use the only disabled toilet in the place. While we had to keep going back to the car to change my niece. It was disgusting.
We only saw three characters  Elsa, Anna and Wonder Woman, who was an absolute state.
Emily Ward, who is eight months pregnant, told MailOnline that she was forced to relieve herself in some bushes after she was pushed out of the queue to the toilets.
I desperately needed the toilet and had to wait in line, even when I got to the front people were so desperate to get in they pushed me back out of the door, she said.

A spokesman for Neath Port Talbot Council, who run Margam Park, said the staff werent prepared for the volume of people.
Whilst we anticipated a good attendance for the superheroes event and had planned in advance for a busy day the numbers who attended was unprecedented for the park.
The previous highest bank holiday attendance was on Easter Monday 2015 when 5,500 people visited the park. Yesterday saw approximately 13,000 visitors.
As with all events we review the day to see what can be learnt.
Yesterdays event did not go as we would have wished and wed like to apologise to those visitors who did not have a good experience.

The rabbit was killed using a bicycle pump (Picture: Radio24syv)
A Danish radio station has defended itself after a baby rabbit was killed live on air.
Radio24syv saidit used a bicycle pump to kill the rabbit because it wanted to highlight cruelty in the farming industry.
The broadcaster said radio host Asger Juhl, who ate it,struckAllan with repeated blows to the head to highlight hypocrisy in Danes attitudes towards animal welfare.
We buy and eat animals that have had an awful life. And animals that have been killed under the same controlled conditions as the rabbit in the studio, the stationwrote in a statement.

Reality TV show star and animal rights activist Linse Kessler tried to grab the animal and chased Juhl around the studio several times before being asked to leave.
This video does not show the killing of the rabbit.

They wanted to see if they could kill him during the last show or if they had gotten too attached to him, she said in a video clip on her Facebook page.
Kessler said she thought she was capable of wresting the animal from Juhl but feared it would die a more painful death if she grabbed it.
Animal rights activist Linse Kessler, who was a guest of the station, later condemned it in a video on her Facebook page (Picture: Linse Kessler/Facebook)
I hit it hard over the neck twice so that the cervical vertebrae fractured, Juhl told broadcaster TV 2.
I was instructed by a zookeeper from Aalborg Zoo who hits several baby rabbits every week (to feed) the snakes, he added.
Juhl said he had brought the dead rabbit with him home  where he had skinned and cut it up with his children, aged six and eight  and that he later would have rabbit stew for dinner with fellow morning host Kristoffer Eriksen.
And heres the stew:

MORE: O2 urged to sort it out after nationwide signal outages
Copenhagen zoo prompted international outrage last year by putting down a healthy giraffe, known as Marius, and then dissecting it in front of children.
That incident, just like the radio stations stunt, drew a mixed response in Denmark where agriculture is a key export industry.
To provoke and to promote itself, Twitter user Steffen Andersen in Aarhus wrote, while journalist Brian Esbensen tweeted: What if people were just as outraged over drowned refugees.
Radio24syv said it wanted to put more focus on one of the worlds most industrialised agriculture sectors.
Danish farming allows 25,000 piglets to die every day because farming has been streamlined and (breeds) pigs that give birth to far more offspring than the mother pig can handle, it said.
This is the fullaudio clip of the Danish-language radio segment (WARNING: Contains killing of the rabbit)

If ever there was proof that sports cars only exist for the purpose of showing off, then this might just be it.
Thats because the owner of this Chevrolet Corvette crashed his car only 24 hours after purchasing it from a showroom.
Explaining the incident to CarThrottle, the man filming the crash explained: It was his first time using it, it controlled the torque completely through first gear at wide open throttle.
(Picture:Fenix_LOTB/YouTube)
After shifting to second (expecting the torque management to continue working) it was unrestricted power to the wheels and just came as a surprise, which is why there wasnt really a reaction to it.
But the driver would probably be pleased to hear that the damage was completely repairable, albeit at a wallet-burning cost of $20,000.

Mobile phone network O2 has been urged to sort it out by Business Secretary Sajid Javid, after customers were hit by a signal outage on Monday evening.
O2 users reported disruptions to services in London, Leeds and Nottingham, which lasted for several hours.
The reports were even investigated as far afield as Cardiff and Newcastle, while Glasgow and Belfast became the only cities that seemingly werent affected by the disruption.
Many users even took to Twitter to voice their frustrations.
What the hell is going on with 02 signal? Am I the only one that has no signal just wifi. #signal #02 #02signal

Anyone else on 02 and have no signal or service?! Whats going orrrnn! 
 Bonnie (@Bonniieeee) May 25, 2015
But while O2 has since insisted that their service returned to normal on Monday night, the networks online status checker still reported delays in London and Newcastle earlier this afternoon.
Speaking to Metro.co.uk, a spokesperson for 02 said: Yesterday evening some customers experienced an intermittent problem accessing our network and we apologise for the inconvenience caused to those customers who were affected. We restored service at 23.35.
The problem was caused by some network equipment that was temporarily unable to correctly process mobile phone traffic for some of our customers.
We have now isolated the problem to prevent this from happening again.

Just as we all suspected  people who post endless running personal bests on Facebook are a bit sick in the head.
A Brunel University study found that people who brag constantly about fitness and dietstend to benarcissists.
Narcissism is a psychological problem where people gain pleasure from admiring themselves.
On Facebook, this translates into endless, needy posts about how fast people run.
Sadly, there is no cure, although you can just ignore them.
The researchers surveyed 555 Facebook users  and found that exercise bores often get the attention they crave, with people frequently Liking their posts and responding to them.
The researchers wrote, Narcissists also wrote more status updates about their diet and exercise routine, suggesting that they use Facebook to broadcast the effort they put into their physical appearance.
MORE: Your annoying Facebook friend who brags actually has low self-esteem
Psychology lecturer Dr Tara Marshall, from Brunel University London, said: Although our results suggest that narcissists bragging pays off because they receive more likes and comments to their status updates, it could be that their Facebook friends politely offer support while secretly disliking such egotistical displays.
Greater awareness of how ones status updates might be perceived by friends could help people to avoid topics that annoy more than they entertain.

Creative internet users have designed a series of anti-logos in protest against the allegedabuse of workers in Qatar.
FIFA was heavily criticised for deciding that the2022 World Cupwill be held in Qatar, a countrythat has a red-hot climate and lacks the infrastructure to host such a large event.
But far worse criticism was to follow.
More than 900 workers have died in theconstruction projects for the competition, and some have estimated this figure to be rise to at least 4,000 by the time the buildings are finished.
Furthermore, the country has faced allegations of condemning migrant workers to slavery through the Kafalasystem, which lets workers in-country sponsors  usually their employers  confiscate their passports upon entry to the country and then make it difficult for them to leave.
Creative detractors have taken to sharing anti-logos of major of sponsors of the World Cup in a bid to encourage them to withdraw their backing.

Benefit payments are supposed to be used as a safety net for the most vulnerable, not as a fund for cosmetic surgery.
With finances so tight, benefits must only go to those who really need them.

There is a toilet, a shower, a mini-kitchen, a bed, a table and even some storage space. The walls are well-insulated and theres a connector so you can charge your electric car while you tow the capsule.
For now, if youd like to see it up close, youll have to head to Vienna, where it will be on display at the Pioneers Festival. It will be available to the wider public later in the year, although there has, as yet, been no mention of the price. (We imagine it wont be cheap.)

Sir Cliff Richard is reportedly trying to sell his apartmentwhich was raided by the police last year.
His friend Cilla Black reportedly told MailOnline the veteran entertainer never wants to live there again following the raid which drew criticismas a BBC crew was on hand to film the police activity.
Sir Cliff, 74, who was in a different property in Barbados while the raid on the Berkshire apartmentwas taking place, has strongly denied any wrongdoing and has not been arrested or charged.
Black told the paper: Cliff told me hes just put the flat on the market. Its the saddest thing for him, but he had to do it.

The propertyis estimated to be worth 3million.

In February, South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable David Crompton revealed the investigation into Sir Cliff, 74, had increased significantly in size and involves more than one allegation.
Sir Cliff said the claims against him were absurd and untrue and he had never, in my life, assaulted anyone.

The risk of accidental incest has never been greater after a surge in the number of kids born from sperm and egg donation.
A Cambridge professor believes previous research into families has not taken into account half-siblings in sexual relationships.
Susan Golombok, who has spent years studying the modern family, said a large amount of donor-conceptions happen in the same area.
She told the Hay Festival that many donor-conception children end up going to the same schools or living in the same town.

The Telegraph quoted her assaying: That is a big worry, that children might enter into sexual relationships with their half siblings and not be aware of it.
And various calculations have been made about how likely or unlikely it is, and most of these say its not really likely to happen.
But they dont take into account that these children often live in a community and are the same age and may even go to the same schools and so on.
I dont know what the actual chances are, but its probably higher than people think.

A taxi driver got his last wish  to drive his cab one last time, at his funeral.
Mourners climbed into the back seat of the cab to pay their respects, withVictor Perez Cardonas body sitting in the front seat, hands attached to the wheel.
Puerto Rican taxi driver Victor Perez Cardonas specifically requested the unusual funeral as he was dying of cancer.
Puerto Rico has developed a tradition of odd wakes, including a young man mourned seated on his motorcycle, a boxer standing in the ring and an 80-year-old woman sitting in her favorite rocking chair and wearing her old wedding gown.

A former MP has made a damning statement on the state of British politics, claiming the House of Commons would become empty if all lying MPs had to quit.
Sir Malcolm Bruce, the former deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, made his comments in response to accusation levied at Alistair Carmichael, the only Lib Dem MP in Scotland.
Alistair Carmichael is facing a grilling after he allegedly leaked a confidential document during the election campaign that could have harmed SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon.
He is also accused of lying to the public about the extent of his knowledge of the leak.
During an interview with BBC Radio 4, Sir Malcolm saidmany people in Parliamenthave told lies and you know perfectly well that to be true.

He added: If you are suggesting every MP who has never quite told the truth or even told a brazen lie, including cabinet ministers, including prime ministers, we would clear out the House of Commons very fast, I would suggest.
While many people expressed their outrage over his comments on Twitter, others got a bit philosophical on us.
But was Malcolm Bruce telling the truth?

How are your teeth looking today? Yellow with brown bits and a thick coating of gunge?
If so, youre a pretty normal Brit, according to TV doctor Dr Chris van Tulleken.
Dr van Tulleken said that British people have become internationally renowned for having really lousy teeth.
He said, In the UK were OK with brown, foul teeth, it doesnt really bother us, while in America its very socially unacceptable.
And that means we tolerate much higher levels of decay.
Dr van Tulleken suggested that we should all stop eating sweeties and brush our teeth more.

Because while it might not be able to take control, this dog became a real easy rider as its owner strapped the animal onto the back of a classic motorbike.
And as the owner speeds along the highway, the dog seems fully aware of how cool they look  sitting upwards with its paws together.

If you ever needed undeniable proof that cats believe themselves to be the dominant species on the planet  this is it.
Obviously this cat is far too important to make way for the peasant humans leaving this building, so he is forcing them to step over and around him.
However on closer inspection we realised this was not simply an act of outrageous laziness.
If you watch the video you will see how the cat would probably be happier if he moved two feet into the light so he could sunbathe.

Death could soon be a thing of the past  with old people hooked up to computers to download their brains into ultra-powerful machines, where they can live on forever.
Cambridge neuroscientist Hannah Critchlow believes that we are not far off creating a computer powerful enough to host a human mind.
All it requires is a computer powerful enough to simulate the trillions of connections inside a human mind  something which todays machines cant do.
Dr Critchlow, speaking at the Hay literary festival, said, If you had a computer that could make those 100 trillion circuit connections then that circuit is what makes us us, and so, yes, it would be possible.
People could probably live inside a machine. Potentially, I think it is definitely a possibility.

Gingerol can stop cancer cells from growing (Picture: Getty Images)
Ginger helps fight ovarian cancer, a new study has found.
The research, by BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine , revealed the food tricks cancer cells into killing themselves.
The natural dietary component gingerol has been shown to shrink tumors by 56 per cent.
It works by blocking the cancer cells from growing and  ultimately  spreading.
The paper concludes: Ginger inhibits growth and modulates secretion of angiogenic factors in ovarian cancer cells.
The use of dietary agents such as ginger may have potential in the treatment and prevention of ovarian cancer.
It gives credence to previous studies that ginger extract has the ability to fight cancer.
In 2012 a study published bythe British Journal of Nutrition suggested the food had a natural positive impact on fighting prostate cancer cells in men.

Nail or cocktail stick? (Picture: Ross Parry)
Laura Barrow thought she had bitten down on someone elses fingernail when she was enjoying a Nandos.
But in fact it was a piece of wood from a cocktail stick that was put in her food.
When she thought it was a nail, Lauren said: It was horrible, it was all yellow from the sauce and it looked like it had been bitten off.
I was absolutely disgusted. Not surprisingly, it really put me off my food.
Nandos have since written to Lauren claiming the fingernail was in fact a cocktail-stick shaving.
A Nandos spokesman said: We make every effort to ensure that our food is served to the highest standard.

Unfortunately, in this case it appears a small shaving from one of the cocktail sticks we use for the flags to show spice level was found in another part of the customers dish.
The meal has since been re-imbursed and Nandos gaveLauren two meal vouchers, but she doesnt want to go back for a while.
She said: I will go back eventually just not anytime soon, it was disgusting. Were on a break, weve broken up for a while.
I am not the sort of person to complain really but I felt like I had to with this.

Is your spidey sense tingling?(Picture: PA)
Even the toughest people in the world will sometimes squeal in fear at the sight of a spider or any sort of creepy-crawly.
However being made to flinch at the sight of an unwelcome animal might be a sign that you are healthy.
Rather than being over-sensitive, jumping when you see a creepy-crawly is the result of a behavioural immune system mechanism which warns us of nearby threats so we can flinch away before they harm us.
Now the brainy folks at British Columbia University think this can impact many other aspects of our lives and behaviours.
Unlike the regular immune system which uses cells to guard us against infection and disease, thebehavioural immune system is different because it only uses a small amount of hormones.

When you come across something that could make you ill if you eat it, like some rotting food, you are repulsed by the smell, thus saving yourself from a pretty nasty tummy ache.
The same applies tospiders and other potentially dangerous creatures  we are scared of them because our bodies have evolved to instinctively fear them.
Dr Val Curtis, a hygiene specialist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told MailOnline : Disgust is a fundamental part of human nature  it is the voice of our ancestors.
Research suggests there is a universal set of things that disgust people. They include body wastes, body contents, sick or unhygienic people, dirty environments, certain foods  especially if unfamiliar or spoiled  and certain animals, such as rats and cockroaches.
So next time someone mocks you for being scared of spiders or rats, just smugly inform them how you are simply a highly evolved being.

Feminist icon Germaine Greer has accused Sir Elton John and husband David Furnish of deconstructing the concept of motherhood.
Speaking at the Hay Literary Festival, Greer appeared to criticise the fact that Furnish is listed on the birth certificates of the couples two young children  who were both born to a surrogate.
Sometimes I think that really the problem is the concept of motherhood, which we cant give any real structure to, she said.
Sir Elton John and his wife David Furnish have entered on the birth certificate of their two sons that David Furnish is the mother. Im sorry. That will give you an idea of how the concept of motherhood has emptied out. Its gone, its been deconstructed.
The 76-year-old also seemed to criticise IVF treatment.
We now have a genetic mother who supplies eggs, she added.
It depends entirely on where she is if she is going to be allowed to know what happens to the eggs. And women tend to care.
Elton John and David Furnish have been criticised by Germaine Greer (Picture: Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images for Starkey Hearing)
An egg is not a sperm, we do not produce 400million of them in one go. One miserable little egg pops every month.
She continued: In some places you are allowed to know what happens to them, in other places you are not. What you get is a reduced bill for IVF because a child is being born by the people involved using your eggs.
Im sorry. Did we talk about this? Did we sit down and talk about what eggs mean to women?
Although Sir Elton hasnt responded to Greers comments, he previously reacted with fury earlier this year, when Dolce and Gabbana spoke of their opposition to gay adoptions.

Policehave started a murder investigation after Patty King and Karen Williams claimed that his aides had poisoned him.
He died, aged 89, on May 14 in Las Vegas, where he lived while he kept up a gruelling schedule of tours that ended only last year.
His daughters have alleged that business manager Laverne Toney was behind his death, according to Eonline.
Identical affidavits filed by them say: I believe my father was poisoned and that he was administrated foreign substances to induce his premature death.
(I) request a formal investigation into this matter.

An attorney for Kings estate also dismissed the daughters accusations as ridiculous.
I hope they have a factual basis that they can demonstrate for their defamatory and libellous allegations, Brent Bryson said in a statement, according to the entertainment site.
Earlier the local coroner confirmed the homicide investigation and said that Kings remains would undergo an autopsy.

The last supper: Jeffrey (R white shirt) is pictured with his loved ones just hours before he killed himself (Picture: WARREN SMITH 2015)
Assisted suicide is illegal in the UK.
So every year, a number of Brits living with terminal or particularly distressing health issues make the decision to end their life in the Swiss clinic Dignitas.
Butanyone caught helping themabroad could face up to 14 years in prison here.
Earlier this month54-year-old Jeffrey Spector killed himself after he was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour wrapped around his spine.
He faced being paralysed from the neck down at any moment.
Jeffrey and his wife Elaine (Picture: WARREN SMITH)
The successful businessman died surrounded by his wife and children who fully supported his decision.
His death is likely to reignite debate other whether or not assisted suicide should be legal in Britain.
Assisted Dying Bill
A move to allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose for the terminally ill was put before parliament last year.
However, it ran out before officials had the change to debate it.
But Lord Falconer has vowed to re-introduce the bill in the new parliament.
Mr Spectors case was a particularly interesting one because  unlike most Dignitas goers  he was not terminal. He said he feared being a quadriplegic more than death.
Critics believe legalisation could pave the way for countless people to unnecessarily end their lives when treatment is the better option.
Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, said: The vast majority of people with cancer or quadriplegia  which was a risk but not a present reality for this man  do not wish to kill themselves but want support and care to go on living as comfortably as possible.

Any change in the law to allow assisted suicide in Britain will inevitably place pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives so as not to be a financial or emotional burden.
Meanwhile supporters say the decision to be yours and yours alone.
Mickey Charouneau, a spokesman for Dignity in Dying, said:It cannot be right that we force people to suffer against their wishes, or take drastic and desperate measures behind closed doors.
The only way to give dying people choice and control at the end of life, while also protecting vulnerable people, is through an assisted dying law with upfront safeguards.

Its an offer Mr President surely cant refuse.
A Kenyan lawyer has allegedly put 70 sheep, 50 cows and 30 goats on the table to marry Obamas daughter.
Felix Kiprono isnt leaving anything to chance, and has declared his love for Malia as real.
Speaking to The Nairobian , he said: I got interested in her in 2008 [Editors note: When she was 10]. As a matter of fact, I havent dated anyone since and promise to be faithful to her.

I have shared this with my family and they are willing to help me raise the bride price.
People might say I am after the familys money, which is not the case. My love is real.
I am currently drafting a letter to Obama asking him to please have Malia accompany him for this trip. I hope the embassy will pass the letter to him. I will hand it over to the US Ambassador with whom we have interacted several times.

Dramatic footage has emerged showing the moment a pilot was forced to make an emergency landing during a flyover for the70th anniversary of VE Day.
The pilot was flying over the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, US, when he thought a fire had broken out in the cockpit.
It was in fact leaking hydraulic fluid which turned into vapour, giving the appearance of smoke.
He made the decision to abort the celebratory flyover and land on a nearby runway.
The edge-of-your-seat cockpit video was uploaded to YouTube by the pilot.
The pilot said the incident was a poignant reminder of lives lost (Picture: YouTube)
He wrote: The biggest lesson was how the leak presented itself in a vapor form. It moved and acted like smoke, combined with fluid heat on the legs of my passenger, it was mistaken for fire.
This event, especially on this day, gave a somber reminder to all those who didnt have a runway conveniently aligned.
To those who were hundreds of miles away from the nearest carrier, in enemy waters. To those who made the ultimate sacrifice. We remember.

Huge waste (Picture: Getty)
A councillor who successfullycampaigned to make French supermarkets give waste food away now wants the world to follow suit.
Arash Derambarsh successfully led to the passing of a law banning the destruction of out-of-date food.
Previouslybleach was put on waste food before throwing it away so that it cant be taken by homeless people or the poor.
M. Derambarshtold the Guardian : Food is the basis of life, it is an elementary factor in our existence.
I have been insulted and attacked and accused of being naive and idealistic, but I became a local councillor because I wanted to help people. Perhaps it is naive to be concerned about other human beings, but I know what it is like to be hungry.
MORE: Poll: do you think supermarkets should give unsold food to charity?
The French government is expected to pass the law todaywhen it comes before the national assembly.
Following Frances lead, a petition has now been set up in the UK to reduce the amount of usable food being thrown away.
The petition, set up by Lizzie Swarf, says: Rather than wasting millions of pounds worth of food that is still usable, make supermarkets donate their leftover products that are still safe to eat, to food banks.
Encourage existing customers to donate towards a delivery service to needy people in their area on the delivery run.

Great Orme is a precious archaeological site in North Wales (Picture: PA)
A stretch of coast which is rich in wildlife and archaeology has been bought by the National Trust for more than 1 million as it launches a new vision for looking after the nations coastlines.
The Trust has acquired land on Great Orme in north Wales, the latest acquisition in a 50-year Neptune Coastline Campaign to protect special seaside areas.
The acquisition includes the 140-acre (56 hectare) Parc Farm, with its views of Anglesey and the Welsh coast, and grazing rights to 720 acres of headland, allowing the Trust to help protect the habitats of unique and rare plants and animals.
Great Orme is also rich in archaeology and has the worlds biggest prehistoric mine, dating back 4,000 years to the Bronze Age, while the first-ever book in Wales was printed in one of its caves.
It also has the worlds biggest pre-historic mine (Picture: PA)
Justin Albert, director for the trust in Wales, said: The Great Orme is a very special place, loved by the millions of people that visit the classic seaside town of nearby Llandudno every year.
The coastline encapsulates the beating heart of what the National Trust is about  looking after places of natural beauty rich in wildlife.
That includes sub-species of silver-studded blue and grayling butterflies and a plant, the wild cotoneaster, which can only be found here.
The National Trust looks after 775 miles of coastline across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and is launching a new vision to protect the rich wildlife, culture and beauty of the coasts, allow greater access and create space for natural changes to occur.

India is trying to shake off its reputation as a dangerous place for women.
After several high profile rapes that have led to lynch mobs or horrific deaths, the countrys womens minister, Maneka Ghandi, said in an interview on Swedish TV network SVT: We have four rapes per 100,000 women, while Sweden has more than 130.
The most recent figures suggest that it is actually half that number  57per 100,000 in 2013 in Sweden and 2.7 in India  but Swedenis still among the highest in the world for reported offences.
So much so that in February this year, the Gatestone Institute described it as the Rape Capital of the West.
Internationally only Lesotho has a higher incidence of rape.
In 2012 a 23-year-old medical student died days after she was subjected to a horrific sex assault that led to protests.
Ghandi said that more women were now reporting sex assaults than before as a result, but acknowledged a lot are still not reported.

        <MainBody>Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 26 May 2015 7:43 am
We associate a large growl in our stomachs as a war cry for food  but it actually means your gut is cleaning itself.
Tummy rumbling comes at a time when we feel hungry, but it isnt a biological mechanism to remind us to eat.
Around an hour after we finish digesting our system undergoes a muscular contraction to sweep any remaining food from the stomach into our intestines, saysGuilia Enders, author of Germanys hit book Gut: The Inside Story Of Our Bodys Most Underrated Organ.
In her punchy guide to our body, the 25-year-old explains the gut cleaning takes place some time in between meals. Nutritional scientists recommend we leave a five hour gap from one meal to another.
Snacking will stop the cleaning process immediately (Picture: Getty)
Snacking at any time will stop the process.
Guilia also makes the interesting point that our stomach starts just below our left nipple and ends at the bottom of the ribcage  generally much higher than we think.
So when people complain of a stomach ache the pain is more than likely happening in our intestine.
The poo chart
Types 3 or 4 are considered healthy. Experiencing any other type on a regular basis is good grounds to consult your GP.
Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass).
Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy.
Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface.
Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft.
Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges, passed easily.
Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool.
Type 7: Entirely liquid.

Its quite simple. You put two pencils on top of one another in a cross with yes and no answers in opposing squares, summon a Mexican demon, and watch the top pencil move to give you an answer.
The magical chant is Charlie, Charlie, are you here?
Then, if s/he answers in the positive, Charlie the Mexican demon will answerwhatever question you askhim/her.
Heres a selection of the things people have been asking Charlie.

Science tells us its okay to go out on a school night and get a bit sloshed  but only if we get seven hours sleep.
Booze isnt to blame for low productivity at work, experts believe.
Instead, theyve linked it to a lack of sleep.
Researchers from Cambridge University and Rand Europe found that smoking and eating as much as we like wont have a negative impact on productivity either.
They monitored 21,000 UK workers who slept for either six hours or less a night and seven to eight hours.
The study found that those who had slept for longer were notably better performers in the office.
Not exercising is also a negative factor.
Employees with concerns of a financial nature were found to be less productive as well.
As well as poor work performance a lack of sleep has been linked to a number of health issues including diabetes.

Some women may have a genetic impulse to be unfaithful (Picture: Getty Images)
Its a common defence of men caught cheating that theyre wired to do so.
But if thisresearch is anything to go by, some women may also have a genetic impulse to be unfaithful.
In astudy published in Evolution and Human Behaviour , 7,400 sets of twins in Finland who were in long-term relationships and aged between 18 and 49 were looked at by researchers, who found nearly 10 percent of the male participants and 6.4 percent of the female participants had had at least one affair in the past year.
The researchers were interestedin the rate of cheating between non-identical twins (who dont share all their genes) and identical twins (who do) and found that 63 percent of the variation of infidelity in men and 40 percent in women could be down to genetics.

The male and female drives to cheat could be very different (Picture: Getty Images)
Isolating specific genes is more difficult because thousands of genes influence any behaviour and the effect of any individual gene is tiny, said Brendan Zietsch, a lead researcher at the University of Queensland, Australia.
But we did find tentative evidence for a specific gene influencing infidelity in women.
The so-called cheating gene is the vasopressin receptor gene, which is responsible for empathy and sexual bonding in animals. In men, this gene had no influence on promiscuity.
MORE: Wife beats up teacher in classroom over affair with her husband
Researchers conceded that the evidence is tentative (Picture: Getty Images)
In the New York Times , psychiatrist Richard A. Friedmanargues that the female drive to cheat may be down to simple pleasure-seeking.
While there is an evolutionary advantage to men cheating, he says, there is no obvious reason for women to be unfaithful, other than the search for novelty and sensation seeking.
There may be no clear evolutionary advantage to female infidelity, but sex has never just been about procreation, he said.
Cheating can be intensely pleasurable because, among other things, it involves novelty and a degree of sensation seeking, behaviours that activate the brains reward circuit which conveys not just a sense of pleasure but tells your brain this is an important experience worth remembering and repeating.

Tom Hoel regained his title (Picture: YouTube/Tom Hoel)
The former record holder for the longest plank has regained his title after losing it last October.
Two minutes of the plank, a bodyweight exercise that requires you to support your body on your elbows and toes and hold your body straight (just like a plank!), is normally enough for the average person to start losing their form, though people in good shape may be ableto hold the position for up to five minutes.
Try not to feel too demoralised, therefore, to hear that Danish fitness instructor Tom Hoel, 51, just held a plank for four hours and 28 minutes, setting a new world record and regaining his title after he lost it last October.
Mr Hoel beat his previous best time by around 80 minutes in Jaegerpris, Denmark, on Friday, but admitted he had a serious crisis for almost two hours.
Chinese SWAT officer Mao Weidong held the previous record (Picture: AP Photo)
I have never pushed myself that far, he told the Local.
I had a serious crisis for almost two hours.After mentally arguing with myself, I finally asked for the time at three hours and 41 minutes.
I thought that I was still under three hours and was ready to quit but when I realised I that had beat my former record and the goal was within sight, I mobilised every resource in my mind and body.
Mr Hoel said that he spent nine months preparing for the attempt, eating healthily, getting a lot of sleep and giving upalcohol.

Detectives hunting Jed Allen, who was being pursued after his young sister, mother and her partner were found stabbed to death at their home, have discovered his body in a wooded area in Oxford.
Armed police officers were scouring Didcot, Oxfordshire, and its surrounding areas, after the bodies of Philip Howard, 44, Janet Jordon, 48, and their daughter Derin, six, were discovered in a house in Vicarage Road just after 8.20pm on Saturday.
More than 100 officers were also searching Oxford University Parks where Allen worked as a groundsman.
Police also revealed they had found what they believe was the murder weapon at the crime scene.

A promising basketball player who was arrestedafter allegedly robbing a pizzeria has started eating the jail, swallowing screws, needles and even pieces of metal.
Lamont Cathey, 17, was detained in Cook County Jail in Chicago after he was arrested 16 months ago for an alleged robbery.
Since no-one has paid his $5,000 bail, Cathey has remained in the jail, and has recently taken to eating it, swallowing objects includingscrews, needles, thumbtacks, strips of leather and on one occasion parts of a medical device.

The damage he has done to his insides is so severe that he has been to hospital two dozen times, costing the jail more than $1million (647,000).
Hes literally eating the jail, the jails executive director, Cara Smith, told the Chicago Tribune .
This case to me is a perfect example of the failure of the criminal justice system Its been a crushingly sad and very frustrating case.

They might look like luminous baseballs, but these mysterious orbs are actually Japans secret weapon in the battle against shoplifters.
Theyre locally known as bohan yu kara boru and are meant to be flung at suspected thieves, covering them with orange paint and making it pretty obvious who they are so they can be tracked down quickly in a crowd.
The prospect of apublic shaming is probably quite a deterrent against stealing from anystore, too.
However,while they seem like a pretty effective idea they havent actually been used much since they were first developedeight or nine years ago.
Many reasons for this have been put forward by experts, includingafear of retribution from the shoplifter or the risk of labelling someone a thief to passers-by on the basis of a split-second suspicion.

Despite this one store manager, Kazuo Kimura, seemed convicted that the balls are an effective deterrent.
We have introduced coloured balls in all of our 8,500 stores, and we put signs on them so theres no mistake about what theyre there for, he said.
Yes, it may immediately strike you as a bonkers idea  but it might just work

Breasts are actually quite dangerous to your penis, surprisingly.
Dr Van Kirk says, Ive seen a few penile fractures, not just with the pelvic bone, but when guys are in the process of trying to give a pearl necklace

The Brazilian study found that penetration from behind was the second most dangerous position for penile breakages.
Youre also at risk of accidentally shoving your dong up your partners bum, Dr Van Kirk warns.
Ill often see from rear-entry positions guys going to penetrate the vagina and fairly often the penis will accidentally go into the anus,, says Dr Van Kirk.
And because there wasnt any preparation, there can be anal tears and things like that.

This is the most dangerous position to your wang.
Dr Van Kirk says, This issue is basically the womans pubic boneIts slightly differently positioned in each woman.
At times theres not enough lubrication when the woman goes to sit on the penis if theres enough force or friction or the penis catches on the pubic bone, thats when that bend will occur in that ligament. That is more common than people think.

This one (where the woman is backwards on top of the man, and often to be seen in Dutch art films), is even more dangerous to your wang, Dr Van Kirk says.

Historian David Starkey has taken aim at international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, reportedly telling her to shut up and accusing her of over-promoting human rights.
Mrs Clooney, a former special advisor to UN General Secretary Kofi Annan whocounts Julian Assange among her former clients, rose to international fame when she married Hollywood actor George in Venice last year.
But Dr David Starkey apparently doesnt have much time forthe 37-year-old.

The historian reportedly accused judges and lawyers such as Mrs Clooney of hijacking the European Convention on Human Rights and expanding it beyond what he believes is its intendedpurpose.
He also took aim at the director of human rights campaign group Liberty, apparently saying that he wished the Amal Clooneys and Shami Chakrabartis would shut up.

He added that he believes the balance between human rights and duty to society  which dates back 800 years to the Magna Carta  has been lost.
The comments by Dr Starkey, who recently published Magna Carta: The True Story Behind The Charter, come as debate continues over Prime Minister David Camerons plans to scrap the1998 Human Rights Act, which requires all UK law to take into account decisions made by the European Court of Human Rights.
However, UK courts are not bound by Strasbourg and the UK doesnot need to change law on based on judgments from the European Court.

A formerhairdresser accused of snipping herboyfriends willy with a pair of scissors walked free from court today after the victim was reluctant to give evidence.
Helen Smith, 48, who was accused of grabbing her mans member and cutting it with the household implements at her home in Cardenden, Fife, was found not guilty at Dunfermline Sheriff Court.
Her partner, Stuart Cooper, failed to attend.
The incident last August was said to have left Mr Cooper hurt, but the court heard howhe did not want the matter to proceed.
Depute fiscal, Azra Yousaff, made a Crown motion to adjourn the case due to the absence of Mr Cooper.
She said: The witness was cited in the usual postal fashion.He may be aware of todays trial.He is a reluctant witness.
But Yvonne McKenna, defending, opposed the motion, saying Mr Cooper did not want proceedings to go any further.

Ragweed triggers severe hay-fever (Picture: Getty)
Time to stock up on Kleenex hay-fever sufferers  and not to catch your sneezes  because this news will make you cry.
The allergy, also known as the dreaded sniffles and hellish puffy-eyes syndrome, could be made a lot worse by global warming.
Expertssayragweed pollen is to blame.
The weed is native to North American but has rapidly spread since the 1960s.
Its still rare in the UK but experts have warned pollen will be scattered across the country by 2050.
Pollen from the plant not only induces severe allergic reactions but also extends the hay-fever season from summer to autumn.

Last year, researchers from the University of Leicester recorded airborne ragweed pollen levels in the East Midlands high enough to cause significant hay-fever attacks.
The weed is a far more potent allergy trigger than grass and experts fear it could pose a serious public health problem if it becomes established.
Scientists writing in the journal Nature Climate Change found that predicted levels of global warming were likely to create conditions favourable to ragweed across large areas of northern Europe, including the UK.
They concluded: Climate change and ragweed seed dispersal in current and future suitable areas will increase airborne pollen concentrations, which may consequently heighten the incidence and prevalence of ragweed allergy.
MORE: 11 things only hay fever sufferers will understand
The researchers, led by Dr Lynda Hamaoui-Laguel, from the Laboratory of the Sciences of Climate and the Environment in Gif sur Yvette, France, ran computer simulations that forecast a four-fold increase in European ragweed pollen concentrations by 2050.
Substantial increases in pollen load were likely to occur in areas such as north-central Europe, northern France and southern England, where ragweed was rare today.
Depending on the speed of dispersal, pollen levels in some locations could rise as much as 12 times.

London is set to look a little different in the near future  with cows grazing on top of super-skyscrapers, bridges spanning miles, and basements stretching miles under the Houses of Parliament.
Huge 3D printers will spit out homes to order  with people able to design, then live inside their own creations.
A panel includingDr Rhys Morgan, Director of Engineering and Education at the Royal Academy of Engineering and lecturers at the University of Westminster came up with the ideas for a new series calledImpossible Engineering on TV channel Yesterday.
The experts predict that global warming and other threats to the environment will lead to the development of high rise farms and new living spaces in enormous basements beneath buildings.

Overcrowding could also lead to people living in floating habitats on rivers, the experts predict.
Dr Rhys Morgan said: Breakthroughs in engineering work in the same way as breakthroughs in literature, music and lifestyle  an accumulation of different discoveries or influences is required to create the final catalyst for a new discovery.
There is rarely a eureka moment.
The panels predictions are below.

Watch out! Its the invasion of the naked bikers!
Or in reality, this was the scene in Southsea, Hampshire, yesterday whenhordes of cyclists took part in the Portsmouth World Naked Bike Ride.
But there was a real valid reason behind the apparent madness, with the birthday suit wearing cyclists aiming to promote a safer environment for cyclists.
Speaking to the Portsmouth News, with ride marshall Simon Terry explained that their display aimed to highlight the vulnerability of cyclists.
Nudity emphasises the vulnerability of cyclists on the road, he said.
If we wore clothes motorists wouldnt spot us. If we go nude, they do.
We want to encourage more people to cycle, use their cars less and stop taking unnecessary journeys.

This video appears to show the shocking moment that a police officer pepper-sprayed a man while he was suffering from a stroke.
In the video, officer Shaun Jurgens can be seen walking up to David Washington, after he drove the wrong way on a street in Fredricksburg, Virginia.
But he then proceeds to seemingly fire a Taser at Washington without warning while he is still sitting at the wheel of the car.
And after another police officer opens the car door, Jurgens sprays a huge amount of pepper spray into Washingtons face.
Get out the car, Jurgens shouts.
Get out the car, or Im going to f*****g smoke you. Get out the car, right now. We aint playing.
(Picture: Fredericksburgh Police Department)
At one point in the video, Washington can even be heard telling officers that he cant breathe.
He was later taken to the hospital, where it was discovered that Washington was suffering from a stroke.

Jurgens has since resigned from his job after police determined that the level of force used was not appropriate.
But he has defended his actions, claiming that he believed Washington may have been under the influence of drink and drugs.
Separate charges have been filed against Washington for hit and run, reckless driving, and driving on a revoked license.

Huge jellyfish which weigh up to five stone each are swarming off British beaches  and no one knows why.
The creatures have tentacles up to six feet long, and are being left stranded on the island of Portland, Dorset, when the tide goes out.
Experts say the creatures have headed closer to shore because warmer seas have made more plankton available.
They have tentacles up to six feet long and are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean sea.
Their sting isnt considered dangerous, but can cause a nettle-like rash.

Marine and wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella found 25 of the barrel jellyfish scattered across the 200 metre shore in just one day.
He says he thinks that tens of thousands could be lurking in the deeper waters.
He said, There are significantly more than last year. I am surprised they have hung around for two years.

Whoops. (Picture: PA)
Its that time of the year again when people hurl themselvesdown a hill in the hope of catching a large round of cheese.
The Coopers Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake takes place on the Spring Bank holiday at Coopers Hill in the village of Brockworth, near Gloucester.
It involves rolling a 9lb round of Double Gloucester cheese down the hill with competitors chasing after it. The idea is that whoever catches the cheese wins, but in reality, the first person to cross the finish line is crowned the winner and gets the cheese as a reward.

Unsurprisingly, thereare often several injuries during each event, and organisers as well as cheese maker Diana Smart  who provides the Double Gloucester round  have been warned by police they could be liable for these injuries.
That wont deter those involved, however. Since 2010, when the official competitionwas cancelled, the eventhas taken place spontaneously without any management.
No-ones going to stop us doing it, said former winner Helen Thorpe in 2011.
They say its not official but we are all Brockworth people and were running the cheese today so it is official. We strongly believe in it.

Thousands of people lined the shores of the Mersey today to witness Cunards three flagship liners sail down the river framed by the magnificent Liverpool skyline.
The Three Queens spectacle celebrated the famous shipping lines formation 175 years ago in its original home port.
Many people arrived in the early hours of the morning to secure a prime spot to see the Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria.
The ships performed choreographed manoeuvres on the river, which included 180-degree turns.

Isarve Cano Vargas was abducted in Tehuacan, Mexico (Picture: CEN)
A teenage girl who was abducted by a gang was murdered even though her parents paidthe 84,000ransom demand.
Isarve Cano Vargas, 19, was abducted shortly after meeting Angel de Jesus Carrasco Lopez, 21, and his friends in Tehuacan, Mexico, police believe.
Authorities say Lopez and friends Efrain Mendez Cabrera, 28, and Jairo Adan Gutierrez Cabrera, 21, then rang the teens family and demanded 2million pesos (84,000) for her release, which the family paid.
They then reportedly demanded a further 140,000 pesos, which is when the Vargas family contacted police. The teenagerwas found dead soon after.

Police believe that the gang murdered Ms Vargas before they demanded the first ransom payment.
We suspect that they were worried she could identify them, and decided not to take any risks, said a police spokesman.
The body was found 20 miles from the city of Coxcatlan. Local reports suggest she was strangled, although a post-mortem examination could not confirm this.
Lopez and his friends have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and rare being held.

The tables are turned: A lion is chased up a tree by the very animals it was hunting (Picture: Barcroft)
The king of the jungle doesnt always win.
This is the extraordinary moment the tables were turned in Kenya when a lion was chased away by the herd of buffalo it was stalking.
The series of incredible images, taken by ex-army officialCharles Comyn, show the hairy beast fleeing before scrambling up a tree.
(Picture: Barcroft)
Mr Comyn, who was exploring the reserve with his wife, said: All of a sudden, literally out of nowhere, a male lion sprang out from his hiding place hightailing for a nearby tree with the buffalo now starting to give chase.
It didnt take long before the lion had scrambled up the tree, fearing for its life.
The marauding buffalo circled below, smelling the lion. They were not going to let it get away.
(Picture: Barcroft)
The terrified lion slid down the tree after a few second and made for a nearby bush.
It was a hair-tingling moment, he continued. The lion could not hang for long  one could really sense that he was almost doomed  so he had to make another attempt to flee.
(Picture: Barcroft)
Very quickly the buffalo resumed their early morning grazing. It was only then that we spotted the newly born calf in the middle of the herd, which they obviously had been protecting from the lion who possibly had spotted a potential light breakfast.
What a magical, unforgettable and, as we later learnt, unheard of occurrence.

Fallan Kurek (R), and mum Julia (Picture: BPM)
A 21-year-old teaching assistant died suddenly after taking a contraceptive pill, her parents have claimed.
Fallan Kurek was rushed to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, after collapsing at home in Tamworth on May 11, but died three days later.
The cause was recorded as a pulmonary embolism on her lung but her parents, Brian and Julia Kurek, said doctors thought it might have been down to a contraceptive pill she had been taking for just 25 days.
She took her pill, then she got up, and then began walking downstairs, her dad Brian, 52, said.
But as she got half way down the stairs she collapsed. I got to the bottom of the stairs and she just went limp in my arms.

Teaching assistant Miss Kurek was prescribed Rigevidon by her GP to regulate her periods and told to take the pill for three months.
But after just three weeks of taking the contraceptive, she began suffering with breathlessness and pains in her legs and ribs.
The Medicines and Healthcare products regulatory agency has moved to reassure women, with a spokesperson saying the contraceptive was safe and highly effective.

An inquest into Ms Kureks death will be conducted by the South Staffordshire coroner in due course and her funeral will take place on Friday.

Its always pretty satisfying when a hateful protest takes a turn for the worse, and those involved are left to look extremely stupid.
And thats exactly what happened when the Westboro Baptist Church attempted to protest against Ireland voting yes to gay marriage.
Having now probably realised that their Gods hate fags shtick is a bit old, they decided to spice up their displays of vitriol by waving an Irish flag.
They posted a Vine titled You flip a flag upside down to show a nation is in distress. Like when they pass fag marriage by popular vote.
Or if you turn the Irishflag around you dont look like an Irishman in distress, you look like someonewith a passion for Ivory Coast.
(Picture: Vine)
But if were being honest, it just looked like a bloke who wasnt sure about which way to hang the tricolour flag.

Ye Olde Fighting Cocks (Picture: Google Street View)
Not satisfied with telling a farm worker off for swearing in front of his sheep , Peta now wants a pub to change its name.
Peta has asked Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St Albans, Hertfordshire, to rebrand in recognition of societys growing compassion for animals and in celebration of intelligent, sensitive chickens.
Instead the pub, which is officially the oldest pub in the UK, should call itself to something like Ye Olde Clever Cocks.
The pub dates back to the eighth century and has had the fighting cocks name since 1872.
MORE: PETA made a complaint against a farmer who swore at his sheep
Peta wrote an open letter which said: We understand that the pub has long been called Ye Olde Fighting Cocks and that there may be some resistance to making a name change, but just as many pubs with names tied to slavery changed their names to match modern sensibilities, so its high time for The Cocks to change.
If you must stick with tradition, you could revert to the much kinder name from 1756: Three Pigeons.
Landlord Christo Tofalli told the Herts Advertiser : I wish animal rights organisations all the very best with their priority, which is to continue to raise awareness of cruelty to animals, and to protect them. We will be replying to PETA respectfully.

There are perfectly planned Oceans Eleven-style heists  and then theres the opposite end of the scale.
A 30-year-old bowling alley employee Jamie Pordon staged a clever fake robbery in Decatur, Illinois, by beating herself over the head with a bowling ball, then lying on the floor.
Sadly, she was right next to a CCTV camera.
She claimed that $2,100 had been stolen by unknown assailants  but police rapidly found some of the money in her car.
The video showed her bashing herself over the head with a ball, then sounding the alarm and lying down to wait for the police.

She admitted to having gambled away the rest in the bowling alleys slot machines.

Jamie advised she struck herself with the bowling ball so that she would have a knot on her head when police arrived.

A cheating husband begged a bus company for help after he left a bag containing his sex tape with his mistress on a number 17.
The man was carrying a video of his steamysessions with his lover in a holdall, but forgot to pick it up when he got off at his stop in Scarborough, Yorkshire.
He desperately rang the lost property section of East Yorkshire Motor Services, confessing the affair and begging for help in recovering the bag.
He admitted that he was married and his wife was not in the movie but his girlfriend was, depot manager Chris Agar told the Sun.
He was more concerned about the fact his wife would find out.
All we can assume is that someone on the bus decided to walk off with the holdall and got more than they bargained for.

A bus driver has spoken out in defence of a cyclist who apparently skipped a red light and crashed into him.
Gary Wilkinson commented on Manchester Evening Newss Facebook page saying the cyclists brake cable snapped as he approached the lights.
He said: I was the driver of the bus and just to let everyone know I parked just round the corner and ran back. The cyclist was very lucky and only suffered a cut to one of his knuckles. Also in the cyclists defence his brake cable snapped and he couldnt stop. Scariest thing that ever happened to me.
The cyclist, who was filmed by Captf, responded to the video saying: Thought Id just get the lights, hence the speed. Realised it wasnt happening, squeezed the front brake. Cable snapped. Not enough time to lose speed on back wheel in the wet.
Its a fixed back wheel, front brake for urgent braking, pushing back on the pedals gives you controlled but sadly slower braking with the back wheel, so what you see is me pushing back as hard as i can but its a cr** bit of road surface and it was wet.

This picture caused confusion as viewers saw it differently (Picture: Swiked/Tumblr)
Remember that nonsense about the colour of the dress which sent the internet into meltdown?
Well, it turns out that we were all wrong  after a new book suggested that theres no such thing as colour, and its actually just an illusion.
In the book Outside Colour, Dr Mazviita Chirimuuta suggests that colour has always just been a concept in our heads, but forms when light is transformed by our minds.
Of all the properties that objects appear to have, colour hovers uneasily between the subjective world of sensation and the objective world of fact, he wrote.
And its believed that illusions such as The Dress are proof of how colour is perceived differently, with the colour of an object often leaving a temporary imprint on our eye.

Dr Chirimuuta added: If we step back a moment, we can appreciate how very weird it is to expect there to be a connection between the manifest visual world, brought to us by our senses, and the rarefied scientific image of a world made up of physical particles.
And further evidence suggested that we didnt even realise colour existed until it was described  with ancient languages failing to have a word for blue.

Look at any advert for Apples iPhone 6, and the time is ALWAYS 9.41 on screen.
This is not a coincidence, and youre not having an acid flashback.
Question-and-answer site Quora.com threw light on exactly why this week  and its all down to Steve Jobs perfectionist, control-freak side.
MORE: Apple Watches may not work properly if you have a wrist tattoo
When Jobs first announced iPhone, he wanted the phone to be frozen at the time he announced it on stage at MacWorld.
Quora writer Brian Roemmele says, On January 9, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. Steve Jobs took the stage at the 2007 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo and just about 35 minutes into his presentation he said, This is a day I have been looking forward to for two and a half years
And at just about 9:42 a.m. Steve announced the iPhone. Thus frozen in time is the near exact time the iPhone was officially announced.
Since that time, Apple presentations have got a bit shorter, and newer iPhones such as iPhone 6 were announced at 9.41  hence the time on screen.
Former Apple software engineer Scott Forstallsaid, We design the product launch keynotes so that the big reveal of the product happens around 40 minutes into the presentation.
When the big image of the product appears on screen, we want the time shown to be close to the actual time on the audiences watches.
But we know we wont hit 40 minutes exactly. And for the iPhone, we made it 42 minutes. It turned out we were pretty accurate with that estimate, so for the iPad, we made it 41 minutes. And there you arethe secret of the magic time.

Hundreds ofpeople from Bangladesh have allegedly been flying into the UK for a day to claim benefits.
One flat alone is the registered address for 400 claimants, according to The Sun , in one of the biggestfrauds of its kind.
The workers, based in Italy and who have Italian passports, are believed to have received around 9,000 each after landing at Stansted Airport, heading to a Jobcentre and getting National Insurance numbers that they usedto forgepayslips.
Over three years it is believed to have cost the UK millions of pounds and sparked an investigation involving the Met Police, Department for Work and Pensions and Redbridge council.
Its seen the arrest of Asma Khanam, trustee of charity Families for Survival UK, which works in Bangaldesh and Kenya providing necessities to the disabled, elderly and orphans.
In total eight people have been charged.
A spokesman for the DWP said: Our fraud investigators have powers to track benefit cheats around the world and bring them before the courts.
We are determined to crack down on people who abuse the system, so that benefits only go to those who really need this help.
In addition to any sentence imposed by the courts, fraudsters must pay back all the money they falsely obtained and face a criminal record for life.

Instragram is usually a bit cooler than more granny-friendly social networks such as Facebook.
But this week, the picture-heavy social site just got a bit needy.
Instagram is to start sending out highlights emails with the goal of tempting back users who dont visit too often.
The new service will cherry-pick a few of the best posts you might have missed, in a similar fashion to Twitters experimental Twitter highlights.
Naturally, cool techy types are having none of it, with Techcrunch saying that the move showed Instagram was ageing.
Instagram, you're supposed to be cool

This should already be a given but if you work for the government and was thinking of wearing Ugg boots and a onesie to work, youre no longer allowed to.
Thats in Australia anyway, where the casual clothing items were officially banned for public servants employed by the Immigration Department.
New guidelines, which go into effect today, also forbid thongs and jeans, which are probably less outrageous depending on how you wear them.

They pine, they cry, they walk round in circles, thinking their master is never to return.
But some, like Paddy the labrador-collie cross, take things into their own hands.
Hewent into the back garden and jumped onto the trampoline until hewas able to get out and follow owner Thomas McCormack.
Paddy followed him to the train station in Croy, North Lanarkshire, and jumped onto the seat next to him.

PreviouslyThomas found Paddy sat on the front doorstep waiting for him and he didnt know how he had escaped.
But neighbours told him theyd seen Paddy using the trampoline to escape.
Thomas said: Hes bouncing on the trampoline with the kids all the time  thats where he must have learnt it. Hes a clever dog.
Id never seen him do it but sure enough Ive now seen it for myself. Hes some dog.
He added: My guess is that hes been following me to work a few times, but never managed to find me until until the other day.
That morning he obviously caught me. I had to take him to work. Obviously hes a new start.

If smoking cannabis is legalised, governments are set to rake in billions from tax.
But smokers will see a pretty hefty price drop, too, as control of the trade shifts out of the hands of criminal gangs.
American states such as Oregon which have legalised marijuana have seen prices drop from an American average of 210 an ounce to 131 an ounce, according to Forbes.
American weed tends to be extremely strong skunk  for comparison, the average price for skunkweed in the UK was 187 in 2011, according to the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit.
The research comes from PriceofWeed.com, which analyses data from smokers across America, both in states where weed has been legalised, and states where it remains prohibited.

If youve seen the latest Avengers movie, youll be well aware that the prospect of a robot created from artificial intelligence is pretty terrifying.
But its one that Google could be on the verge of creating, according to SpaceX boss Elon Musk.
Writing in his new book Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, journalist Ashlee Vance recalled a conservation he had with Musk over dinner.
He opened up about the major fear keeping him up at night: namely that Googles cofounder and CEO Larry Page might well have been building a fleet of artificial intelligence-enhanced robots capable of destroying mankind, Vance wrote.
Im really worried about this, Musk said.
And despite Musk being close friends with Page, he spoke of being worried that Page could produce something evil by accident.
Speaking to Business Insider, Vance added that Musk believed Pages experiments with AI to be nave.

Its not the first time that Musk has warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence, having previously likened it to summoning the demon.
And hes been backed by both Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking, who both similarly warned that a cautious approach should be taken towards AI technologies.

Brains or breasts? (Picture Getty)
Men actually prefer brains over bust size when it comes to choosing long-term partners.
We should note that this research may not hold true, say, at closing time in the pub.
A leading psychologist, ProfessorDavidBainbridge of the University of Cambridge, said that studies had repeatedly shown that men choose brain size over breast size in potential partners.
Professor Bainbridge told the Hay literary festival, Breast size doesnt matter. Large breasts are more likely to be asymmetric and men are more attracted to symmetry.
And they look older more quickly, and men value youth.
The main thing that men are looking for is intelligence. Surveys have shown time and time again that this is the first thing that men look for.

Taking paracetamol while pregnant can seriously harm the health of unborn baby boys, new research has found.
Taking the popular painkiller  prescribed by doctors for pain during pregnancy  stops babies producing the male sex hormone testosterone, and can harm children long after birth.
Researchers say their findings could help to explain reported links between paracetamol use in pregnancy and reproductive health problems in young boys.
Testosterone, produced in the testicles, is crucial for life-long male health.
Reduced exposure to the hormone in the womb has been linked to an increased risk of infertility, testicular cancer and undescended testicles.
MORE: Taking paracetamol has serious effects on your emotions, study finds
Dr Rod Mitchell, a Wellcome Trust intermediate clinical research fellow at Edinburgh University, said: We would advise that pregnant women should follow current guidance that the painkiller be taken at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.
Dr Martin Ward-Platt, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: The findings of this study send a clear message  expectant mothers should not prolong paracetamol use during pregnancy, only taking it when necessary and as per current NICE guidelines.

Cancel the crisp rosemary and olive oil flatbread, theres a problem with supply.
Italy and Spain have had poor harvests meaning theres a chance that olive oil could be rationed this summer.
Walter Zanre, UK managing director of Filippo Berio told The Grocer: If there were to be another bad harvest next year I think we would have the prospect of rationing people in terms of supply.
In 15 years in this business this is the worst year I have seen. There is not enough oil to meet demand. Sourcing good quality extra virgin in the second half of the year will be very difficult.

In contrast supplies of sunflower oil have gone up as people switch to cheaper alternatives.
The supermarket price war is also having an effect as Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Morrisons deal with competition from Aldi and Lidl.
Mr Zanre added: The discounters are really having a big impact on olive oil. They are taking a larger share and the big four are reacting, so the natural result is deflation all round.

A woman chased her husband through a car park in a four-wheel drive and rammed into him, pinning him beneath the car, because he admitted he didnt vote.
Voting IS important, but probably not this important.
Holly Nicole Solomon circled her husband Daniel in the car, before moving in for the attack, after she heard he didnt vote in the American 2012 Presidential election.
He suffered a fractured pelvis in the attack.
Solomon thought her family would face hardship as a result of Obamas re-election.
She was jailed for three and a half years for assault by a judge in Arizona.

You know the ones (Picture: Alamy)
That really annoying Facebook friend of yours who brags online actually has very low self-esteem.
A new study, which confirms what weve all been thinking, found that people who post statuses about accomplishments are typicallynarcissists.
Psychologists at Brunel University London surveyed Facebook users to examine the personality traits and motives that influence the topics they choose to write about in their status updates.
The data was collected from 555 peoplewho completed online surveys measuring the big five personality traits  extroversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness  as well as self-esteem and narcissism.
The research found
People with low self-esteem more frequently posted status updates about their current romantic partner.
Narcissists more frequently updated about their achievements, which was motivated by their need for attention and validation from the Facebook community. These updates also received a greater number of likes and comments, indicating that narcissists boasting may be reinforced by the attention they crave.
Narcissists also wrote more status updates about their diet and exercise routine, suggesting that they use Facebook to broadcast the effort they put into their physical appearance.
Conscientiousness was associated with writing more updates about ones children.
Psychology lecturer Dr Tara Marshall, from Brunel University London, said: It might come as little surprise that Facebook status updates reflect peoples personality traits.
However, it is important to understand why people write about certain topics on Facebook because their updates may be differentially rewarded with likes and comments. People who receive more likes and comments tend to experience the benefits of social inclusion, whereas those who receive none feel ostracised.
Although our results suggest that narcissists bragging pays off because they receive more likes and comments to their status updates, it could be that their Facebook friends politely offer support while secretly disliking such egotistical displays.
She added: Greater awareness of how ones status updates might be perceived by friends could help people to avoid topics that annoy more than they entertain.

A mother who was jailed in a row over her sons circumcision has been freed after being sent to prison.
Heather Hironimus divided opinions when she refused to have her four-year-old sons foreskin removed.
She agreed in a parenting agreement filed in court then changed her mind, sparking a lengthy legal battle.
Judges sided with the boys father, Dennis Nebus, but shedisappeared before giving consent.
She was eventually found at a shelter in Broward County, Florida, with her son.

Hironimus refused to give her consent for the surgery and she was jailed indefinitely. After nine days in prison she appeared before the court where she cried as she signed a document giving consent.
Her mother, Mary Hironimus, said intactivists  anti-circumcision activists  planned to reach out to doctors around the country to urge them not to perform the circumcision.
Georganne Chapin, executive director of Intact America, which advocates against circumcision, said the images of a distraught Heather Hironimus signing the form to allow the surgery show how she was bullied into it and that she doesnt truly give her consent.
If anyone finds out the circumstances under which she signed, a doctor would be insane to carry out that surgery, she said.

The life of a cyclist who knocked down a young girl then dragged her 12ft along a pavement has been destroyed following the incident, his father has said.
Andrew Holland allegedly cycled off after hitting Lucie Wilding, three, when she stepped out from her front gate in Blackpool, Lancashire.
PAVEMENT CYCLING: THE LAW
It is illegal to cycle on footpaths under Section 72 of the Highways Act 1835 . Its also illegal to drive horses, asses, sheep, mules, swines or cattle on pavements. The maximum fine is 500.
Mr Holland, 23, denies hurling abuse at the family adding thathe apologised to the girls mother, Lauren Howarth, 26, after the incident, has spoken to police and emailed her family to apologise.
He told the Daily Mail : Apparently it was a hit and run but it wasnt.
Speaking about cycling on the pavement, Mr Holland said: I didnt know it was illegal. I usually use cycle paths or the roads.
Ms Howarth also said that hehad cycled off following the incident,but Mr Hollands family disputes this.

Labour leadership favourite Andy Burnham has been claiming 17,000 a year in expenses to rent a London flat.
This is on top of rent he receives from a another flat he owns in Kennington.
Mr Burnham claims1,449.98 to rent the property, which he moved to before parliament changed the rules in August 2012 which banned MPs from claiming mortgage interest on second homes.
Sir Alistair Grahamcriticised the move and told the Sunday Times it was wrong.
A spokesman for the MP said: Mr Burnham was forced into this arrangement by a change in the rules.
He has received no public subsidy in respect of his flat and the rent he receives only covers his costs.
If parliament changed the rules, he would return to his own flat. Any suggestion that he has made money with the help of the public purse is utterly false.

This is Lee. Hes the latest victim of stag doshenanigans.
His mates stripped him naked and taped him to a traffic light pole in Stockport  because having a couple down the local would be too tame.
The 41-year-old stagwas leftwith his hands behind his back for 30 minutes before his friends eventually puthim out of his misery.
The group of 13 then travelled over to Liverpool where they forcedhim to dress as John Lennon, complete with a miniature guitar, during anight out in the city.
Then, while nursing a hangover on Sunday morning, poor Lee was painted blueand forced to dress as a Smurf for the remainder of the party, which endedin Birmingham.
Best man Matthew said he had been planning the prank for a long time: He was there for about half an hour. But he was alright in theend and he took it in his stride.
It was all very strategic and a bigsurprise for him. He was a bit shocked and nervous but hes quite anoutgoing person. He was a good sport about it.

The hunt for a man suspected of stabbing to death his six-year-old sister, her mother and her partner is intensifying.
Armed police officers have been scouring Didcot, Oxfordshire, and its surrounding areas, including Oxford Universitys Parks, for 21-year-old Jed Allen.
The manhunt has now entered its second day.
The bodies of Philip Howard, 44, Janet Jordon, 48, and daughter Derin were discovered in a house in Vicarage Road just after 8.20pm on Saturday, following a call from a member of the public.

As news of the tragedy began to spread, people could be seen visiting the homeand leaving floral tributes.
A yellow teddy bear was also placed just inside the cordon, and a hand-written tribute was attached to a bunch of flowers.
Part of it read: To my best friend, my soul mate, Jan, Dezzy and my anorexic Phil and my gorgeous Jed.
Tributes have been left outside the property (Picture:Ben Birchall/PA Wire)
You are my family and always will be. I will miss you all each day. You have all left a massive void in my heart which will never be filled.
I love you all so much, Jan, Phil and my Dezzy Doo.
As more than 100 police officers hunted for the suspect, Oxford University Parks  where Allen worked as a groundsman  were closed.
Post-mortem examinations of the victims are expected to continue today.
Anyone with any information about the incident is asked to contact police immediately via 101, quoting reference number 1370 (23/5).

The creators have decided to stay anonymous as they fear retaliation from sexist men, which is also depressing in itself.
Anyway, weve collected some of the most striking ones. Prepare to get angry.

Apparently some phone calls are so important that you stay on the line even when youre being shot at.
CCTV footage of a pavement in Cincinnati, Ohio, shows a man walking along the street with his mobile phone pressed to his ear when a drive-by shooter sends a hail of bullets his way.
The man ducks away before pulling out his own gun and returning fire. All while continuing with his phone call.
Its not until he runs off that he finally takes the phone from his ear.
Police believe the shooting was part of a turf war between two rival gangs.
WLWT reports that the only injury reported was a cut knee caused by shattered glass.

A farmer on a farm in the Australian outback has been slammed by PETA after one of his workers allegedlyswore at his sheep.
According to reports, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals lodged a complaint against farmer Ken Turner, after an employee was apparently filmed by an undercover operative using profanities in front of the animals.
Describing the bizarre accusation, Mr Turner said: The allegation was that bad language was used by an employee on the property in front of the sheep and that they could have been offended by the use of bad language.
And while the complaint was submitted to the Australian RSPCA, the case unsurprisingly collapsed when it became clear that the footage hadnt breached the law.

Blackpool Zoo is releasing a new video series aimed at giving viewers a behind-the-scenes look at life at the park.
Andwhen keepers put a camera in an indestructible case and left it with a pair of female orangutans, the great apes showed their human side by flipping the camera round and recording themselves.
Keepers eventually persuaded Cherie to swap the expensive camera for a banana, Blackpool Zoo wrotein the video description.

An American TV star has equated transgender people to child predators despite her own son admitting to molesting young girls.
Michelle Duggar, who featureswith her husband Jim Bob in the popular TV show 19 Kids and Counting, compared trans people to child molesters while speaking out on a proposed gender discrimination bill last August.
But it has now emerged that Duggars ownson, Josh, admitted to molesting girls as young as 12 while a teenager in 2006.

Maybe if I keep on smiling at his jokes hell shut up eventually (Alamy)
Its always been an accepted idea that women talk a lot more than men, but it turns out that its simply not true.
Surprisingly, sexist pseudo-science isnt actually backed up by facts!
A study published this year by Princeton University showed that even gender parity doesnt insure that women will talk as much as men in any given setting.
In fact, according to The Silent Sex, men will out-talk women even if a room is 60%female.
Shockingly, women need to outnumber men 4 to 1 in a social situation for them to actually talk more than men.
A team of researchers at thePersonality and Social Psychology Review in the US publisheda study in 2007 which backs this up.
In mixed-gender conversations, men not only used more assertive speech,but also consistently did most of the talking.
The social setting is also utterly irrelevant: men will be the ones talking the most in universities, laboratories, classrooms, town meetings, and others.
There are many possible solutions to this problem, but the easiest one would probably be for men to shut up once in a while, eh.
You heard that, men? Good. Hush now.

An investigation is underway (Picture: PA)
An NHS surgeon reportedly used a rusty hacksaw to amputate a patients leg because B&amp;Q was shut.
Surgeons at Ayr Hospital discovered they did not have the correct tools to carry out a routine amputation after theyunexpectedly found a metal plate inside an elderly patients leg.
Staff were sent to B&amp;Q to pick up a saw, the Mail on Sunday reports, but the store was shut  so a surgeon reportedly carried out the operation with a rusty hacksaw found in a cupboard of old stock at the hospital.
Once the surgeon discovered the metal plate in the mans leg, he found he didnt have the tools to continue with the procedure, a source at the hospital told the Mirror .

As B&amp;Q was shut, the decision was taken to use a saw which was found in the old store cupboard.
It was sterilised before being used, but highly skilled surgeons in Scotland in 2015 shouldnt find themselves in the middle of an operation without the proper equipment.
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Carlaw Jackson said he was shocked by the news.

Interim Nurse Director at the Healthboard, Ann Gow, confirmed that an investigation was underway.
It hopes to find out why the metal plate was not flagged up before the operation, rather than why the saw was used.

The owner of a barber shop has been accused of racism after charging customers more for a haircut if they are white.
The owner of the shop in Northern Italy attracted complaints to police after he opted to charge different prices depending on a persons skin colour  meaning white people pay more than black people.
When police broke into the Gloria Coiffeur Beauty Centre in the Veneto region of Northern Italy, they seized a price list  which seemed to support the accusations.
The owner, who is African, is now being quizzed by police.
On the list, the barber appears to charge 10 Euros (7) for a white haircut, as opposed to 6 Euros (4) for a black haircut.

Greek hospitals have run out of basic supplies such as painkillers and sheets after budget cuts left the health service desperately short of funds.
Crippling austerity has left millions of Greeks unemployed, while 2.5million peopleare now uninsured, a massive increase from the 500,000 in 2008.
Healthcare spending has fallen by more than a quarter since 2009, leaving hospitals lacking even the most basic supplies, including scissors, sheets and painkillers.

Patients have reportedly been turned away from hospitals because of the lack of equipment.
Others have undergone surgery without pain-relieving medication.
The news follows the announcement by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis that the country willsoon run out of money.

Islamic State fighters have executed at least 400 people in Palmyra since capturing the ancient Syrian city four days ago, according to Syrian state media.
It was not immediately possible to verify the account, but it was consistent with reports by activists that the Islamist fighters had carried out executions since capturing the city from government troops.
The militants seized the city of 50,000 people, site of some of the worlds most extensive and best preserved ancient Roman ruins, on Wednesday, days after also capturing the city of Ramadi in neighbouring Iraq.
The two near simultaneous victories were Islamic States biggest successes since a U.S.-led coalition began an air war against the fighters last year, and have forced an examination of whether the strategy is working.

The Sunni Muslim militants have proclaimed a caliphate to rule over all Muslims from territory they hold in both Syria and Iraq. They have a history of carrying out mass killings in towns and cities they capture, and of destroying ancient monuments which they consider evidence of paganism.
The terrorists have killed more than 400 people.. and mutilated their bodies, under the pretext that they cooperated with the government and did not follow orders, Syrias state news agency said, citing residents inside the city.
It added that dozens of those killed were state employees, including the head of nursing department at the hospital and all her family members.
Islamic State supporters have posted videos on the internet they say show fighters going room to room in government buildings searching for government troops and pulling down pictures of President Bashar al-Assad and his father.

Activists have said on social media that hundreds of bodies, believed to be government loyalists, were in the streets.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors violence in the country with a network of sources on the ground, says that some people were beheaded in the town since it fell but has not given an estimate for the toll among civilians.
It says at least 300 soldiers were killed in the days of fighting before the city was captured.
A bigger number of troops have disappeared and it is not clear where they are, Rami Abdulrahman from the Observatory told Reuters.

Its not its usual prey, but that didnt stop one alligator taking on a truck.
In a video posted to YouTube by keet246, an alligator can be seen lying in the grass with its jaws open as a truck inches towards it.
But the truck pushes the gator too far and it suddenly leaps up, grabs the bumper in its jaws and rips it off, also dislodging the wheel guard in the process.
Not its usual prey (Picture: YouTube)
The ease with which the alligator does this is incredible, but we shouldnt be surprised.
Gators have a bite strength of 2125 pounds per square inch  enough to bite through steel.
The alligator bite pales in comparison to that of its crocodile cousin, however. The saltwater crocodile can slam its jaws shut with a force of 3,700 PSI.

Unfortunately for everyone involved, his legs gave way as police were walking him back to their patrol car.
It just so happened that this occurred mid-way through an ABC news report, and the mans fallto the ground coincided with him spotting the camera.

Wrong. Look closely and youll realise that theres been a spelling mishap, and someone is actually driving around in a Porshce instead.
Thats because a driver was forced to take his 100,000 super car to the garage to fix a dent on its bumper.
However, when it was returned, he realised that a mechanic had unwittingly given the vehicle a new identity  thanks to the spelling mistake.
But at least he can now laugh at the gaffe, after it was posted on Twitter by friend Ollie Martin.

Kiaya (Middle) lives in Waterford, Michigan, with her owner, Jessica Van Husen (Picture: Facebook)
For humans afflicted by blindness, a guide dog can prove to be an invaluable source of support.
But it turns out that theyre pretty good at doing the same job for their own species too, after the younger siblings of a blind dog became her guide.
Kiaya, a 10-year-old Akita, lost both eyes after she was diagnosed with glaucoma.
But now, siblings Keller, 2, and Cass, 8, have become her guide to stop her from bumping into things.
Speaking to WXYZ, owner Jessica Van Husen, from Michigan, explained: I think she would be lost without them.
Kiaya is looked after by Keller and Cass (Picture: Facebook)
She relies on them. When they are coming in from the back yard they rub up against her. They guide her.
And the vet who originally removed Kiayas eyes described the situation as remarkable.
Its clear the other dogs are trying to protect her. Their sense of loyalty is really remarkable, Dr Gwen Silasaid.
Kiaya relaxes with her siblings (Picture: Facebook)
Describing their incredible routine, Jessica added: Cass always allowsKiayato get to her food dish first and waits for her to start eating.
When I take them in the car, he leans against her to keep her steady because she sometimes gets a little off kilter. He also loves to groom her.
Cass definitely took the role upon himself to guide her around the yard which made me of course cry my eyes out.

Mr Singh tending to the boy
A Sikh student who broke strict religious protocol to save a boys life has been rewarded generously for what he did.
Harman Singh, 22,became knownaround the world for for removing his turban to put underneath the head of six-year-old Daejon Pahiawhen he was hit by a car.
Neighbours, aided by New Zealands One News , have clubbed together to kit out his home with new furniture.
During TV interviewspeople noticed how sparse his flat was and so they have furnished it for him.
On top of that, hes gota six months supply of Dominos Pizzas as a thank you.
After coming to the worlds attention, Harmantold the New Zealand Herald : I saw a child down on the ground and a lady was holding him. His head was bleeding, so I unveiled by turban and put it under his head.
Harman on his new sofa (Picture: One News)
He has been praised internationally for his actions (Picture: Facebook)
I wasnt thinking about the turban. I was thinking about the accident and I just thought He needs something on his head because hes bleeding. Thats my job  to help. And I think anyone else would have done the same as me.
He added: Thousands of people have said well done. I was only doing what I had to and trying to be a decent member of the community.
Thanks to all who messages, calls thanks all the worldwide Facebook members who messaged me. I think i just did my job nothing else.
The Sikh Press Association later posted on Facebook saying: Whilst the story of how this Sikh went out of his way to help an injured child is a beautiful story and nicely covered by nzherald.co.nz, it is entirely inaccurate to say he put religion aside to do it.
A Sikh is taught to do whatever they can to help someone, especially in the kind of situation seen in the linked article. This is seen in the use of the DuMalla style of turban during war times.
DuMalla can be transcribed as meaning two turbans. One reason this style of turban was worn by warrior Sikhs was to have extra material to use for treatment of wounds and to give to women who may have had clothes ripped in attacks after villages were ransacked. This Sikh did not put aside religion to help, he was simply doing what generations of Sikhs have done for centuries.

It managed to survive decimation from bombs raining down during the Blitz, and is one of Londons most enduringly popular landmarks.
But now, St Pauls Cathedral has been voted Britains favourite building  ahead of landmarks such as the Shard and Westminster Abbey.
From the survey of 2,000 adults, Stonehenge came in second place, racking up 30% percent of the vote.
Stonehenge is located in Wiltshire (Picture: PA)
And London landmarks seemed quite popular in general with Buckingham Palace, The Shard, and the Palace of Westminster also featuring in the vote.

There was also love for architecture across the UK, with Edinburgh and Windsor Castle getting 22 and 20 percent of the vote respectively.

The survey was carried out to mark the launch of TV series Impossible Engineering on the Yesterday channel.
Adrian Wills, general manager of Yesterday, said: Britain is so rich with great architecture and design, so we wanted to celebrate this by finding out our nations favourite.

As the most secretive nation on the planet, known for killingpeople for the most spurious reasons , were scratching our heads on this one.
Tourism in North Korea has fallen by 37 per cent.
It could have something to do with Kim Jong Uns fear of Ebola , effectivelyclosing the borders for six months from October 2014 to March this year.
Or it might be the forced labour camps where many, many people die.
Or even the executions of high-ranking officials that have taken place (16 so far this year) because theyve fallen out of favour of the Emmenthal-loving dictator.
Even the Ryugyong Hotel isnt attracting the visitor numbers it could hold (Picture: AP/Koryo Group)
Theres a water park people could enjoy (Picture: EPA)
Or it could be the fact that they just cant breed lobster successfully (not to mention the familne)
Whatever it is, the number of people going into North Korea dropped from 6,134 to just 3,851.
And thats despite Kims new ski resort, which he hoped would attract 5,000 visitors a day. Its hardly used.

Theres being a bit too friendly with customers, and theres well plain offensive.
WhenLiryca Neville Branch went to have dinner at Huck Finns Cafe in New Orleans, she wasnt expecting to get racially abused after dessert.
She went to have the meal with three of her co-workers, who are also black, and was shocked to see the N-Word printed on the receipt, along with the words 100% dislike.
She asked the staff about the slur, but was only told it was a joke they play on the black employees who work at the back of the restaurant.
Branch took to social media to complain about the restaurants racism, and the outrage soon went viral.
Huck Finns Cafe initially apologised on their Facebook page, saying that The unfortunate actions of this one employee do not mirror the mission of [their]firm non-discrimination policy, but later deleted the whole page from the website.

They also fired the waiter who printed the slur, who has been named asDakota Crochet, 23, who allegedly is the son of the restaurants owner.
Liryca Neville Branch called Crochet a stupid kid on Facebook, and said she felt heartbroken on the night of the incident, and lost sleep over it.
Dozens have since left reviews on Huck Finns Cafes Yelp page, with comments such as: lovely racist establishment. Order your burger with a side of hate and bigotry.

Construction workers buildingstadiums for World Cup 2022 in Qatar have been told they cant go back to Nepaltobury their loved ones or visit relatives following the earthquakes.
Nepal has also taken the unusual step of criticising Fifa and its commercial partners for the first time, according to the Observer .
Labour minister Tek Bahadur Gurung said: After the earthquake of 25 April, we requested all companies in Qatar to give their Nepalese workers special leave and pay for their air fare home.
While workers in some sectors of the economy have been given this, those on World Cup construction sites are not being allowed to leave because of the pressure to complete projects on time.
They have lost relatives and their homes and are enduring very difficult conditions in Qatar. This is adding to their suffering.
There are 400,000 Nepalese workers among 1.5million migrants working on the massive building project.
Gurung added that Fifa and its rich sponsors  which include Coca-Cola, Adidas, Visa, and Sony are ignoring Nepal because it is a small, poor country.
It is the first time one of the countries involved in supplying workers has spoken out against the treatment of its people.
Gurung said: Things are very difficult for the Nepalese and other workers in Qatar, but we have to help them and cannot stay silent any longer.

Police name Jed Allen as man they are hunting following triple murder in Didcot
Police today named three people found dead at a house in Didcot, Oxfordshire, as amanhunt continues.
The victims of the alleged murder werePhilip Howard, Janet Jordon, and her daughter Derin Jordon who was just six years old.
Police are now hunting for Jed Allen who has a distinctive spider tattoo on his hand.
The bodies were found at a house in Vicarage Road, Didcot, after officers were called last night.
Today they closed Oxford University Parks where Allenused to work as a groundsman.
Thames Valley Police have appealed for help to trace Jed Allen, 21, who was known to the family, who has a distinctive spider tattoo on his left hand.
Detective Superintendent Chris Ward said: Thames Valley Police is releasing an image of a man wanted in connection with three murders in Didcot yesterday.
The image is of Jed Allen, aged 21. We believe that Jed Allen is related to the victims and that this was a domestic incident.
Jed is white, about 6ft, of stocky build, and has a distinctive tattoo of a spider on his left hand. If you see Jed please do not approach him, instead call 999 immediately.
A photo posted by Jed Allen (@mr_meat_tank) on
Apr 1, 2015 at 7:55am PDT
It is very important we locate him as quickly as possible. I dont believe there is any danger to the wider community, however, given the nature of what we are dealing with it is important we find him.
If anyone sees him they should not approach him, anyone with information about him I am genuinely appealing for them to contact us.
We have officers actively looking for him at the moment, we know he has connections with Oxfordshire. We have carried out enquiries last night at addresses he might be.

Mr Ward added that although Allen was not considered a danger to the wider community, the public should not approach him and instead contact police.
The cause of deaths have yet to be established, and post-mortem examinations are expected to take place later today, Thames Valley Police said. No arrests have been made.
Mr Ward revealed that all three victims  who had only been living at the address for around two months  were related to each other and to Allen, who is a suspect in the investigation.
He is known to police and local to the area, Mr Ward said.
At this stage it is not believed that any firearms were involved in the incident.
At this stage the families of the victims have been informed and they are being looked after by specialist, trained officers, the detective said.
Officers received the tip-off at around 8.23pm and detectives are keen to hear from witnesses who may have been in the area of Vicarage Road at the time.
As a result of the hunt for Allen, police will be carrying out a number of overt searches in the Didcot area.
Anyone with any information about the incident is asked to contact police immediately via 101 quoting reference number 1370 (23/5).

A man survived against the odds after his skull was ripped from his spine in a car crash.
Tony Cowan, 29, suffered injuries similar to those suffered by Christopher Reeve and was left paralysed following the crash in September last year.
His car hit a speed bump before spinning out of control and hitting a telephone poll in Newcastle. Only muscle and tissue prevented him from being decapitated.
He suffered a complete spinal cord injury andthere appeared to be no brain activity so his partner of 10 years, Karen Dawson, took the decision to turn his life support machine off.
The gap between his spine and skull can be seen in this x-ray (Picture: NCJMedia)

But after she, his mother Pepsi Cowan and the rest of his family had said their goodbyes, Tony opened his eyes.
His recovery has been so remarkable that he may soon be heading home after months atHawthorns Neurological Rehabilitation Centre in Peterlee, County Durham.
The former bricklayerhas learned to communicate through blinking, mouthing words and using an electric communication board.
He said: I love Karen with all my heart and I cant wait to go home to get back to the life I had.

His mother said: The consultants had to make the decision to reattach his skull to his spine with a metal plate and bolts, they had never done an operation like it before and we were informed Tony would probably not survive  but again he pulled through.
Karen, 28, added: I love him somuch and it would mean the world to me to get him home. We were like twopeas in a pod and spent all our time together.
We are going to give Tony as much a normal life as possible, we haveassured him we will be there for him ever day, and he will never be alone.

The future is here! Someone has built a hoverboard that actually works.
It works so well, in fact, that it managed to go an incredible 905ft 2ins over a lake. The longest journey by a hoverboard ever.
The flight was made last summer, but its now been recognised by Guinness World Records.
Catalin Alexandru Duru, who created the board and flew itover Lake Ouareau in Quebec, said: I will showcase that stable flight can be achieved with a machine one can stand on and control with their feet, just like in the movie Back to the Future Part II. In our case, the machine is propeller-based.
The prototype can be used anywhere, but is usually tested over water because of how dangerously high it can fly (which is ironic considering that the movie joked that it cant).

A sci-fi obsessed multi-millionaire hopes to boldly gowhere no man has gone before, after building his office headquarters to look like the StarshipEnterprise from Star Trek.
Businessman Liu Dejian, the chairman of Chinas most popular mobile internet provider, was granted a license to build the impressive replica in Fujian Province.
Unsurprisingly, the impressive recreation doesnt come cheap, costing an estimated 100 million to construct, and features 30 foot metal slides between levels, and automatic sliding gates.
But hes certainly able to afford it, with his family boasting a 390 million fortune  larger than the Queen.
Construction on the offices began in 2008, and the building finished in 2014, becoming the new headquarters of NetDragon Websoft, Dejians company.
Its believed that his Star Trek obsession began when he studied chemistry at the University of Kansas.
Viewed from above, it looks like the USS has landed (Picture: Google)
Since then, hes managed to sell his own smart phone company for a whopping 1.2 billion, which is probably why hes been able to build this place.

To some people, it seems modern art can be a bit too modern.
This statue of a naked man, designed by Marek Ormandik, erected outside an art gallery, had to be pulled after complaints from people living nearby.
They said it was just too rude for them.
So police in Prievidza, Slovakia, ordered for it to be taken down.
Roman Turcel, manager of the gallery, said: We are preparing an exhibition of Marek Ormandik. It seemed totally natural to exhibit his statue outside.
For me the statue is a valuable art piece. It is annoying that some people cannot perceive art as art.
But Michel Dureje, spokesman for the Mayor, said: The peoples reaction was that the statue was causing a public nuisance and the people did not identify with the statue.
The gallery could face a fine of 24 for the statue being a public nuisance.
Vit Zajac, police spokesman claimed that the statue had to be removed not because of the nudity but because the gallery manager did not have any permission to exhibit it in a public place.
He said: It was not allowed to be shown outside so it had to be removed.

Aminah Ahmed died following a suspected brain aneurysm (Picture: Facebook)
A student died from a brain aneurysm soon after graduating in biology and business.
Aminah Jennifa Ahmed, 22, complained of a headache so went for a lie down shortly after picking up her diplomas from the University of Texas.
But her family was unable to wake her and she died in hospital five days later, according to CW33 .
A fundraiser has been set up called Aminah Sees in her name to helpchildren in South Asia without access to vision care and glasses.
On her gofundme page it says: A girl that can. All she ever wanted was to push people through faith. Push people to do what was right, and push people to make a difference. This special girls mission was to change the world. Its a goal that many of us have. But Aminah had a drive to motivate the people around her to become spiritual and make a positive difference in the world.
Before her death there had been no indication that she was in any discomfort, but after taking to the stage she vomited on campus.
She did it again on her way home and her father put it down to stress from school.
Imar Suleiman, director of the Islamic Learning Foundation, wrote: The family is in immense pain having seeing their daughter graduate literally hours before she was declared completely brain dead. Please keep her and them in your sincerest thoughts.

Warren Buffett wants government to pay people more money, not private industry (Picture: Alamy)

Hes the third richest man in the world and he wants you to stop blaming people like him because youre so poor.
Warren Buffetthas written an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal in which he says the poor are most definitely not poor because the rich are rich.
Rallying against a rise in the minimum wage in the U.S., he says people should be paid more through a government tax credit scheme.
While writing about addressing the widening gap between rich and poor, he points to Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Sam Walton and their achievements in making lives better for all of us because of their innovations.
He said: Nor are the rich undeserving. Most of them have contributed brilliant innovations or managerial expertise to Americas well-being. We all live far better because of Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, Sam Walton and the like. Instead, this widening gap is an inevitable consequence of an advanced market-based economy.
Outlining what he thinks the US economic policy objectives should be, he says everyone who works should receive an income that will provide him or her a decent lifestyle. But then he adds that it shouldnt distort the market system.
The system, that is, that has seen him valued as being worth $71.3billion (46billion).
Buffet wrote that the second goal (about not distorting the system) would crumble if the minimum wage in the U.S. was raised to $15 (9.68).
He says the best way to deal with it is keep wages where they currently are and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. I.e. the salaries he pays to his lowest workers would be subsidised by Government.

Nearly all romantics will have spent hours planning out the life-changing moment when they propose to their loved one.
But one mum overshadowed that moment for her daughter  by falling over on the beach just moments before her future son-in-law pops the question.
In the awkward (but pretty funny) clip, the mum seems confused as shes kept in the dark about whats about to happen, and moves closer to the couple.

However, things take an embarrassing turn when she suddenly loses her footing and face plants in the sand.
While she attempts to get up again, the boyfriend pops the question, meaning that the mum will be suffering from a heady mixture of embarrassment, guilt and shame.
Still, at least it didnt happen at the wedding.

John Langley has worked as a porn star for 30 years
A former UKIP electioncandidate has been suspended  after footage of him performing in a porn film in a public park emerged.
John Langley, whose porn career under the name Johnny Rockard made him one of the highlights of this years campaign, refused to resign as vice chairman of the Bristol party.
Mr Langley, 59, who finished second in the Brislington East council wardearlier this month, was apparently filmed performing in one of the citys parks.
He was suspended after he refused a recommendation to resign.
The national party will now decide whether to throw him out.

He wrote in a blog post: Seemingly the committee of which I am a member, by the way, made a decision which I was not party to, by being misled into the belief that I had conducted a criminal act while in post, and thats the nub of it.
Lets be very clear on where the law stands in this instance.
No criminal act was committed because no criminal act was reported, and furthermore I have neither been arrested or charged with a criminal act.
So therefore no criminal act has taken place. It was accepted both locally and nationally by UKIP that I make adult movies when I joined the party and therefore taken as read that I would continue to do so.
Which I have, and totally within the framework of the law.
Langley said he no longer has confidence in the committee.
The party had previously stood by him after details of his 30 year porn career emerged last month.
Bristol UKIP chairman Steve Wood told the Bristol Post: John has done a lot of good work for UKIP and he is a really nice guy.
You also have to bear in mind that we always knew what John was doing and he was completely upfront about it and we stood by him.
But there is a big difference between what somebody does in the privacy of their own home or even a studio and what they do in public.
He described the video as indecent and said: We cannot have that kind of thing in the party and therefore we asked him to resign.

A courageous wheelchair bound musician has been killed in a car accident while raising money for charity.
Frank Barhams trip, in which he hoped to push himself 302 miles, ended in tragedy on Wednesday on a highway in Georgia.
The 59-year-old was only 30 miles from the finishing line in Savannah when a tractor hit a van that was tracking the jazz harmonica player, which then slammed into him in Screven County.

Margaret Kargbo, who was part of his entourage and travelling in the van, was also killed.
The charity trip from Atlanta to Savannah started on May 11 and was due to end on May 25 and was raising money for Wheel 2 Live.
The musician was paralysed at the age of 24 when he was involved in another car crash.

A paralysed man finally got to fulfil his wish of holding abeer but he had to use some mind control tomake it happen.
A video showed Erik Sorto, from Los Angeles, completing his ultimate goal of drinking a tipple despite him being made a quadriplegic in 2002 after getting shot.
How was it done?
Surgeons at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California placed a pair of small electrode arrays into Sortos posterior parietal cortex, or PPC.

These neural prosthetics were then connected to computers that processed Sortos brain signals and determined his intent, allowing him to control a robotic arm mounted to a table nearby, or a computer cursor.
Sorto said he had a few tasks lined up other than drinking.
On the top of the list is that I want to be able to groom myself. I want to be able to brush my teeth by myself, he said.

However, while those patients could control a robotic limb, movement was delayed and jerky.

Olivia Bruce is the proud mother of a healthy newborn girl called Chloe.
But had it not been for an incredible twist of fate, Chloe probably would have been stillborn.
Ms Bruce, from Kegworth, Leicestershire, admitted herself to hospital five days before her due date because she was worried her baby had slowed down. She was then induced after doctors saw on a monitoring machine that her babys heart rate had dropped from 140 to 60.
Doctors have since told the 27-year-oldthat had she waited until her due date Chloe would have died.

 ElenaSoto50 (@Elenasoto50) May 23, 2015
Ms Bruce, who already has a seven-year-olddaughter called Brooke, had believed an old wives tale about babies reducing their movement prior to a birth to conserve energy.
But luckily for her, her grandmother phoned herto tell her about a segment on a TV programme about the Count The Kicks campaign.
After this Ms Bruce became very aware of her babys movements.
She said:I started to take more notice of how active the baby was in the womb and it was definitely slowing down, so I went to the hospital for a check-up.
That time doctors sent her away with the all clear.
Ms Bruce still remained uneasy about how little her daughter was moving in the womb and returned a second time  when she was given the all clear again.
The third time was five days before her due date, when doctors noticed the drop in little Chloes heart rate.
She said:I wondered if I should bother the medics again because Id been twice, and both times it was more about me being worried than there being any real problem.
Was it just my imagination? Perhaps I could just hang on for a few more days. I feared that if I went into hospital again theyd think I was either hysterical or a hypochondriac and send me away.
But I looked again at the Count The Kicks website and knew without doubt that the movements were reduced and I needed to get to hospital.
After the doctors noticed the problem, Ms Bruce describedhow medical staffwere quick to try and save her baby.
She said: Suddenly, midwives and doctors all rushed in to help, she remembers. I knew this was odd. There was only one midwife and a very calm atmosphere when Brooke was born.
The medics then started screaming instructions at each other. The doctors decided I had to have an emergency C-Section but then, after a final examination, they realised that by the time I was prepared for surgery, it would be too late  the baby would die.
I had, apparently, dilated enough to give birth and was told to push. I didnt feel ready to, but I sensed because of the panic in the room it was a life or death situation.
I grabbed poor Mum in a headlock and pushed as if all our lives depended on it. One hour and six minutes later Chloe was born.
She was perfect. As I cradled her in my arms, doctors told me that if I had waited until my due date, she would have been born dead.
Doctors are still unsure why her heart beat had started to slow and Chlope has now passed all her tests.
Now all Ms Bruce wants to do is pass on her knowledge to make sure all expectant parents are aware of the #Countthekicks campaign
Week by week baby movement guide
0-8 weeks pregnant
Your baby will begin to move at around 7 weeks pregnant and while these will be visible on an ultrasound scan you will not feel your baby move for another couple of months. Your baby will be making general movements like bending and startling.
9 weeks
At around 9 weeks your baby may begin to hiccup and move individual limbs like arms and legs. They may also be able to suck and swallow, this will help them prepare for breathing. Although the hiccups will start around now you will not be able to feel them until much later. It is important to remember when you do start to feel hiccups, they do not count as baby moving
10 weeks
At 10 weeks your baby can flex and turn his head and bring his hands up to his face. He is also developing finer facial movements like opening and closing his jaw.
11 weeks
By 11 weeks your baby can yawn in the wombbut dont take it personally!
12 weeks
The babys skeleton begins to develop into bone and although you still wont feel them yet your baby is developing more defined movements
14 weeks
At 14 weeks your baby can begin to move his eyes, although there wont be much to look at!
20 to 24 weeks
As the weeks go by, your babys activity will gradually increase. It is likely to be around this time that you first notice your babys movements. It may feel like flutters at first, also known as quickening. If this is your first baby it can sometimes feel like gas or indigestion. Over the next few weeks it is a good idea to make a note of your babys activity pattern, do they kick more in the morning or evening? Do they have spells when they do a lot on movements? This will help you determine if there is a change in your babys regular pattern of movement.
24 to 28 weeks
Around this time you may start to notice when your baby gets hiccups. These will feel like regular, rhythmic, jerky movements. These are an involuntary reflex and so do not count as movement. You may begin to notice that your baby responds to outside sounds and jumps at sudden loud noises. You may also notice your baby has a favourite band or sound!
Your baby may begin to follow a pattern for waking and sleeping. Very often this is a different pattern from yours, so when you go to bed at night, the baby may wake up and start kicking.
29 weeks
Your baby will begin to make smaller, more definite movements and the movements may begin to be more noticeable from the outside. This is a great time to get your partner involved as they can sit and calk to your bump and feel the baby kicking. It is a great bonding experience.
32 weeks
Your babies movements will gradually increase week by week until this time when they will plateau but NOT REDUCE. If you notice any reduction in your babys movements you should report it. The care you receive will depend on your stage of pregnancy. Your baby will not run out of room and should continue to move up to and during birth.
36 weeks
Your baby can take up his final, usually head-down, position. This is more likely to happen at this stage if this is your first baby. The firm muscles of your uterus and tummy will help to keep him in place. The main movements you are likely to feel now are jabs from his arms and legs, and possibly painful kicks to your ribs.
36 to 40 weeks
Your baby will be getting larger, and wont be rolling over as often. Instead, you may notice a persistent kick underneath your ribs on one side or the other. ALthough the type of movement will have changed, the frequency should not. You should continue to feel your baby as frequently as before and if you notice any change in your babys regular pattern of movement you should report it to your midwife or antenatal ward.

This is jelly wrestling, in case you wondered (Picture: SWNS)
Cambridge Universitys jelly wrestling event has been resurrected after more than 1,000 people signed a petition to get it back.
The competition, which sees women tackle each other in bikinis in a pool of jelly, was scrapped after protests by the unis Womens Group two years ago.
They branded it misogynistic and sexist.
Not all would agree, however, as it has returned to this years calendar by popular demand.
A spokesperson for theWyverns drinking society, which holds the event, said: Yes, jelly wrestling at the Wyverns Garden Party is set to make a return this year in a form never before seen in Cambridge.
More than 1,000 people signed a petition to get it back (Picture: SWNS)
This decision was not part of some cheap ruse to see women get down to their bikinis, rather it was prompted by a strange twist of fate, the birth of a legend, the discovery of a talent.
For this Summer Jelly wrestling shall be hauled from the dark depths of obscurity, no longer tarnished as an alleged clog in the machinations of the patriarchy but placed at the forefront of competitive British sport at Britains greatest summertime event.

First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence (Picture: PA)
About 1,000 people, including descendants of those who died, have attended a service to commemorate Britains worst rail disaster.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the Princess Royal were among those gathered at Rosebank Cemetery in Edinburgh to remember the people who perished in the Quintinshill crash, near Gretna on the border, 100 years ago.
The disaster claimed the lives of more than 200 soldiers, most of whom came from the Leith, Portobello and Musselburgh areas surrounding the Scottish capital.
Several of the relatives of those who died had travelled from overseas to attend the service at the place where many of the soldiers are now buried.

It was early in the morning of May 22 1915 when a train packed with First World War troops travelling from Larbert, Stirlingshire, collided with a local passenger service.
A Glasgow-bound express train then smashed into the wreckage at the Quintinshill signal box, setting off a devastating fire which engulfed the troop train, packed with nearly 500 members of the
Leith Battalion of the Royal Scots.

At least 214 soldiers of all ranks and 12 civilians were killed. Another 246 people were injured.
The troops were on their way to Liverpool, where they were due to sail to the frontline of the war in Gallipoli.

Royalty, politicians, military veterans and relatives of the victims also marked the anniversary with a special service in Gretna yesterday.

The tins,which everyone seems to have heaps of at Christmas, will have a reduced capacity of729g.
At the moment they weigh 753g, but four years ago they were much bigger, at 975g.
Its the fourth time theyve gone down in four years.

The first official results in Irelands gay marriage referendum have returned a majority of 57per centin favour.
With the Republic set to become the first country in the world to back the reform by popular vote, the figures from the constituencies of Waterford and Sligo North Leitrim led the way for the 43 electoral areas.
Official confirmation of the scale of the victory is not expected until late afternoon but estimates are pointing to a clear two to one majority in favour of extending the right to marry to same-sex couples.

Voters were asked one simple, specific question on whether to amend Article 41 of the 1937 Constitution by adding a new clause to a section titled The Family.
It asked them to support or reject a change to the 78-year-old document which reads: Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.

It does not suggest any change to the definition of the family or remove any outdated references in the section, including those that state a womans place is at home.
If passed, it would be the 34th amendment to the constitution but, regardless of the result, the campaign will rank with other hotly contested issues such as divorce and abortion.

Legal highs could be banned (Picture: PA)
An out-right ban on all legal highs has been called for by councils across the UK.
The psychoactive substances are linked to a growing number of deaths.
Earlier this week it was reported that five first year students at Lancaster University were in a critical state after smoking a cannabis substitute.
The Misuse of Drugs Act does not control legal highs, and while substances have been outlawed in the past  like mephedrone  they continue to reappear with altered chemicals.
Laughing gas has already been outlawed at a number of festivals this summer (Picture: REUTERS)

What are legal highs?
According to FRANK
Legal highs that are actually legal contain one or more chemical substances which produce similar effects to illegal drugs (like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy).
These new substances are not yet controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
There is often not enough research about them to know about their potency, adverse effects from human consumption, or when used with other substances or alcohol.
However, more and more legal highs are being researched to see what their dangers are and to see whether they should be made illegal.
In fact, many substances that have been found in substances sold as legal highs have already been made illegal.
Now the Local Government Association (LGA), which looks after more than 400 local authorities, has said that the current legislation was not fit for tackling theissue.
Ann Lucas, of LGA, said: Nobody can be sure of their contents or the effects that they could have.
At the moment, as soon as one is outlawed, another one with a slightly different chemical composition appears.
We cant allow this to continue.
Many legal highs are sold under brand names like Clockwork Orange, Bliss and Mary Jane.

Does it matter if the dolphin was alive or dead? (Picture: Facebook)
An image of a woman straddling a dolphin on a beach has re-emerged online and people are still angry about it.
Theyre so unhappy an online protest has been started, with the imagecaptioned: Keep reposting until we can ID these idiots who killed this poor dolphin.
Call the police if you know who these people are.
They are animal killers!! Lets ID them and send them to prison. Keep reposting.

But the picture, which was posted with other images showing the animal being roughly handled, may not actually tell the full story.
The dolphin may have actually been dead at the time, according to posts on reddit , where the series of four images were first uploaded in March 2014.
For a dolphin to just let someone pick it up like that is strange, a user wrote, according to Huffpost .
They are very strong so Im assuming it was nearly dead or already dead when the pictures were taken.
The pictures were apparently taken in Lima, Peru.

First Great Western has apologised (Picture: PA)
A rail firm has been forced to apologise after passengers on a delayed train were told someone couldnt be bothered to live anymore.
The insensitive announcement on the Plymouth-bound journey left many in shock on Friday.
It came after a man was killed by a train betweenSlough and Reading earlier in the day.
Esmee Phillips, 21, said passengers cringed when the announcement was made. She complained to First Great Western.
She said: It was shocking as it was said in a very callous and tasteless way, especially as you dont know what personal experiences other passengers have gone through.

Its pretty hard to sink a hole in one during a round of golf  but it was made slightly easier when four giant sink holes opened up at a golf course in America.
The four holes, the largest of which was 60 feet by 80 feet and 35 feet deep, opened up at the Top of the Rock Golf Course in Branson, Missouri.
Its believed that the cavernous gaps opened up after water circulated through bedrock below the ground, causing a gaping hole on the otherwise pristine fairways.
And while the holes will take a fortnight to fill in, the course could be plagued by similar openings in the future.
Oops! (Picture: Nate Papes/Springfield News-Leader via AP)
When quizzed about the possibility of the holes opening again, geology professor Doug Gouzie said: Thats the magic question.

        <Description>This is why it's best not to walk naked across a bridge if there's a risk of it being raised.</Description>
        <MainBody>Dave Burke for Metro.co.uk Saturday 23 May 2015 2:35 pm
Bad days dont get worse than this.
When youre walking naked across a bridge in broad daylight  ok, its a long stretch, but stick with it  the last thing you want is for it to suddenly raise.
Unfortunately it happened to this chap, and he had to climb to the top.
Its thought he had been swimming in the nude in Florida on Friday.

To compound his embarrassment, it looks like the world and his brother decided to film the thing happening.
Passer-by David Izabal told the Sun Sentinal: He was swimming in the water previously, and he jumped out of the water and went to cross the bridge.
The bridge was coming up before he had gotten off the bridge.
To make matters worse, firefighters didnt have ladders that were tall enough to get up there.

It meant members of the Broward Sheriffs Office had to climb up the bridge.
The man was wrapped in a towel, and put into a harness, before the bridge was lowered.
This poor fella is having a bad day (Pic: Local10)
So the lesson is, if you can avoid walking naked across a bridge that might raise, its probably best to do it.

The idea we might not be able to feed people in the next few decades sounds like a dystopian movie plot but it could actually become a reality.
Helen Browning, chief of the Soil Association, made the suggestion on Desert Island Discs and blamed humans for not treating soil correctly.
Weve already degraded about 40 per cent of our soils internationally, and thats happening here as well, she said.
If we dont take care of our soils, we wont be able to feed people in 50 years.
MORE: July will start ever so slightly later than normal, and heres why
Browning also criticised current foods for being inefficient and too reliant on cheap fossil fuels, the Independent reported .
Her solution was to carry out more organic farming, which is kinder to soil, although she admitted the expense could prove prohibitive.
She added: I can understand that people, when theyre squeezed financially, arent going to be thinking [the environment] is their highest priority.

Burkas and niqabs lookset to be banned in schools, hospitals and on public transport in the Netherlands.
This week a partial ban on full-face veils was proposed.
It also applies to ski-masks and helmets, but will not apply on public streets.
But the proposal, backed by the cabinet in The Hague, has been slammed by a far-right opponent.

A statement from the home affairs ministry said: In a free country like the Netherlands, everyone has the right to dress how they choose, no matter what others think.
That freedom is only limited in situations when it is essential for people to look at each other.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it had nothing to do with religion.
But Geert Wilders, a politician whose anti-Islamic policies have attracted voters, branded it weak.
People caught breaking the law could be fined up to405, if it is approved by the Dutch parliament.

But be warned  adding a second isnt something to be done lightly.

Amazon has reportedly prepared for it by creating its own time zone, as you do.
Its going to be falling out of sync with Universal Coordinated Time for 24 hours.
Clever.
And the stock markets are bracing themselves, just in case.

Its been done 25 times since leap seconds were first introduced in 1972.

A 65-year-old woman has given birth to quadruplets- meaning she now has 17 children.
Annegret Raunigk, a teacher from Berlin, Germany,gave birth to a girl, Neeta, and three boys  Dries, Bence and Fjonn  by caesarean section at a Berlin hospital on Tuesday.
Thefour newborns weighed between one lb, seven ounces and two lbs, two ounces each. The children were said to be healthy but were being moitored as they had been born prematurely at only 26 weeks.
Ms Raunigkwas dsaid to be doing well after the birth.

Ms Raunigk basically has no medical risk any more, Heike Speda told The Associated Press.
The mother waswidely criticised by medical professionals in the countryfor choosing to have more children at the age of 65.
Ms Raunigk already has 13 children ranging in age from nine to 44, from five fathers. She gave birth to her last child Leila aged 55.
She told Germanys Bild newspaper last month that she decided to become pregnant again because her nine-year-old daughter wanted a younger sibling. She also has seven grandchildren.
Ms Raunigk travelled abroad to have donated, fertilised eggs implanted  a procedure that is illegal in Germany.
Her decision prompted criticism from doctors, who questioned whether her body would be physically capable of bearing four children.
But Ms Raunigk defended her decision, telling Bild last month: They can see it how they want to and Ill see it the way I think is right.

Jennifer Smiths son received this note
A mother decided to fight back against sexism when her son was invited to a school pool party which forced girls to follow strict clothing regulations.
Jennifer Smith, from Indianapolis, US, was outraged when her son brought home a permission slip for the party, which stated: All girls must wear a non-white t-shirt over their swimsuit.
Speaking to the Huffington Post, Jennifer said she was enraged by the rule.
Being a feminist and seeing things through that filter, I was just kind of enraged by that, she said.
Theyre saying little girls need to be ashamed of their bodies and cover themselves up.
The pool party was a school treat to pupils for good behaviour
And while she doesnt have a daughter, Smith admitted that she wanted to set the right example for her son.
I have a little boy, Im teaching him to think correctly, and this is contrary to what Im teaching him, she admitted.
Defending the regulation, the Principal of Rhoades Elementary said that the dress code was enforced after girls previously wore inappropriate swimwear.
Due to the varying sizes of students at this age, [making T-shirts mandatory] takes away the ability of kiddos making fun of others for wearing a shirt [since] everyone is required to wear one, she wrote.

This is Scafell, a dog who was found wandering around lost and hungry on Britains highest mountain
The male collie cross was discovered by holidaymakers Briony Beckerley and Daniel Cope on the summit of 3,209ft high Scafell Pike in the Lake District National Park last Saturday.
The couple from Scotlandtook him to their home in Maybole, Ayrshire, after struggling to get help in England.

The dog, who has been given the nickname Scafell after the palce he was found, is between five and eight years old and is now being looked after at the Scottish SPCA animal rehoming centre in Glasgow.
Rehoming centre manager Anna ODonnell said: The couple who found Scafell saidhe was petrified and nervous and it took them around half an hour to coax him over to them.
They advised they did try and get help in England and had called the police, but they hadnt been able to assist.

So they took Scafell home because they were so worried about him and then called us.Unfortunately Scafell isnt microchipped so we have been unable to trace his owner.
We have also searched for information about dogs who have gone missing in the area with no luck.
At this stage its all a bit of a mystery but we believe Scafell may have been taken up the mountain by his owner and become lost.
There is also a chance he was abandoned and made his own way up to the top ofScafell Pike.
It would be fantastic if we are able to reunite him with his owner if he has gone missing.
If not we will find him a loving new home in Scotland.

It is believed to reference Akhmed Chatayev, also known as Akhmad al-Shishani, a Chechen militant in charge of the Yarmouk Battalion of ISIS.
Abu Sultan wrote: Amir [Leader] Akhmed al-Shishani told me about a young lad who went to Iraq for a suicide mission and he went there because in Sham [Syria] there is a veeeeery long queue [of several thousand people].
The would-be suicide bomber gave up after three months and returned to Syria, but said he would only be able to get a mission through a blat  a Russian phrase meaning connections  with Saudi leaders.
Abu Sultan stated that the boy had said: Those Saudis have got things sewn up, they wont let anyone in, they are letting their relatives go to the front of the line using blat.
He branded it corruption and made a direct appeal to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi  whose brother is among those to have carried out suicide bombings.

Click to enlarge: Sorry hipsters, the event isnt real (Picture: Facebook)
Thousands of people are attending this pointless, s*** spoof rooftop event.
A couple of brothers from Kent fed up with hipsters organising ridiculous sounding parties on Facebook have decided to hit back with their own satirical one.
Edmund and Mark Howard promised their series of shindigs would feature rooftop parties well over capacity, open air cinemas and slip and slides.
Edmund Howard, 24.
Mark Howard, 22.
If that wasnt enough there would also be multiple Djs playing in one night, most of which you may or may not have heard of, and flute recitals on a mad scale.
The Completely s*** and pointless events in London this summer (probably on a rooftop, somewhere) page was so popular more than 80,000 people said they were attending within a day ofit going live.
But it was all parody, so any hipsters waiting in anticipation can stick their tongues back into their mouths.
Having seen a ridiculous increase of random pages going viral on Facebook, we thought it was time to make an ironic one that poked fun at all the London events, Edmund Howard, 24, told Mail Online .
These events clearly only have capacity for about 100 people, yet 20,000 people are always registered to attend.

Ireland is on course to make history by becoming the first country in the world to introduce gay marriage by popular vote.
With counting of ballots only beginning at 9am, early patterns from count centres suggested that the campaign to extend the right to marry to same-sex couples will succeed.
A high voter turnout was recorded in all regions, particularly in urban areas, with a huge youth vote and returning emigrants heavily influencing the ballot.
A worldwide #hometovote campaign saw hundreds of Irish nationals travel back to their home country to cast their votes.

In Dublin the result was expected to be a landslide in favour of gay marriage while in many other parts of the country the constitutional amendment was expected to be passed by about two to one.
John Murray, director of the Iona Institute religious think-tank, one of the leading groups fighting the reform, accepted the result was going in favour of the reform.
Obviously Id be disappointed in that. We did our best to fight a good campaign and if having run that we havent won it, we did our best, he said.
Everyone is saying it is Yes and Im not going to argue with that.

An official result is expected some time in the afternoon but if tallies from the 27 count centres in 43 constituencies continue the same pattern seen in the first hour, campaigners will be calling it much earlier.

Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin told RTE Radio that he was confident the result would see the introduction of gay marriage.
I think it was a debate that captured the imagination and I had a strong sense that the Yes vote would win,he said. I think that will be borne out today.
Results from the constituencies will be fed back to the count headquarters in Dublin Castle, where about 2,000 people are expected to gather in the upper courtyard to mark the day.

It is only 22 years since Ireland decriminalised homosexuality.
Voters were asked one simple, specific question on whether to amend Article 41 of the 1937 Constitution by adding a new clause to a section titled The Family.
It asked them to support or reject a change to the 78-year-old document which reads: Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.
It does not suggest any change to the definition of the family or remove any outdated references in the section, including those that state a womans place is at home.
If passed, it would be the 34th amendment to the constitution but, regardless of the result, the campaign will rank with other hotly-contested issues such as divorce and abortion.
Other countries have held referendums on gay marriage, including Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia, where the extension of the right was not passed by the electorate.
In a separate referendum also being held today, voters are being asked their views on proposals to reduce the age limit on who can stand for the presidency from 35 to 21.

A woman has been found pushing her dead three-year-old son on a park swing.
The 24-year-old mother, who hasnt been identified, was reportedly seen pushing her dead son on the swing at Wills Memorial Park in La Plata, Maryland, on Friday morning.
Its believed that she may have been at the park all night, and the child didnt have any visible signs of trauma, police said.
In a press release, police explained that they arrived at the park after hearing reports of a woman pushing a young child in a swing for an unusually long time.

But when they arrived at the park shortly before 7am, they realised that the boy was dead and his mother was pushing him back and forth on the swing.
She has now been taken to hospital, while an autopsy is set to determine the cause of her sons death.
Diane Richardson, a spokeswoman with the Sheriffs Office, said: Its a very sad and tragic situation for the mother, her family, the officers.
Were working very hard on that.

This video shows the brilliant moment that one cab driver proved how ridiculous homophobia is, by pretending to be a heterophobe.
In the prank, which was filmed ahead of Irelands gay marriage referendum, a cab driver can be seen driving through the streets of Dublin, and repeatedly tells passengers about his unusual opposition to heterosexual couples.
Saddam Hussein and Hitler, whose kids were they?, he controversially remarks to support his argument.
(Picture: Facebook)
And at one point, he even admits I wouldnt even let them in the car, and that would be the end of it.
At the end of the clip, a sign simply reads all discrimination is ridiculous, hammering home the pranks important message.
The clever prank was the brainchild of cab app Hailo, who were providing voters with free trips to their polling station for yesterdays referendum.

KILL IT WITH FIRE.
Its a good thing someone has complained about that terrifying clown, because the rest of us were too afraid of looking like wimps.
Adverts for new film Poltergeist are on buses across the country and currently scaring thebejeezus out of all of us.
The Manchester mother, who has not been named, reported the posters after her two little girls were left traumatised by the blue-eyed clown on the side of a Stagecoach bus.
She: Its absolutely horrific. That image runs top to bottom on the bus.
Why would you authorise to have that on the side of the bus which runsthrough the day?
When the girls arrived home, one immediately started complaining of theclown.
ARGH! (Picture: MEN)
She said it was right in my window mummy, its a real evil man dressed upas an evil clown.
The Advertising Standards Agency confirmed her complaint was one of 19regarding the poster. Most of these were spotted on the side of a bus.
The spokesman added: They have said its offensive because itsinappropriate and scary for their children.
The general nature of thecomplaints has been about it being scary for children and the negativeeffect on them.
Were now assessing the complaints to establish whether or not there aregrounds for investigation. So, just to stress, we havent launched an
investigation at this stage.

The Honey Monster was probably annoyed with talk of a sugar tax (Picture: PA)
If youre someone who likes sweet foods, or prefers a proper Coke to the sugar free version, you might have got a shock today when you read about a proposed sugar tax.
But youll be happy to know the government doesnt actually plan to introduce the charge to companies that sell unhealthy food, and the plan was just life sciences minister George Freeman speaking out of turn.
The newly-appointed minister had sent shivers down the spines of those with a sweet tooth by saying increased taxation should be looked at for firms selling sugary products that lead to huge pressures on state services.
The cost would have probably been passed to the consumer.
But Number ten was quick to firmly rule out such a move, insisting other ways must be found to tackle the UKs obesity problems.
Asked if David Cameron was considering a sugar tax, the prime ministers official spokesman said: No.
He added: Working with public health professionals, the industry on public health matters, including obesity, that is an important agenda.

Display of tinned soup in a supermarket.(Alamy)
The French parliament passed a new law today which will ban supermarkets from destroying out-of-dated food.
The measure is meant to put an end to the epidemic of food waste, which is a problem in all of Europe.
In France, much like here, its common for supermarkets to put bleach on out-of-date food before throwing it away, so it cannot be taken by homeless and poor people.
The controversy, however, is over the fact that food past its best-before date generally remains edible for a certain period of time, and so do certain foods even past their sell-by dates.
Though a big step, this is only part of the problem, as French people themselves tend to waste 20-30kg of food a year each.

Despite the unhealthy eating she managed to keep her weight to around 10st and squeezed into the unusual outfit with Ian dressed as Willy Wonka and their dog an Oompa-Loompa.

The world-famous landmark was closed today (Picture:Getty Images)
The Eiffel Tower closed to the public for most of the day as workers protested over a rise in aggressive pickpockets around the Paris landmark.
The walkout came a day after city authorities announced that crime against tourists in the French capital had dropped this year thanks to reinforced police presence and video surveillance.
The tower did not open this morning because staff were concerned about petty crime around the site.
Clusters of tourists streamed beneath the tower, unable to reach its viewing platforms.
It remained closed while staff and management held meetings about security measures, then re-opened in the late afternoon, according to the company that manages the site.
 Marius (@MMNewzz) May 22, 2015
Tower employee Denis Vavassori of the CGT union said the workers want a permanent police presence.
He said: It is a growing problem. There were always pickpockets at the Eiffel Tower but now we are really facing an organised group.
Paris authorities said yesterday that violent theft was down 25 per cent and pickpocketing was down 23 per cent in the first four months of 2015, compared with the same period last year.

What is cramp?
Cramp is yourmuscles suddenly contracting
The shortening and tightening of muscles is what causes the pain
Cramp can last from a few seconds to ten minutes
Throughout that period you cannot control the affected muscle
They can occur for no apparent reason but have been linked to liver disease, exercise or certain medication

An aircraft engineer took his own life after he became obsessed with the idea that he was to blame for theAirAsia plane crash that killed 162 people, an inquest heard.
Gavin Price Jones, of Cheshire, died less than a month after successfully talking afriend out of suicide on the telephone on Christmas Eve.
His wife Louise told an inquest all attempts by family members andcolleagues to convince him otherwise had failed and the thoughts drove himmad.
Mrs Jones said the death of his father six-years-agoand the blame he shouldered for the AirAsia disaster on December 28 lastyear, sent her husband spiralling into depression.
Giving evidence at the inquest, held at West Cheshire Magistrates Court,she said: The AirAsia flight that came down just after Christmas was anAirbus A320, which is what he works on.
Mr Jones drew pictures to explain to his wife how he was responsible for the crash(Picture: AP Photo/Joshua Paul)
He thought he was to blame for that aircraft going down.These thoughts drove him mad. He was obsessed.
Mrs Jones said she had spoken to her husband about the issues and explainedhe would draw technical pictures to demonstrate how he was to blame for theair crash.
She arranged for the 37-year-old to speak to the head of quality and safetyat work, who attempted to reassure Mr Jones he was not at fault but to noavail.
Alan Moore, assistant coroner for Cheshire, concluded Mr Jones took his ownlife while the balance of his mind was disturbed.
Mr Moore said: For reasons only known to Gavin, he formed the belief hewas somehow involved in the disaster.
His employers and national media events would indicate this was completelyand utterly irrational. Gavin played no part in that disaster, but he musthave believed he did.

Youre looking at Britains first 1million council house (Picture: National News)
They say you should never judge a book by its cover  heres why.
Behind the harsh and uninviting exterior of this ex-council estate lies swanky new flats on the market for1million each.
And yeah, you guessed it, theflats are in theborough of Kensington and Chelsea in London.
Three floors above a Stella McCartney boutique, the modest homein Keppel House, a post-war block built for council tenants, is one of two adjacent properties developed by a former City lawyer aged just 36.
Annette Greenwood, 60, is the only council tenant left on the same floor as the luxury properties.
The kitchens pokey, but check out all that Taittinger in the fridge (Picture: National News)
She moved into the flat with son Jake, 36, in 1990.
She said: The houses in this area were built for a purpose, they were for the poorest people, the most vulnerable and the people who we all rely on but cant afford to buy property in central London like police officers and ambulance drivers.
Is this good value for money? Its hard to tell (Picture: National News)
Their homes have just turned into a way for people to make more and more money while ordinary people are forced out.
Something must be done to bring it under control or the community who dont drive flash cars or shop in Stella McCartney will disappear.
But it is right above a Stella M boutique (Picture: National News)

1. The Offspring  Conspiracy of One

2. Sum 41  All Killer No Filler
Sum 41, Canadian alt-rock band. Fronted by Deryk Whibley.
This has American Pie written all over it  All Killer No Filler was the official sound track to the cult-classic movie that follows the sexual awakening of teens as they go from one alcohol-fuelled party to the next.
Sadly ironic, then, that lead singer Deryck Whibley recently said from his hospital bed that one more drink would have killed him.

Nine students have been suspended (Picture: Getty)
A hospital has launched an investigation after medical students put a drink in a dead mans hand and partied with the corpse.
Nine students have been suspended following the bizarre celebration atHospital de Clinicas in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo.
An intern is believed to have spotted the cadaver in an A&amp;E corridor and moved it.
The body was found in a nearby toilet by the mans relatives  who raised the alarm.
Health director Jorge Quian said: When theres a mistake in medicine, theres never a single person responsible.
I think these youngsters committed a bad error but there are other people at blame here, the superiors who were supposed to be in charge of them and hospital bosses.

If your daughter loses her school bag and its nearly time to head out the door in the morning, what do you do?
If youre comedian Joe Heenan, you get an empty box of beer and fashion it into one of the greatest makeshift schoolbags youllever see.
By simply sticking some string through an empty box of Miller, hes managed to create a unique bag that wouldnt look out of place in a trendy east London market.

In the clip, its revealed that Germaine Yeap is actually a skilled Muay Thai fighter, as shes seen unleashing a furious combination of moves on a punch bag, and taking part in an intense training session.
But then she gets in the ring, and adopts the persona of a timid and shy individual who seems reluctant to trade blows with the unsuspecting gymtrainer.
SMACKDOWN! (Picture: MaxMan/YouTube)
And unfortunately forsaidtrainer, he only realises its all an act as they begin fightingand hes floored by a devastating kick to the head, all the while struggling to get a single punch in during their incredibly brief bout.
As the fight draws to a close, the demoralised and confused trainer looks embarrassed as Germaines true identity is finally revealed.

Theres a reason one of these bears is extremely dishevelled and the other is in pristine condition and it might be the most heart-warming thing youll read all day.
Posting the image on Reddit, the original poster wrote: When my brother was born in 1985, my mother purchased two identical teddy bears.
The one on the left has been my brothers for 30 years, the one on the right has been kept in storage for my brothers first child who was born today.
FREAKING ADORABLE, RIGHT?
Hopefully my new niece, Claire, will love him just as much, he added.
And as for why the bear looks somewhat battered, he explained: According to my mother its been on many vacations, gotten soaked in pool-water time and time again, and got lost on a theme park ride at Disney World.
It has certainly seen a lot.

Himmah  a not-for-profit Muslim organisation  andThe Nottingham Liberal Synagogue have opened a drop-in kitchen together.
The kitchen  called Salaam Shalom  will be running every Wednesday from 6pm until 8pm, and will serve food to homeless and poor people.

Nottingham for the most part has been quite sheltered but we felt that now is the right moment to give hope and demonstrate our communities values of compassion, dignity and care to others.
John Youens, a member of the Nottingham Liberal Synagogues steering committee, also made it clear that the soup kitchen wasnt only available to Jews or Muslims, but to anyone who needs it.

But the bigger news could be the questionable identity of theEast German Ladies swimming team, which turned up to have a swim in the 40 metre pondthis morning.
You may be wondering why most of them were men (so were we), but the explanation is actually quite simple, if not weird.
The group was named in honour ofthe all-female 1976 German swimming team because they were masculine, just like this group ofpaddlers.

The horror(Picture: Lemelson-MIT)
Do you fear getting an injection? How about swallowing this pill lined with tiny needles instead.
The Microneedle Pill (mPill) could replace injections in the future by releasing medicine directly into the blood stream.
Tiny needles are buried in a coating that dissolves once it reaches the gut.
The digestive tract of the body squeezes drugs out such as insulin.
The oral capsule allows the drugs to act much faster than they currently do, according to inventor CarlSchoellhammer.
His team atMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has now been awarded a 9,600 fund to develop the groundbreaking device.
It looks pretty big here (Picture:Lemelson-MIT)
How the mPill works
The capsule is 0.8 inches (2cm) long and 0.4 inches (1cm) wide
The microneedles are 0.2 inches (0.5cm) long and made of stainless steel
Coating hides the needles which is dissolved when it hits the gut
Drug is then squeezed out by digestive tract
Capsule is excreted with no side-effects
MrSchoellhammer says because there are no pain receptors in our gut the internal injection would not cause any pain.
The capsules were trialed on pigs and it took more than a week to pass through the cut.
However, researchers found no sign of tissue damage.

Nearly all of us know a Dave and one in five people would consider changing their name to Dave.
A poll of 2,000 people found that common traits among the D-men are laziness and an awful knack for playing poker.

 1 in 5 people would consider naming their child Dave
 1 in 5 people think the name Dave is sexier than Mike, Neil, Colin, Gary, Pete or Bill
 1 in 10 people would consider changing their name to Dave
 90% of the nation know at least one Dave and a third of the nation know 4 or more
 A Daves best attributes are his sense of humour, being good fun and kind

Ukip leader Nigel Farage after losing his Thanet South seat to Conservative Craig Mackinlay (Gareth Fuller/PA Wire)
Ukip has never exactly been the most liked party, but things are getting quite personal.
The founder of the party, Alan Sked, wrote a scathing letter to the Times today criticising Nigel Farage.
Sked, who left the party in 1997, complains of how it took Farage some time to control the party and ruin its reputation.
He also blames the leader for still having not become an MP, after 15 years of trying, and for having already lost one of his Tory defectors  Mark Reckless, who lost his seat on May 8.
The icing on the Eurosceptic cake, however, comes with the sign-off:
[Nigel Farage] is becoming the new Nick Griffin of British politics  a far-right failure.
OUCH.

Teacher is living in her car in an Asda carpark because she wont give up herdogs

Hillary Burrows, lives in her car in a carpark in Canterbury. (Picture: SWNS)
This is Hillary Barrows, and shes spent four months living in in her car in an Asda car park because she wont give up her beloved dogs.
The 57-year-old spent eight years working as an English teacher across Europe, but returned to Kent in January and started renting a private flat.
However, she failed to find a job and was offered emergency council accommodation when her money ran out  on the condition that she gave up beloved dogs Robbie and Cleo.
But she has resolutely refused to abandon the two animals she rescued on her travels, and now lives with Pharoah hound Robbie and Labrador Cleo in her 20-year-old Alfa Romeo, which is parked in an 24-hour Asda car park in Canterbury.
When I came back I had my own money and privately rented in Herne Bay, but ran out of money, Hillary explained.

I was offered emergency housing but the dogs were not allowed to come with me and I wont go anywhere without my dogs.
Hillary, a divorcee, has no family in England. Her 89-year-old mother lives in Canada and the rest of her family emigrated to New Zealand.
The only place I could stay was my 20-year-old Alfa Romeo, she said.
I decided to drive to Canterbury because the Salvation Army have really helped me and fed the dogs, and there is a public toilet nearby.
There is a 2 a time shower room that I use once a week.
The RSPCA have been out to visit the dogs twice and they have no problem living in the car.
She now relies on the generosity of Asda workers, who provide her with free hot water and leftover breakfast items from the supermarkets caf.
Hillary added: Theyre lovely. They give me hot water so I can make a soup.
Theres a 24-hour McDonalds here too, so I go there to charge my phone and laptop so I can continue to look for work.

She continued: I have been just been accepted to job seekers allowance and housing benefit, but I have been told I am not a priority for housing because I was out of the country so long.
Its a joke, I must be a priority.

The Liberal Party MP said: There is nothing at all recreational about this drug.
Let me tell you a story that demonstrates this  about a young boy taken into an emergency department for treatment who gouged out his own eyeballs and ate them.
We have to get these kinds of stories out to young people  this is not a recreational drug.
She said she had been told about the incident bya frontline emergency services officer who had witnessed the scene.
The Central Coast Ice Summit is organised by Australias The Express Advocate.
A spokesperson for the hospital could not give any more details on the incident.

Duke was a bit larger and scruffier than before but after this tearful embrace, there was no doubting he was the Rottweiler that dog trainer Joshua Edwards had lost eightyears ago.
Mr Edwards had been crushed when Duke vanished from his home in Shenandoah, Miami, in 2007.
After searching for the puppy for six months he gave up and came to terms with the fact hed never see the dog again. It turns out,he was wrong.
The two are together againafter Duke was found on a Miami street and then identified through a microchip, according to CBS Miami .
Duke and Joshua Edwards (Picture: YouTube/Miami Herald)
We are going to have a good time. He is going home. He is going to be pampered, said Mr Edwards after being reunited with his pet in an emotional video filmed at Tamiami Animal Hospital.
Mr Edwards became a dog trainer due to the impact of his loss, but despite this positive hed much rather have had nine-year-old Duke at home all these years.
I am glad to have my dog home. He is a part of my family, he added.
It is hard because not everybody understands but the people that do know exactly what I am talking about.

It turns out that Google isnt exactly at fault here  it just tried to rely on what people are saying online, whichwell, isnt the brightest idea.
Heres what the spokesperson said:our ranking systems are designed to return results that match a persons query. For Maps, this means using content about businesses and other public places from across the web.
The company has also apologised, and is working on a way to fix the problem.

Theyre all classic examples of quintessentially British swear words  and us Brits are the only nation that knows how to use them properly, delivered with a dry tone thats somewhere between extremely annoyed and mildly indifferent.
But theres hope for our transatlantic cousins yet, thanks to a new video that hopes to teach Americans how to swear like the best of Blighty.

Britains Got Talent studio and area around Wembley Stadium evacuated after unexploded WW2 bomb isfound
Amy Willis for Metro.co.uk Friday 22 May 2015 10:15 am
The unexploded Second World War bomb that has brought Wembley in north London to a standstill and caused hundreds of people to be evacuated temporarily from their homes and offices(Picture: PA)
The Britains Got Talent studio has beenevacuated after an unexploded 110lb bombwas discovered nearby.
Homes have been evacuated as the Army works to defuse a World War II bomb found at a building site near Wembley Stadium.
The 50kg explosive, which is believed to have been dropped over London during Nazi bombing raids in the the early 1940s, was discovered by construction workers.
(Picture: PA)
The Army has warned of a genuine risk to life as homes and businesses were evacuated outside a 400m police cordon.
They are now working to defuse the bomb.
An Army spokesman said: This bomb is a live munition in a potentially dangerous condition so its important that people listen to the police and evacuate their homes if asked.
(Picture: PA)
We will do all we can to minimise the disruption but ask the public to bear with us  any bomb, even under a controlled explosion could cause significant damage to property and there is a genuine risk to life.
Royal Logistic Corps disposal teams from Northolt and Ashchurch have excavated the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch general purpose bomb and Royal Engineers have built a blast wall around the site in order to limit an accidental explosion.
The team is very well experienced. Theyve dealt with Improvised Explosive Devices in Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland which are much more complex than Second World War munitions, the Army spokesman added.
(Picture: PA)
The Evening Standard said residents in two housing had been evacuated, along with Fountain Studios, where the ITV talent show is filmed.
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: The device was discovered by builders working at the location.
Officers are at the scene and a 400m cordon has been implemented around the site whilst work is under way to make the device safe.
A number of residential and business addresses have been evacuated as a precaution.
(Picture: PA)
He said the number of evacuees was relatively small.
In March, a 550lb (250kg) bomb was found in Bermondsey, south-east London, before being taken to Kent to be destroyed once it had been defused
German bombs from the Second World War uniquely have their fuses on the side, rather than in the tail or nose, where fuses are located on more modern devices.

Women are finding it increasingly difficult to make time for boyfriends, and are instead seeking thrills from male gigolos, according to new research.
Researchers at Lancaster and Manchester Metropolitan Universities interviewed a range of male, transgender and female prostitutes  who revealed that their female clients often preferred paying for sex over an actual relationship.
And while women of all ages are reportedly paying for sex, theres a proportionately higher amount of women in their thirties and forties desiring a booty call.
Perhaps surprisingly, the study also found that theres 28, 614 female escort profiles online, compared to just 15, 372 male profiles.
Sarah Kingston, a Criminology lecturer at Lancaster University, explained: Our participants say that most of the women who buy sex are professional people, some of whom simply want pleasurable sexual experiences.
MORE: Britains net migration is now at record levels
Paying an escort is described as a way of ensuring discretion as opposed to other ways of securing sexual encounters. Some female clients also seem to not want or have the time for a conventional relationship.
But it isnt just solo professionals that seek male escorts, with some admitting that their services are often required by couples who desire a relationship treat.
It is also evidence that women purchase sexual services as part of a couple, Dr Kingston explained.
The majority of the escorts interviewed see couples, stating they are booked for regular excitement or simply for a relationship treat.

Baby deported after Slovakian-born mother decided to stay in UK  but didnt want to raisehim
Harry Readhead for Metro.co.uk Friday 22 May 2015 9:42 am
Benjamin was sent back to Bratislava with two social workers (Picture: )
A six-month-old baby was deported after his Slovakian-born mother decided she wanted to stay in the UK  but no longer wanted to raise him.
The mother of baby Benjaminwas born in Slovakia but settled in England. However, babies born to parents from the European Economic Area can only receive British citizenship if at least one parent has lived in the UK continuously for five years prior.
So when Benjamins mother decided she no longer wanted to raise her son  who was born in Liverpool the teething six-month-old was forced to endure a tearful two-and-a-half hour flight back to Bratislava, accompanied by two social workers.
I hope that his life in his homeland will be good and he will be happy, said the Slovak social worker who greeted Benjamin at the airport.

Benjamin was taken to a childrens home and then given to a surrogate family, who will look after him until he is adopted.
Judges and social workers in the UK have been told they must be more sensitive to the rights of other European countries regarding child welfare and must not take control of the lives of foreign children.
Andrea Cisarova of the Slovak Centre for International Legal Protection of Children and Youth, told MailOnline : The British informed us that the baby is legally our responsibility.
The baby is small but they decided to give it back to its homeland.

The man lost his holdall on a bus (not pictured) in Scarborough (Picture: Getty Images)
A cheating husband begged a bus company for help after he left a bag containing his sex tape with his mistress on a number 17.
The man was carrying a video of his steamysessions with his lover in a holdall, but forgot to pick it up when he got off at his stop in Scarborough, Yorkshire.
He desperately rang the lost property section of East Yorkshire Motor Services, confessing the affair and begging for help in recovering the bag.
He admitted that he was married and his wife was not in the movie but his girlfriend was, depot manager Chris Agar told the Sun.
He was more concerned about the fact his wife would find out.
All we can assume is that someone on the bus decided to walk off with the holdall and got more than they bargained for.

        <MainBody>Amy Willis for Metro.co.uk Friday 22 May 2015 8:13 am
David Cameron insisted yesterday he was still determined to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands despite official figures showing the number had soared to record levels.
Long-term migration was estimated to be 318,000 last year and the prime minister acknowledged the numbers showed how far we have to go to reach our goal.
Foreign criminals, who face being kicked out of the country, will also be tagged and tracked by GPS satellites, and deport first, appeal later will apply to all non-asylum cases.
Mr Cameron, who announced the new laws in a speech at the Home Office, said: While a strong country isnt one that pulls up the drawbridge, it is one that properly controls immigration. Its disappointing that we havent made more progress but I take these figures as a clear instruction to deliver and to deliver faster.
The prime minister continued: Why is it right? Because if you have uncontrolled immigration you have uncontrolled pressure on public services.
Uncontrolled immigration can damage our labour market and push down wages. People are fed up with a system that allows those who are not meant to be in our country to remain here.
The data, from the Office for National Statistics, shows Mr Cameron has a long way to go, with 641,000 immigrants entering the UK last year  a rise of more than 100,000 over 2013.
The net migration figure  the number of people entering the country minus the number leaving  is the highest for a calendar year since current records began in 1975.

        <MainBody>The small boat on the left was used to catch a large 400lbs porbeagle shark (picture: bnps)
Afterwards skipper Jerry Rogers calculated the shark would have weighed around 400lbs, measuring its length and girth.
This makes it one of the largest sharks to have ever been caught in British waters.
Mr Nelson said: I had caught a 300lbs shark the day before and I was over the moon with that one.
But it felt like I had hooked into a submarine in comparison when I caught the bigger one the next day.
It took me an hour-and-a-half to get it to the boat. It had so much power and aggression. My arms were aching a lot afterwards and had pins and needles.
Okay, so this particular shark species tends to stick to killing mackerel, seals and once bit someones foot and put a hole in their boat  but be a little careful in the water this bank holiday weekend.
Porbeagle sharks
Porbeagle sharks, which are considered endangered as there are only a few hundred off the coast of Britain, look very similar to great white sharks.
They have not been known to attack humans and one senior fish curator called Oliver Crimmen at the Natural History Museum insists: It is not a danger to us.
They normally just eat mackerel.
Hmmm.

Once inside, the thieves ransacked 72 safety deposit boxes, taking millions of pounds worth of goods.
After facing criticism for the way the incident was handled, the Met Police apologised for deeming that a call from a security firm about an intruder alert shortly after midnight on Good Friday did not require a response.
Detectives from the Flying Squad issued the apology after confirming that alarm response procedures had not been followed, but rejected the suggestion that they were bungling Keystone Cops.
Commander Peter Spindler said: On this occasion, the systems and processes that we have in place with the alarm companies werent followed and, as a result of that, officers did not attend the premises when, in fact, they probably should have done and for that I want to apologise.
A more detailed investigation into the defeat of the alarm system is continuing and Scotland Yard says it will share any lessons learnt.
A ninth man has been bailed pending further inquiries.

A mock up of Bensons shirt (Picture: Metro Picture Desk)
A shoplifter nearly committed the perfect crime recently  the only hiccup being that he had his name written on the back of his shirt.
Paul Robert Benson, 24, was caught on CCTV stealing 104.54 worth of produce from a Tesco supermarket in Belfast.
Unfortunately Paul clearly forgot he was wearing a Manchester United shirt with Benson 22 printed on the back of it.
He made a quick getaway after realising he had been spotted by staff, however when police reviewed the CCTV footage they realised Benson had given them the best clue they could ask for.

Even more terrifyingly the mass melting shows no signs of stopping any time soon.
Dr Wouters who worked on the study said: The fact that so many glaciers in such a large region suddenly started to lose ice came as a surprise to us.
It shows a very fast response of the ice sheet: in just a few years the dynamic regime completely shifted.
The team believe climate change which has led to changes in wind direction has in turn meant the temperature of severaloceans has increased, causing the ice shelves to melt at such a rate.

Wentworth Woodhouse, the UKs largest private home (Picture: SWNS)
If you fancy buying the UKs largest private home, which is so big that no-one knows how many rooms it has, it will cost you8million.
Wentworth Woodhouse, which is five miles north of Rotherham, is twice as wide as Buckingham Palace and is 150 times the size of the average British home.
The 606-foot wide South Yorkshire mansion, formerly owned by the aristocrat who inspired Jane Austens Mr Darcy, has five miles of corridors.
It is 150 times the size of the average British pad (Picture: SWNS)
It will cost you 8million (Picture: SWNS)
It has a floor space of 124,000 sq/ft and an estimated 350 rooms but is so big no-one knows the exact number.
The 18th Century super-mansion has now been put up for sale with Savills for 8 million  the same as one-bedroom flat in One Hyde Park.
But whoever buys Wentworth Woodhouse will have to spend millions restoring a large part of it which is currently uninhabitable.
It has a great (and large) garden (Picture: SWNS)
These are the plans of the house (Picture: SWNS)
The home is being sold after its owner architect Clifford Newbold died last month.
Ive not sold a bigger house and I am not sure there is one, said Crispin Holborow, director of Savills Country department
You cant look in every room, but once you have seen a few rooms you have seen enough.

ISs seizureof the town of Palmyra yesterday came after it captured the strategic city of Ramadi in Iraqs largest Sunni province.
It has raised concerns the extremists may destroy some of the priceless ruins in the countryas they have done in neighbouring Iraq.

He was able to get to his feet and stagger towards a block of flats where he lived and raise the alarm on October 15 last year.
Ryan Duggan has been convicted of attempted murder (Picture: Cavendish)
Ryan Duggan, 19, of Widnes, has beenconvicted of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life following a three day trial at Chester Crown Court.
He will be sentenced in July.

Detective inspector Gary McIntyre, of Cheshire Police, said: Duggans actions that night were extreme and shocking  the victim went outside to speak to the group about the fact they had turned off the water supply resulting in the defendant shooting him with a powerful weapon.
Fortunately, the victims mobile phone took the brunt of the shot and, as a result of this, he survived.
This is remarkable  had that phone not been in his pocket at that time he would undoubtedly have died.

Earlier this week Frances Crook of The Howard League for Penal Reform wrote for us calling for the G4S-run Rainsbrook secure training centre to be closed down immediately following a highly critical Ofsted report. Paul Cook, Director of Children Services for G4S, here defends the companys record at Rainsbrook.
The Ofsted report published yesterday into our Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre makes extremely disappointing reading for me and the G4S team of dedicated and professional social workers, teachers, psychologists and care staff that work at the centre.
MORE: No child is safe in G4Ss Rainsbrook Detention Centre. It should be closed immediately
This the first time in 16 years under our management that the centre has been rated anything other than good or outstanding by inspectors. The isolated incidents highlighted in the report were the subject of swift action as they occurred, resulting in the dismissal of six members of staff over the 14 month period prior to the inspection. We work closely with the independent Youth Justice Board, which has monitors on-site throughout the year, and any example of staff failing to meet the high standards we expect of them are investigated and if necessary subject to an independent review. The charity Barnardos is also commissioned by the Youth Justice Board to work with the young people at Rainsbrook, adding to the level of oversight and governance.
Rainsbrook is one of three Secure Training Centres we run in the UK, providing secure accommodation, training and education to some of the most challenging children in the country. The centres we run at Medway in Rochester and Oakhill in Milton Keynes are both rated good by Ofsted and I am encouraged that the Youth Justice Board yesterday expressed its support for the actions we have taken to put Rainsbrook back on track. Ofsted did acknowledge the excellent work the team at Rainsbrook achieves on education, and some 264 exams will be taken this year at the centre by young people who in many cases have never engaged in the education system before.
A young offender in her room at Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre. (Picture: PA)
The UK juvenile secure estate has undergone significant changes in the last 16 years. In 1999 some 3,500 children were detained against 900 today. Consequently a number of secure facilities have closed and the configuration of the three remaining secure training centres has changed. The inspectors recognised the good work our team at Rainsbrook have done to respond to these changes, particularly in keeping young people safe with histories of self-harm. These young people present a complex challenge and some of the statistics highlighted by the Ofsted report, reflect the need to protect some young people from not only harming others but also harming themselves.
As a qualified social worker who has worked with children for over thirty years, the families of those young people in Rainsbrook should be assured that we have already taken swift action to review our processes and where necessary change our management team. I am confident therefore that when inspectors revisit the centre, they will see a team determined to deliver an outstanding service to young people once again.

It might make you no better than your cave-dwelling ancestors, but urinatingin the garden could actually benefit your flowers.
Well not really in the garden, because it only works on cut plants.
Experts have found a solution made from aspirin and urea (achemical found in human urine) made cut plants last twice as long when they were left in it.
The study was conducted ongerbera jamesonii, also known as the African Daisy, which is one of the most widely grown commercial flower crops.
The flowers vase life improved drastically when introduced to the strange concoction.

Please dont go thinking this gives you permission to urinate in your friends garden during a BBQ.
The acids in urea are harmful to plants on their own due to their ability to boost harmful enzyme activity in the stems (this is why dog owners tend to have patches of dead grass all over their gardens).
Luckily both compounds are readily available, so that cheap bouquet of flowers you got your mum for her birthday may be able to stand as a symbolof her disappointment inyou for even longer!

Helen Butchart underwent a 22-hour operation on the tumour, which wasdiagnosed after dental treatment failed to cure a swelling on the rightside of her face.
The cancer was so aggressive that surgeons at the Southern General hospitalin Glasgow were forced to make Helen a new cheekbone and palate using bonefrom her shoulder blade, as well as removing her right eye.
Yesterday, the 54-year old, from Lochgelly, Fife, released pictures of herface taken in the days and weeks after the surgery.
She wants to raise money for the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Endowmentsfund which raises cash to pay for extra equipment, research, training andpatient comfort.

Car jackings usually end with someone steeling a car, but in this case the thiefs legs probably arent long enough to drive because hes a baboon.
And rather than keys or money he was looking for some grub, which his terrified victims dutifully handed over.
The hilarious scene took place in South Africa, and the beautiful injection of irony is that the driver, John, had only stopped to get a look at the baboons in the area.
Sadly he wasnt as fast as those furry little hands and quickly lost his dinner.
At the time of writing no charges have been brought against the primate.

Stupid pheasant(Picture: Metro)
A pheasant with an unquenchable thirst for speed is causing havoc at Alton Towers.
Workers at the theme park have been forced to close a ride twice because the annoying thing was on the tracks trying to ride the roller coaster (probably).
People queuing for Rita werent happy. They tweeted about it, naturally:
At @altontowers and Rita breaks down twice whilst in the queue.

The next time Sky takes ages to cancel your subscription make sure you write down any costs incurred as the companys just paid a man 1,500after wasting his time.
The story ofPete Swift should put a smile on the face of anyone whos had difficulty when trying to cancel a contract before.
The 30-year-old had faced several months of frustrationwith debt collectors after Skyfailed to cancel his TV and broadband account when he moved to Leith, Edinburgh, in 2012.
After nearly 18 months of being threatened by bailiffs Pete decided to take legal action, which led to Sky admitting its failings and paying up the sum last month.
The customer service I experienced was abysmal, there was just a complete disregard for the situation they had put me in and a continued failure to take ownership and fix the problem, research consultant Mr Swift said.

If youre having a similar problem make sure you tot up the time you have wasted and how much it has cost you, just like Mr Swift.
Aftercounting up the hours he had spent speaking to those involved via phone and email, as well as meetings with lawyers, he came up with a total of1,395, plus court costs of around 72.
Sky eventually paidhim 1,500 and it only took them two-and-a-half years to do it.

Quinton Wright, a maths teacher at Champion Theme Middle School in Dehald County, Georgia, has been charged with four counts ofcontributing to the delinquency of a minor.
Local news outlet Wsbtv2 spoke to one mother who revealed shocking texts she claims were sentbetween her son and Mr Wright.
One of the texts from Wright to the boy appeared to read: I aint got no condoms. Yall cant be long.

Charles Abbott informed the court the owls name was Solomon (Picture: Aspen Police)
We think its fair to assume one man wasnt taking his trial very seriously when he announced that his stuffed owl would be acting as his lawyer.
Aspen, Colorado, man Charles Abbott was in court accused of violating a protection order involving his former roommate, Michael Stranahan. Abbott was alleged to have entered Mr Stranahans room while he was out of town and retrieved some belongings.
Taking his seat in court on Tuesday, Abbott sat a fuzzy horned owl on the defence table with him, telling the court its name was Solomon and it would be representing him in court, the Aspen Times reports.

Incredibly, Pitkin County Court Judge Erin Fernandez-Ely ignored the owl, instead asking the victim if he would be willing to amend the protection order to allow mediation.
He wasnt.
The hearing ended with the protection order remaining as it was. Abbott was told he may attend the same church as Mr Stranahan as long as he doesnt have contact with him.

He may have once been the worlds most wanted man, but that didnt stop Osama bin Laden from enjoying a bit of porn.
The Department of National Intelligence said that as well as letters and books, the terror leader had a massive stash of X-rated movies.
But officials have refusedto say whatthe porn was because of the nature of the content.
News agency Reuters reported two weeks after bin Laden had been killed that porn had been found in his compound, including many videos.

A teenage girl seenabusing and punching a boy in avideo that went viral has beensentenced to eight months in a young offenders institution.
Thetwo-minute video, which has been viewed more than 2.7million times on Facebook, shows a girl with blonde pigtails and in school uniform grabbing a much larger boy by his sweatshirt and hurling abuse at him before punching him in the face.
The girl, 14, admitted assault today at Croydon Youth Court. She wept and hugged her parents as she was sentenced to eight months for breaching a youth rehabilitation order imposed on 8 March for grievous bodily harm and witness intimidation, plus four months for the assault.
This was an extremely unpleasant assault on a vulnerable 14-year-old who did not seek to respond in any way, said magistrate Ken Ashken.

In these circumstances, despite your young age and the undoubtedly good sides that you have within you, we consider that the offence is so serious, in regards to your previous offending, that a custodial sentence is justifiable.
In the footage, she can be heard asking the boy, Are you gonna get your cousin? before saying, Your cousin cant do dirt on me  you understand?

A planned rail strike over the Bank Holiday which would have crippled services and led to widespread travel chaos has been called off after Network Rail tabled a new pay offer.
Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union and Transport Salaried Staffs Association were due to walk out for 24 hours from 5pm on Monday after rejecting a proposed four-year pay deal.
The unions announced that the action was being suspended following the new offer, made during four days of talks at the conciliation service Acas.
Rail companies had already started cancelling services next week and warned passengers not to travel.
(Picture: PA)

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: Following the Acas talks, RMT has received a revised offer that enables us to suspend the planned industrial action while we consult in full with our Network Rail representatives.
Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA, said: Our negotiating team at Acas has received a revised offer from Network Rail.
As a result of this, they have suspended the planned industrial action, pending the outcome of a meeting of our workplace representatives next week.
Lawyers for Network Rail halted plans to take legal action against the TSSA in the light of developments.
Bruce Carr QC, for Network Rail, told a judge at a High Court hearing in London that Network Rail was not proceeding with an application for an injunction.
He told Mr Justice Jay: There has been progress.

Dont you just hate it when youve caught a fish and a ghost photobombs the picture you take with it?
No? Well in any case, thats what happened to fisherman Wayne Foulkes, who reeled in a 16lb carp at Ponciau Pool in Wrexham, Wales, only for a sinister apparition to hijack the photo of the fish.
Mr Foulkes saidhe had been fishing all day on 9 May, when he finally landedthe huge carp.
Unfortunately, thephoto taken by his friends afterwards wasnt remarkable for the size of the fish, but for the ghostly orange face behind it.
Ponciau councillor Paul Pemberton wasnt so surprised when he sawthe picture, however. He insists the pool has a grim past.

If youre planning to get lashed in Germany this summer mimes will make you feel guilty.
Authorities in Berlin are hiring the silent actors to tell tales of how drinking too much can have serious consequences.
The strange tactic is in response to a growing number of anti-social problems including noise and littering  largely down to tourists.
Mimes will be rolled out over 15 weekends in the district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.
Lutz Leichsenring, from a group representing the citys bar and club owners, said: We dont want to give people orders.

Geoff Marshall, of Londonist.com , said
Crikey, well you can only add so much Orange cant you? 28 new stations (taken over previous rail lines) have now become part of the Overground brand, lines out of Liverpool Street to Cheshunt, Chingford and Enfield. The Emerson Park line is now an Overground service too.
TfL has taken over the running of Shenfield to Liverpool Street  that will eventually become Crossrail  run by a company called MTR but branded as TfL Rail, it gives us another station in Zone 9 on the map (previously just Chesham and Amersham), and another Special Fares Apply station (previously just Watford Junction).
Theres a blob connector between Wanstead Park and Forest gate: TfL are keen to promote connectivity between their two new lines.
Theres TWO Bethnal Green stations now: one Overground, one Central.
But most intriguing off all, that second kink in the Central Line at Lancaster Gate/Marble Archisthere to allow Crossrail to be added to the map in the future between Bond Street and Paddington, without the angle being too severe!

A father and son are to become a married couple after a 50-year relationship.
But before you start to worry about some weird incest thing, they arent actually biologically related.
In fact, Bill Novak and Norman MacArthur used a technicality to gainthe rights they wanted when they moved to a part of the U.S. that didnt recognise same-sex partnerships.
They registered as domestic partners in New York in 1994 before moving to Pennsylvania.
Norman told Patch :We were told at that time hell would freeze over before Pennsylvania approves same sex marriage.
MORE: Dying woman marries her girlfriend in dream ceremony, thanks to kindness of strangers
And so Novak adopted MacArthur in 2000.
It turns out that it must be quite cold in hell right now because Pennsylvania has had to allow same-sex marriage.
So they broke offthe adoption, a practice that hadbeen used by many same-sex couples in the state for some time, and this summerthey will officially get married.
Normanadded: We are ecstatic beyond relief. I feel an enormous sense of not only relief but freedom that we can finally do something in Pennsylvania that Ive been dreaming of for years.

Home brewing enthusiasts could soon be making morphinealongside their alcohol.
Making beer in your basement is one thing but being able to manufacture a drug there also may give the authorities sleepless nights.
But thats a distinct possibility in the future after scientists engineered brewers yeast to synthesize opioids such as codeine and morphine from a common sugar, for the very first time.
As heroin belongs to the opiate group of drugs it would be possible to make this also, according to the report published in Nature Chemical Biology .

It is going to be possible to home-brew opiates in the near future, Christopher Voight of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the research, told reporters.
Some experts have called for the new tech to be regulated before things get out of control.
But if you havent got nefarious motives in mind then the new method could prove usefulfor those suffering from severe pain.
Brewed morphine used for pain relief would be easier to acquirethan the regular version, which is grown in opium poppy farms.

Neil Abbott leaving court today (Picture: Tony Palmer)
A woman has been left with a 10,000 cosmetic bill after a drunken wedding guest accidentally punched her in the face.
Grooms guest Neil Abbott, 41, had been drinking vodka during the reception at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington High Street, London, when he confronted a man on the dance floor, a court heard.
He swung at him but missed and smashed his wife Christina Mina instead.
Isleworth Crown Court Judge Simon Davis said: That was an almighty punch, and I have seen some over thirty-five years, and from a man that is heavily built and this poor woman has suffered the most dreadful, dreadful injuries.
This poor innocent lady was not expecting to be hit. You have played rugby in the past and you are a powerful man, one can see that, you do some physical work and that was meted out to this woman.

Hepleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm during the incident on May 24 last year and was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, suspended for two years.
He must also compensate Mrs Mina 9,798  money she has already spent on advanced dentistry and cosmetic surgery to rebuild her nose, which was flattened by the blow  as well as 950 costs.
Prosecutor Mr. Tom Rodgers told the court: Mr Abbott goes to punch Mrs Minas husband and connects with one forceful punch on her.
She has had reconstructive surgery and will have follow-up surgery. There will be cartilage taken from her to fix a fault with her nose, which had a detached septum and enlarged nostrils.

Mrs Mina has delayed having children because of this, but will resume once she has recovered.
Abbotts lawyer, Richard Paton-Philip, said: He was too intoxicated to be interviewed by police on the day, but the next morning showed remorse when shown the CCTV.
There is nothing to suggest he is anything other than a good, decent man who acted out of character when he drunkenly threw this punch aimed at someone else.

There are many fundraising pages for lots ofworthwhile causes with many pulling at your heart strings.
This gofundme page, however, made the bold decision to go funny and boy does it work.
The goal is to buy a road-worthy car for Angie, a cash-strapped working mother of three (all without her knowledge).

The mastermind behind the page, her cousin Anna Lowe, discussedAngies crappy car, describingitas reliable as a pensioners erection.
She alsodecided to reference the size of Angies bottom stating that she has an arse to rival any Kardashian.
Anna also jokinglydeclaring that the Wokingham motheristhe love child of Yosemite Sam due to her shocking red hair.

Shewrote on the page: Ange is a fun loving girl who actually has no idea that I have set up this page. But her life has been one long series of misfortunate events, so please dont take offence to the light hearted way I tell her story.
This is my cousin Ange, shes vertically challenged, cuddly and well rounded in stature with an arse to rival any Kardashian. Luckily, you will never have the misfortune of seeing her naked in a pair of G-Strings rolling about on the beach collecting sand and sea weed up her bum crack for cash.

But lately things have been so bad for her financially that I was shocked when I saw she had sold her hair to make Rihannas coat. She is actually so poor that instead of make-up she sticks her head up the chimney and blinks.
While there are currently no donations, surely people will offer to help the mother-of-three replace the car that even the scrapyard have refused to dispose of due to the sheer amount of duct tape.

Great news: May Bank Holiday isnt going to be a total wash-out.
Youll want to make the most of Saturday whensunshine is due to dominate.
Temperatures will remain in the high teens and perhaps creep even higher in the south.
Its a similar story for the start of Sunday. But thick cloud and outbreaks of rain are expected further northwest.
Throughout the day this will spread to Wales then into the south.
Then Monday is looking like a mixture of sunshine and a few showers.
Sunny spells to dominate the Bank Holiday (Picture: PA)
The south west is likely to have the best Bank Holiday weather.
A spokesperson for the Met Office said: Although the weather will be somewhat mixed over the Bank Holiday weekend, most of us will see spells of dry weather with some sunshine and temperatures around average for the time of year.
Saturday looks like being the driest, brightest day for many due to a ridge of high pressure. However, weak frontal systems coming down from the northwest will bring some cloud and patchy rain at times on Saturday night into Sunday.
Things look set to become somewhat cooler and brighter again later in the weekend.

MissYoung, whos been at the church for five years, was also keen to talk about the stigma often attached to people with HIV and hoped her revelation would help reduce it.

There is a stigma attached and, thankfully, the church has shown itself to be an inclusive community.
Shecan be confident her 80 parishioners will treat her the same, with church member Alan Griffiths saying: Rev Hayley is surely the most extraordinary, courageous person it has been my privilege to know.

Neil Hanby sprang into action when he found a thief raiding the cellar of hisCostcutter store in Boston Spa, Yorkshire.
CCTV footage shows Mr Hanby raining down blows with achampagne bottle onto the attempted burglar, who he said was a big lad who saidhe had a gun.

James Bruff died after worrying about finance (Picture: INS)
A firefighter and father-of-two was found hanged after he and hisfiance rowed about how they would be able to afford Christmas presents.
James Bruff, 29, had two jobs to try and make ends meet but ended up short of cash after losing a days wages because of strike action, an inquest was told yesterday.
A coroner in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, heard thatdespite being a crew manager for London Fire Brigade and a delivery driver for Tesco, James couldnt support his family.
GirlfriendHayley Payne said: I had come back from work that morning and James was there with our youngest. We were deciding what to do with the day and then we discussed giving the other side of our family Christmas presents, because we had already done his side of the familys presents.
Jamess sister, Natalie, is running a marathon for Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide. Click here to donate.
He was concerned about making sure payments went out before we did this, like bills and the mortgage, and that escalated from something that was very small into a larger row.
It then ended with him getting very upset which wasnt unusual, because James was the kind of person that would never shout, hed never take his anger out on anybody else, hed take it out on himself.
A coroner heard how the decorated fireman died on November 28 last year, less than five months before the April 13 date when he was due to marry his sweetheart.
When his father, himself a retired firefighter, cleared out his sons work locker he found a t-shirt with one of the young boys handprints on and ultrasound scans of his two young sons.
Recording a verdict of suicide, Senior Coroner for Hertfordshire, Edward Thomas, said: You can see he was a devoted dad. I am satisfied he took his own life in a moment of despair  thats all it was after an awful row.
It is in that moment of despair possibly thinking that everything is finished, that that was what happened. My guess is that if he had waited until you had come back this would not have happened, but we will never know.

        <Description>Compulsory military service in the UK is a bad idea, argues David Sanders, an officer in an Infantry regiment.</Description>
        <MainBody>David Sanders for Metro.co.uk Thursday 21 May 2015 11:49 am
Prince Harry is leaving the army after 10 years of service.Ben Stansall/PA Wire
Prince Harry recently called for compulsory military service to be reinstated in the UK. Its a bad idea, argues DavidSanders, who has spent10 years as an officer in an Infantry regiment, completing operational tours of Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan.
I can see why National Service might seem like an attractive proposition. For the conscript is represents an opportunity to develop skills and boost that CV. For most of the British public (according to one recent poll ), National Service appears to bean easy fix to sort out our troubled, binge drinking, ASBO-bearing youth.
MORE: Prince Harry calls for National Service to be brought back
But things are rarely that simple. It costs 34,000 to train an Infantryman. Turning even half the 750,000 people who turn 18 every year into useful soldiers represents a serious strain on George Osbournes already tight purse strings.
Its a big assumption that you would gain useful soldiers at the end of this expensive process. A serviceman/womans education starts when they finish their training. In my experience a new soldier is felt to be on probation for at least their first year in Battalion.
For these and many more reasons it makes no military or financial sense to reintroduce conscription.
British Army personnel patrolling the Olympic Park in Stratfordin the run up to theLondon 2012 Olympics
It was after a visit to a centre for troubled youngsters that Prince Harry suggested National Service as a way to straighten out misguided youth. The military does this brilliantly, as I can personally attest having gone through the mill at Sandhurst after a relatively shaky start to adulthood.
But the world, and British society, has changed massively since the 1940s and 50s. Todays 16-to-21-year olds have only known relative peace, prosperity and increasing freedom. Of the 11 countries that maintain mandatory National Service, most either face a clear and immediate threat (South Korea, Israel) or heartily apply National Service to paper over economic and/or societal cracks (Greece, Russia).
In the absence of the former it is perhaps a step too far even for this government to admit it has no better idea for under-achieving 16-21 year olds than to shove them in a uniform and march them round a square for two years.
Im glad Prince Harry has raised the issue  it certainly warrants debate. Im as proud of my service as Im concerned that we are, as a society, failing to provide opportunities for a portion our young men and women.
Ive seen soldiers from deeply troubled backgrounds join the Army and grow, being driven through their perceived limits. However, Ive also seen soldiers who undergo the same training, refuse to entertain the discipline and hard work required and leave after a miserable year.
National Service appears to hold little military advantage, simply creating a military wing of our social services. As a cure for societys ills I remain to be convinced that simply sending 18 year olds to the tender ministrations of the Drill Sergeant will necessarily set them on the right track; there are better, cheaper ways.
It would be better if National Service were only for those who were motivated to train, wanted to learn new skills and to serve in Her Majestys Armed Forces  which sounds rather like joining the military.

Andy Burnham said he watched the show from behind the sofa
Andy Burnham, who istipped to succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader, has looked cool, calm and confident throughout the leadership contest.
But 24 years ago, Mr Burnham had to watch from behind the sofa as his girlfriend went on Blind Date.
Frankie van Heel, who has been married to Burnham since 2000, had asked him for permission to go on the TV show when the pair were going out at Cambridge University 24 years ago.
Will Harris dressed for the occasion
Mr Burnham accepted. Fortunately for him, he had nothing to worry about.
Dressed in a pair of fetching flared trousers, Frankiepicked dungaree-wearing Will Harris, from Surrey,from the three bachelors.
Footage from the date in Gibraltar shows the pair bickering, with Frankie,whose full name is Marie-France, telling Will to try and look attractive.
The bickering continued when the pair returned to the show. Frankie threw a cushion at Will, who described her as a cold fish.
It didnt work out for Will and Frankie
Frankie has been withMr Burnham ever since.
But the story doesnt end there. Twelve years after the appearance on Blind Date, Mr and Mrs Burnham were sat in the Commons bar when Will Harris walked in.
He had become a marketing director for the Conservatives.

Its been nearly 2,000 years since the deadly Pompeii disaster but one of its most tragic stories is just being fully revealed.
Through plaster casts experts have managed to show the devastating scene of a scared boy on his motherslap.

The substance had preserved the skeletons.
It can be very moving handling these remains when we apply the plaster, conservator Stefania Giudice told journalist Natashas Sheldon.
The expert from Naples national archaeological Museum added: Even though it happened 2,000 years ago, it could be a boy, a mother or a family. Its human archaeology, not just archaeology.

The creepy ad appeared in one of Swedens most popular daily papers
The end is nigh!
This sinister baptismnotice made its way into a one of Swedens most popular newspapers this week.
It shows little Lucy with 666 curls dangling from her head and included the email address Satans Mother when read backwards.
Svenska Dagbladet carried dates for the hellish baptism which is taking place on May 23 in Elmsta.
But it isnt a meeting for Satanists, rather a cheeky marketing ploy for the Elmsta 3,000 Horror Festival.
Creepy, nonetheless.

        <Description>Palmyra artefacts date back thousands of years and are now under threat.</Description>

Islamic State fighters in Syria have stormedthe historiccity ofPalmyra leaving its ancient ruins under threat of destruction.
The blood-thirsty terror organisationseized control of the central citys military air base, prison and intelligence headquarters, having stormed it on Wednesday, said Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Clashes since this weekhave killed at least 100 pro-government fighters,withforces withdrawing, according to Syrian state media.
Abdulrahman, who bases his information on a network of sources on the ground, said there were so far no reports of destruction of the citys historic artefacts.

The capture of Palmyra was a major triumph for the militant group, days after it took the strategic city of Ramadi in Iraqs largest Sunni province.
As IS took Palmyra, government forces collapsed in the face of the attacks and Syrian soldiers were seen fleeing the area, activists said. In Damascus, state TV acknowledged that pro-government forces had withdrawn from the town.
The ruins at Palmyra are one of the worlds most renowned historic sites. Before the war, thousands of tourists a year visited the remote desert outpost, a cherished landmark referred to by Syrians as the Bride of the Desert.

Many Palmyra residents are fleeing the town towards the city of Homs and Damascus, according to Talal Barazi.
Mr Barazi, governor of the central province of Homs which includes Palmyra, said the Syrian army is outside the town, from where it is targeting IS reinforcements.
We have not received any news about [the archaeological sites] destruction, he said. We hope that there will be no massacres in the city or damage to the ruins.

A teenage girl seenabusing and punching a boy in avideo that went viral has been charged.
The two-minute video, which has been viewed more than 2.7million times on Facebook, shows a girl with blonde pigtails and in school uniform grabbing a much larger boy by his sweatshirt and hurling abuse at him before punching him in the face.
And the girl, who was later found to be 14, was arrested on the evening of the 14 May after police were alerted to the video. She has now been charged.

She then threatens the boy, saying, Dont p*** me off or I will have you on the floor, you understand?
The video, which was posted to the Young Rich Britain Facebook page, prompted hundreds of comments, many of which praisedthe boy for not retaliating and mocked the girls street language.
So much respect for that young man, what a star, certainly been brought up the right way, wrote one user.

The 52-year-old was plagued with hallucinations all her life (Picture: REX Shutterstock)
It sounds like the stuff of nightmares, but for one woman, seeing dragons instead of human faces was an everyday occurrence.
According to an Anglo-Dutch research team in the Hague, the Netherlands, a 52-year-old woman presented at a psychiatric clinic in 2011 plagued with something utterly bizarre  even to theexperienced doctors.
For her entirety of her life shed seen human faces metamorphose into the faces of dragons, with this same hallucination happening multiple times each day.
She could perceive and recognise actual faces, but after several minutes they turned black, grew long, pointy ears and a protruding snout, and displayed a reptiloid skin and huge eyes in bright yellow, green, blue, or red, the research team wrote in The Lancet .

Even in the context of her condition, the womans case was rare (Picture: REX Shutterstock)
She saw similar dragon-like faces drifting towards her many times a day from the walls, electrical sockets, or the computer screen, in both the presence and absence of face-like patterns, and at night she saw many dragon-like faces in the dark.
The woman suffered from prosopometamorphopsia, a psychiatric disorder that causes faces to appear distorted. Even within the context of the condition, the womans case was rare in the specificity of her hallucinations.
A host of brain scans and blood tests found her to be completely healthy, although researchers werent surprised as it still unclear what causes the disorder.
The team eventually managed to stop the womans hallucinations with an anti-dementia medication called rivastigmine, which synthesises acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory.

The Rainsbrook secure training centre houses children aged 12 to 17 (Picture: PA)
A G4S-run youth jail is facing severe criticismfollowing a series of incidents of gross misconduct, including the degrading treatment of detainees.
The Rainsbrook secure training centre, near Rugby, is one of four secure training centres housing children aged 12 to 17. Four years ago it was rated as outstanding by Ofsted.
But the most recent report is far from glowing. Ofsted claims some staff were high on drugs while on duty, subjected youth offenders to degrading treatment  including racist comments  and were deliberately negligent.
The report published today is all the more shocking because it reveals the true misery being experienced by some very vulnerable, unhappy and challenging children, Frances Crook, chief executive of The Howard League for Penal Reform, told Metro.co.uk .
This is the worst report on a prison I have ever seen because it is a catalogue of abusive practices that have been inflicted on young children who have no escape.

Ofsted rated the centre inadequate(Picture: PA)
Inspectors say that one child did not receive treatment for a fracture for 15 hours because senior staff members overruled clinical advice that he needed treatment. They further said that contraband DVDs found at Rainsbrook were likely to be the result of collusion between staff and offenders.
At least six members of staff have been dismissed following incidents of gross misconduct.Ofsted rated thedetention centre as inadequate  the lowest possible level of effectiveness.
Paul Cook, the G4S director of childrens services, called the report disappointing.
This is an extremely disappointing report for everyone connected with Rainsbrook and its the first time in 16 years that the centre has been found by any inspecting body to be less than good or outstanding, he told the Guardian .
We recognise that the incidents highlighted by inspectors were completely unacceptable and took swift action at the time, in discussion with the Youth Justice Board. The YJB has expressed confidence in our action plan to address all the concerns raised and I am keen for inspectors to revisit the centre at their earliest opportunity to check on our progress.

Meg was drowned because of her barking (Picture: NTI)
Everyone knows what its like to have a dog barking near their house at night.
But not everyone woulddrown it in a bucket of water to stop the barking.
Thats what Stephen Woodhouse, 53, did to border terrier Meg before cutting the dog open to try and remove her microchip.
Woodhouse, a commercial airline pilot for Flybe, has been spared jail for killing the dog who was bought by Alan and Alison Boddington for their daughter, Lauren, who died five years ago.
After killing Meg at his house in Long Buckby, Northamptonshire, he told police: I just had to stop the noise.

Alan and Alison Boddington bought Meg for their daughter who has since died (Picture: NTI)
He tried to dump the body of the dog three times and it was when Mrs Boddington noticed Megs hairs in Woodhouses car boot that he was caught. The dog was found in his house.
He was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for two years.
MrBoddington said We got Meg as an eight-week-old puppy for our daughter who was special needs as a little companion and obviously she became a very important part of our family.
He said: I just had to stop the noise (Picture: NTI)
We have got lots of memories of Lauren and Meg together and it has traumatised the children and all of us are very, very upset.
Mrs Boddington added: She was Laurens dog and she was just the one thing we had left of her.
So, for us that makes it even worse. Its been truly devastating.
He was ordered to pay 2,580 to the court and as he left said: It was a terrible thing to do.

Labours Richard Burgon as he was being sworn in
Woah! A Labour used his absolute privilege in parliament to say something controversial.
Labour MP RichardBurgon was being sworn in when he suggested that the Monarchy should be abolished  right before he swore allegiance to the Queen.
The new MP for East Leeds added a Republican twist saying: As someone that believes that the head of state should be elected I make this oath in order to serve my constituents.
He should have said: I Richard Burgon swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.
Hes not the first.
Dennis Skinner once added when she pays her income tax, Tony Banks crossed his fingers and Jess Phillips is believed to have done the same.
The reaction to Burgons ad libbing was split.
@cohozac @Election20I5 MP Richard Burgon called for end of Monarchy before swearing in as  new MP, so I think kick him out.

The advert used by the diet pill company (Picture: Hearst Magazines)
Scammers are particularly galling these days.
They nicked a picture of 22-stone Kirsty Kennedy, 30, and put her next to another woman whos size six to advertise diet pills.
They even had the gumption togive her a different name and said that shed lost 98lbs thanks to the pills.
Kirsty spotted the advert on a website purporting to be the Womens Health website. In fact it was a bogus site and had nothing to do with publishers Hearst.
Kirsty said: They made me a year older, a divorcee, moved me down to Essex and made me out to be a size six. Why would someone do that? I dont know how to take it.
Kirsty Kennedy is pretty angry that a picture of her was used to demonstrate weightloss (Picture: HEMedia)
I feel sorry for any poor beggar who falls for this under the impression that it would help them lose weight.
The other woman on the advert is Taryn Wright, from Essex, who featured in the national press for losing weight after splitting up from her husband.
Her mum, Rosemary said: Does she look like shes a size six? To me you shouldnt be discriminated against whether youre big or small.
Kirsty hasnt lost 98lbs (Picture: HE Media)
A spokesman for Hearst Magazines UK added: We are appalled that the good name of Womens Health has been associated with this fraudulent activity.
Womens Health is not in any way connected to this fake company or the products it claims to sell.

        <MainBody>A yes vote will change what it means to grow up LGBT in Irelandforever
Trina Tsai Thursday 21 May 2015 7:00 am
Ireland goes to the poll on Friday 22 May (Picture: Paul Sharp)
Irelands Marriage Equality Referendum, which will take place on FridayMay 22, will be the first ever public vote on same sex marriage in the world.
It seeks to insert a new sentence into the Irish Constitution: Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.
With each political party advocating for a YES vote, it is up to the Irish people whether two loving adults will be free to marry in the future, regardless of their gender.
May 22 means the world to me. My names Trina and I live in Waterford, about 80 miles south of Dublin.
Ive been with my partner Karen for nearly eight years, and weve had so much happiness together. Equally, weve been able to support each other through tough times.
As with any relationship it takes work, patience, understanding, communication, trust and most of all love.
Karen is my rock and I can confide in her my deepest, darkest fears.
Last November I asked Karen if she would spend the rest of her life with me, and she said Yes!
Our friends and family celebrated with us for months. Unfortunately, at the moment, we dont have access to civil marriage.
Trina and Karen are hoping for a yes result (Picture: Trina Tsai)
Im really hoping this will change and that the people of Ireland, my friends, my family, and my community will vote Yes.
A Yes vote means that Karen and I will finally be able to stand in front of our friends and families and make a legal, lifelong commitment to each other.
I hear couples speak about how marriage strengthens their relationship, and talk about the joy and contentment that they experience as a result.
I want the opportunity to marry the person I have promised to spend the rest of my life with.
I see the recognition and protections that marriage gives to my friends relationships  and I want all of that.
I want the opportunity to marry the person I have promised to spend the rest of my life with.
So, its very important to me on a personal level.
I also want people to vote Yes because I can very much see the benefits it will bring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) young people across the board.
As a youth worker in Dublin and Waterford for BeLonG To, the national organisation for LGBT young people, aged between 14 and 23 years, I have heard the experiences of hundreds of young people whove endured daily homophobic and transphobic bullying and violence.
In Ireland, one in two LGBT young people will consider suicide owing to the stigma and bullying. This has to stop.
By extending marriage equality to same sex couples it will not end homophobic bullying, but it will send a strong message to LGBT young people that they are accepted and valued.
The Marriage Equality Referendum is our chance to change forever what it means to grow up LGBT in Ireland.
So, I hope anyone reading this, particularly if they have Irish family, will take time to ask them to vote Yes  for the sake of love and for the sake of the future.

Well this person just punched their ticket for the biggest a***hole of 2015 award.
Its fairly common knowledge that when a massive fire engine with blaring lights and sirens comes up behind your car you are supposed to move.
Obviously this motorist in Germany thought they were special, and casually chilled out at the lights, stopping the fire engine in its tracks.
Even when the lights change the driver doesnt take any evasive action, forcing the fire engine to manoeuver around them before speeding off to what presumably is a burning building.
Peter Le who uploaded the infuriating video simply said: F***ing idiot.
Amen to that, Peter.

American fast food workers have been showing the world the appalling conditions they are forced to live in due to their low wages.
The exhibition, which is called I, Too, am America, is part of the Fight for $15 movement, in which food workers are asking for higher pay in order to afford basic necessities.
Mona Lee, 20, is part of the exhibition in Kansas City which is affiliated with local labour organisation Stand up KC.
She works two jobs, sometimes back to back, and only brings home $7.25 (4.66) per hour.
Speaking to Slate she said: I dont understand how I can work at two jobs and not have enough money to put food in the house.We need to be able to live.
Here are some of the sobering images from the exhibition.

Last month saw 60,000 works protest low wages across the USA, and in March Kansas City councilmanJermaine Reed introduced legislation which will increase minimum wage gradually, promising to hit $15 (9.64) by the year 2020.

        <Description>There is a war brewing in the Commons</Description>
        <MainBody>Marie Le Conte for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 20 May 2015 7:00 pm
Dennis Skinner MP (PA)
This is Dennis Skinner.
He has been a Labour MP for 45 years.
His nickname is The Beast of Bolsover, in a reference to both his constituency and his behaviour in theHouse of Commons.
He refuses to miss any sittings in the chamber, as he used to be a miner before becoming an MP, and if you missed a shift at the pit, you would get the sack.
He always sits on the first seat of the front bench, which everyone knows.
Always  until this week.
These are the new SNP MPs.
Great reception for MPs from @theSNP the 3rd party at Westminster and @NicolaSturgeon outside House of Commons #SNP pic.twitter.com/nvWMCyHbda
They started working in Westminster last week, and as we mentioned then, they are wreaking havoc in more ways than one .
Yesterday was the first official day back in Parliament, and on the first day, you cannot reserve your seat in the chamber.
So what did a bunch of SNP MPs do? Thats right. They tried to steal Skinners seat.
The SNP chief whip made them sit on Skinners seat, and sit on Skinners seat they did.
People noticed it, and they were not happy.
I apparently have strong feelings about SNP MPs trying to steal Dennis Skinner's seat. He's 83 years old &amp; has had it since the 80s!
 Katie Bee (@breakpointsaved) May 18, 2015
So what did Skinner do? He did what any self-respecting 80-something angry socialist would do: he spotted a tiny bit of the bench that was unoccupied when he arrived, and he wiggled himself in there.
Was he happy about the event? No he wasnt.
Dennis Skinner on SNP MP's who've actually spent their morning taking his seat "I was there before them, &amp; I'll be there when they're gone."
 Anya O'Shea (@aoshay) May 18, 2015
There is a problem though  the bench everyone is fighting over is the oppositions bench, which is traditionally reserved for Labour.
The opposition, however, is now double-headed, with the SNP having more than enough seats to demand their share of seats.
So what next?
A meeting was arranged about the issue today. Yes, really.
Crunch talks to end the War of Skinner's Seat taking place this afternoon between SNP and Labour whips. I'm not making this stuff up.
 Kevin Schofield (@schofieldkevin) May 20, 2015
We do not know what came out of this meeting yet, but hey, on the bright side:
Betway say Dennis Skinner 6/4  to lose his favourite seat on rebels bench in the Commons.
 Adrian Pearson (@Adrian_Pearson) May 20, 2015
Yes. You can bet on it now.

The mother of a woman who was left paralysed and with brain damage following a vicious beating by her ex-boyfriend has won the right to have him moved from his job at the hospitalwhere his victim still getsregular treatment.
Steve Clark left Lisa Taylor, 35, with severe physical and mental difficulties after he kicked her in the head 40 times with such ferocitythat her blood soaked through his trainers.
After serving two years of a four year jail sentence he landed a job an internal courier  at the very same hospital where Lisa gets regular treatment.
And the mother of Lisa today won the right to have Clark moved from his job at Musgrove Hospital in Taunton, Somerset, a job she only found out about when she came face-to-face with him.

Coming face-to-face with someone who has done that to your daughter  it was horrible, said Nancy, 72.
It will make a big difference to know we wont see him again.
Ive been told that the only time he will be allowed in the hospital is if he is admitted as a patient. I know it sounds terrible, but I said to them lets hope its in a black bag.

Lisa, a trainee chef, had a stormy relationship with Clark, with whom she had a daughter, Millie. Clarklater said in court that he snapped after a row during a night out.
Lisawas found in a pool of blood in a nearby park.

        <Description>'The money is s***. Don't ask for more because I don't have it,' the ad reads.</Description>
        <MainBody>Oliver Wheaton for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 20 May 2015 5:30 pm
A restaurateur has posted what might be the most brutally honest job advert ever.
Rather than the overusedlines about needing a go getter who isnt afraid of hard work, the advert is a little more realistic.
Justin, from America, is planning on opening a new joint near Glasgow, and is looking for a number two to help keep an eye on things.
Heres how he is selling the job.
Salary
The money is s***. Its 7/hour and a cut of the tips. Dont ask for more because I dont have it. Youll literally be making more than me because I am essentially working for free until the place is paid off.
Employee participation
You can also have a decent degree of creative freedom, menu-wise. I will listen to your ideas and try your weird suggestions, but if I dont love it were not doing it and thats that.
Management style
If you think I sound like an obnoxious d***head, congratulations. You are observant and will go far in life. Dont let it discourage you, though. Im only a d***head for the first three years you know me. After that Im a total sweetheart.
Management structure
You have to put up with my wife because I do, and shes the real boss.
Personal specification
I dont care if youre super outgoing or actually mute. I dont care if youve got tattoos. I dont care if you only work in kitchens to get away from your horrible significant other.
The menu
You like weird condiments? Great. Me too. You have no idea what Im talking about? Then please, PLEASE, dont apply for this job.
Justin also begs potential staff not to apply unless they seriously consider themselves to be a good fit for the restaurant.
Last time I was hiring for a place I got over 400 CVs. You know how long it takes to read 400 CVs? Too damned long, he said.
The ad was removed by Gumtree because of the profanities used, butcan still be read in its full glorious form due to Googles caching of the page.
Justin, who received 150 applications before the ad was removed, told Buzzfeed : I was just trying to be honest. It was a genuine ad, I thought I would try and cut through.
Its a pretty tight timescale because Im trying to launch on the first of July and I dont have any people and I dont have the time to spend sifting through 8 million cookie cutter CVs.
The man sure knows what he wants.

Cow poo is a lot more powerful than you might think.
So powerful that its actually managed to set a land speed record for buses.
The Bus Hound, built by Reading Buses, hit a speed of 76.785mph atMillbrook Circuit in Bedford, breaking the previous record for bus speeds.
Sadly it cant be recognised as a Guinness World Record unlessit reaches a speed of more than 150mph.
In keeping with the fact that its powered by massive piles of cow dung, the bus is paintedblack and white like a Friesian cow.
The poo-powered bus (Picture: Reading Buses)
John Bickerton, chief engineer of the company, told the BBC: Weve laid down a challenge for other bus operators to best our record and we had to make it a bit hard for them.
Most importantly we wanted to get the image of bus transport away from being dirty, smelly, and slow. Were modern, fast, and at the cutting edge of innovation.
It was an impressive sight as it swept by on the track. It sounded like a Vulcan bomber  the aerodynamics arent designed for going 80mph.
The bus hound reached almost 77mph (Picture: Reading Buses)
Martijn Gilbert, CEOof Reading Buses said: This is fantastic. What a great advert for biomethane which is growing in popularity each day.
At Reading Buses, we love it. Thirty four vehicles, 20% of our fleet, are now CNG powered and we cant wait for vehicle suppliers to widen their product range so that we can take even greater advantage of this carbon neutral and cost effective solution.

We all have those days when we dont fancy going to meetings  but sometimes, it really is worth showing up.
One of Chinas richest men just had a reported 9 billion wiped off his personal fortune in half an hour  and it could be because he failed to show up for a meeting.
Li Hejun failed to attend the annual shareholder meeting of his company, Hanergy  casting doubt over the companys future.
A company spokesman was reported as saying he, had something to do by the Financial Times.
Sadly, thats not really an excuse when youre the chairman of one of Chinas biggest solar panel companies  and the companys stock, and his controlling stake, dived.
After his no-show, sales collapsed  shares in Hanergy Thin Film Power Group, fell 47% on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
In that half hour, Li saw his personal fortune reduced by 9 billion, according to Fortune.
Trading was halted and the company made no immediate public comment on the possible reason for the plunge.

        <Description>Why do ordinary, peaceful people turn into insane, violent maniacs once they've had a few too many?</Description>
        <MainBody>Rob Waugh for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 20 May 2015 4:48 pm
The party animal
Alcohol is the worlds most dangerous drug  and among the most popular.
But why do ordinary, peaceful people turn into insane, violent maniacs once theyve had a few too many?
Writing on The Conversation , DrIan Mitchell,Senior Lecturer at University of Birmingham, has some of the answers.
1) Alcoholstops you feeling fear  so you take stupid risks
USA, Illinois, Metamora, hands of driver holding beer and steering wheel
Ever wondered why it suddenly seems like a good idea to climb out a window and run along a rooftop?
Booze switches off the bits of your brain that make you (sensibly) feel fear.
Dr Ian Mitchell says, Alcohol also acts on GABA receptors to impair the activity of the brain circuits that make us feel anxious and, at higher doses, alcohol inactivates a second set of brain circuits that control fear.
So threatening stimuli no longer seem quite so scary. Alcohol also compromises our ability to compute risk so that situations we would normally shy away from may now seem quite inviting.
2) Alcohol can make you more racist
Quarrel in pub
Booze makes you bond more strongly with members of your group  bu the flipside to that is that it can make you feel less close to people you perceive as outside it.
Dr Mitchell says, Alcohol makes members of our ethnic in-group appear more attractive but this effect does not extend to members of other ethnic groups.
3) Alcohol makes stupid ideas sound like good ideas

Baby trying to drink beer
Ever wondered why you stole that parking cone?
Dr Mitchell says, As well as making us more empathic, laboratory studies have also shown that drinking alcohol can make us trust others more and make us temporarily more generous.
3) Alcohol makes you think everyonelikes you  hence you act like an idiot
D6PRPB Barman make alcoholic shots in nightclub. Cocktail bar and cocktail shots with liquors
Everyones seen it  the moment where some drunk fool is trying to persuade someone sober to join in the fun  or worse, sleep with them.
Its all down to how we perceive other people when we are drunk.
Dr Mitchell says, As we drink, we have a tendency to erroneously assume that some facial expressions of negative emotions are happy, and we find it particularly difficult to identify sad and angry faces. This leaves us prone to making embarrassing social errors.
4) Booze makes you more willing to hurt people(if youre a bit violent in the first place)
Alcohol causes a huge amount of violence  but ti doesnt seem to make peaceful people turn evil.
Instead, it amplifies the mean streak of people who already have one.
Laboratory studies have shown that alcohol increases aggression. For example, it increases the willingness with which individuals will administer electric shocks to others. However, this effect seems to be largely restricted to those who are intrinsically aggressive in the first instance.
5)Alcohol shuts down your ability to understand other people
This is why most really drunk arguments tend to end up either with people yelling, WHAT? or punching each other.
Equally, alcohol can corrupt our ability to understand the intentions of others. The brain contains specific circuits, which connect parts of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and temporal parietal junction, that handle our social cognitive abilities. So our ability to understand somebody elses mental perspective and their motivations for acting in a certain way become unreliable.

A lorry driver caused a pregnant dog to die when he used his vehicle to push a car containing young children into a roundabout.
Andrew McDermid pushed the Mitsubishi 10 feet along the A45 into the mouth of the Saxon Avenue roundabout in Collingtree, Northamptonshire, after the driver of the car, Mr Rose, got out to confront him about his driving.
Mr Roses wife, their11-month-old son and two-year-old nephew were in the car as well as several dogs. McDermid knew there was at least one passenger inside, Northampton Crown Court heard.

McDermid accepted his actions were completely irresponsible (Picture: Alamy)
When the lorry hit us the children were screaming and then they suddenly stopped  I was convinced they were injured and had died, Mrs Rose, who runs a dog-breeding business with her husband, said in a statement.
The children and I have nightmares and I have had therapy for post traumatic stress disorder. Before they incident I had started taking driving lessons but now I have stopped and I dont feel that I will ever want to learn to drive.
The court heard how McDermid had been straddling two lanes to stop other drivers getting around him. Mr Rose had got out of his car to confront him at around 5.30pm on 29 December 2014 when he accelerated.
McDermid accepted his reactions were completely irresponsible. He was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and a 15-month driving ban. He was also ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work.

Frances Crook, chief executive of The Howard League for Penal Reform, responds to todays damningOfsted report on the G4S-run Rainsbrook secure training centre.
Rainsbrook is one of four secure training centres that each detain between 70 and 100 boys and girls as young as 13 years old. The brainchild of Kenneth Clarke during his first stint as Home Secretary as a new way of imprisoning children that would put education at the heart of their incarceration, the child jails were first awarded contracts by Jack Straw under the Labour government. They have been in operation for two decades but have generated little public interest despite the deaths of children by suicide and a 15 year old during restraint by staff at Rainsbrook.
The key to understanding the culture of secrecy surrounding the STCs is that they are run for profit by companies like G4S and have never allowed television cameras to film and very rarely permitted any print journalist to visit.
They have been subject to Ofsted inspections which have tended to be anodyne at best and collusive at worst, despite excessive use of force by staff, high rates of violence and proven rates of reoffending that are positively eye-watering.
The report published today is therefore all the more shocking because it reveals the true misery being experienced by some very vulnerable, unhappy and challenging children.
When inspectors visited Rainsbrook in February, they found that children had been subject to degrading treatment and racist comments and had been cared for by staff who were under the influence of illegal drugs.
G4S runs Rainsbrook secure training centre (Picture: PA)
There had been serious incidents of gross misconduct by staff, including some who were in leadership positions.
The discovery of contraband DVDs, most likely smuggled in by staff, suggested that children had been allowed to view inappropriate material. Inspectors said that this indicated that some staff may have colluded with children to elicit compliance by wholly inappropriate means.
Children were restrained 166 times in six months  72 of these restraint incidents were in response to children harming themselves. This is the institution where 15 year old Gareth Myatt was restrained by staff whilst he choked on his own vomit and died.
Inspectors found that there had been delays in children receiving essential medical diagnosis and treatment, and in referring matters for independent scrutiny. On one occasion, a young person did not receive treatment for a fracture for about 15 hours.
Inspectors rated Rainsbrook as inadequate the lowest possible level of effectiveness.

This is the worst report on a prison I have ever seen because it is a catalogue of abusive practices that have been inflicted on young children who have no escape.
Childrens phone calls out to family and friends are monitored by staff. Visits with family are never in private and are monitored. Whilst the charity Barnardos is paid to provide an advocacy service to the children, the only access to independent legally trained help the children can get is through the Howard League helpline.
I visited Rainsbrook some years ago and found it to be claustrophobic and obsessed with security, a recipe for exactly the disaster now happening.
These child jails run for profit are secretive and should never have been set up in the first place. Rainsbrook should be closed immediately. No child is safe in this jail.

But its actually quite tame compared to some of the other place names that come up if you search really really rude words.
Basically, if you can think of it, and its obscene, odds are its a place name on Google Maps already.

This is the moment a man who claims he was sexually abused as a youngster confronts his alleged attacker.
The video shows someone walking towards a man as he waters his garden in broad daylight.
He then accuses him of performing oral sex on him at the age of 13.
He asks: Would you be willing to apologise to me for sexually abusing me years ago?
The accuser is toldto get lost and he threatens to call the police.
Then the man denies the allegations, saying: I did not sexually abuse you.

The alleged victim points to a nearby house and accuses the man of performing oral sex on him in a room when he was 13-years-old.
How can you say that? he replies. You sexually abused me right there, in that room. You performed oral sex on me. Will you apologise to me for it?
But the man then says: I dont know why I should apologise for what was a consensual situation.
He goes on to claim that the man was 18-year-old at the time, not 13, and he has witnesses to prove it.
The video ends when the man becomes increasingly more impatient and repeatedly asks the person to get off his property.

The only thing that can make your mamas pasta even better is a light sprinkling of parmesan cheese.
But it turns out youve been insulting her each time you ask, because your pronunciation of the word parmesan is way off, you uncultured buffoon.
Dont believe us? Pop over to the US version of the Cambridge Dictionary and click on the little speaker symbol to hear the correctway to say it.
Click here and have your mind BLOWN (Picture: dictionary.cambridge.org)
Thats right, parmesan is actually pronounced pen-sal-vane-ear (which sounds remarkably like an American state).
Something tells us this is the result of a glitch on the website, rather than an incredibly uneducated programmer over at Cambridge Dictionaries.
If you know anyone who is learning English and they ask for somePennsylvania on their pasta make you sure DONT correct them.
It will be hilarious.

The striking colours and the lighting make it look like something from a Dalipainting of a barren sunset in an icy tundra.
But no, its actually a 1,300ft sand dune next to a white claypan in Sossusvlei, Namibia, home to some of the worlds largest sand dunes.

Offices should play the sounds of flowing mountain streams to improve workers productivity, a study has recommended.
An experiment at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute looked at alternatives to the white noiseplayed in some officers to reduce distractions and make speech unintelligible beyond a certain distance.
And the team found that when it came to increasing productivity, the sound of water flowing through mountain streams was the most effective aid.
The mountain stream sound possessed enough randomness that it did not become a distraction, said Alana DeLoach, who assisted in the study.
This is a key attribute of a successful masking signal.
Professor Jonas Braasch, an acoustician and musicologist who led the study, added that it may have uses outside the working place.
You could use it to improve the moods of hospital patients who are stuck in their rooms.

Natural sounds have become increasingly popular as tools for increasing productivity and relaxation.

Its peanut butter, trust us(Picture: Leanne Mascoll/Metro)
You might have heard that shaving your legs with peanut butter is the new health hack for womenwho want smoother skin.
Surely anything which can help a woman de-hair her legs is good enough for a mans face, right?
Probably not, but I thought Id try anyway.
With some Sun-Pat peanut butter and a box of Gillette disposable razors I put this quite frankly idiotic idea to the test.
Could slapping a breakfast treat over your mug and going at it with a razor be added to the morning routine of the modern man?
Well

Then the shaving began.

The layer of fatty goodness might have protected my skin from getting cut to ribbons, but it also seemed to protect the hairs (what a traitor).
I had to dig pretty deep to reach the stubble, but it soon became apparent I was just having the weirdest face massage ever.
Plusthe disposable razors werent really up for the job.

At the end all I had were a couple of ruined razors and a patchy face  in fact some parts of my face seemed even hairier than when I started.
Maybe peanut butter actually stimulates hair growth? (Full disclosure: I probably put more in my face than I did on it, so it took a lot longer than it should have)
Stylish stubble may be in right now, but smelling of something you spread on your toast is most certainly not.
Not to mention that I woke up the morning after with two cats licking my face  I dont even own any cats.

Its fair to say this may not be a craze that catches on.
We can definitively confirm that peanut butter works best as food.

A third of all people living in London cannot afford a decent standing of living, a charity has warned.
The charity Trust for London and a team from Loughborough University asked 21 groups of between six and eight people about their living standards and then compared the answers to the rest of the UK.
And the report found that a third of all Londoners cannot afforda decent standard of living, defined by Trust for London as being able to afford food, shelter, clothing and luxury items such as a childs birthday present or a cheap meal out up to twice a month.

Danny Simpson is on trial accused of attacking his ex-girlfriend (Picture: Cavendish)
A Leicester City defender and former Manchester United player has appeared in court accused of attacking the mother of his child.
Danny Simpson, 29, is accused of throttling ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ward at her home inWorsley, Manchester, shortly after Christmas last year.
A court heard officers heard shouting at her home then a gurgling noise before finding her gasping for breath.
He was allegedly pulled off her as Miss Ward was left crying hysterically and cowering in the corner of the living room.
As he was led away, Simpson shouted Steph, tell them I didnt do anything, Manchester magistrates were told.

It is believed an argument broke out over Simpson texting other women but a month later, MissWard withdrew her statement.
A trial heard a 999 call in which she can be heard shouting get off me, get off me.
PC Gareth Hughes, first on the scene, said: I could hear screams and crying and then silence. I could then hear a choking sound.
I entered the house through a small hallway and to my right I could instantly see a small female lying in a prone position facing up. She was about three metres away from me.
Simpson used to play for Manchester United (Picture: AP)
I saw a male who I now know to be Daniel Simpson straddling across her with his hands firmly placed around her neck. He was sitting on her on his knees. I initially heard choking when in entered the room.
He had both hands around her throat. He seemed startled by my sudden presence. I had to drag him by his arm. I then arrested him on suspicion of assault and he angrily demanded that the female didnt say anything and he said, tell them I wasnt doing anything, which was more of a demand.
He denies on charge of assault by beating and the trial continues.

Another stupid useless panda (Reuters)
Look, we need to have a chat.
Its about pandas.
You know pandas? The confused looking cow bears.
How useless are they, seriously? Think about it.
We already knew that they can only reproduce ONCE A YEAR for TWO OR THREE DAYS.
Thats pretty rubbish, isnt it?
Like, how bad do you have to be at life to only be able to conceive at most three days a year.
ANYWAY. Things just got worse for our useless furry friends.
Turns out that the sleepy black and white balls of fur also cant digest bamboo.
You read that right.
Bamboo. The thing they eat all goddamn day. They cant digest it.
A new study has found that pandas still have the gut-bacteria of carnivores, as they use to eat meat a few millions years ago.
That means that they cant even digest the bloody thing.
Can you imagine spending up to FOURTEEN hours a day eating the same bloody thing, and not even being able to digest it?
Can you?
They only digest 17% of the 12.5 kilos of bamboo they eat every day.
Shame on you for being so bad at everything, pandas.
Shame. On. You.

A new mother who had a caesarian section had to catch her own bowel and intestines when her surgical scar reopened.
Sam Bell left hospital three days after giving birth to daughter Chloe and a couple of days after that the midwife removed her bead stitch.
But when she went to stand up at her home in Liphook, Hampshire, she felt her jeans sticking to her body thenwhen she opened them her insides fell out.
It took 40 minutes for an ambulance to get to her so she was worried that more might fall out.
Sams staples after her second visit to the hospital
She said: It was quite tough because I was crying but trying not to cry because I didnt know how much else could come out of me.
After having 20 staples put in she spent another four days in hospital.
A spokesperson for St Helliers hospital said: We offer our full and sincerest apologies to Ms Bell for what must have been a very distressing experience.
Immediately following this incident, a full review and investigation was launched.

The scheme was started tolow income families and take some of the pressure off GPs.

A spokesman for NHS England said: These minor ailments schemes were established to provide NHS funded, over the counter medicines to people on lower incomes.
The scheme prevents the need for patients to have medicines for minor illnesses prescribed by a GP  leaving the GP more time for patients with more complicated conditions.

A Southern train service (Picture: PA)
Southern Railway has made the headlines again this week, for all the wrong reasons. I tooka picture of them fining people  including an elderly woman  for standing in first class, despite the fact the train was hugely overcrowded.
Southern says the ticket inspectors can operate discretion when handing out fines on busy trains, and that first class can be declassified if its really busy. But the 0736 from Oxted is ALWAYS busy, so why were the inspectors even on there?
Do they get commission?DoesSouthern send them out with a simple instruction tofine as many people as possible?
MORE: Southern Rail is fining people for standing in first class

The fines arent really the issue  the issue is Southerns complete failure to deliver anything close to an acceptable service. Figures published last week show the operator had the worst punctuality record in the year up to May 2nd 2015 , with one train from Victoria to Redhill running at least five minutes late, 45per centof the time.
Imagine if your local coffee shop got your order wrong 45per centof the time. Or your favourite restaurant had served you terrible food nearly half the times youd been there. You wouldnt carry on going for long.
But Southern, along with the other private rail companies, have got us over a barrel. They operate a monopoly. Train is literally the only realistic way of getting into London for millions of commuters every day.
We face price hikes above inflation every year  I pay over 2000 a year for a 30-minute journey, and that doesnt even include zones 1-6. And all this for trains that are overcrowded, dirty, and late.
When Southern adds insult to injury by fining us for standing in the wrong place, they make it very clear where their priorities lie.
I can hear people out there rolling their eyesover anotherwhinging commuter from the stockbroker belt. I dont HAVE to live outside London, right?
Actually, I do. Im not a stockbroker or a banker, and 90per centof my fellow commuters arent either  we cant all afford to live inside zone 6. My wifes a vet out in the sticks, and she frequently works on call out of hours; other people have kids at local schools doing their GCSEs. Otherswork in coffee shops, restaurants and hospitals.
While the main burden of Southerns failure falls on the commuter, London simply couldnot operate without the millions of workers that commute in from outside the M25 every day.
These rail companies that, year in, year out, put profit before performance are not just failing their passengers. They are failing London.

The investigation into an alleged VIP ring of politiicans and celebrities who abused children has spread wider than previously thought.
Police now say that more than 1,400 suspects have been investigated in an ongoing investigation into historic child abuse.
Norfolk Chief Constable Simon Bailey said 261 are classified as people of public prominence, of these 135 come from the world of TV, film or radio, 76 are listed as politicians, 43 from the music industry and seven are from sport.
Thee figures were revealed by Operation Hydrant, a group set up by the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) to explore links between child sex abuse committed by prominent public persons.
Norfolk Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the NPCCs lead on child protection, said: The referrals are increasing on an almost daily basis. The numbers I refer to today are a snapshot in time.
Out of the 1,433 suspects identified, 216 are now dead.

Mr Bailey said: We are seeing an unprecedented increase in the number of reports that are coming forward.
That has brought about a step change in the way the service has had to deal with it.
He said it is projected that police will receive around 116,000 reports of historic child sex abuse by the end of 2015  an increase of 71% from 2012.

Theres more bad news for small people (Picture: Getty)
They say size doesnt matter, so why do us small people still feel like were missing out on so much in life?
*Weeps into XS T-shirt*
Well my vertically-challenged chums, the news gets worse Im afraid  tall guys earn more.
The findings, which led scientists to believe that every extra inch a man has in height is equivalent to 510 a year in salary, has beenwell documented.
But now a new paper has shed some light over the theory that suggests the sharpest jump in earnings takes place between those who are54 and 56.
Andreas Schick, an economist at the FDA, and Richard Steckel, an economist at the Ohio State University, believe taller people earn more because they are more self-confident and have higher emotional intelligence.
(Picture: Getty)
This may be a result of how they have beentreated by people throughout their lives.
These theoriescome from tracking a group of UK men born in 1958.
They discovered that the most important factor was how much nutrition they received as a child.
A youngsters diet can have a huge influence on intelligence and height.
However, other factors come into play when talking about someones earnings  in particular their outlook on life and cultural perceptions.

Can your professional life be determined by your DNA?(Picture: Alamy)
How do you think rich and successful people get rich and successful?
By getting a good education? Being lucky? Being good at what you do? Coming from a privileged background? Having parents who were also rich and successful?
WRONG.
There is a new study out and apparently it maybe down to their genes.
A team of scientists from Kansas State University have announced the discovery new properties for the CEO gene, aka DAT1, which, if you have it in your DNA, makes you more likely to become powerful in your company.
DAT1 is normally responsible for the transport of the neurotransmitter of dopamine in your brain, but the scientists found that it also makes you more likely to strive for rewards.

The study looked at the genetic make-up of 13,000 people, and concluded that those who had the gene may be more likely to do better in a business setting.
However, another telling characteristic of people carrying the DAT1 gene is that they are less likely to regulate their own behaviour to make positive change, according to one of the scientists on the team.
Well leave you to draw your own conclusions from these statements.

Always take the same route to work?
Change it up and youll be richer for it  figuratively and literally.
Thats according to a report from Tesco Mobile, who found that people who avoid habit traps such as always taking the same route to work are more likely to be satisfied with their lives and earn more money than those who stick with the same routine.
The survey of 2,000 Britons found that 70 percent of us are self-described creatures of habit  eating the same lunches, going to the same holiday destinations and keeping the same mobile provider.
How Extremely Satisfied People Shake Things Up
1. 74 percent vary what they eat for lunch every day
2. 69 percent have changed contracted services such as mobile providers in the last three years
3. 65 percent have changed the position of the furniture of their home in the last year
4. 61 percent have regularly changed their commute to work
5. 49 percent have changed their hairstyle in the last year
But those who do create variety in their livessay they are moresatisfied, and are three times more likely to earn 60,000 or more per year compared to their less adventurous counterparts.
Doing the same things all the time means that were more likely to operate on autopilot and will be more oblivious to opportunities around us, said psychologist and author Dr Rob Yeung.
New stimuli and a breadth of experiences are vital for creativity; so doing the same, safe things repeatedly over time can limit our perspectives. By saying yes to novel experiences and putting yourselves in new situations, we literally create new connections within the brain.
People who seem lucky in work, love and life are often making conscious decisions to try new things. By exposing ourselves to different experiences, we effectively create our own luck and find our way to more opportunities.

A dog whose owner was killed in a tornado hasbeen given a new home, two weeks after tragedy struck.
The giant Pyrenees, who was found in her ownerBrenda Tapleys arms in Van, Texas, has been renamed Emma and is now living with a volunteer who helped to rescue animals following the tornado.
Cindy Nash, director of Nicholas Pet Haven, said: Emma went and crawled up underneath [her former owners] arm for comfort, so a very sad situation. But shes going to havea good home.
Michelle Shockley, who decided to adopt her, told ABC News : I was sitting in the back of the pick-up and she came out on my lap. She was just exhausted and very traumatized.

Emma had a head and ear injury as well as bruising across her body.
Mrs Tapley and her husband David, who also died in the tragedy, had 10 dogs in total. Three died in the tornado, one was taken by their children andthe other six were put up for adoption.

Mark Willis bit off more than he could chew (Picture: GNS)
When a sex predator punched a woman, dragged her over a wall and jumped on top of her, he had no idea who he was messing with.
Five minutes later, he was unconscious, and his victim was dusting herself off.
Mark Willis, 39, bit off more than he could chew when he targeted a woman walking home through Cheltenham at around 2am, a judge at Gloucester Crown Court said today.
After grabbing and punching the woman several times, he forcedher into a front garden and mounted her.
But the woman, who had two years of kickboxing under her belt and had taken a self-defence course, put the man in a triangle choke  a submissionhold that involves wrapping your legs around the neck of the other person and cutting off the blood flow to their brain and put him to sleep.

The woman, who cannot be named, said the man told her to be quiet and do as I tell you and you wont get hurt.
Famous last words.
I swore at him, said the woman.
I think I said something like go f*** yourself. He hit me again in the face. He was grabbing at my clothing.
She went for an armbar, but the man wiggled free and hit her in the face.

My legs were still free so I lifted my left leg up onto his shoulder and around the back of his neck. I crossed my right leg over and squeezed together as hard as I could, she said.
I closed my eyes and held it for as long as I could hoping he would pass out in a few seconds. Then I felt his body go limp. I thought he had lost consciousness or run out of air. I flipped him off, rolled over and crawled through the bushes to the door of the house.
Williss DNA was found in the crotch of the womans shorts. He was quickly arrested and admitted to actual bodily harm but denied sexual assault.
The jury, however, convicted Willis of the latter charge. He was sentenced on a date to be fixed.
The judge awarded the woman a 500 reward, a tiny token of the courts appreciation of what she has done to bring about the apprehension of Willis.

If you search for N***a house in Google Maps, it brings up the location of the White House on screen  a racist jibe targeted at Barack Obama.
The vandalism is thought to be the work of racist spammers, and is (of course) nothing to do with Google.
It doesnt work in ordinary Google search, but in Maps, its still working now (we tried it in the Maps app on Android).
Blog Search Engine Land suggests that the vandalism might have been added by creating a business called N***a House elsewhere, then moving it to the location of the White House.
At time of writing, Google has not removed the search term, but the search giant has previously acted to remove Google Bombs such as searching for miserable failure which used to bring up George W Bush in Google Search.

Ocean Russell is so terrified of choking he only eats soup and Weetabix (SWNS)
Most children tend to be fussy eaters, but Ocean Russell truly is an extreme case.
The seven-year-old refuses to eat anything but mashed potatoes, liquidised baked beans, soup and cereal.
His drastic diet started three years ago, when a cold made his tonsils became so swollen he had trouble eating and sleeping.
The boy then became terrified of choking, and has been so anxious about it that he has been refusing to eat any solid food since, even though his tonsils have now been removed.

He also refuses to eat unless his mum is supervising him, which means that he does not eat at school, and has not gained any weight for two years.
His mum, 36-year-old Oxana, from Bristol, said she was worried about her sons future, and doesnt know what to do.

The boy is too weak to take part in after-school activities, and though he says he would like to eat normally, each meal can take up to two hours.
The family are now waiting to see a pediatrician, but have been told that Oceans case isnt urgent enough, and wouldnt get an appointment before August.

Man attacked by brutal bike gang in front of wife and daughter speaks out for firsttime
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 20 May 2015 12:18 pm
A driver who was brutally beaten by a bike gang in front of his wife and daughter wept in court as he told for the first time how he feared for his life.
The attack onAlexian Lien shocked the world when helmet-cam footage of the incident was uploaded online and viewed by millions.
Lien was testifying at the trial of undercover detective Wojciech Braszczokwho is charged with assault and other crimes following the New York City motorcycle rally that devolved into pandemonium.
Co-defendant Robert Sims has also been charged with similar offences.
Lientold a judge: Complete fear. For my life, for my wifes, for my daughters.
Lien said he, his wife and their toddler were heading to New Jersey for some shopping for the couples anniversary in September 2013.
But when they hit Manhattans West Side Highway in their blue Range Rover, they crossed paths with hundreds of bikers. Some were popping wheelies and slapping the tops of cars they passed.

One motorcyclist tried to block other cars from going north to allow the bikes to pass, but Lien said he was annoyed and wanted to get on with his day, so he kept driving. As the bikes whizzed by, his wife tossed a half-eaten plum and later a water bottle at the bikers, he said.
Tensions rose. A motorcyclist knocked off his rear-view mirror, and Lien was eventually forced to a stop as some bikers got off their rides and approached his car.
And as theyre around my car, I feel it being hit, being kicked, he said. Im horrified at this point, and I recall asking my wife what do I do? what do I do? She says Just go! Just go!.
And I make a hard right because I see theres an opening and I  I just go.
He ran over someone, the bikers gave chase and eventually caught up with the family where they smashed the car window and battered him senseless.
Lienneeded 20 stitches and has been left with permanently scarred.
Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass accused Braszczok of failing to act as a police officer.
Braszczok reached into a broken window on the SUV, then stood by and eventually drove off as others pulled Lien from the car and attacked him, prosecutors said.
The case continues.

A Norwegian cruise ship ran aground at the top corner of the notorious Bermuda Triangle  an area of ocean known for a series of mysterious sinkings and disappearances of small planes.
Small boats, divers and tug boats circled the Norwegian Dawn for hours before high tide helped push it off the reef and into deeper water, where the ship dropped anchor for the night, Norwegian Cruise Line said.
The incident happened in the top corner of the Bermuda Triangle  known for a series of mysterious incidents such as the sinking of a Navy cargo ship in 1918.
The ship failed to send an SOS and was lost with all 300 hands aboard.
Paranormal enthusiasts claim that the area is cursed.
All guests and crew are safe and there were absolutely no injuries, cruise officials said.
The ship, bound for Boston, hit a reef near Bermudas North Channel. There were 2,443 passengers and 1,059 crew members aboard.
Passenger Rachel Hansen, from Londonderry, New Hampshire, said, We were in the middle of eating dinner. There was a shudder for maybe 30 seconds to a minute and then there was a sudden stop.
We had crew members running around in a panic, and we felt like we had to panic.

The news emerged after one commuter, Oxted man Peter Boyland, wrote to MPs Crispin Blunt and Sam Gyimah, complaining that he saw ticket inspectors fining passengers on the 7.36am servce from Oxted to London Bridge on 22 April, the Independent reports.
Tweets from other travellers appeared to confirm that this was standard procedure.
Southern Rail replied to one disgruntled passenger, saying thatif you are in First Class with a standard class ticket then you are right to be fined.
In a statement to the Surrey Mirror, itadded that passengers would have been fined either 20 or twice a single fare, whichever was greater.
A spokesperson told the Independent: In this instance, passengers who were issued with penalty fares were sitting in first class accommodation whilst holding standard class tickets.
First class accommodation is not declassified automatically if the train is busy, but Conductors can use their discretion to declassify if it is deemed necessary.

Porn is about to get much, much more intimate.
The rapid evolution of virtual reality has thrilled video game fanatics, but theres no doubt lovers of porn areexcitedabout the potential of the technology as well.
Adult filmproducers in particular have been looking at ways that they can use VR to improve their product  and crossing their fingers that headsets will allow their content.
Turns out Palmer Lucky, co-founder of Oculus Rift, is on board.
Speaking at the Silicon Valley Virtual Reality Conference and Expo, Mr Luckey said that the Rift was an open platform.

And thats a big deal.
Wired reports that Samsung Gear VRs Nick DiCarlo, Google Cardboards Clay Bavor and Sixenses Amir Rubin evaded the question.
Porn-lovers may have to wait a while before high-quality VR films areavailable (Picture: Getty Images)
The reality is that it will be a while before high-quality virtual reality porn is available.
Very few studios are shooting scenes in the format required for VR, although there are some videos you can find on the internet already.
Those studios that are filming porn for VR, however, are taking advantage of features like 180-degree field of view and the integration of sex toys.
So if youre a lover of porn, theres good news and bad news. The good news is that yes, virtual reality porn is on the way. The bad news is that it may take a while.

Poor Theresa May. Shes in for a bit of a grilling today.
The Home Secretary will make her first speech since being reappointed today when she addresses police officersat the annual conference of the Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) in Bournemouth.
But shes already in hot water with the bobbies after her uncompromising speechlast year.
What May did to pee-off the police
Reeled off a list of recent police scandals
Told the federation if it doesnt reform, shell do it anyway
Withdraw the PFEWs funding from August last year
Threatened to use her special Home Officey powers to investigate the federations accounts
Bringing back proposals to make the federation subject to Freedom of Information requests
Heres what youre thinking:
@VictoriaLIVE Theresa Mays been able to keep situation in policing hidden because of dedication of the very police she attacks. Shameful.

The Home Secretary is likely to face a frosty reception today (Picture:Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters)
Opening the conference on Tuesday, PFEW chairman Steve White struck a defiant tone. He said: Lets face it, after hearing from the Home Secretary last year, one could have been forgiven for thinking that the Federation was facing extinction but we are not  and we never will be.
We were the ones who commissioned our review, we were the ones who stood up to reform, and not because of some bullying from a Government minister.
Mr White repeated his warnings about the possible impact of further rounds of austerity, saying members are at breaking point and claiming cuts could have dire consequences.
About 17,000 officers have been lost from the police service since 2010.
As a result of the cuts, we face the challenges of modern 21st century policing in a structure from the 20th century with funding which sometimes seems its from the 19th century, he said.
Quite simply, we can do more.
What the Government says about police reform
Cutting bureaucracy and central targets has saved up to 4.5 million police hours
This is the equivalent of 2,100 full-time officers, Minister for Policing, Crime and Criminal Justice Mike Penning said
He added that the number of officers in frontline roles has gone up by 91 per cent
Mr White will say today that neighbourhood policing is just one of the endangered species in the new, streamlined, barren policing landscape.
It comes after research for the PFEW found that three-quarters of forces in England and Wales have cut or merged dedicated neighbourhood teams.
The finding led to warnings that bobbies on the beat are in danger of disappearing from the streets.
However, the Government insisted police reforms are working and crime is falling.
Mrs Mays speech will include a Government pledge to spend up to 15 million to tackle the problem of people with mental health issues being detained in police cells.

Reverend Matthew Makela
Apastorwho regularly rantedagainst homosexuals and all things rainbow has been caught cruising for bottoms on Grindr.
Reverend Matthew Makela, who is married and has five children,was caught looking for some oral, massage, making out naked, cuddling fun on the gay dating app.
Rev Makela, from Midland, Michigan, has now quithis associate pastor job at the St Johns Lutheran Church.
His full conversation and the pictures he posted were sent in to Queerty along with extracts of his Facebook rants against homosexuality.
He tells a couple of porkies, telling a potential suitor that he has a girlfriend so cannot do evenings or overnight, and that he only has two children.
What would Jesus say?
Makelaalso says: I would love to mess around with a Bicurious guy.
One of his previous Facebook messages (Picture: Facebook)

Hepreviously compared homosexuality to alcoholism writing on a Midlands Daily News story:I love people who have same sex attraction, and so does God.
The proof is in the sacrifice He made for all of us who sin We dont tell a person born with tendencies to abuse alcohol to keep on giving in to his innate desires because he cant help it.
We try to help him in his struggle.
Pastor Daniel Kempin wrote to the congregation to tell them of Makelas actions: Pastor has acknowledged that there was sin and repentance, and I have testified that there is indeed forgiveness through the same Lord who forgives all our sins.
Nevertheless, it is an end of our time together in ministry, and we ask for your continued prayers and support for the Makela family.
I write this to you to warn you that you may be confronted with the details of the sin, and to remind you that sin is never pretty.
He concluded: Be very careful, then, how you live, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. See you in Church.

The new research reminds us of the movie the Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Picture: YouTube)
Scientists may have just gone and done the unthinkable by identifying an anti-ageing drug.
Early research in mice found that theAlk5 kinase inhibitor (sciencey talk for protein which impacts growth control)simultaneously sprung back old muscle and brain tissue into a youthful state.
David Schaffer, of the University of California, Berkeley Stem Cell Centre in US, said: We established that you can use a single small molecule to rescue essential function in not only aged brain tissue but aged muscle.
That is good news, because if every tissue had a different molecular mechanism for ageing, we wouldnt be able to have a single intervention that rescues the function of multiple tissues.
As we age our bodies gradually shut down because adult stem cells stop replacing damaged ones.
This new drug targets those failing stem cells and restores their ability to do their job.
Experts have praised the find, but voiced caution that the research is still in its very early stages and other stem cell pathways are continually explored.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits the Anbyon Fish Farm under under Korean Peoples Army (KPA) Unit 580, in this undated photo released by North Koreas Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
North Koreasvolatile dictator Kim Jong-un yesterday staged a terrifying public denunciation of terrapin farmers.
Kim accused farm managers of being defeatist when he turned up to give them field guidance in a filmed visit.
He strongly criticised the shortcoming of its officials as a manifestation of incompetence, outmoded way of thinking and irresponsible work style, the KCNA news agency reported.
Failure could bring grave consequences, it added. The crime? The Taedonggang farm failed to breed enough terrapins and freshwater lobsters for the 70th anniversary celebration of the founding of the ruling party.
The creatures are an expensive delicacy in the country.
Kim said the party had sent freshwater lobsters to the facility more than two years ago to breed, and expected results.

A studenthas come up with an international flag of earth and we think its pretty cool.
Made up of seven white rings in an interlocking pattern on a blue background, it may be used in thefuture as we earthlings go on to colonise other planets.
It has been proposed by Oskar Pernefeldt fromBeckmans University of Design in Stockholm, Sweden.
Heres the thinking behind the design: Centred in the flag, seven rings form a flower  a symbol of the life on Earth. The rings are linked to each other, which represents how everything on our planet, directly or indirectly, are linked.
The blue field represents water which is essential for life  also as the oceans cover most of our planets surface. The flowers outer rings form a circle which could be seen as a symbol of Earth as a planet and the blue surface could represent the universe.

When the Government asked New Zealanders to come up with new designs for their national flag, it was only going to end one way.
They didnt seizethe chance to have their creativity immortalised in history. They came up with these instead:
1.Southern Kiwi
(Picture: NZG)
Designed by: Aku A. from Waikato
Bird actually is kiwi. Is well known icon of our country and people. Also stars are southern cross and blue is pacific ocean. Where were from and how we got here.

(Picture: NZG)
Designed by: Spurdo Ebin from Auckland
This flag represents one of our national symbols. The Kiwi bird. The Kiwi is proudly standing in the center of the flag with two white bars on either side representing the Two islands and the Blue in the middle representing the oceans.

3. The Happy NZ Flag
(Picture: NZG)
Designed by: Hannah Jackson from Northland
I think it would make a good flag of nz because its yellow and is happy and it would really cheer people up.

4.Four Seasons One Nation
(Picture: NZG)
Designed by: Liam Gerrard from Auckland
I have used both traditional and new colours, plus the silver fern and the southern cross. The theme relates to our wild and different weather and natural beauty.

A prostitute who injected a Google executive with an overdose of heroin hasadmitted involuntary manslaughter andadministering drugs.
Forrest Timothy Hayes was found dead ona luxury yacht after Alix Tichelman, 28,injected him with the drug.
Tichelman, a high-end call girl, was sentenced to six years in prison at Santa Cruz County Superior Court yesterday.
Hayes had hired Tichelman several times before, and they were doing drugs and having sex the night he died, authorities said.
Larry Biggam, Tichelmans defence attorney, said: It was an accidental overdose between two consenting adults.

Surveillance footage shows Tichelman gathering her belongings, stepping over Hayes body, finishing a glass of wine, closing a curtain and then leaving the yacht.
It also shows her trying to revive him in a panic as he slipped into unconsciousness in the small craft harbour in Santa Cruz.
Deputy District Attorney Rafael Vazquez said: There was an obvious reaction that showed she didnt intend to kill.
Vazquez said the charges were filed over the objections of Hayes family, who feared a public trial would further embarrass a wife and children traumatized by exposure of the Google executives double life. Hayes was the father of five, and two of his children are in elementary school.
They just wanted this to go away, the prosecutor said. But we had a duty to pursue the case.

A gangland fugitive has finally been caught after he tried to sign up for a model agency.
Ben Fiberesima, who also called himself Roky Million,launched a successful career in Australia where he was on the run for weapons and fraud offences.
By the age of 26 he boast that he was worth seven figures.
Under the name Roky Millionhis hip hop career saw his work dubbed the greatest UK Hip Hop Record of all time by one newspaper.
His book, Rokys Power Gain 50 claims to have helped create 317 millionaires.
But he eventually returned to the UK and signed up with a London modelling agency and thats when policefinally caught him.
MORE: Two more arrests over Hatton Garden heist
Officers posed as representatives of a company called WOU Photography and contacted the agency about hiring Fiberesima as a model for a new range of sportswear.
He arrived for the planned casting meeting on September 3, 2014, and was arrested at the entrance of the photographic studios in Kentish Town.
He was jailed for three years and nine months at Harrow Crown Court on May 6 after being found guilty of two counts of theft, two counts of fraud and one of possessing a weapon.

In September 2008, police first entered his flat in Christchurch Avenue, Harrow, north-west London and discovered a stun gun, a canister of CS gas and a stoeln chequebook belonging to a neighbour.
He was arrested and bailed, but disappeared before his first court appearance.
Detective Inspector Pete Wallis of Brent CID said: There is clear message here, that we will not forget you if you offend, and we will explore all options in tracing you and bringing you to justice.
Mr Fibersima used false identities to evade capture for five years and developed a very public persona in Australia and internationally as a rap artist and model.
Thankfully he is now paying for his crimes, due to the perseverance of Brents Wanted Offenders Unit.

Itwas then 3D-printed in medical-grade titanium, and fitted to the turtle in a two-and-a-half-hour operation.
There is still a small chance the prosthetic could be rejected by the turtle, but if that is not the case, it will return to the sea shortly, where it will look infinitelycooler than all the other turtles.

(Picture ESA)
Are space druids building weird circles of standing stones on our comets?
Cameras on the Rosetta space probe have spotted what appears to be a huge Stonehenge-style circle of standing stones  on the surface of a comet.
No white-robed figures have been seen nearby, but the probe is still looking.
One of the rocks  a huge boulder with a diameter of around 90 feet  appears to be balanced precariously on the comets surface.
We had noticed this formation already in earlier images, however, at first the boulders did not seem to differ substantially from others we had seen, says OSIRIS scientist Sebastien Besse from ESA, who first noticed the formation.
How this apparent balancing rock on Comet 67P/C-G was formed is not clear at this point, says OSIRIS Principal Investigator Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany.
The scientists believe that the rocks may have moved from their original location, due to transport processes on the surface.

The researchers say, Scattered boulders are seen in many places on the comets surface, sometimes in otherwise relatively smooth regions.
One of the largest  Cheops  measures approximately 45 metres in size and sits in the middle of the smooth part of Imhotep on the underside of the comets large lobe. In other regions, it is more common to see rubble piles comprising hundreds of boulders.
The scientists hope that further detailed imaging of the rocks and other formations on the comets surface will reveal more information.

A 42-year-old photographer has been living as an elderly woman for two years for her latest project.
Kyoko Hamada, who grew up in Japan before moving to the US aged 15, got the idea for a photo project after volunteering to visit lonely senior citizens in their homes.

Since 2012, she has been posing as the fictional Kikuchiyo-san and taking photographs of herself for her99-photo collection I Used to Be You.
No one seemed to care, or even notice me. Its already very easy to feel ignored in New York City, but as Kikuchiyo-san, I sometimes felt totally invisible, she told the Huffington Post .
I have always been drawn to elders. I often sense an otherworldly air from them as though they are still living in another time.

Hamada, who has had her work featured in thePDN Photo Annual, Communication Arts, PDN Under 30, American Photography Annuals and the NY Photo Festival, said that the name of the project came from what Kikuchiyo-san might tell her if they ever met.
Shes now trying to publish her photo collection and has started a Kickstarter campaign to try and raise the $10,000 she needs.

Denmark took a big step towards getting rid of paper money forever  after theDanish Chamber of Commerce recommended that shops be allowed to ban cash.
Instead, retailers would switch to using debit and credit cards and smartphone payments only.
If the measure is approved by Parliament, retailers could reject customers who try to use cash from January 2016.
Weverecognised what merchants have been telling us for some time now, said Sofie Findling Andersen of theDanish Chamber of Commerce.
Using cash is expensive, because it takes time for salaried employees to handle, and its also a security concern.

A further two men have been arrested over the raid at Hatton Garden, where thieves made off with an estimated 200million in jewels and cash.
Nine suspects in total have now been detained by Flying Squad officers investigating the heist following raids at 12 addresses in north London and Kent.
The men were aged between 48 and 76 and are being held for conspiracy to steal, said Detective Superintendent Craig Turner, head of Flying Squad.

A man put his girlfriends puppies in a bag and then ran them over in his van because they were making a mess of the house, police said.
Jeremy Ellis, 41, was reportedly seen while his girlfriend was away opening the passenger-side door of his van and dropping a trash bag containing sevenfour-week-old Chihuahua puppies.
Witnesses said they heard the distraught crying of the dogs. Ellis was then reportedly seen running them over.
Somebody needs to run over him, said an angry neighbour of Elliss, who chose not to be identified.

He couldve easily loaded them up in that van and taken them to a shelter or something.
The neighbour added that he had started feeding the puppies because Ellis was deliberately neglecting them while his girlfriend was away.
Elliss girlfriend called police when she came home and found the puppies gone. She told officers Ellis had text messaged her saying he had got rid of the puppies because they were making a mess of the house.
Two of the puppies had to be put down following the incident.
Ellis is charged with seven felony counts of animal cruelty.

A Russian YouTuber has shown off an incredible car theft technique which looks so smooth it should be in Grand Theft Auto.
Thief One pops out, slaps a bit of paper on the car.
When the Victim pops out to investigate, Thief Two jumps into the drivers seat and zooms off.
Before you get too afraid, though, we should point out that this technique is a bit of an urban myth which circulates regularly, according to Snopes .
The mythbusting website says, Our law enforcement contacts have also noted that although the process described above could be used by carjackers, they were unfamiliar with any cases of cars being taken in this manner.

This video appears to show the emotional moment a blind man was able to see for the first time in 21 years.
In the clip, the father  known only as Daniel  can be seen anxiously waiting to open his eyes after successfully undergoing a cornea transplant.
And as his daughter encouragingly shouts youre doing great dad, he opens his eyes for the first time.
He appears visibly stunned as he manages to finally see and shouts wow as he takes in his surroundings for the first time in more thantwo decades.
But perhaps the most touching moment occurs when he is able to see his daughter for the first time in her lifeand lovingly describes her as more beautiful than I could ever have imagined.
It is not clear where the short clip was filmed, although the comments suggest it is at a private eye hospital in theUnited States.
Metro has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Shakespeare? (Picture: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images)
Its finder has called the portrait purporting to show William Shakespeare the literary discovery of the century.
Others disagree.
In fact, some experts havegreeted the claim with derision, with the director of the Shakespeare Institute calling it a hallucination.
The picture was identified by botanist and historian Mark Griffiths, who edits Country Life magazine, in the first edition of a 16th century book on plants called The Herball.
The engraving, which apparently shows Shakespeare in a Roman outfit, is the work of William Rogers. Only around 15 copies of the book are said to exist.
MORE: Here are eight bizarre and little-known facts about Shakespeare
The portrait is very different to thepaintings of the Bard that were used to (Picture: Oli Scarff/Getty Images)
Mr Griffiths claims he cracked the many-layered Tudor code to reveal Shakepeare, along with the books author, John Gerard, Rembert Dodoens, a Flemish botanist, and Queen Elizabeths Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, who are the other figures in the picture.
This is the only known verifiable portrait of the worlds greatest writer in his lifetime, he said.
Its an absolutely extraordinary discovery.
But Professor Michael Dobson, director of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, dismissed the picture, even saying that he wasnt sure that Country Lifes reputation will recover.
One has seen so many claims on Shakespeare based on somebody claiming to crack a code, he said.
I cant imagine any reason why Shakespeare would be in a botany textbook. Its a lovely picture.
Its nice that people are so fond of Shakespeare that they see him everywhere, even in the pages of a botany textbook. But its hallucination.
Paul Edmondson, head of research and knowledge for the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, added: I see there a figure who is dressed like a Classical poet, with a green bay on his head, but that doesnt make him Shakespeare.

A man has claimed that he accidentally had sex with his wifes identical twin sister in the dark  and only realised when he reached round to feel her boobs afterward.
Then his wife walked in.
All a bit awkward.
We should point out that this comes from a Reddit post where all the names have been changed, and which reads suspiciously like it came from a pornographic magazine, so pinch of salt is advised.
The poster, going under the moniker Not Thesis, claims that the trio were on holiday in Las Vegas, got drunk, then he found himself in bed with a woman he thought was his wife.
They made brief, but passionate, love before he reached round and found a big pair of plastic honkers  and realised it was his wifes sister, Jody.
Not Thesis writes, Even though they are twins, I absolutely have no interest in her. Jody is more of a party girl,selfish and vain (She has plastic boobs). My wife is sweet, all natural, kind and selfless.
By this time it was 2am and we start to stumble our way up to our room. We were pretty hammered. Next thing you know, im face down on the bed out cold.

We cuddle and I start to fondle her boobs. I notice they were quite firm and almost balloon like. In my drunken state, I immediately froze. I realized I just fucked my wifes sister.
About a few seconds later the lights turn on and my wife witnesses both myself and Jody naked. Shes screaming at the at the both of us. Jody wakes up and jumps out of bed. What the fuck is going on?? Uh, umm, I didnt.. uh umm I couldnt muster anything.
Fast forward to today, we are separated.
Naturally, Reddit had a few questions for the unfortunate lurve machine.
One poster asked, So the wife was doing what when he laid down? And only a few moments passed until he woke up and the sister was in the bed with him even though she stayed back?
And why did the sister get in bed with him? Still again, where was the wife all this time?
These are all good points.

A young Mum who was baffled by this David Cameron guy who kept popping up in her news feed asked her friends the big question.
Whos David Cameron and why do people keep posting about him?
The question came just days after the general election where (in case you missed it) David Cameron was re-elected Prime Minister.
Somehow, Devon Boon, 21, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, missed all that.
Her friends quickly replied, Please tell me your joking?
Devon replied, No lol? I would Google it but my phones slow.
She said, I dont watch the news or read the newspapers so Id never heard of him until people started talking about him last week. I thought he must be a celebrity or something.
The last I heard, Tony Blair was the Prime Minister. But I dont think its my fault. I dont watch the news and we didnt get taught about politics in school so why should I be expected to know these things?
They should teach you about the government and politics and mortgages at school. Instead, they teach you about the parts of a leaf and how flowers reproduce which no-one is ever going to need to know.

Were fairly sure this isnt how this type of scenario is supposed to go down.
When a fully-grown bear approached Swede Ralph Perrson, it was the outdoorsman that came out on top thanks to his crazy roar.
Mr Perrson, from Ljusdal, north of Stockholm, was training his pet beagle in the forest when the dogs bark changed  and he realised another animal was close.
But the experienced outdoorsman saved him, his wife and his dog from a certain mauling when he lifted his arms up and roared in the bears direction  and it ran away.
To lie down and play dead I do not believe in, the outdoorsman said (Picture: YouTube)
I suspected when the dog changed (there might be a) bear, said Mr Perrson.
You have to have respect for the animals.
I cried all I could and made (myself) very great. It was a metre away from me.
To lie down and play dead I do not believe in.
Were impressed.
But not as impressed as we were by this man , who responded to a bear appearing outside his house by punching it in the face.

Cute, but why would you eat one?(Picture: File)
A teacher decided to give his pupils an extracirrcular lesson recently, by allegedly eating a live hamster in front of them.
Police are investigating the teacher, identified only asYu, who reportedly gave the little rodent his grisly end to show the pupils in his South Korean classroom how dear life is.
The class he was teaching at a boarding school inJeongeup, North Jeolla Province were reportedly teasing hamsters, causing him to take the drastic (and, lets be honest, over the top) method of teaching them a lesson.
Yu is also accused of using abusive language in front of the seven children who claim to have witnessed the gruesome act.

He has since left the school following complaints from several parents and other members of staff.
Some parents have filed a complaint with the police, claiming that Yus actions were a form of child abuse.
He has since apologised for the incident.
Yu toldYonhap News Agency: I couldnt control the situation and couldnt stand it.
While watching the hamsters die from teasing, I thought I should teach the children it was wrong to make light of life.

A man caught with more than 1,000 stolen eggs in his fridge has claimed he stole them from the factory where he worked for personal consumption
Not only that, he had scribbled dates on them in pen to remind him when to eat his next eggy delight.
The 47-year-old security guard, whose surname was Gu, was spotted by police smuggling two suitcases of stolen goods out of the factory where he worked in Pinghu City, China.
Police found more than 1,000 eggs in his fridge, as well as meat, soap, boxes of tissues and bottles of detergent.
Gu said, I lost count how many times I have stolen. Probably hundreds of times. I have stolen everything in my house. 
A spokesman for the factory said: We are as surprised as everyone else that it was the security guard.

Fittingly, perhaps, for a Treasury minister, newly-appointed Greg Hands was absolutely thrilled to find 6.35 had been left on the cafeteria card he inherited from his predecessor.
Mr Hands, who is the MP for Chelsea and Fulham, was appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in last weeks cabinet reshuffle.
And he was thrilled to find that his predecessor, Lib Dem Danny Alexander had left 6.35 on the card used to purchase food at the Treasury cafeteria, taking to Twitter to announcethe good news.

However on Monday morning an gunman broke into her home and shot her in the head while she rehearsed.
Mutlu, who is currently in a critical condition in hospital, lives inDiyarbakir  a very conservative region in the south-east of Turkey.

She had reportedly been receiving death threats due to her participation in the show, and had shared her fears of being hurt with the shows production team.
Mahmet Kaya, Mutlus father, told local media: My beautiful girl Mutlu, how could they wound you? I am very sad.
Despite the conservative values of the region,almost half of the MPs in the city of Diyarbakir are female, and the Kurdish womans movement is very strong in the area.

Itmay be the best job in the world, if you like being absolutely blitzed all day long.
Jake Browne, 32, writes weekly weed reviews for the Denver Post, where he writes up some of the mind-bendingly strong strains of dope such asRed Headed Stranger, Afghan Haze and Bio-Diesel which were recently legalised in the state.
Browne goes into one of Colorados many new legal weed shops, sparks up, and writes up how the grass makes him feel.
Better still, he writes them up in the style of posh wine reviewers.
Whats notably absent are the chocolate notes, instead its more of a stale coffee youd get from a Starbucks cup discarded to a passenger-side car floor.  Its a Christmas tree, but stripped of the bulbous ornaments, he wrote, possibly while still off his gourd.
MORE: Theres a drive-through that takes weed as payment
Browne told the Washington Post, Usually every week I go to a different shop and get [a strain] and review for structure  how it looks, how it smells, how it tastes. Its similar to wine criticism, but I get to talk about how it makes me feel as well.
I think its really essential with there being so many questions that people have these days.

Hunting is a barbarous activity carried out by people who couldnt care less about the welfare of wild animals  if you believe the likes of Ricky Gervais and Brian May.
However, any genuine scrutiny of their viewpoint provesit to be false.
I say this as a former executive director of the League Against Cruel Sports  one of a number of people who worked for that organisation who have changed their minds on the validity of the anti-hunt case.
Better say this 1 more time. There is NO EXCUSE for Blood Hunting. Along w/ bear baiting &amp; witch burning, has no place in civilisation. Bri

 Ricky Gervais (@rickygervais) May 9, 2015
Do you believe wildlife should be managed? Most agree that its important to keep a diverse range of indigenous wild animals and plants. This biodiversity protects human interests, combats disease and benefits vulnerable species. To argue, as some do, just to leave everything to nature, is to ignore these issues.
How then is this to be achieved? Try to a step back from the propaganda about hunting being just killing for fun. Of course people ride or follow hunts for recreation, but they are also funding the process.
The business end of the activity is the hounds. Importantly, hunting with hounds is non-wounding  the quarry animal either gets caught or escapes unscathed.
Hunting generally catches the old, weak, diseased or injured and in doing so is similar to the way in which wolves and other wild canines hunt. The process is not about the numbers killed, but the health and size of the population left alive.
We hear a lot about what certain groups dislike, but little about what they support. If they genuinely wish to improve the welfare of wild animals they should support the proposal for a new wild mammals welfare law. This would create an offence for genuine cruelty to all wild mammals in all circumstances, based on evidence  not opinion, prejudice or propaganda.
There will be some people who will never agree with this view and refuse to accept that hunting is justified on moral grounds. Yet to ban an activity, while ignoring the other methods that will fill the vacuum, is nothing more than pseudo-morality.

Vallencia Community College (Picture Getty)
An American college is being sued after two students claimed they were forced to submit to transvaginal probes as part of training in the procedure.
The students claim that older students would sometimes sexually stimulate them before inserting a probe covered in a condom, using large amounts of lubrication.
One one occasion, an older student told one girl she was sexy and should consider working as an escort girl as she inserted the probe.
The two medical students claim they were told they were in danger of having their grades reduced and of being blacklisted by future employers unless they agreed.

According to the lawsuit, the college, had a second-year student, Jennifer Astor (nicknamed the TransVag Queen) explain the medical diagnostic sonography programs faculty believed that students should undergo invasive transvaginal ultrasound procedures in order to become better sonography technicians.
Students, endured these invasive probes without a modicum of privacy. Plaintiffs would disrobe in a restroom, drape themselves in towels, and traverse the sonography classroom in full view of instructors and other students.
A student would place a condom over the probe and then apply generous amounts of lubrication to the probe. In some cases, the student would have to sexually stimulate plaintiffs in order to facilitate inserting the probe into plaintiffs vaginas.

If Labour washoping to come out of its current crisis stronger, more united and ready to win backhuge swathes of the public following the General Election, the current leadership contest may raise some eyebrows.
Not only are all five of the candidateswhite, theyre all Oxbridge-educated too.
In fact, bar one, they all have a pretty similar haircut.
Thats not to say their education isa bad thing. But for a party desperate not only to show itsstill in touch withthe working people ofthe UK but that its representative of Britain as a whole, it might be seen that way.
A quick perusal of Twitter would confirm that.

Now, more than 5,000 people have joined a Facebook group which is organising a vigil for the cow.
Organisers of the event have invited people to wear cow onesies and bring candles to the field where the animal met her end.

But they insisted that their vigil was not a joke: We are sick of being portrayed as a rough run-down community, they wrote.
We are doing this to show our great community spirit and get some positive recognition for once.
Paying tribute on the RIP Wallsend Cow page, Joseph Lennon wrote: Can we all sing Candle in the Wind by Elton John? I think that would be a fitting gesture for Bessie.

During the incident, Northumbria police had to close a section of the Coast Road from Newcastle to Tynemouth as attempts to catch one of the escapees in a nearby field proved difficult.
Aspokesperson for the force said: The cow was in a highly distressed state and considered to be a significant risk to members of the public and motorists.
The decision was made for the animal to be destroyed by firearms officers at the scene.
The vigil is set to be held on Friday evening.

The paintings are actually 3D pieces which give the illusion of depth, making the painting seem like a real view as you walk past it.
As far as we are aware poor Dmitry is still in the art show, staring in awe at the art work.

        <MainBody>Rob Waugh for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 19 May 2015 1:39 pm
Science has finally unraveled one of the big mysteries of the human race  why men exist.
It turns out that the answer isnt our awesome DIY skills.
Researchers from the University of East Anglia set out to solve why males exist.
Scientists have puzzled over the question about why species bother with males  while in many species, their only contribution to reproduction is a load of sperm.
The scientists found that the process of sexual selection when males compete for female attention and females choose between them  improves the health of populations, and protects species against becoming extinct.
Lead researcher Prof Matt Gage, from UEAs School of Biological Sciences, said: Our research shows that competition among males for reproduction provides a really important benefit, because it improves the genetic health of populations.
Sexual selection achieves this by acting as a filter to remove harmful genetic mutations, helping populations to flourish and avoid extinction in the long-term.

To be good at out-competing rivals and attracting partners in the struggle to reproduce, an individual has to be good at most things, so sexual selection provides an important and effective filter to maintain and improve population genetic health.
The scientists made their discovery by forcing beetles to inbreed on purpose for 10 years  and removing sexual selection by forcing one male to breed with one female.
The researchers found that, without sex, populations rapidly became a genetic disaster area. Hence, men are a pretty good thing to have around.

His victims loved ones were in court today as Chua, who wore an impassive face throughout the entire trial, was told he would serve a minimum of 35 years before being eligible for parole.
Mr Justice Openshaw told the court: He has committed a dreadful crime and he must now pay the price.
His victims loved ones packed the public gallery above the dock where Chua sat below, with 10 jurors returning to court to see him sent down following a trial stretching over four months.
All sat grim faced in silence as Mr Justice Openshaw recounted the pain, suffering and deaths of his victims and the anguish of their loved ones.
Stifled cries could be heard from the public gallery as Chua was taken down.
Passing sentence Mr Justice Openshaw added: What he did was inexplicable and irrational.
It is a striking, sinister and truly wicked feature of the case, he did not personally administer contaminated products directly to most of these patients but having left saline bags contaminated with insulin he did not know which nurse would unwittingly collect them and still less to which patient the nurse would then unwittingly administer the poison.

In the tweets, which have been viewedmore than 300,000 timeson Imgur , Javier impressively explained that he had enjoyed a glass of orange juice  but also happened to speak a variety of languages.

But then Imgur users got creative, and decided to put their own spin on Javiers idea.

And another showed some committed, but not necessarily legal, determination.
But most users just seemed pretty impressed that Javiers idea was so mad that it just might work.

To some people, youmayseem like this after one too many drinks (hilarious, life and soul of the party).
And to others, youll just seem a bit like this.
But theres a reason for that, and its because of the way that alcohol reacts to receptors in our brains.
Writing for The Conversation , Dr Ian Mitchell ofthe University of Birmingham explained the reason for those drunken acts of stupidity that we always regret in the days after.
Dr Mitchellexplained: Alcohol impairs the activity of the brain circuits that make us feel anxious and, at higher doses, alcohol inactivates a second set of brain circuits that control fear so threatening stimuli no longer seem quite so scary.
Alcohol also compromises our ability to compute risk so that situations we would normally shy away from may now seem quite inviting.
MORE: It looks like Queen Elizabeth': Dad regrets botched tattoo of his daughter on his arm
(Picture: PA)
And when it comes to getting a little bit rowdy after a few, it seems this happens because alcohol can corrupt our ability to understand the intentions of others.
The brain contains specific circuits, which connect parts of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and temporal parietal junction that handle our social cognitive abilities, he writes.
Alcohol also impedes our ability to accurately interpret emotional expressions in the face.
As we drink, we have a tendency to erroneously assume that some facial expressions of negative emotions are happy, and we find it particularly difficult to identify sad and angry faces. This leaves us prone to making embarrassing social errors.
Dr Martinalso stressed that while the effect of alcohol will wear off the next day, the long-terms effects of it certainly wont.
Chronic heavy drinking can lead to brain damage and irreversible cognitive impairments, especially poor memory function, and psychiatric problems including depression, psychoses, anxiety and suicide, he added.

She was even recorded on camera defending her views, and said ethnic minority women couldnt be racist as they do not stand to gain.
But now, students have started a petition to remove Mustafa from her job, and a change.org entry has garnered 2,700 signatures so far.
The current welfare and diversity officer has used hate speech based on race and gender, the petition reads.
For example, the consistent use of hashtags such as #Killallwhitemen and #misandry, and publicly calling someone white trash under the official GSU Welfare and Diversity Officer Twitter account.

The Twitter account has since been taken down, and Ms Mustafa has admitted that her use of the term white trash wasnot professional.
But she has defended the use of the controversial hashtag, and referred to it as in-jokes and ways that many people in the queer feminist community express ourselves.
Its a way of reclaiming the power from the trauma many of us experience as queers, women, people of colour, who are on the receiving end of racism, misogyny and homophobia daily, she said.
If the petition is signed by three percent of students union members, a vote of no confidence will be held for Ms Mustafas position, and she will lose her job if two thirds of voters in that ballot decided to go against her.
In response to the petition calling for her to be sacked, an open letter ofsolidarity has since been started on Change.org as well. It has 1,300 signatories so far .

Perhaps this is why Bob Marley was only five foot seven.
Smoking cannabis actually stunts growth in teenage boys, according to a new study.
The researchers at the Pir Mehr Ali Shah Agriculture University Rawalpindi in Pakistan compared growth rates and hormone levels in 220 non-smoking teenagers and 217 heavy cannabis users.
They found that smoking cannabis increased levels of puberty hormones such astestosterone and luteinising hormone (LH) in the smokers  but decreased growth hormone levels.
The result is early onset of puberty  but the non-smoking boys were on average four kilos heavier and 4.6 inches taller by the age of 20 than the dope smokers.
Study leader Dr. Syed Shakeel Raza Rizvi said: Marijuana use may provoke a stress response that stimulates onset of puberty but suppresses growth rate.
Early puberty is associated with younger age of onset of drinking and smoking, and early matures have higher levels of substance abuse because they enter the risk period at an early level of emotional maturity.

Why talk when you can emoji? (Picture: Emoji/Apple)
Emoji is now the fastest growing language in the UK , apparently.
This must mean were all fairly fluent in those little symbols infecting every tweet, text and Facebook post these days, right?
Well, were going to give you a chance to put your knowledge to the test  can you decipher these 10 historical events as told through emoji?
If you want a little warm up, try reading The Big Lebowski in emoji format (thats right, it actually exists).
A big day for her at least

Funny guys (Picture: AP/Rex)
You might think youre pretty witty on Twitter, but its fair to say youve never reached a presidential level of banter.
All you can really do is aspire to be like Bill Clinton and President Obama, who have taught us all that world leaders (and former world leaders) have still got jokes.
Barack Obama finally received his own personal Twitter account recently, under the handle POTUS (President Of The United State).
So far he has only posted three tweets, but already the cheeky Bill Clinton is trying to get in on the action.
Welcome to @Twitter , @POTUS ! One question: Does that username stay with the office? #askingforafriend

War veteran, 82, sacked on the spot from B&amp;Q after leaving till open for just 3minutes

An 82-year-old war veteran has been sacked from B&amp;Q for leaving the till open for just three-and-a-half minutes.
Ivor Smith was marched out of the store in Parkhead, Glasgow, by security guards despite having worked for the company for 12 years.
The great-grandfather, who started working for B&amp;Q when he was 70, had previously been hailed as an outstanding employee, before the incident.
Mr Smith told an employment tribunal: They treated me with utter contempt.
I did my national service and served my country and yet I get treated like this. I loved that job.
Mr Smith, who worked for Hoover for 47 years as an apprentice and toolmaker, served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in Malaysia as Britain fought the communists in 1955 and 1956.
He has seven children, 25 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
The hearing has been adjourned until July but a B&amp;Q spokesperson told The Daily Record:We can confirm this case is ongoing but cannot say anything about it specifically that might prejudice the legal process.
B&amp;Q have a strong track record of employing older workers. We removed the compulsory retirement age in the mid-1990s and more than 30 per cent of our current employees are over 50.

This dog might be deaf, but that definitely hasnt stopped him from rocking out at this concert and having the time of his life.
In the clip, the small white dog appears to be taking part in some impressive headbanging as he runs around the local city centre where a concert was being held to celebrate the end of the Second World War.
And despite reportedly being 17-years-old, the dog seems to be running round with all the enthusiasm of an animal half its age.
Rock on! (Picture: YouTube)
Its unclear what exactly caused the dog to rock out, but were hoping that he managed to hear a bit of the music and just got in the mood of the event.

A study by Talk Talk mobilefound that 80 per cent of us now use the digital symbols to converse on a regular basis.
Prof Evans describes emojis as like modern hieroglyphics, pointing out just how many are of cats faces.
He also warns against using emojis when breaking bad news or in formal settings such as job applications.
Here are the ten most popular emojis used by Brits today:
