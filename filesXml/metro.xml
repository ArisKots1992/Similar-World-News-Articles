Last week the Supreme Court of the United States voted to legalise gay marriage across the country in a landmark decision.
While most people celebrated this progressive moment in the name of equality, a few bigots thought it was the perfect time to spew some nonsense, naturally.
Leading the charge was conservative loud mouth Bryan Fischer, who compared the Supreme Courts decision to 9/11  also known as one of the worst acts of terrorism in history.
Fischer, who hosts an anti-gay radio show for the American Family Association, wrote a blog post titled SCOTUS blows up twin towers of truth and righteousness, SCOTUS referring to the Supreme Court Of The United States.
In the post Fischer labelled June 26, 2015 as a date which will live in infamy.

It is a day on which behaviour which is an abomination in the eyes of a holy God was normalized, promoted, celebrated and imposed on a nation built on the foundation of the Judeo-Christian tradition, he writes.
No only does he claim America has become Sodom and Gomorrah, but even refers to supporters of the ruling as the Gay Gestapo.

Obviously if Fischer had ever read a single book about the Nazis he would know they were almost as anti-gay as he is.
The heartbroken Fischer even says the ruling was the day the music died in the United States of America.

The suspect accused of decapitating a man in France allegedly sent a selfie in which he posed with the victims severed head, a source close to the investigation said.
Yassin Salhi, 35, was arrested after he allegedly drove his van into a warehouse containing dangerous gases in Lyon, France. Police then found a severed head nearby.
And a legal source has said that Salhi reportedly sent a selfie in which he posed with the head via WhatsApp, though investigators are working to identify the recipient.
Father-of-three Salhi was described by a co-worker as being calm and mysterious.

Asurfer filmed his heart-stopping encounter with a Great White Shark off the coast of Australia.
Like a scene from Jaws, the shark circled the surfer for several minutes as he paddled through the water near Manly beach in Sydney.
The surfer can be heard breathing hard as he desperately tries to get back toshallower water without disturbing the Great White, the outline of which can be clearly seen underwater just a few feet away.
The man eventually made it back to shore, but he was one of the lucky ones. A surfer was killed by a Great White on Shelly Beach near Ballina, Australia, in February this year.

Theres a creature that looks like Donald Trumps hair and it slithers around in theforest
Harry Readhead for Metro.co.uk Saturday 27 Jun 2015 4:50 pm
This caterpillar bears a startling resemblance to Donald Trumps hair.
Its a flannel moth caterpillar,something that looks fuzzy and cute but is actually covered in poisonous barbs that can cause humans to get headaches and vomit.
Like Donald Trump, some might argue.
The caterpillar has such a reputation for causing harm that other animals, including at least one Amazonian bird, have evolved to look like it to deter predators.
But even if they are nasty pieces of work, were still fans.

Honey bees hold several advantages over dogs (Picture: Getty Images)
As marijuana laws change across the globe, the number of active drug-sniffing dogs diminishes.
Dope-sniffing canineshave been forced into retirement because they are trained to give the same alert for all illegal substances and training them to detect only the amounts that are illegal is not cost or time-effective.
If a dog hits on marijuana, you dont know whether youre going to find one ounce in that suitcase or six pounds, Steve Davis of Lakewood Police Department in Colorado told Bloomberg .
But it seems scientists have found an unlikely solution: honey bees.

Sniffer dogs cant distinguish between different amounts of weed (Picture: Getty Images)
According to research at the University of Cologne, the humble honey bee is able to distinguish between any narcotic from caffeine to cannabis andperform individual alerts for each.
The bee has other advantages over the dog. They are inexpensive to produce and maintain and they do not form bonds with humans, which means biased detections  which dogs will occasionally do to please their master  are not likely to happen.
This is not the first time honey bees have been in the news this week. Only yesterday, it was announced that Oslo was constructing a bee highway to restore dwindling populations in the city.

More shocking news in the world of swimming pools: They can give you diarrhea.
Only last week we learnt that red, stinging eyes is caused by sweat and urine  not chlorine. And now cases of illness outbreaks in poolsis increasing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US documented90 illness outbreaks reported in 32 states and Puerto Rico for the years 2011 to 2012.
This affected nearly 1,800 people  95 of which were taken to hospital.
Cryptosporidium is the parasite causing all these problems. It leads todiarrhea, and vomiting.
Itcan survive for ten days or more even in water thats heavily chlorinated.
Michele Hlavsa, lead author of the report, told CBS News: This parasite is extremely chlorine-resistant.
Swimmers bring it into the water when they are sick with diarrhea.
Basically just dont ever swim.
TheCDC has issued guidelines on how to swim safely  they include not pooing in the water which is, you know, fairly obviously.

Yesterday, the world celebrated after the Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage across the United States.
But inevitably, not everyone was happy.
Step forward Fox News to provide some ill-informed ignorance.
In a broadcast hosted by anchor Martha MacCallum shortly after the ruling was announced, she questioned if the ruling now meant that three people could enter into a marriage together.
Were just trying to think about the ramifications, when a precedent is set, what it means down the road, right? she worriedly asked.
(Picture: Fox News/ YouTube)
So, suppose three people say We want to be a marriage. Were three people and we love each other and we want to be a marriage. Whats to prevent that under this?
Well its pretty simple really.
Same-sex marriage permits the union of a couple of the same gender. The key word there is COUPLE  TWO PEOPLE, DOS, DEUX, and ZWEI.

Rats just wanna get out and see the world man (Picture: Alamy)
Considering that theyre known for crawling through the sprawling subterranean networks of the world, it should come as no surprise that rats actually dream about the places they want to go.
Thats according to researchers from University College London  who claimed that when the rodents are shown an inaccessible food treat, theyre likely to dream about how they can get it when they nod off to sleep.
Or as lead researcher Hugo Spiers put it: Its like looking at a holiday brochure for Greece the day before you go  that night you might dream about the pictures.
The discovery was made by the team after they placed four rats at the bottom of a T-shaped pathway, where the animals could see the food but couldnt access it.

They were then encouraged to fall asleep in a nest  and their brain activity was recorded with 50 electrodes as they slept.
And after they were finally put back in the maze , the animals were seen to run along the arm of the T shape that had been previously blocked  which suggested that they had been carefully planning their strategy while in the land of nod.
But it gets slightly weirder too  as researchers have previously been able to alter the dreams of mice, reminiscent of the film Inception. They stimulated the brains of mice so that they were more likely to scamper to a certain place when awake  which sounds suspiciously like mind control to us.

A man has been taken to hospital after his penis was split in a drive-by banana attack.
The victim from Westfield, Massachusetts, US,claims he was struck in the genitals by the fruit after it was thrown out of a car window.
He was found lying at the side of the road yelling in pain near the Quick Food convenience store on Southwick Road, according to a police report.
A worried passer-by raised the alarm as the man managed to stumble towards the store.
Officer Richard Mazza wrote in his report: The male party stated he was struck in the banana by a banana. When asked what he meant, he stated he was struck in the groin by a banana thrown out of the window of a passing vehicle.
The man was taken to Noble Hospital and got a sick note giving him the following day off work

Miss Balch, who had a four-and-a-half hour wait for rescue, has previously told the BBC: It felt like slow motion. We banged into the car in front. I felt the bars go into my knees; we moved backwards and the car went into us again.
I passed out. I was awoken by Dan shouting my name. Everyone was screaming and I was in excruciating pain. I looked down and I could see blood all over.
The bars were in my right knee.
The only thought that was going through my mind for the hours and hours that we were stuck was that we were going to die. If I was going to survive I would never walk again, that was certain.
I thought it was never going to end. I just wanted to die.

British holidaymaker Gary Pine told Sky News that he first became aware of the attack the hotel where he was staying became eerily quiet.
The beach tends to be full up very quickly so its the usual story of getting down to lay your towel at half past six to get a decent beach position, so all of the beach positions were taken, he said.
Theres a lot of people walking up and down, taking in this lovely weather, so its a very busy beach, but as I said it became apparent very quick that it was something more than firecrackers when you could hear bullets whizzing around, he added.

Rick Scarborough has some strong views (Picture: Getty Images)
The news that the US Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide is good news for supporters of civil liberty, gay people and, well, reasonable people.
But its not good news for this guy.
Rick Scarborough, a Baptist pastor from Texas, has some fairly strong opinions on the topic of gay marriage.
Hes so against gay marriage he saidhe would burn andin his battle against the idea.
Now, we dont want to put words into Mr. Scarboroughs mouth, but when he said he would burn, we assume he meant he would set himself on fire.
Which means hes faced with a pretty tough decision, as decisions go.
When Mr. Scarborough isnt threatening self-immolation, he runs a podcast called the National Emergency Coalition show, which is linked to a group run by the equally-charming EW Jackson called Staying True to Americas National Destiny (Stand).
Nice acronym.

The drones maiden voyage is from Frankfurt to an undisclosed location in Poland (Picture: Getty Images)
A pro-choice activist group is planning todistributeabortion pills via an Abortion Drone into countries where terminationsareillegal.
Which might upset a few people.
Dutch group Women on Waves collaborated with a number of other European pro-choice organisations for the Abortion Drones maiden flight, which will take it from Frankfurt, Germany, to an as-yet-undisclosed location in Poland, one of the few European countries where abortion is not legal.
For obvious reasons, Women on Waves are keeping quiet about the drones exact destination. Yet they remain confident they are not breaking any laws.
As the Abortion drone weighs less than 5 kg, is not used for any commercial purposes, will stay within the sight of the person flying it and does not fly in controlled airspace, no authorisation is required under Polish or German law, group founder Rebecca Gomperts told ScienceAlert .
MORE: Ed Miliband has become unstoppably sassy on Twitter
We want to create awareness about womens right to a safe abortion.
The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.
In Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals dont help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but its the women who dont have the means or access to information who are suffering.
According to the Guardian , some pro-life groups have threatened to shootdown the drone if it goes ahead with its mission.
Gomperts, however, isnt too concerned.
Its not easy to shoot down a drone, she said.

Its good to look afterbees.
Theyre only small.
Also, if they die out, we only have about four years left to live.
Apparently the people of Oslo, Norway, have realised this, as they are in the process of developing a highway for the beleaguered honey bee, the population of which has been dwindling in the countrys urban areas.
The bee highway consists of a network of flowers across buildings in the city which allow the insects safe passage, resting spots and places to live, The Verge reports.
Some firms have allowed their rooftops to become homes for new bee populations (Picture: Getty Images)

The programme is led by Bybi, an environmental group dedicated to rebuilding urban bee populations. Bybi approached local companies to secure funding, and some of these firms have gone sofar as to creatededicated homes for the bee on their rooftops.
We are constantly reshaping our environment to meet our needs, forgetting that other species also live in it, said Agnes Lyche Melvaer, head of Bybi.
To correct that we need to return places to them to live and feed.
A companion website, Pollinatorpassasjen , tracks the hives and movement of honey bee populations across Oslo.

should we tell the people threatening to move to Canada that gay marriage is legal there too? Or just let them find out once they get there?

Aftermath of terror attack in Sousse, Tunisia
Adevastating attack on a Tunisian beach resort left at least 27 people dead and many more injured today.
While many of the details surrounding the attack are still unclear, some reports now claim the gunman or gunmen arrived on the beach via an inflatable boat from the sea.
Tunisian radio Mosaique FM interviewed eyewitnesses of the attack who said they saw gunmen, some of whom were carrying grenades, exiting the inflatable boat before unleashing their attack.
One gunman has been killed, and it is unclear how many more, if any, were involved in the attack.
Many of the innocent people killed are thought to be tourists, with footage of people of still wearing beach attire while they are rushed to hospital emerging from the scene.

The US Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is legal across the United States.
In a historic decision, passed by five votes to four, the court ruled that marriage is constitutional for all, bypassing individual state laws.
Gay couples could only marry in 37 states in addition to Washington DC before the judgement.

No union is more profound than marriage, wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion.
The decision is the culmination of decades of litigation and activism and came against the backdrop of fast-changing attitudes towards same-sex marriage, with recent polls suggesting the majority of Americans support same-sex partnerships.
The White House changed their Twitter and Facebook pictures to a White House with rainbow colouring.

One of the gunmen who opened fire on holidaymakers as they sunbathed at a Tunisian beach resort was dressed in shorts, a T-shirt and baseball cap to look like a tourist himself, it has been claimed.
At least 27 people, including foreign tourists, were killed today when gunmenopened fireat thepopular resort of Sousse.
A hotel worker described seeing one of the men dressed in shorts and a T-shirt as if he was a tourist himself.
These pictures appear to show one of the suspects  in shorts  being led away by police.
The hotel worker said: One attacker opened fire with a Kalashnikov on tourists and Tunisians on the beach of the hotel. It was just one attacker. He was a young guy dressed in shorts like he was a tourist himself.
 !Lionel Tunisiano (@LionelTunisiano) June 26, 2015
Police were still clearing the area around the Imperial Marhaba hotel and the body of one gunman lay at the scene with a Kalashnikov assault rifle after he was shot in an exchange of gunfire, a security source at the scene said.
Irishwoman Elizabeth OBrien, who was staying at a neighbouring hotel with her two sons, said there was panic on the beach when gunfire erupted.
I honestly thought it was fireworks and then when I saw people running I thought, my God, it is shooting, she told Irish radio station RTE. The waiters and the security on the beach started to say Run, run, run!
Sousse is one of Tunisias most popular beach resorts, drawing visitors from Europe and neighbouring North African countries. Tourism is also a major source of income for the government.
It was the second major attack in the North African country this year, and took place during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.

It was about 12 oclock and I just looked up about 500 metres from me and I saw a (hot air) balloon collapse down, then rapid firing, then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me  because I thought it was fireworks.
So, I thought oh my God, it sounds like gunfire, so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started saying run, run run! and we just ran to our room, which is like a little bungalow.
We are actually trapped in our room.
British tourist Gary Pine, who was also on the beach, said he thought he heard firecrackers going off and said his son saw someone being shot on the beach.
Sousse is located in the north-east of Tunisia
There wan explosion from the next hotel complex along, he said.
There was a mass exodus off the beach.
But you could see then quite quickly the panic that was starting to ensue from the next resort along from us which is about 100 yards away and so then people started exiting the beach pretty quickly, but only when you can start hearing bullets around your ears did you start to realise it was something more serious than firecrackers.
Speaking to Metro.co.uk, Ben Matthews:
We are OK. Shaken up but unhurt, thankfully.
Im here with just my wife at the Riu Club Bellevue Park. We believe the attack started just down the beach near the Mahaba Palace.
Wed just come for lunch in the main hotel when everyone outside started running into the hotel and there was what sounded like firecrackers going off on the far side of the hotel. After a few minutes the Animation team asked everyone gathered in the hotel communal areas to take shelter in their rooms, which we did.
Our room overlooks the outside of the hotel and we hid in the bathroom as what sounded like a fire fight took place outside in the street below.
Were currently in the restaurant, weve been told very little other than that the hotel is safe now and that the police are guarding the hotel gates and the beach, which is currently off limits. The tour rep knows nothing more than we do, but theres a chap here whos come in specially to tell us that.
One holidaymaker barricaded herself in her room after she was woken by gunfire.
I heard gunshots start a little while ago then I heard women screaming and crying, she said.
Now all I hear is silence.

The Paris protests are showing no signs of cooling off.
French taxi drivers have overturned cars, smashed windows and set fire to tyres to campaign againstlow-cost rival firm Uber.
Key highways in Paris were blocked by protesters  some of whom were wielding baseball bats.
Following day-long riots, Frances interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the firms UberPOP service was illegal and called on police and prosecutors to shut it down.

Despite the unrest, officials from Uber have insisted they will continue to pick up passengers until Frances high court passes a ruling on the service.
UberPOP is a car-sharing service run by Uber, which allows users to take advantage of prices much lower than those charged by traditional taxi firms  who are said to have lost between 30 and 40 per cent of their income in the last two years as a direct side-effect.

Rebecca Miles, a British tourist who was staying at the Royal Kenz hotel with her boyfriend told MailOnline: We were told to go back to our rooms because there were reports of a bomb.
It happened about half an hour ago  I heard a bang and I thought it was thunder but it was a clear sky so it obviously wasnt.
I heard sirens going off about 20 minutes ago and everyone came running back from the private hotel beach which is about 400 metres from the hotel. Everyone is a bit clueless about what is happening.
Tunisia attack - what we know so far
At least 27 people thought to have been killed
Sousse is known for being popular with British holidaymakers
British Embassy in Tunis said it is ready to provide consular assistance
At least one gunman thought to have been killed
People are anxious because they dont really know what is happening and we are now stuck in our rooms. There have been deaths apparently.
A British tourist identified as Gary told Sky News: There were several hundred people on the beach, it was quite busy because of the lovely weather.
You could hear bullets whizzing around, but at first I thought the gunfire was firecrackers.
Some reports claimed that militants parachuted into the town before the attack, however Gary told Sky News this may be due to the para-sailing activities many tourists undertook throughout the day at the resort.
Holidaymaker John Yeoman posted this image of a mattress that he forced up against the door of his hotel room for fears that the gunman would go room-to-room killing tourists.
John Yeoman barricaded himself inside his room
In a statement, the British Embassy in Tunis said: We are aware of reports of an incident in Port El Kantaoui and are urgently looking into them. We stand ready to provide consular assistance to any British nationals affected.
Sousse - a hotspot for British tourists
Sousse is one of Tunisias most important holiday resorts and is popular with Brits and other Europeans.
Situated on the east coast, it is the countrys third largest city and is around 87 miles from the capital Tunis.
Sousse combines family-friendly hotels with more high-end exclusive all-inclusive resorts.
Many of the hotels are on the seafront and have their own private beaches.
The city of Sousse stretches from the Medina or Old Town at one end up to Port El Kantaoui at the other.
The port is a popular place for wealth yacht owners to moor up while exploring the area.
Sousse is also a popular base for people travelling to the area to visit the Sahara desert and El Djem a Roman setllement that boasts the ampitheatre where Russell Crowes Gladiator was filmed.
Some 1,200,000 visitors visit Sousse every year and its hotels can cater for about 40,000 guests at the height of the summer season.
British holidaymaker Gary Pine told Sky News that he first became aware of the attack the hotel where he was staying became eerily quiet.
The beach tends to be full up very quickly so its the usual story of getting down to lay your towel at half past six to get a decent beach position, so all of the beach positions were taken, he said.
Theres a lot of people walking up and down, taking in this lovely weather, so its a very busy beach, but as I said it became apparent very quick that it was something more than firecrackers when you could hear bullets whizzing around, he added.
British Prime Minister David Cameron says the governments crisis committee, Cobra, will meet later today in response to the attacks. He offered his condolences and our solidarity in fighting the evil of terrorism.
Scotland yard has urged the public to remain vigilant but has not yet raised the terror threat level.
Our priority is safety and the security of the public. We would also like to reiterate our long standing advice to remain vigilant and alert, a spokesperson said.
The HomeOffice have set up a dedicated helpline for worried friends and relatives on0207 008 0000.

While the little girl in the video seems to be smiling and giggling as she is flung about like a rag doll(however towards the end she appears a bit more distressed)many are claiming the video depicts child-abuse.
Several of the moves see the girlswung about by her feet, with her head coming dangerously close to the floor, while a woman watches and laughs.
One person commented on the video: This is a CHILD, not a rag doll, she is obviously crying. Please, never again.

A man has been beheadedand several others have been injured after terrorists stormed a factory in France.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve hasconfirmedthat a man, named locally asYassin Salhi (spelling unclear), has been arrested  having beenknown to security services since 2006.
He had been put under surveillance at the time for his links to salafist organisations,which endedin 2008as intelligence services thought he was not dangerous.
The police is currently searching his house in Saint-Priest, where he had been living for six months with his wife and three kids, according to local press.

The victim has also been identified, and was, according to AFP,a company CEO of a local business who was at the factory for a delivery.
According to AFP, the police are now actively looking for people who could have potentially helped Salhi, and have arrested his family, according to this tweet by a journalist from Le Monde who is on the scene:

Questions have been raised on how theattacker managed to getto the factory, as the industrial site requires vehicles to ask for access before being let in.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has condemned another Islamist terrorist attack in France, and is coming back from South America earlier than planned.

In an address to the French people, President Francois Hollande confirmed that one suspect had been identified, and further action would be taken in due course.
The attack comes only months after 17 people were killed in a series of terror attacks across Paris in January.

The way that he text[ed] me was how would my sister would text, Sunnys sister, who asked to be kept anonymous, told BuzzFeed .
We think he may have gone through her phone to see how she usually contacts us.
It was really shocking to see how someone can really hide what they did in that way.
It also emerged that on the day Sunny was killed she had accepted a new job. Later that day Lee, pretending to be Kim, declined the offer, telling the employer she was going back to the US to study.

Two days later, Sunny was found in a suitcase buried under cement in the hills near her home.
Lee had a history of being violent towards Sunny, her sister said. Lee is due to appear in court at later date.

A transgender woman and her gay friendhavereportedly fled persecution in Russia to join terror group Isis.
Viktoria E and Aleksey T, both 22, left Kamchatka Krai in eastern Russia claiming they suffered persecution and abuse at the hands of families and locals in their town.
The pair, who had apparently watched an Isis recruitment video, then headed to Syria to join the terror group, the Mirror reports.

The strangenessof the pairs reported decision to join a group known for its brutal treatmentof non-heterosexuals wasnot been lost on Russian authorities.
We would always be interested in stopping people from joining a terrorist organisation but in this case there is a double motive, as our information is that this would not be accepted if they managed to get all the way to Syria, and it is unlikely that they would live very long once their sexual orientation was revealed, said police spokesman Alexander Vinogradov.
Viktoria, born Viktor, was confirmed to be undergoing hormone replacement therapy by her aunt.

She did not have enough money for the surgery and asked relatives but we all refused, and the next thing we knew was that they were wanted by the police after it was found they had gone to join Isis, the Mirror reports her saying.
Viktor had been walking around in womens clothes and wearing makeup and was living with his mum before converting to radical Islam.
She told him that he would probably be killed if he went there dressed as a woman, but he said that if he could travel there was a woman, he believed they would accept him as a woman.

Dustin Diamond enters court with his fiance Amanda Schutz (Picture: AP)
The only bell Dustin Diamond will be hearing in the next four months is a prison one.
Theformer star of 1990s hit show Saved by the Bell is headed tojail.
Diamond was sentenced at a court in Port Washington, New York, today following two misdemeanor convictions that stemmed from a Christmas Day bar room fight.
The 38-year-old actor was cleared of a felony charge after a three-day jury trial last month, although they found him guilty of carrying a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct.
He told jurors he took out a knife to try to ward off people, including a woman who punched his girlfriend Amanda Schutz.

He added heaccidentally stabbed a man during the altercation.
But witnesses testified that Diamonds girlfriend pushed one woman at the bar and grabbed another womans hand, initiating the bar fight.
Schutz was also convicted of disorderly conduct last month.
I sincerely apologize to everyone involved, Diamond said at the hearing today.
He was also sentenced to 15 months of probation.

Bruiser can be seen repeatedly climbing the step ladder and then jumping into the outdoor pool before playing with a floating surfboard.

Park in a disabled space in Brazil at your peril.
One man found out the hard way that parking your car in a spot reserved for people with disabilities is not a smart thing to do.
The mans car was covered  and we meancovered  in blue paper. White disabled symbols were made with sheets of white paper on the back and sides.
Even his wheels were covered in blue for goodness sake.
Aside from having his car made to resemble a smurf, the illegal parker also had to endure the taunts of the crowd, who cheered as he finally drove off.
Lesson learnt? We suspect so.

As reported by Vice ,Anne Piraux-Flabat wrote on Facebook: I am not Muslim and I dont count on becoming one.

A French nurse who admitted to suffocating eight of her babies has told investigators that she did so because they were the result of an incestuous relationship with her father.
Dominique Cottrez, 51, is at the centre of the worst case of infanticide in modern French history following the discovery of eight baby corpses in a garden in Villers-au-Tertre, near Lille, in 2010.Now on trial in Douai, the nurse faces spending the rest of her life in prison if found guilty of multiple counts of murder of minors.
Cottrez, who has two adult daughters and several grandchildren, revealed today that the children were the product of a long incestuous affair with her own father  an affair that she didnt want to be discovered.
From 1989 to 2007, Cottrez said she killed eight children, two of which she buried in the garden and six more she hid in the house, she said.
The nurse faces spending the rest of her life in prison (Picture: AFP)
She claimed that despite completing eight pregnancies, her husband Pierre-Marie knew nothing about them.
He was briefly suspectedof helping to hide the corpses, but was released because of lack of evidence.
The corpses were discovered by sheer chance after the new owners of a house the Cottrez family once lived in started to dig a duckpond and found two bodies. Police later found the other six in the home.
Post-mortems on the babies found that they children were suffocated seconds after their birth.

But if you thought she would be feeling down about her potential paralysis youd be mistaken.
Instead she has vowed to live her life to the fullest in order to honour those who didnt survive.
The chances of me using my legs again are pretty bleak, she wrote on Facebook.
Not the best odds but Im moving to a great rehabilitation centre here in San Francisco for 2 months (it has dog therapy) and intend to give it everything Ive got.

A mother and her baby son have been rescued from the Colombian jungle five days after a plane crash which claimed the life of the pilot.
Maria Nelly Murillo Moreno, 18, and her five-month-old son, Yudier Stewart Moreno, were on a small Cessna plane that crash landed in the Choco province on Saturday.
The pilot died in the crash but when rescuers failed to find the bodies of Maria and her son in the aircraft they began to search the jungle, setting up loudspeakers in an attempt to make contact with the pair.

And five days after the plane went down, emergency crews have found Maria and Yudier. Maria had some minor lacerations and burns from the accident, but her son was unharmed.
Its a miracle, Colonel Hector Carrascal of the Colombian Air Force told AFP.
It is a very wild area and it was a catastrophic accident.
He added: His [Yudiers] mothers spirit must have given him the strength to survive.

If you werelying unconscious during an operation you wouldnt expect your doctor to laugh at your penis and suggestyou were infected with Ebola.
But that was exactly what happened to a patient inReston, Virginia, whoonly found hed been insulted because hedset up his mobile phone to record everything while he was asleep.
Anesthesiologist Tiffany M Ingham didnt know this and was subsequently caught making a fool of herself on a recording, the Washington Post reported.

After five minutes of talking to you in pre-op, I wanted to punch you in the face and man you up a little bit, Ms Ingham was heard sayingduring thecolonoscopy procedure.
She wasnt finished there.
When a medical assistant noted the man (known as DB) had a rash, the anesthesiologist warned her not to touch it, saying she might get some syphilis on your arm or something, then added, its probably tuberculosis in the penis, so youll be all right.
The patient was surprised by what had been said when he woke up (Picture: Getty Images)
Gastroenterologist Soloman Shah, who was examining the patient, also got involved when he jokedanother doctor they both knew would eat him for lunch.
The abuse cost Ms Ingham and the practice an eye watering 318,000 after the patient successfully sued them for medical malpractice and defamation.
Shell probably keep quiet next time.
Patient DBhad set up his mobile phone to record what was being said just in case he missed important information for his rehabilitation.

In what looks like a last-ditch attempt to convince people that climate change is very real and very serious, Bill has been forced to explain the process the only way us idiots will understand  through emojis.
While Bill is hopeful for the future, he admits that many innovations that could solve the energy crisis have notyet been invested.

Aprofessor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University, who was not involved in the study, Josh Miller told Live Science :The data and hypothesis are very intriguing, but much additional investigation is required to determine if this is a real cause-and-effect phenomenon.
Proof of a causative effect of B12 supplements on acne development will require randomized control trials with enough subjects to see a significant effect, if one exists.

Queen Elizabeth wants Europe to stay united (Picture:Reuters)
One is not amused by plans to divide the European Union.
The Queen has implored the need for unity throughout Europe on the eve of a Brussels summit where the Prime Minister is set to outline his proposed reforms to Britains EU membership.
During a state banquet atBellevue presidential palace in Berlin, Germany last night, she said pulling out of the EU could prove dangerous.
In the presence of German president Joachim Gauck, HRH added: In our lives, Mr President, we have seen the worst but also the best of our continent.
We must work hard to maintain the benefits of the post-war world, she added.We know that division in Europe is dangerous.

President Gauck told the Queen in his speech: We know that we need an effective European Union based on a stable foundation of shared values.
PM David Cameron intends to renegotiate Britains membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017.
While traditionally monarchs remain politically neutral, the Queens speech could be interpreted as a firm view on the EU debate.

This video of a drone ripping off a plane wing during take-off has taken the internet by storm.
Its terrifying.But fake.
The eagle-eyed among us cansniffclever CGI a mile off. But for newbies, the mobile phone footage is so realistic it sends shivers down our spine.
It was the work of Bruce Branit, of Brandit graphic designers.
Explaining the idea, he said: Lately, Ive been looking for little videos to make with no budget, an iPhone and some CGI.
After shooting this footage of NYC as we were climbing out of Laguardia (thanks FAA for finally letting us keep our phones in airplane mode during take-off), I thought it might be a challenge to make something go by or even strike the wing.
This is the same air corridor that Captain Skully ditched his Airbus A320 in the Hudson after a double bird strike, saving all on-board.
But I chose to make a drone zip past instead of a bird and tear off a section of the winglet.
Heres how he did it:

Japan has lifted a 67-year-old ban on public dancing, and we say its about time.
Since the end of the Second World War, dancing outside has been banned, and dancing inside has required the premises to own a dancing licence. Even then, a licenced premises couldonly allow itspatrons to dance until midnight, like some sort of rubbish fairy godmother.
The law was brought in primarily to stopprostitution, which was common at dancehalls.

Of course, dancers gon dance, so people regularly flouted the law, and in the late 20th century police were content to turn a blind eye to it.
That changed in the 2000s, when celebrity drug scandals and nightclub brawls gave police a reason once again to crack down on illegal dancing.
But thanks to a campaign by Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto,Japan has introduced a law allowing dancing. It was ratified last week and will come into effect next year.

If youre thinking of working longer hours, weekends or with colleagues you despise so that you can earn more money, you might want to reconsider.
New research from career site Glassdoor found that while more money can make employees feel more satisfied with their jobs, there are other factors that are far more effective.
Glassdoor looked at salary reports and employer reviews for221,000 users from the same company over the past year.

What they found was that a higher salary only made employees slightly happier. A 10 percent increase in pay translated to just a 1 percent increase in employee satisfaction. In other words, the difference between earning 50,000 and 55,000 in terms of job satisfaction is minimal.
So what does contribute to job satisfaction?

The US National Security Agency spied on three French presidents from 2006 to 2012, Wikileaks has claimed.
In its latest reveal, the website published a series of files under the heading Espionage Elyse, citing top secret intelligence reports and technical documents from the NSA.
Wikileaks claims the secret files derive from directly targeted NSA surveillance of the communications of former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy as well as incumbent Francois Hollande and a handful of high-ranking ministers.
The revelations were met with anger byFrench officials, with one saying that spying between allies was unacceptable, reports the BBC .

Mr. Hollande is said to beconsulting security chiefs.
Files released by Wikileaks include Francois Hollande apparently discussing a possible Grexit. Another alleges that Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to resume peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
A file dated 2010 suggests that French officials knew they were being spied on by the US and intended to make their disapproval known.
A summary of the reported exchange involves Mr. Sarkozys diplomatic adviser discussing a plan to express frustration at US unwillingness to sign a bilateral intelligence co-operation agreement.

Two British teenagers have walked free from court after stealing historical artefacts during a school trip toAuschwitz death camp.
The two boys, both aged 17, spent Monday night in a police cell in Poland after being caught with items including a fragment of a razor, a piece of spoon, buttons and two pieces of glass, believed to have once belonged to inmates at the Nazi German camp.
A police spokesman had said earlier on Tuesday that they could face up to tenyears in prison.
The pairpleaded guilty at a court hearingandwere given suspended sentences and ordered to report to a police station back in Britain at regular intervals.

The death camp
Auschwitz, which is near Krakow, has become a poignant symbol of the Nazi German Holocaust that claimed six million Jewish lives across Europe during World War Two.
Around 1.5 million people, mainly European Jews, were gassed, shot, hanged or burned at Auschwitz during the war.
Part of the site is now a museum.

The pupils were spotted acting suspiciously on Monday afternoon near a building where Nazi German guards had stored prisoners confiscated belongings, said a museum spokesman.
Perse School, a fee-paying school in Cambridge, England, where the two boys are studying, said the pair had attempted to keep some items of historical importance which they found on the ground at the site.
We understand they have explained that they picked up the items without thinking and they have apologised unreservedly for the offence they have given, and expressed real remorse for their action, a Perse School spokesman said.

Its the news many of us have been waiting for  red wine can actually help you lose weight.
New research has found that an ingredient in grapes and berries turns your fat into calorie-burning brown fat.
Of course this ingredient, known asresveratrol, can be ingested without downingthe claret like youre Tyrion Lannister.
The compound is also found in blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and apples.

Testing on mice found that the ones givenresveratrol gained 40 per cent less weight than their counterparts when given high fat diets.
For those of you who havent darted off to the shops to buy a crate of cheap red wine, here is lead researcher Professor Min Du, from Washington State University explaining how it works.
I was nearly physically sick': Woman finds a chunk of metal in her KFC burger
He says: Polyphenols in fruit, including resveratrol, increase gene expression that enhances the oxidation of dietary fats so the body wont be overloaded.
They convert white fat into beige fat which burns lipids (fats) off as heat, helping to keep the body in balance and prevent obesity and metabolic dysfunction.
We think its time to celebrate, and now you can crack open a bottle of wine (enjoyed responsibly) and have a solid excuse to skip the gym today.

The accidental capture of one of the worlds largest species of sharkoff the coast of Australia has divided scientists and conservationists.
Listed as the second-largest species of fish in the world, the basking shark, which can grow to upwards of 8m (26ft) in length, has been given vulnerable status after years of being hunted.
So the accidental capture of one such shark by a fishing trawler off the coast of Australia has proved controversial, with conservationists branding the catch sickening and criticising trawler fishing and scientists voicingtheir excitementathavinga chance to learn more about the species.

In a statement on Facebook , Museum Victoria, where parts of the shark will go on display, said that the fishermen got in touch immediately after the catch rather than try to sell parts of the 6.3m (20ft) fishinthe lucrative meat or fin market.
It provides a rare opportunity to conduct scientific research into this species, the statement added.

This will help Museum Victoria with conservation efforts and biological research.
But though the museum and scientists have acknowledged the catch as unfortunate, some commentatorshave been more critical.
Facebook user Prashant D, commenting under the statement, slammed the indiscriminate killing of the shark and the terrible damage that trawler boats cause to the ocean, adding thatthe incident should be used to educate the public about sustainable fishing techniques.

A mother of triplets has shared a picture of their dyed placenta to highlight the miraculous survival of one of the brothers.
After doctors delivered Sammi Edess three babies, they dyed the blood vessels in order to show which part belonged to each child as they developed in the womb.
But while sons Geoffrey and Hunter had a huge share of nutrients, third son Thomas was only able to access a tiny section of the food source, and doctors didnt think that he would survive.
Geoffrey and Hunters generous sections are dyed green and red and blue and white respectively  but Thomas paltry yellow section can also be seen on the top of the placenta.
Sammi shared the image on the Australian Multiple Birth Association Facebook page, and heralded her sons birth as a miracle, after the triplets were born at 30 weeks.
She wrote: When I saw the obstetrician who sent me this picture he asked if he can use it in a big seminar with head obs from around the world of course I said yes but asked why?
His response was Thomas shouldnt be alive and to be honest we dont know how he survived to 30+6 but he has and hes a little miracle.

I didnt understand until I saw the picture myself that we made the right decision to deliver at 30+6.
I thought I would share this picture with all of you guys as its something we as mums dont really ever get to see and this is our babies lifeline when inside us. Its pretty amazing to think that was keeping them alive.

Lego is one of the most popular toys ever created, perfectly combining creativity, imagination and bright colours.
However it is also made of one of the most environmentally unfriendly products  plastic.
Now the most recognisable brand in the world has decided to go green, and has pledged to invest $150million (95million) to find a eco-friendlymaterial for its product.
The Danish company plans to use sustainable bricks in all toys by 2030 (however it is unclear if this will make them any less painful to step on).
Artist creates incredible scenes showing Lego like youve never seen it before
Each yearLego uses 6,000 tons of plasticmade fromacrylonitrile butadiene styrene, the same product used since 1963.
Green Peace lobbied Lego last year to end their long running partnership with Shell with a moving video which referenced the hugely successful Lego Movie.
Following the ad campaign the toy manufacturer cut its ties with the oil company.
Perhaps everything is awesome again?

Fang Peng fell onto scaffolding at a building site (Picture: CEN)
A manis able towalk and talk again one month after athick iron bar smashed through hishead ina building site accident.
Fang Peng, 50, was working on a construction site in the city of Chaohu, in east Chinas Anhui Province, when he fell three metres from the scaffolding he was standing on.
He plummeted below into a batch of rusty iron bars, one of which penetrated the right side of his neck and lodged itself 35 centimetres (ten inches) into his head, stopping on the left side of his forehead.
Doctor Zhang Hong, head of the trauma department at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui, said Fang was on the brink of death when brought into the hospital.
He said: His face was full of blood, with brain tissue visible around the entry point of the iron bar.
Faced with the possibility of leaving Fang in a vegetative state or at the very least without the ability to speak, doctors performed a nine-hour surgery to remove the 75-centimetre (20-inch) long, 2.5-centimetre thick (one inch) iron bar.

Fangs tough first few days of post-surgery recovery were compounded with a number of conditions, including upper gastrointestinal haemorrhaging, high fevers, a cerebral oedema, as well as an infection in his lungs.
However, having overcome the conditions with the help of a full team of doctors from various departments, incredibly Fang is now doing better and on the road to recovery.
Doctor Zhang noted that it was both lucky and impressive that Fang had not suffered any seizures or convulsions since the high-risk operation was done on his head, and that he has become increasingly stable.
Even though Fang is now able to walk and talk, the doctor said that another three and a half months will be required for him to make a hopefully near-full recovery.

And while Xavier and his family now have a permanent home, the 10-year-old hasnt forgotten those they left behind, and spends his pocket money buying fabric, buttons and zips so he can make clothes for the homeless.
I think the idea came to him from everything we have endured and wanting to make a difference for other people, Xaviers mother Stephanie told the Huffington Post .

According to HuffPost, Xavier took up sewing after watching his mother at work.

Some are saying the pyramid was built by an ancient civilisation (Picture: YouTube)
Is there life on Maaaaaaaaaaaaarrrssss?
We dont know. But there might be a pyramid.
Nasas Curiosity rover has captured images of what seems to be a perfectly-formed pyramid on Mars and, unsurprisingly, conspiracy theorists are excited.

The images were taken by the Curiosity rover (Picture: YouTube)
The pyramid is around the size of a car, and the sensible explanation is that it is a rock formation that has formed a pyramidal shape by chance.
But others have come to a different conclusion. Citing the near-perfect design and shape, conspiracy theorists are saying the pyramid is the creation of an intelligent being and therefore its possible it was built by an ancient Martian civilisation.
The premonitiontheory is that the pyramid is a rock formation (Picture: YouTube)
Some go further, suggesting that we on Earth are descended from this Martian civilisation.
Which seems unlikely.
But it isnt the worst idea. Even astrophysicist, scientific commentator and all-round good bloke Neil deGrasse Tyson has suggested in the past that if there werelife on Mars  and yes, its a big if  thenit is not impossible that human lifeoriginated there.

A routine roadside check ended with one police officerdead and another seriously injured after a drunk-driver launched a sudden knife attack.
In dashcam footage from the police patrol car, the two officers sit in the front seats while the suspected drunk-driver, a 38-year-old man who has not been named, sits in the back sit.
At first, it seems as if the suspect is about to pass out, but without warning he pulls out a knife, leans over the seat and stabs 36-year-old Aleksandr Lyamkin.

After repeatedly thrusting the knife into Mr. Lyamkin, the attacker then turns his attention to the other officer, stabbing and slashing him a number of times.
Both officers manage to get out the car but Mr. Lyamkin can only walk a few steps before succumbing to his injuries and collapsing. His partner, meanwhile, holds shut the door to prevent the suspect escaping and calls for back up.
Arriving officers arrested the attacker, who they later discovered had managed to find work as a truck driver despite his criminal record, and was afraid he would lose his job if booked for drunk driving.

He faces between 12 and 25 years in prison for the murder of the police officer. The second officer is recovering from his wounds in hospital.
The investigation is ongoing but this is a tragic day for all police officers, said police spokeswoman Ludmila Ryanzantseva.
The dead officer was married with a wife and two children, an 11-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter who will now grow up without their father.

The courts deputy prosecutor Julie Colaert said that every month she saw up to 10 British smugglers before the court, following promises to migrants of a guaranteed passage to the UK.
Aid workers have predicted the plight in Calais is set to worsen, and that more than 2,000 more migrants will flock there over the summer.
Such growth in migrant numbers has led to outbreaks of violence among their number and towards truckers, forcing some hauliers to avoid Calais altogether.
British truckers have spoken about facing daily threats of violence, intimidation, as well as fears of being fined if migrants clamber aboard their trucks.
Meanwhile, there was also an economic impact to the UK. The Fresh Produce Consortium estimates that some 10 million of fresh fruit and vegetables have been thrown away since the start of the year.

Islamic State has suspended two boys from a pole by the wrists because they ate during Ramadan.
Two boys  both said to be under 18  were punished in Mayadeen, Syria, for allegedly breaking the fast without religious justification.
The youths were made to hang from a beam by their wrists on Monday after being accused of eating during daylight hours by ISIS.
Residents in Mayadeen  in the Deir Ezzor province  reported two boys hanging from a crossbar near the headquarters of the jihadi police, Hissba.

The children have been suspended by ropes from a pole since noon, and were still there in the late evening, chief of the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman toldAFP.Apparently, they were caught eating.
A sign reading, They broke the fast with no religious justification, was said to be attached to the boys.
Through the month of Ramadan, Muslims are expected to abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and having sex during daylight.
Children, people in bad mental or physical health, pregnant, postnatal and menstruating women and the elderly are not expected to fast.
People who are exempt from fasting during Ramadan can make up the fasts at a later date.

Squatting in skinny jeans for a long period of time has been linked to damage of the muscles and nerve fibres in the legs, health experts have warned.
Doctors have described the case of a 35-year-old woman who collapsed and spent several hours lying on the ground outside, unable to move, before spending four days in hospital.
The case study, which is published online in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, said she had spent the previous day helping a relative move house, and had spent a number of hours squatting as she emptied cupboards.
She had also been wearing tight skinny jeans and recalled that they had felt increasingly tight and uncomfortable as the day wore on.
Later that evening, she experienced numbness in her feet and found it difficult to walk, which caused her to trip and fall. Unable to get up, she then spent several hours lying on the ground before she was found.

The womans calves were so swollen that her jeans had to be cut off her and she could not move her ankles or toes properly and had lost feeling in her lower legs and feet.
Doctors found she had damaged muscle and nerve fibres in her lower legs as a result of prolonged compression while squatting, which they believed her tight jeans had made worse.
Her fashion choice had prompted the development of compartment syndrome, or reduced blood supply to the leg muscles, causing swelling of the muscles and compression of the adjacent nerves, they said.

She was put on an intravenous drip and was only able to walk unaided after four days.
Doctors said previous side-effects of wearing skinny jeans have been limited to lesions of the thigh, and this was the most serious incident they had heard of.
Associate Professor Thomas Edmund Kimber, of the University of Adelaide in South Australia, said: The present case represents a new neurological complication of wearing tight jeans.

A former cobbler who has been dubbed Ugandas Ugliest Man has become a father for the eighth time.
Godfrey Baguma, 47, who is believed to suffer from a rare, unknown medical condition, and his wife Kate Namanda,30, welcomed a baby girl.
Baguma won the less-than-favourable title in 2002, after he entered the competition to make money for his cash-strapped family.
Before his marriage to Kate, Godfrey hadtwochildren with his first wife  but their marriage came to an end when he caught her cheating with another man.
Describing how he wooed Kate initially, Godfrey told KFM : I stayed with her four years before her people knew where she was. I didnt want them to see me until we had a child because they would definitely advise her to leave me.
She left me when she was six months pregnant but I think she later accepted her fate because she came back two months later.

I told her that I didnt choose to look the way I do and that if she feels I am a burden, she is free to leave me.
The couple got married in 2013, and now have six children together  after their first child was born in 2008.

Around 10,000 dogs have been skinned alive, cooked and eaten as park of a cruel annual tradition in China.
The Yulin government distanced itself from the festival and announced new restrictions, but eateries still did goodbusiness during the event held to mark the summer solstice.
Heartbreaking pictures show mans best friend stuffed into cages as they await their grim fate.
Many are puppies and thought to be stolen pets.
Adam Parascandola, director of animal protection and crisis response at the Washington DC-based charity Humane Society International, described the horror in Yulin on Sunday morning.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
He said: A man would go in the cage with a club and just start clubbing the dogs, just beating them and beating them, not killing them at that point the dogs are screaming and trying to get away and its really heartbreaking.
He said he was struck by the huge variety of breeds of live dogs, delivered on the backs of scooters and trucks, on sale at a market.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
I saw a Dalmatian and a chow and many dogs wearing collars that indicated the likelihood they were stolen pets, he continued.
Apparently concerned about the adverse publicity, the local government disavows any ties to the event, issuing a statement saying it did not officially sponsor or promote the festival.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
It said authorities would tightly control public order and punish any incidents of stealing or poisoning dogs. Traders would no longer be permitted to slaughter dogs in public, place carcasses on display or serve meals outdoors, it said.
Despite such restrictions, restaurant owners said the festival continued to attract enthusiasts for the dish.

Ricky Gervais has slammed thefestival as disgusting.
The Office star has taken a stand in a series of passionate tweets accompanied by photos showing pets being tortured.
He posted: They believe torturing the dog makes the meat tastier. They beat them, burn them, skin &amp; boil them alive! Disgusting sub human c**ts.
(Picture:REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon)
They steal peoples pets to torture &amp; eat. What would you do to someone who you caught torturing your dog? I hope youd stop them somehow.
Gervais is backing the Humane Society Internationals campaign to shut down Chinas cruel dog and cat meat trade.

This guy riding a moose is such an idiot.
Hopefully an animal jumps on his back one day when hes swimming in deep water.
Maybea lion, or an elephant?
A YouTube video showed him leaping on to a poor moose that already looked like it was struggling.
It let out a huge groan when the man landed on its back after he jumped from a boat.

His friends laughed of course, but it really wasnt funny.
The Wolftracker TV account, which posted the YouTube video, confirmed authorities had been notified.
This moron is going to be charged with harassing wildlife, they wrote.

Polygamy laws are some of the most controversial rulings throughout the world.
In many western societies polygamy, also known as polyamory, has been outlawed for centuries, however in some parts of the world it is still practised.
This map demonstrates just how many countries still allow polygamy (which is a marriage containing more than two people), and in which countries it is illegal but not criminalised.
Many advocates of the poly lifestyle claim that love is an endless entity, and should not just be limited to one person.
Konbini spoke to a 22-year-old woman British woman who claimed to be a polyamorous relationship.

She said: If I was ever to decide that I want a family or that I want to raise my children in a communal family there will be so many difficult legal entanglements that I would have to deal with.
I think I would be in a very precarious position particularly in regard to the public perception of the welfare of my children.
However as the world becomes more homogenised, one global society  Facebook  have clearly taken a stand against polygamy, as users are not able to be in a relationship with more than one person at a time.
Bigamy is a crime in the UK and is punishable by up to seven years in prison.

This video shows the nail-bitingmoment a toddler miraculously escapes certain death as a lorry reverses over him whilehe plays in the street.
In the remarkable CCTV footage, a truck driver in China can be seen reversing his vehicle over the child  but the boy lies desperately still and manages to avoid getting mangled under the trucks wheels.
Shockingly, the truck driver seems pretty unwilling to check on the child driving off without seeing if hes okay.
But the youngster soon gets to his feet and doesnt seem too bothered, running out of the road having presumably learnt his lesson.
Luckiest escape ever?

Still havent booked that week away in the sun this summer?
If youre looking for a cheap holiday then heading to Greece might just be your best bet  as the threat of a Greek exit from the Eurozone has led to travel companies slashing their prices by as much as half.
Its believed that tourists are being put off by the debt crisis, and Tour operators are cutting their prices in a bid to sell unsold package holidays to locations including Athens, and idyllic islands such as Crete and Zante.
At present, sun seekers can snap up a week on the Greek island of Thassos for just 384 per person, a price drop of 45 percent.
And theyre not the only ones  with travel firm Ionian Island Holidays offering a week in a one-bedroom flat in Corfu for just 405, hugely reduced from the normal cost of 809.
However, Thomas Cook remain confident that a Greek exit from the Euro wont impact existing bookings.

Some advice if you are going on holiday to Greece
If staying in a hotel during your trip experts advise to book in advance using Sterling, rather than paying with cash upon arrival or checkout.
If the country leaves the Eurozone during your stay your credit cards might not work, so take some cash.
HOWEVER, travelling withlarge amounts of cash is never advisable for obvious security reasons, so donttake too much.
ATMs are more likely to run out of cash on the Greek islands than on the mainland.
If Greece announces that they are to leave the Eurozone while youre visiting dont panic, it would take about 18 months for the currency to completely revert back to the Greekdrachma.
Greece continues to be an important destination for us and great value for our holidaymakers, a Thomas Cook spokesman told MailOnline.
Were working with our suppliers and closely monitoring the situation.
To date we have seen no drop off in bookings so far as a consequence of a potential Grexit.
We expect an exit from the euro would have no impact on the holidays costumers have already booked with us because we have existing contracts with hotels and airlines.
However, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) has advised tourists to take holiday cash in both euros and credit or debit cards  so theyre not forced to join long queues at local banks if the currency exit goes ahead.
Speculation about a possible Greece debt default, and potential exit from the Euro, has been current for some time, but at present remains just speculation, Abta explained.
Any changes would be highly unlikely to happen overnight, any switch to a new currency would take time and euros would likely be accepted in the interim.

In a statement that claimed responsibility for the attack, the Taliban said that it had been carried out to coincide with a meeting to announce Masoom Stanekzai as defence minister.
Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi has since confirmed that all the MPs inside parliament at the time of the attack are now safe.
MP Sidiqa Mubarez recalled how the parliament building had been shaken by a large explosion and those inside were wounded by flying shards of glass.
And only moments after the attack, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility on Twitter.
Several mujahideen have entered the parliament building, heavy fighting is on-going, he wrote.

Afghan Police have denied that militants stormed the building, but instead claimed that the fighting had instead taken place outside.
It is a group attack by the Taliban on the parliament, Kabul police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi said.

The attack comes at a time when Taliban insurgents continue to gain control across the north of the country, having already captured two districts of the Kunduz province.
Embattled Afghan forces have struggled to defend territories against Taliban advances, after U.S. and NATA forces official withdrew from Afghanistan at the end of last year.

The horrifying truth, my friends, is that sweat and urine cause stinging red eyes in public swimming pools  not chlorine *immediately washes body*.
Dr. Michael J. Beach, associate director of the Centres for Disease Control and Preventions Healthy Water program, said so.
He told Action Four News : Chlorine binds with all the things its trying to kill from your bodies, and it forms these chemical irritants. Thats whats stinging your eyes. Its the chlorine binding to the urine and sweat.

Asked if theyd relieved themselvesin the pool or the sea while on hols, 64 per cent of Americans fessed up, followed by the Brits (46%), Germans (44%), Canadians (58%) and Chinese (41%).

You can always trust Uncle Vlad to give back to the people and what better way than showing off Russian military might through a family friendly gun-filledtheme park.
Patriot Park just outside Moscow in Koblinka allows youngsters to fire grenade launchers and clamber over cutting-edge tanks.
According to the Guardian the food served on offer is all made fromarmy rations Yum.

Papa Putin explained that the park isan important element in our system of military-patriotic work with young people and used his speech at the opening to tell thecrowd and a nervous international community that he was adding 40 new intercontinental missiles (ICBMs) to the Russian Federations arsenal.
Just in case Western leaders were not nervous enough, the former KGB officer stated that these new ICBMs are capable of overcoming even the most technically advanced missile defence systems.

In Soviet times the army was a distant, faraway thing, but now we all feel closer to the army. The army is being romanticised and I see that as a good thing.
If we dont educate our own children then America will do it for us like we have seen in Ukraine.

Sabillon had an infection resulting from the surgery (Picture: Reuters)
Having something to get off your chest is never easy.
Smuggling a class A substance through customs inside your breasts  now thats a tough gig.
A woman from Honduras was arrested at an airport near the capital of Bogota in Colombia on June 20, wearing 3.3lbs of liquid cocaine in her breast implants.
Paola Deyanira Sabillon, 22, was en route to Spain when airport security noticed her looking conspicuously nervous in the security line, according to airport police colonel Diego Rosero.
X-rays later showed Sabillon had recently undergone breast surgery to conceal the cocaine.
Sabillon confessed she had taken instructions to deliver the contents in Barcelona without knowing what she was carrying, police said.
A preliminary investigation revealed the surgery was done in an obscure clinic in Pereira, a city based in western Colombia.
The implants were later removed at a Bogota hospital where Sabillon is being treated for an infection resulting from the surgery.
Colombia produces around 300 tonnes of cocaine each year.

Men  the choice of contraception willsoon no longer be simply betweenextra safe or ribbed.
The Vasalgel injection is expected to be seen on the US pharmacy shelves as early as 2018.
MORE: 22 ridiculous thoughts all women have about contraception
This injection is taken through the scrotum into the sperm carrying tubes. Just ouch.
Working in a similar way to a vasectomy, a singlepolymer injection prevents sperm enteringthe ejaculate for a matter of years.
Unlike vasectomy this contraceptive method is meant to be easily reversible with another injection developed to dissolve Vasalgel.
As reported by the Telegraph , there are many other male contraceptive methods being developed such as a pill that would allow a man orgasm but not ejaculate.
Another two pill-based options being trialled is Gendarussa ,which aims to prevent the sperms ability to inseminate the egg, and Anti-Eppin which attacks the sperms ability to swim.
All three of these contraceptive methods are non-hormonal  something some women will tell you is a major plus, asmost ofthe standard contraceptive pills supplied to women are hormonal.
Dont forget to practice safe sex out there, everyone.

It might seem counter-intuitive, but extreme music containing lyrics like theseby Five Finger Death Punchcalms you down and makes you feel happier, a study has found.
In a study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 39 regular listeners of so-called extreme music aged 13-34 years were deliberately angered by being asked to recall frustrating and irritating events in their lives, and then listened either to 10 minutes of music of their choice of spent 10 minutes in silence.
The research, which was conducted at The University of Queensland School of Psychology by honours student Leah Sharman and Dr. Genevieve Dingle, found that those who listened of the music, which was generally heavy metaland other similar music genres, became inspired and mellow after the 10-minute period.

A secondary aim for the study was to see what music angry participants would select from their playlist, Ms. Sharman said.
It was interesting that half of the chosen songs contained themes of anger or aggression, with the remainder containing themes like  though not limited to  isolation and sadness.
Yet participants reported they used music to enhance their happiness, immerse themselves in feelings of love and enhance their well-being.
All of the responses indicated that extreme music listeners appear to use their choice of music for positive self-regulatory purposes.

A calcified foetus has been discovered inside the body of an elderly Chilean woman and doctors think it may have been there for more than 50 years.
Local media in Chile reported that a woman, thought to be aged at least 90, was taken to hospital after a fall.
But when doctors X-rayed her, they found to their surprise a 2kg (4.4lb) calcified foetus  believed to have died during pregnancy  inside the womans abdomen and outside her uterus.
The phenomenon, the technical term of which is lithopedion, was called extraordinarily rare by hospital director Margo Vargas Lazo, who spoke to the Efes news agency following the discovery.
Because of the womans age, it is unlikely doctors will operate to remove the foetus, which occupied all of her abdominal cavity, reports the BBC.

Google has produced a new doodle in honour ofFathers Day.
The doodle animation shows fathers in various species looking after their children, from penguins to foxes to homo-sapiens.
Clearly these scenes of paternal love and care didnot occur during the Champions League final or the final round of the Masters.
The only question is: why is the doodle green?Is this the patron colour of fathers?
If the doodle doesnt start the oldtear-makers, then this Nationwide advert surely will  we all want that scarf.
It just gives you the wobbles, doesnt it.

We cant be sure, but were fairly certain this young man was the one who masterminded the Hatton Garden heist.
Three-year-old Brody probably spent months planning how to steal that chocolate bar, but unfortunately at the last minute his mum came in and caught him on camera.
Of course it takes more than a little security footage to out-do a mastermind like Brody, especially when he makes fantastic use of the old walk sideways and hide the chocolate bar behind your back technique.
He nearly makes it, until a slight hiccup (a table), causes him to drop his precious bounty.

A group of five people who allegedly transported and sold the tainted alcohol to poor workers have been arrested.
The Press Trust of India news agency added eight police personnel had been suspended for negligence of duty.
Deaths from illegally brewed alcohol are common in India because the poor cannot afford licensed liquor.
Its often spiked with chemicals such as pesticides to increase its potency.
In 2004, 104 people died after drinking tainted alcohol in Mumbais Vikhroli area.

A new device might soon be available which allows blind people to see using their tongue.
Having just been approved by the FDA (theFood and Drug Administration), theBrainPort V100could soon be on the shelves.
How does it work?
The BrainPort V100, developed by Wisconsin-based Wicab, uses a camera to grab the visual data, which is then translated into electrical stimuli.
This is fed to the blind person by a 400-electrode sensor array which is placed on their tongue.
The idea is to create a feel-based image which allows blind people to visualize objects around them.
MORE: A blind man and a man with no arms have been working together to plant trees for 13 years

Its tricky to explain, and even using it takes some practice to use, however 69 per cent of subjects who tested the device in trials said it enabled them to gain some sort of visual semblance about the physical world around them.
Robert Beckman, chief executive officer of Wicab Inc , said: People are able to learn to interpret these patterns of bubbles or stimulation on their tongue to know what object is in front of them.
We dont want to create false hopes, they need to learn the technology and practice with it. Its more akin to learning a new language than it is to ordinary perception.
The device is expected to cost about $10,000 (6,300) when it becomes commercially available.

So its no surprise Julia Marie Jones was caught after she allegedly pocketed the briefsin a Walmart in Georgia, United States.

The 22-year-old apparently hid the knickers in her handbag and some plastic shopping bags.
We can only imagine shewas planning to sell the garments, which are worth $749.95 (472).
That, or she really loves her underwear.
Whatever the reason, she will still have to face a charge of felony theft by shoplifting after being arrested on Monday.
One thing we do know is Jones is definitely tired ofhearing about the incident after posting this Facebook message below.

Dylann Roof, the man charged with shooting dead nine people in a church, has appeared before a court via video uplink.
Flanked by two armed guards,21-year-old Roof heard words from family members of people who died in the massacre.
With little emotion on his face, Roof listened as many people said they forgave him for his alleged crimes.
Alana Simmons, granddaughter of Daniel Simmons who died in the shooting, said: Although my grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate, this is proof that they lived and loved.
One woman whose sondied in the shooting even said she would welcome him to our Bible study.

The Judge at the bail hearing said he was unable to set bond (bail) for the nine murders Roof allegedly committed, however bond for the fire arms offence was set at $1million.
He will therefore remain in custody until his next court appearance in October, followed by a another hearing in February 2016.

It was once claimed that he learnt at drive at the age of 3, so perhaps its no surprise that Kim Jong Un claims to have a developed a single drug which is capable of preventing and curing diseases such as Aids and Ebola.
Yes  an internationally condemned bloodthirsty despot claims to have emerged as an unlikely medical savour. Right.
Inevitably, theres little to back this bold claim up  but the official Korean Central News Agency has said that the cheese-loving dictators scientists developed miracle pill Kumdang-2 from ingredients including gingseng.
The pill is said to be responsible for preventing and curing diseases such as Aids, Ebola, Sars and Mers.
And perhaps even more astonishing is the claim that the same drug cured lethal bird flu epidemics in 2006 and 2013.

While the eurozone (countries which use the euro as their currency) has been around for 16 years, its still sometimes seen as project, and not everyone believes it is going so well.
Unless you have been living under a rock with no Wi-Fi for the last decade you willbe aware that the Greek economy has been having some difficulty.
After several bailouts due to the countrys ongoing financial crisis, several theorists believe both the country and the larger eurozone would benefit from Greece leaving the currency union.
But what effect would this have?
The British Government say they are preparing for serious economic risk should Greece default on their debt and leave the Euro Zone.
MORE: Fox presenter says its extraordinary to call Charleston church shooting a hate crime
Before you chime in with your belief that Farage was right all along, the eurozone only refers to the 19 countries which use the euro and is separate for the EU (European Union), which Greece canstill be part of even if, like the UK, it chooses not to use the Euro.
Greece has faced massive protests and strikes during its extended financial crisis, with critics claiming austerity measures brought in have been unfairly aimed at people lower down on the socio-economic scale.
Recent talks between Greece and its many creditors ended with the agreement that the country must pay back1.6billion (1.14billion) within two weeks to the International Monetary Fund, one of its creditors.
Unsurprisingly Greece have said they can not be expected the repay their debts without debt relief from the rest of Europe.

Oh Fox News  you cant help but usea horrific tragedy to your own political advantage, can you?
Fox News presenter Steve Doocy recently spoke topastor E W Jackson for his views on the killingof nine people in theCharleston church shooting recently.
The interview started off fairly regularly, with the pastor being asked about the effect on Christianity and church goers across America, before things got a bit weird.
Despite many people believing the gunman to be racially motivated, Doocy cant stop himself from questioning why the incident was called a racially motived hate crime, claiming instead that the it was an attack based on religion.

Doocy said: Extraordinarily they called it a hate crime, and somelook at it as, well it was a white guy in a black church.
Mr Jackson then added that because the gunman didnt attack a bar or a basketball court, this somehow certified itas a attack on Christianity rather then black people.
Since the interview suspected gunmanDylann Roof admitted to killing the nine people to start race war.

This video showed a pirate feeding fish with money to criticise more conventional mainstream party.

The apology will have to be published on the internet for the next six months and to paycourt costs of 1,236.

Legos lawyer Karel Cermak said: The apology is an essential thing for us. The essential issue is that we do not wish our business to be connected with Czech Pirate party in any way.
The party had claimed in court in Prague that the figures were similar to other toys, not just Lego, and that no real damage was caused.
Just in caseyou were wondering, yes  the Czech Prate Party is a member of the larger European Pirate party.

Were not sure if this was a YOLO moment or not  but people arent happen aboutit.
The bizarre scene was photographed in broad daylight in a busy Aberdeen street.
The woman was caught squatting with her trousers down looking as if shes about to wee everywhere.
Naturally, it found its way on social media, as these things do. People voiced their disgust and its even got political.

Nathan Morrison, a Labour councillor who represents the area, said: It is completely unacceptable behaviour.
It is not something you want to see on the streets and there really is no excuse for that kind of behaviour.
I have never seen anything like that before  particularly in broad daylight. Hopefully the woman is at least fined for her actions.

Have you ever been surprised by how much those apples at the market cost?
You could be getting short changed, just like customers at this market stall allegedly were.
A YouTube video apparently showed the female seller adding weight to a bag attached to the scales before customers paid for their fruit and vegetables.
Is she scamming her customers? (Picture: YouTube/Onliner)
This meant they would pay more because it appeared as if their products had a higher weight.
The video from Russia, which was posted last week, has unsurprisingly irked a few people, with one reader sarcastically calling the seller kind, generous and helpful.
So the next time you shop at a market you may want to check if there are weights behind the till.

Thousands of people have come out in support of a Malaysian gymnast after her revealing outfit sparked anger.
Farah Ann Abdul Hadi, 21, took home goldin the womens floor exercise final at the SEA Games.
In celebration, a Malaysian TV channel uploaded a picture of her after the event to its Facebook page  but was later taken down.
People bombarded the thread with their outrage over her gymnastic outfit which they believe showed her aurat, meaning private areas.
But in response, a fan page was created on Facebook which people are flocking to togive praise.

Muslim groups have waded into the debate.
The student arm of Islamist group Ikatan Muslimin Malaysia (Isma) said Muslim women should stay away from activities which are not Shariah-compliant, reports the Malay Mail Online .
Roszida Kamaruddin, of Isma, said: If Jakim had recently been able to provide a guideline for concerts in Malaysia, I am optimistic Jakim will be able to provide a guideline for sports next.
Gymnastics comes from the Greek word gymnastikos, meaning skilled in bodily exercise. This, in turn, originated from the archaic Greek word gymnos which means naked, as athletes in ancient Greek competed without clothes.
Women should not be stopped from sports, but they must priorities the Islamic codes in sports attire. Furthermore, there are many Muslim female athletes who succeed even by covering their aurat.

Plankton is more evil than we could have ever imagined.
After the jealous Bikini Bottom restaurateur stole the Krabby Patty recipe, he offed Mr Krabs and all of his friends.
This scene on a San Diego beach looks like asinister Spongebob Square Pants twist.
Thousands of tiny red tuna crabs have been washed upon Southern California coastline.
Such strandings take place periodically and are not necessarily a threat to the species, according to Linsey Sala, collection manager for the Pelagic Invertebrates Collection at the University of California, San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
Experts have warned beachgoers not to eat the crabs (Picture: REUTERS)
She said: This is definitely a warm-water indicator.Whether its directly related to El Nino or other oceanographic conditions is not certain.
Scripps has cautioned people not to eat the crabs because the creatures may have ingested toxin-producing phytoplankton.
Scientists have noted the presence of a toxic algae bloom in the Pacific Ocean stretching from California north to Washington state that might be the largest ever detected off the US West Coast.
Experts arent sure if plankton caused the death of so many crabs, but such analgae boom cannot be ignored.
Its only a matter of time before Plankton strikes again.

Gary Glenn sensationally claimed schools should be held liable for STDs (Picture: YouTube)
This is Gary Glenn. Hes everything wrong with the world.
The Michigan legislator has sensationally said that schools which say its okay to be gay should be held criminally liable if students get a deadly STD.
The representative was speaking during a documentary released this year called Light wins: How to overcome the Criminalization of Christianity.
He says: If some young person hears at school that its okayto be gay and then comes down with a fatal disease as a result, school officials should be held legally liable, individually and in their official capacities, financially and maybe even criminally.
Say what now? Its right here:
The interview was filmed in 2013 but the clip was highlighted and uploaded to YouTube this week.

Despite his views, Mr Glenn has since said he does not have plans to introduce lawto penalise school officials if gay students later contractand STD.
He did say he still stands by his comments, however.
Mr Glenn said: If the school environment is teaching children that homosexual behavior is normal and healthy, and children, in reliance on what theyre taught from authority figures, decide to experiment or engage in such behavior and suffer negative health consequences, somebody ought to be held accountable.
Yvonne Siferd of LGBT group Equality Michigan said hiscomments would be laughable if they werent hyperbolic and so very dangerous.

Left handers  it turns out that you can count kangaroos among your ranks.
Thats according to a new study, which suggested that wild kangaroos favour their left hands during everyday tasks such as feeding and grooming.
Scientists from St Petersburg State University discovered the remarkable findings after travelling to Australia to spend hours observing the marsupials in the wild.
And it was a trend that all Kangaroos seemingly followed  with two species of roo and one wallaby appearing to favour their left hand for everyday activities.
But wildlife ecologist Janeane Ingram, who collaborated on the study, explained that the findings had not been widely embraced by the scientific community.
You want some?
Speaking to the BBC, she said: Unfortunately, even my own colleagues think that studying left-handed macropods is not a serious issue, but any study that proves true handedness in another bipedal species contributes to the study of brain symmetry and mammalian evolution.

Lead author Dr Yegor Malashichev said that the study was solid confirmation that we are not alone in the Universe; we are two  humans and kangaroos.
And when it comes to why kangaroos are left handed, researchers believe that posture plays an important role  with left handedness only seen in species that stand on their hind legs, using forelimbs for a variety of tasks.

This is the moment suspected killer Dylann smiled at cameras as he was led away in chains after his capture.
The 21-year-old wasseen later at 6.20pm wearing a pinstripe jumpsuit as he was escorted onto a plane back to Charleston with chains around his ankles and his hands handcuffed behind his back.
He was caught in Shelby, North Carolina, 250 miles from the church where he allegedly gunned down nine black people attending a bible study group and prayer meeting.

One survivor described how he reloaded his gun -given to him for his 21st birthday  five times as he shot down his victimsMyra Thompson, 59, Clementa Pinckney, 41, Tywanza Sanders, 26, Sharonda A. Coleman-Singleton, 45, DePayne Middleton, 49, Cynthia Hurd, 54, Ethel Lance, 70, Susie Jackson, 87, and Reverend Daniel Simmons.

Dylann Roof, from Lexington, wasarrested after he wasidentified by his own uncle Carson Cowels, 56, who recognised him on CCTV footage released by police.
Cowels said his nephew had received a gun for his birthday in April. Its not yet known if the .45 calibre pistol was the gun used in the attack.

The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime.
Greg Mullen confirmed the arrest during a press conference. The Charleston Police Chief said: This case could not have been cleared at quickly as it has been if not for all the investigation involved in the operation. I cant say how grateful I am. Some of them have worked tirelessly.
Mayor Joseph P Riley added: Weve had extraordinary cooperation. Because of all of that work, we can announce that that awful person  the terrible human being who went into a place of worship when they were playing would kill them  is in custody.

The shooting marks one of the most notorious attacks on a black church in the South since the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed four girls and helped galvanize the U.S. civil rights movement. The bombing was tied to the Ku Klux Klan.

The bloodshed in Charleston follows a wave of racial tension and protests stirred by recent police killings of unarmed black men in cities across the country, that have sparked a renewed civil rights movement under the banner of Black Lives Matter.
In one such case in neighboring North Charleston, a white police officer was charged with murder after he shot Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, in the back.

I didnt notice until now that Dylann was just a few people away from Wanza, one friend told Mashable.You can slightly see him in the right corner of the screenshot.

Heinz has apologised after a QR code on the back of bottles of ketchupdirected users to a hardcore porn website.
The QR code  the matrix barcode found on the back of some products  was supposed to link to a webpage where you could design your own ketchup label, and it did between 2012 and 2014.
But when the link expired this year, Fundorado, a hardcore porn site, registered the website for itself.
Its incomprehensible that [they] didnt reserve the domain for one or two years, said Germancustomer Daniel Korell, who discovered the mistake.
It really doesnt cost the Earth.
Heinz wrote on Facebook that they regret the event very much.

Going by His Holinesss latest tweet, Pope Francis is disgusted by the current state of the planet, which he says is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.
The pope has been fiercely critical of ourtreatment of Earth, and inhis latest encyclical  released today  he called on the rich in to change their lifestyles or watch the planets ecosystem be destroyed.
The 192-page letter, titled Laudato Si, On the Care of Our Common Home accuses the human raceof seeing itself as lords and masters, entitled to plunder at will.
He further attacks humanityscollective selfishness, which he says manifests itself in consumerism.
In its stead, he suggests a moral approach tothe environment, urging the whole human family to come together to seek sustainable and integral development.
We know that things can change, he writes.

Adobe, Wikimedia, WordPress and Yahoo also received high marks for their defence of user privacy, though the EFFsgrading of Google and Microsoft werefar less complimentary.
Facebook, which owns WhatsApp but was rated separately, was given four out of five stars, as was Twitter.
The Who Has Your Back? report assesses technology companies in five criteria: whether they follow best practices for data security, whether they inform users when the government requests data, whether they are open about their policies on holding on to user data, whether they tell users when the government demands the removal of content, and whether they publicly oppose so-called backdoors which give the government access to data.

Russia claims they are not contending the moon landings never happened (Picture:Nasa)
It might seem half a century late, but Russia is to launch an investigation into the American moon landings.
According to Russian newspaper Izvestia, an investigation will seek to discover why original footage and a lunar rock from the first moon landing in 1969 disappeared.
Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Russian governments Investigative Committee, stressed that he and the department are not saying the landings didnt happen (perish the thought), butthat they are simply curious as to the whereabouts of certain artifacts which are part of the legacy of humanity.
We are not contending that they did not fly [to the moon], and simply made a film about it, he wrote in an op-ed forIzvestia.

But all of these scientific or perhaps cultural artifacts are part of the legacy of humanity, and their disappearance without a trace is our common loss. An investigation will reveal what happened.
Reuters reports that Nasa has admitted to erasing the original footage the save money, though it was later restored in better quality using other recordings.
Mr. Markin said that the investigation might uncovernew information aboutthe various spacemissions.
While it seems odd that Russia would launch the investigation more than 50 years after the moon landings happened, Mr. Markin didcomplain in his op-ed piece that the US authorities had crossed a line in their probe of nine Fifa officials.
US prosecutorshave declared themselves the supreme arbiters of international football affairs.

Take this burger snapchat for example  seems pretty straight forward. Or is it?

Did it work?
Probably shouldnt of hit send on this one
Holly, who wonMiss Ireland in 2011, said she got the idea for the blog while on a girls night out.
If Im having a good hair day and my make-up looks nice Ill find any random excuse to send a snap to someone I fancy. Like pick up a random coffee mug and write mmm coffeeeven though the mug is empty!, she told Buzzfeed.
She added that she didnt think men were quite as tactical when they posted to snapchat.
Oh, and if men break the screenshot code  theres no going back  she adds.

Russian health officials have bizarrely backed a social media campaign where women take selfies with shawarmas to promote healthy eating.
The women post the pictures of themselves holding oreating the grilled meat wraps to a page on Russian social network VKontakte called Beautiful Girls And Shawarma.
Which is totally normal and not at all weird.
One of the organisers Anatoliy Lugovoy said:This project in the social media world is designed to praise shawarma as an object of cooking art and to praise the beauty of a woman.
When you join both it makes a powerful piece of web art.

Dylann Roof, who gunned down nine people in a prayer meeting, has been captured by police.
The 21-year-old from Lexington, South Carolina, has been arrested after an intense manhunt by officers.
Dylann Roof was identified by his own uncle Carson Cowels, 56, who recognised him on CCTV footage released by police.
Cowels said his nephew had received a gun for his birthday in April. Its not yet known if the .45 calibre pistol was the gun used in the attack.

Nine people  six women and three men were killed in the attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, which has strong historical links to the black community.
Church pastor Clementa Pinckney was among the victims, as was Cynthia Hurd, 54; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59; Ethel Lance, 70; Susie Jackson, 87; the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; and DePayne Doctor, 49.
Before opening fire on the church congregation, Roof is thought to have said: You rape our women and youre taking over our country.
The shooting are being investigated as a hate crime.

Greg Mullen confirmed the arrest during a press conference. The Charleston Police Chief said: This case could not have been cleared at quickly as it has been if not for all the investigation involved in the operation. I cant say how grateful I am. Some of them have worked tirelessly.
Mayor Joseph P Riley added: Weve had extraordinary cooperation. Because of all of that work, we can announce that that awful person  the terrible human being who went into a place of worship when they were playing would kill them  is in custody.
Roof has been arrested twice previously a drugs charge and another for trespassing. Its thought that he acted alone.

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out (Picture: Google)
When Morrissey sang There Is a Light That Never Goes Out, he was surely referring to this traffic lamp in Germany, which has stayed red for the past 28 years.
The light in question stands at the intersection of four different streets in Dresden, just south of the river Elbe.
Drivers can turn right at the light at any time as long as they take due caution, but if they want to drive straight ahead, they might be waiting a while.
The light isnt faulty, however. In fact, the city council designed the light always to be red.

The light lies at an intersection in Dresden (Picture: Google)
Because the green light means transport is free to go all the other lights in conflict to this one must show red,a spokesperson told The Local .
The red light instructs: stop at the intersection. After stopping one is also allowed to turn right if there is a sign to the right of the traffic light that shows a green arrow on a black background.
Because on Ziegelstrae one is only allowed to turn right, in accordance with regulation 27 section 37 of the transport regulations, we can do without using the traffic signals green light.
Apparently, a simple stop sign wouldnt do because they dont fulfill the same set of regulations.
So much for German efficiency.

Even the most level-headed adults would freeze if faced with a gun-wielding murderer.
But a super smart five-year-old girl managed to survive the Charleston Church shooting by playing dead, suggests a local news station.
A slim white gunman named by local media as 21-year-old Dylann Roof opened fire and killed nine people during a prayer session in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church  one of the oldest historically black churches in America.
Roofs uncle Carson Cowels, 56, reported him after he recognised his nephew on the CCTV footage released by police.
He said Roofreceived a gun as a birthday present for his 21stin April. A.45 calibre pistol. Its not yet known if it was the same gun used in the attack  which is being investigated as a hate crime.

Relatives of the girl said to have survived the attack told ABC News 4  a station based in Charleston  that the youngster had dodged the killer by keeping quiet and pretending to be dead.
Its thought that shes currently recovering from the ordeal in the nearby Medical University of South Carolina hospital.
Journalist Rob Mallia, who is reporting from the scene tweeted: Family says 5 year old survived by playing dead. Child resting @MUSChealth @ABCNews4.
An intense manhunt in underway to locate Roof, from Lexington. Police are now surrounding his mothers house, but it has not been confirmed if he is inside.
A local newspaper suggestshe is currently on bail for drugs charges, while court records say he was charged with trespassing in April.
The gunman apparently sat in a religious meeting for an hour before gunning down members of the congregation.
Among the dead are six women and three men, including Reverend Clementa C Pinckney.

Someones put an Oyster card under their skin to save time and it doesnt even workproperly
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Thursday 18 Jun 2015 3:52 pm
Warning: Graphic content
A Russian man has gone to pretty extreme lengths to cut out barely any time at all.
Vlad Zaitsevsliced open his hand and slipped in the equivalent of an Oyster card to speed uphis commute in Troika.
Now the engineer only has to touch his mitt on the card reader to ride the subway. But at what cost.
He underwent surgery to implant the pass inhis skin and has been left with a big scar.
Vladinsists that it didnt cause any pain and there were no complications afterwards.
He said: It is the perfect solution to not have to worry about losing an expensive season ticket, although I admit its not going to be everybodys cup of tea.
He does admit, however,that the plan has not worked as well as he had hoped.
Vlad continued: Not all of the scanners seem to have a very strong signal to read the Troika card, and they dont always manage to read the chip.
Fail much?

Anyone else suffering this season? (Picture: Getty)
If youre reading this, congratulations  you havent scratched your eyesoutyet.
It feels like a particularly bad year for hay fever sufferers, and its only going to get worse as the pollen count is set to soar over the next couple of weeks.
But dont let those A-hole plants and trees steal summer. Here are some of the best hay fever remedies and prevention teckkers.
Eat chilli peppers
The fiery food contains capsaicin which, when consumed, has the ability to reduce congestion by opening up our nasal passages.
Just dont chow them down like theyre M&amp;Ms.
Lemons help too
(Picture: Getty)
Or any food high in vitamin C for that matter.
This includes oranges and grapefruit. A combination of vit C andbioflavonoids present in the fruit makes and naturalantihistamine which relieves symptoms of the nightmare that is hay fever.
Around1,000mg of vitamin C a day should do the trick.
Self-hypnosis
Research suggests you can actually train yourself to relax your body when feeling symptoms of hay fever.
The amazing teckkers is taught through breathing techniques.
This does work best before the season, however.
Acupuncture
(Picture: Getty)
Ouch! It doesnt look like the most pleasant treatment, but acupuncture has been known to help itchy eyes and a blocked nose.
Honey
(Picture: Getty)
Fight nature with nature: Its an old wives tale but honey produced by your local bees could actually stave off hay fever.
Studies have shown that as a healing agent it is better than over-the-counter remedies forcommon colds.
And thousands of people swear by it, claiming a spoonful of honey a day is the best way to build up an immunity.
Immunotherapy
(Picture: Getty)
Time to break out the big guns.
Immunotherapyinvolves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen,such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction.
It can be given either as an injection or a tablet to dissolve under your tongue. Over time itll build up a tolerance to the allergy.

        <Description>The month-long fast begins today. </Description>

Ramadan begins today for millions of Muslims around the world.
But what does it mean and why do Muslims fast for a month?
Here is everything you need to know about Ramadan.
1. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar
It is believed that the central text of Islam, the Quran, was first revealed to the prophet Muhammad during Ramadan, which begins and ends according to the moon, meaning Ramadan moves 10 or 11 days forward each year.
2. Fasting during Ramadan is known as sawm
Sawm is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, the foundation of Muslim life, which also include faith, prayer, charity and at least one pilgrimage to Mecca in a lifetime if able.
3. The word Ramadan means dryness or scorching heat
4. Muslims must fast for one month
Because of the moons cycle, Ramadan will either last 29 or 30 days. Between dawn and sunset, Muslims must refrain from eating food, drinking liquids, smoking and having sex.

5.Fasting is obligatory once Muslims reach puberty
However, children can fast if they wish. Those exempt from fasting include the elderly, the sick, people who are travelling, and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or menstruating.
6. As well as fasting, Muslims try to refrain from bad behaviour
During Ramadan, Muslims are also asked not to use swear words or talk about others behind their backs.

11. In some countries, there are penalties for breaking the fast
Breaking the fast in public is considered a crime in some Muslim countries and offenders may be sent to prison. In other countries, an offence is punishable with fines and community service.

13. Fasting times vary throughout the world
There are 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, but they have vastly different fasting times during Ramadan because it follows the hours of daylight. In Iceland, for example, there are more than 21 hours of daylight, while a daily fast in Australia might only be 11 hours.
Muslims in polar regions of continuous daylight can adjust to the hours of their nearest city, or they can follow the fasting hours of Mecca.

In Islam, the Night of Power, or Laylat al-Qadr, is when the first verses of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad by God, and is considered the holiest night of the year.
But the Quran does not identify which specific night it fell on, although it is believed to be one of the odd-numbered dates during the last ten days of Ramadan.
On this night, Muslims believe angels come down to Earth and that God forgives all sins.

16. Ramadan ends with a celebration
The end of Ramadan is marked by the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which heralds the beginning of the next lunar month, Shawwal. Fasting ends and Muslims praise Godfor helping them through the previous month.
Muslims greet each other by saying Eid Mubarak (Happy Eid) and there are processions in the streets. It is celebrated by exchanging gifts and visiting friends and family.

The fiery passion between this couple isobviously so overpowering they had to drop to the floor and spontaneously make love.
And it would have been romantic, if it hadnt have been in the middle of a shopping centre.
Now this Sydney mall is forever sullied.
Abraham Jniedi, from Peakhurst, filmed the gritty, in-your-face sex and put it on Facebook. Its had more than 3,000 Likes.

He asks: Mate, what are you doing? God, youre in f***ing public.
To which the man replies: Sorry, we got carried away.

It could be another tale of star-crossed lovers  or will it be heart-crossed lovers?
In a move that shouldnt really bother anyone but obviously will, Twitter are apparently planning to change their favourite icon from a star to a heart.
They are testing the potential change so it will only affect a small number of users (mainly android users), but that doesnt mean everyone and their mother will soon have an opinion on it.
Oh wait, they already do  and guess where they are heading to vent their frustration (or appreciation).
Would love to see Twitter switch to hearts over stars. Most users get really confused by "star" and "favorite" https://t.co/0cnRyBLrRI

This is a tragic, tragic event surrounded by mystery and public deception, said Jim Arnott, who is Greene County Sheriff.
The couple face two charges each of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.

A teenager has been shot dead after using a mobile tracking app to findhis missing iPhone.
Jeremy Cook, 18, from London in Ontario, Canada, went on a hunt for his smartphone after leaving it in a taxi.
He downloaded a tracker app which lead him to a car where he confronted three men.
But he was shot when the car startedto drive off and he grabbed the handle of the drivers door.
He died from multiple gunshots wounds.
London policemanKen Steeves told The Canadian Press :Its certainly extreme, no one ever would have predicted or even thought that a loss of life would have resulted from a loss of a phone.
It wasnt the app that took away Jeremys life, it was the individuals, which would be rare, who happened to be armed with a gun.

A gang of child snatchers is reportedly luring British children into cars by dressing as waiters to trick unsuspecting parents on holiday.
Holidaymakers weremoved to another hotel in Cyprusafter three children on a Thomas Cook breakwere stopped at the last minute from getting intothe cars with the men.
Police have launched an investigation after the incidentat the Anastasia Beach Complex, near Protaras.
The kids were targeted on Tuesday night after up to ten men were spotted loitering around the hotel and taking photos.
Greg Letford, 28, from Dundee, was part of a wedding party. He told the Daily Record : This Romanian couple were leading the two young children towards a waiting car, another person had a third child up against a wall ready to go, too.

Someone spotted what they were up to and stopped them. If he hadnt been there those kids would have gone.
One of the men got away and we heard the getaway car crashed a short distance away too.

He continued: When the police turned up, they took the man and woman into an office in the hotel and a crowd built up in the foyer  there must have been about 60 or 70 really angry people. It was chaos.
The police got them into a van through a window for their protection. One of the hotel staff later told us they were Romanian and that one of them used to work at the hotel.
The children are safe.
Thomas Cook has since relocated a number of customers to a new hotel.
A spokeswoman said: Thomas Cook have requested an increased and immediate security presence at the hotel.

The safety and welfare of our customers is always our first priority and, upon hearing about the incident, we immediately deployed our experienced resort team to the property to provide those customers in residence with individual support.
Customers who did not wish to stay at the property were moved to alternative hotels of a similar or higher standard.
She continued: While incidents of this nature are extremely rare, we would like to reassure all customers that this is being taken seriously and we are continuing to work closely with the local authorities and the hotel as the investigation continues.
Any customers with concerns about future holidays at this hotel are asked to contact us directly so we can deal with them personally and directly.

A very excitable cyclist caught the bizarre scene on camera, and took great joy in confronting her.
The helmet cam footage shows the man cycle past a red Land Rover in Hampton Court.
He then cuts across the road and shouts through the window: Put that down, youre on camera, youre going to the police, Ive got your number.
The motorist doesnt react initially, and then throws a few hand gestures.

A white man has opened fire on people prayinginside a historic black church, killing nine people, in what has been described as a hate crime.
The man, who is believed to be in his early 20s, was said to still be at large last night.
The shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston was carried out last night as the people inside took part in a prayer meeting, police said.
There are believed to be survivors, but it is not knownhow many, or how many were inside at the time of the shooting.
(Picture:EPA)
It was unknown whether the pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, was one of the victims.
Police Chief Greg Mullen saidbelieved it was a hate crime, but would not elaborate.
The only reason that someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is out of hate, said Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley. It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine, and we will bring that person to justice.  This is one hateful person.
(Picture: EPA)
As police and the citys mayor updated the news media, a group of pastors huddled together praying in a circle across the street.
Police moved members of the news media back away from the site due to what they called an imminent threat. They did not release any details.
The campaign of Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush sent out an email saying that due to the shooting, the candidate had canceled an event planned in the city Thursday.
The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charlestons Methodist Episcopal church.
One of its founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. He was caught, and white landowners had his church burned in revenge. Parishioners worshipped underground until after the Civil War.

A murderer who killeda model in South London has admitted raping another woman  a crime for which adifferentman has spent 12 years in prison.
Mark Dixie, 44, murdered 18-year-oldSally Anne Bowman in 2005, and has now admitted to the brutal rape of a woman in Spain,a crimefor whichDutchman Romano van der Dussen was found guilty.
He remains behind bars today  yet theDutch National Forensic Investigation Agency have this week carried out DNA tests which allegedly prove Dussen is innocent of the crime.
When Dussens lawyer questioned Dixie over these allegations last week he allegedly broke down and confessed to sexually assaulting a Spanish woman in Fuengirola while high on drink and drugs in 2003.
Hero who died saving woman after she jumped onto train tracks was a family friend
In a statement, PrisonLAW, a law firm specialising in overturning miscarriages of justice, said: Mark Dixie confessed that in 2003 he was living in Fuengirola and he remembers committing a rape that Romano van der Dussen has been convicted of.
He also stated that he is sorry that another person has been in prison for such a long period of time for that rape.

Dixie was living inFuengirola, a party town on Spains south coast, in 2003 when three women were attacked within two hours of each other.
Dussen was arrested three weeks after the attack when one of the victims picked him out from photographs on police files.
Even though no DNA evidence linked Dussen to the attacks he was charged with the crimes and jailed for 15-and-a-half years.
Sally Anne Bowman was stabbed several times and raped while she lay dying on the floor of her flat in 2005.
Dixie was linked to the crime ayear later after being arrested for a bar fight. It was found when he was arrested that his DNA matched the sample found on Sally Anne.
He was sentenced to life for the murder and told he must serve at least 34 years behind bars.

Vodafone blocked a boring LGBT community website on the grounds that it violated the companys content control because it includes LGBT-related keywords, the sites founder believes.
Peter Burnett, who co-founded financial advice website lgbt.co.uk, said he was contacted by a Vodafone user who said they were unable to access the site because a Vodafone content control wasin place.
But according to Mr. Burnett, nothing on the website is remotely inappropriate and most people would even find it quite boring. He believes that Vodafone, like some other sites, may have blocked it on the grounds that it contains LGBT-related keywords.
If you open the webpage and read the script, you can see it is a site giving LGBT financial advice so I can only presume that someone at Vodafone or the listing people that provided them with the advice or list has just included certain terms, he told Cable.co.uk .

Mr. Burnett asked Vodafone to lift the block, and says there are literally thousands of websites that are harmless but contain similarkeywords to those found onlgbt.co.uk  and thereforecouldalso be blocked.
A Vodafone spokesperson said: Vodafone UK, along with the rest of the UK mobile operators use the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to define which content is unsuitable for customers under the age of 18.
We use a third party supplier to provide automated technology to block sites which are unsuitable under that rating system and have recently changed our supplier, which clearly has slightly different categories than those of the provider we used before.
We believe that the new automated system blocked this site by mistake. As soon as the issue was raised, we went back to our supplier to ensure it was unbarred with immediate effect.

There are more mobile phone blackspots in Liverpool than any other UK city, a study has revealed.
The research, carried out by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS), also found that around 40 per cent of Brits have a mobile phone blackspot in their home  with kitchens being the worst location.
It also revealedthat all of the big four UK operators are having problems extending their 4G/LTE networks into British homes.
GWS polled 2,000 people across the nation and quizzed them on how badly theysuffer from a lack of signal in their home. Staff alsospent six weeks collecting and analysing data from inside London homes.
Cardiff, Bristol and Norwich are some of the worst places after Liverpool.
One in every 14 test calls GWS made using devices locked to the EE network failed inside houses, the study goes on to claim.
By way of contrast, O2s voice network blocked less than one per cent of calls during testing, while Vodafones blocked and dropped only one per cent of calls.
An array of 12 Samsung Galaxy S5s with three different sim cards were used for the research.
Paul Carter, CEO of GWS, said: The UK is no longer a fixed line nation. When were at home we dont just receive calls on our mobiles  we make them too.
The best phone is the one youve got on you  not the one sitting in its dock out in the hallway. But that presents a problem for operators  many of whom are clearly struggling with the brave new world of in-home mobility.
Only by gathering and analysing accurate data on the performance of wireless networks will operators find a solution that genuinely benefits consumers  consumers who are currently not well-served by the kind of crowd-sourced data operators too-often use to bolster unrealistic claims about the level of service they offer.

Women have been told that they should freeze their eggs by the age of 35 if they want to have children, as their changesof giving birth decrease significantlyas they enter their late thirties.
A 12-yearstudy was carried out on nearly 4,200 women undergoing 5,841 IVF cycles and aged between 38 and 44 at Barcelonas Hospital Universitaro Quiron-Dexeus.
The study found that would-be mothers were 18 times less likely to have a baby through IVF at 44 than at 38, when the chances of successful fertilisation are just 24 percent. Lead researcher Dr Marta Devesa concluded that women should be encouraged to have families earlier, and failing that they should look to freeze their eggs by the age of 35.

There is a clinically relevant decline from 41/42  but the prognosis is really futile from 44 and onwards, she said atthe European Society of Human Reproductions conference in Lisbon.
Women should be encouraged to have families earlier but if you cant change society then we should encourage them to freeze their eggs by 35.
Indeed women of 44 or older should be fully informed about their real chances of a live birth and counselled in favour of oocyte (immature egg) donation.

Professor Adam Balen, who is chairman of the British Fertility society, told the Telegraph that people should not assume they can have children late because some celebrities managed to do so.
While you hear lots of good news stories about celebrities who may have given birth at an older age, nobody knows the number of celebrities who may not have been able to have babies, either because of infertility or possibly even having had fertility treatment that has been unsuccessful, he said.
There is always a strong possibility that many of these celebrities may well have sought the assistance of a fertility clinic and may have conceived either with IVF or donor eggs.

        <Description>You must wear underpants in Thailand. Period. </Description>
        <MainBody>Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 17 Jun 2015 2:16 pm
If you thinkangering the Gods by stripping off on a volcanois the most bizarre way toland yourself in hot water abroad, think again.
Because, believe it or not, this isnt the most peculiar crime you can commit in a foreign country.
Theres a host of odd offences worthy ofa fine or even jail time.
Letslook at some of the craziest.
1. Going commandoThailand
(Picture: Andre Camara/REX/Shuttershock)
Look, we know its tempting to free the beast all over the inside of your shorts or skirt, but just dont, okay?
Its an offence to leave your home in Thailand without a pair of panties on. But what qualifies as underpants is unknown. Still wouldnt risk it with a TOWIE-esq willykini though.
2. Running out of fuel on the Autobahn
(Picture: PA)
Germans dont take kindly to motorists running out of fuel on the countrys biggest road. Probably because it has no speed limit. Wait, shouldnt there be a law against that?
3. Driving in flip flops in Spain
(Picture: Getty)
While were on the subject of driving  this should be avoided any where in the world. But Spain actually clamps down on weirdos who drive with rubbery material strapped to their feet.
Seriously, who does that?
4. Wearing high heels in Greece
(Picture: Getty)
Again, practical footwear, people! If you happen to trek around the ancient ruins of Greece in high heels, you could be fined.
Thats because officials dont want history sullied by your sweet Kurt Geigers.
5. Chewing gum in Singapore
The ban came into force in 2004 as a result of huge maintenance fees the government was dishing out to repair pavements and buildings.
Importing or selling gum comes with a fine in the hundreds of pounds.
6. Eating, drinking or smoking during Ramadan in Dubai
None of this. The Foreign Office regularly warns Dubai holidaymakers not to eat, drink or smoke in a way that disrespects the Ramadan holiday.
Failing to do so could result in jail time.
7. Thailand stepping on currency

You wouldnt step on the Queens face, would you?
8. Feeding pigeons in Venice

Because theyre still rats with wings, even if you have a sexy Venice tan.

200 years ago Napoleon was defeated at the battle of Waterloo.
This was seen as a pinnacle moment in the downfall of a tyrant andone of the proudest hours of the British Army (which is probably why we named one of Londons biggest stations after it).
Like any epic battle that took the lives of thousands of men, it will almost certainly look better in Lego, which is why Reuters have created this video to commemorate its 200 year anniversary.

A teenager who had his arm bitten off by a shark has described the moment he escaped death.
Hunter Treschl, and his cousin were swimming just off the beach at Oak Island, North Carolina, when he felt something bump into his left leg.
The 16-year-old thought it was a big fish, so he moved away, but the shark then bit his left arm off above the elbow.
In an interview released by the hospital where he is being treated, New Hanover Regional Medical Centre, Hunter said his cousin helped him to make it back onto the beach before others came running to help.

Hunter said: I didnt see it coming. I was in waist-deep water and I felt something hit my left leg.
Then it just hit my arm. I saw it was biting up my left arm. I got it off eventually, I dont know if it swam away, but I was able to move.
He added: I got out of the water with the help of my cousin.
Despite losing his dominant hand during Sundays attack, Hunter said he is going to try to live a normal life.
In a separate attack on the same beach just 90 minutes before, 12-year-old girl Liersten Yow also lost an arm and seriously injured a leg after being bitten by a shark

Mayor of Oak Island Betty Wallace said: I dont want everybody to think this is one of those areas where you really have to worry about shark bites.
But for the foreseeable future, people have to be extra vigilant.

On Tuesday it was reported that all the animals were either dead or re-captured.
Zoo spokeswoman Mziya Sharashidze said eight lions, all seven of the zoos tigers and at least two of its three jaguars were killed. Only two of the zoos 14 bears survived, while nine of its 17 penguins died, she said.
Ivane Daraseliya, chief veterinarian for the zoo, said staff on Tuesday found the carcasses of three lions, a tiger and two wolves. Most of the animals appeared to have been killed when water and mud inundated their enclosures.
However, a young white lion named Shumba, one of the zoos most beloved attractions, was found shot in the head on zoo territory on Sunday.
The flooding also killed hundreds of homeless dogs at a private shelter near the zoo, shelter staff said.

The lawyer believes compensation for the victims could run in to million of pounds.

These are the faces of the six students killed when a balcony collapsed at a 21st birthday party in the US.
Oliva Burke, 21, Eoghan Culligan, 21, Niccolai Schuster, 21, Lorcan Miller, 21, Eimear Walsh, 21, and AmericanAshley Donohoe, 22, died in the early hours of Tuesday.
Emergency services were called to Berkeley in California at around 1am.
Structural engineer Grace Kang said the fourth-floor balcony may have been overloaded if, as city authorities have said, it was holding 13 people.
She said: They were packed like sardines, and then they were moving, she said, adding that movement further exacerbates the strain.
The families of the six are expected in the university town of Berkeley, California, today.

The building is owned by BlackRock, the largest asset-management fund in the US, according to city officials, and managed by Greystar Management, whose website says it operates more than 400,000 units in the U.S. and abroad.
In a statement, Greystar extended condolences to the victims families and added: The safety of our residents is our highest priority and we will be working with an independent structural engineer and local authorities to determine the cause of the accident.

If youve booked a flight to the United Arab Emirates, you might want to bear this in mind.
A newly-passed law in the country reportedly states that anyone caught swearing online could face a fine of Dh250,000 (43,500) and be deported.
In fact, the Federal Supreme Court overturned two convictions of a man fined Dh3,000 (522) for swearing at someone at WhatsApp on the grounds that it was too lenient, and did not conform to the new legislation, Emirates 247 reports.
Under the new legislation, natives canface jail time if they do not pay the fine and holidaymakers or expatriates living in the countrymaybe deported, reports suggest.
FSC supported the prosecutors appeal and affirmed the need for the enforcement of the law governing information technology crimes involving a Dh250,000 fine and deportation from the country,Emarat Al Youm daily said.

Everest was shifted 3cm (Picture: AP Photo/Jody Kurash)
The Nepal earthquake was so powerful that it changed the direction of Mount Everest, a geological survey has revealed.
Because the worlds largest mountain sits on the border of China and Nepal, and therefore straddles the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, it is always moving in some way.
But according to research by the Chinese governments National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation, the scale of the earthquake that hit Nepal in April was so large that Everest moved 1.2in (3cm) in a different direction to the one in which in which was moving before.

The mountain has been constantly moving to the northeast, and the earthquake made it bounce a little bit in the opposite direction, Xu Xiwei, deputy head of the Institute of Geology at the China Earthquake Administration in Beijing told China Daily.
The 7.8-magnitude quake killed nearly 9,000 people anddevastated parts of Nepal, India, China and Bangladesh when it hit in April this year.
The tremor triggered an avalanche on Everest which killed 18 people and damaged climbing routes. Authorities called a halt to the 2015 climbing season as a result.

Legalising weed did not trigger an increase in teenage smoking (Picture: Getty Images)
Legalising medical marijuana doesnt lead to more teenagers smoking it, a study has found.
Critics have long said that the legalisation of weed, even if only for medicinal purposes, leads to a more relaxed attitude towards the drug amongteenagers, which in turns leads to increased usage and eventually, harder drugs.
But a government-funded US study found no increase in teenage smoking in states that had legalised cannabis and even saw a decrease among certain age groups.

Researchers even saw a decrease in smoking in some age groups (Picture: Getty Images)
Our findings provide the strongest evidence to date that marijuana use by teenagers does not increase after a state legalizes medical marijuana, said lead author Deborah Hasin, of Columbia University in New York.
Researchpublished in the medical journal Lancet Psychiatry and presented at a medical conference in Phoenix, Arizona,showed that weed usage among more than 1million students in 48 states had not significantly increased.
Among 13- and 14-year-olds usage had dropped, something researcherssay may be because young people no longer see weedas recreational.
They also suggest that some parents are working harder to stop their children smoking weed because they know it is more readily available.

Gamers and people with insomnia will bepretty excited lately due to the announcement of Fallout 4s release date.
For anyone unfamiliar with the series, it is set in a post-nuclear war USA in a society where bottle caps are used as currency.
One eager (and sassy) fan has apparently blurredthe lines between fantasy and reality and is trying to buy the game using bottle caps.
The gamer, known only as Seth, posted an image of the estimated 2,240 bottle caps he is hoping to use to purchase the game and a letter to developers Bethesda to Imgur.
Seth said he has been saving bottle caps since I played Fallout 3 for the first time seven years ago.

Rachel Dolezal has been accused of dishonesty and blackfacing (Picture: Facebook)
A civil rights activist accused of pretending to be African-American has defended herself againstcritics, claiming she identifies as black.
Rachel Dolezal resigned from her role as President of the Spokane branch of theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) following allegations  including from her own parents  that she was pretending to be African-American.
But Ms. Dolezal defended herself against accusations of dishonesty and blackfacing on the Today show, telling host Matt Lauer that she identifies as black.
I did feel at some point I would need to address the complexity of my identity, she said.

I identify as black.
Handed a picture of her 16-year-old self  complete withpale white skin, freckles and blonde hair  Ms. Dolezal conceded that visually she was white.
Ms. Dolezals parents said previously that their daughter began to alter her appearance after adopting four African-American children, The Huffington Post reports.
Ms. Dolezal says, however, that she has identified as black since she was five.

Happy #Bloomsday to you!
Not sure what we mean?
Well, its a day to celebrate the life and work of Irish writer James Joyce, whos probably best known for writing Ulysses.
The book tells the story of a day in the life of protagonist Leopold Bloom as he walks through Dublin and a whole load of strange events happen.
But it all happens onJune 16 1904which also happens to be the date that James Joyce first cemented his relationship with wife Nora Barnacle.
The iconic novel, which began being serialised in 1918, has been previously described as a flow of consciousness  which seems like a totally appropriate description for the books often rambling and unpredictable structure.
But despite this, its still hugely popular, and people are going all out to celebrate it.

Ms. Heller says food wastage is morally unacceptable (Picture: CEN)
Its one of those phrases you hear all the time as a child.
Eat your food  there are children starving in Africa.
Its a simple and effective way of teachingyoung people to takeonly the food that they need, and to appreciate that they are lucky to have it.
But apparentlythe guests at one Swiss hotel were never told this, andthe managerhas seen fit to put notices on tablesin the restaurant featuring graphic images of malnourished children.
It might seem an extreme measure, butBrigitte Heller, who is the manager of the four-star Monopol Hotel in Lucerne, said the quantitiesof food taken from the restaurant buffet by guests and then left uneaten forced her hand.
The notice, which is written in both English and Chinese, reads: The malnourished children die and in Switzerland people waste food and throw it away.
This is in Switzerland ethically and morally unacceptable.

The Monopol Hotels measure has proved divisive (Picture: CEN)
The notice features fivegraphic images of emaciated African children, one of which has a caption reading: The vulture waits until the malnourished child dies.
How would you react?
Unsurprisingly, its been a divisive measure.
A great initiative, Mark Natusch told local newspaper Blick.
When Im in Lucerne I will stay at the Monopol. You have to support such an action.
One commentator, by contrast, criticised Ms. Heller for apparently blaming Chinese guests for the food waste.
Franz Tschigung said: The hotel director is unfairly accusing the Chinese. Why doesnt she serve food that Asians can eat?
In China you can get international food in every small hotel. This should also be possible in Lucerne as well.

If these maps are anything to go by, our planet is going to be really hot by the end of the century.
Scientists at Nasa ran simulations usingmore than 11 terabytes of data in an attempt to accurately predictthe world climate, including greenhouse gas concentration, temperature and rainfall, in July 2100.
Londoners may findaverage daily temperatures of 25C bearable (or even quite nice) but for those living in South America, Africa or the Indian subcontinent its a different story.

Those areas will likely experience45C every day (the current average is a little less than 39C), and Los Angeles and New Yorkmay seesimilar temperatures as well.
Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will have reached 935 parts per million, Nasa predicts, which represents around 0.1 percent of the atmosphere. At the moment, carbon dioxide constitutes around 0.04 percent, or 400 parts per million.
Nasa believes this data will help scientists understand what challenges the planet is likely to face and better plan for the future.
Nasa is in the business of taking what weve learned about our planet from space and creating new products that help us all safeguard our future, Ellen Stofan, chief scientist at Nasa, told MailOnline .

Hi
For the past few months I have been working on a design for a time machine in my garage. So far I have been able to make mice disappear but I dont know if they are going back or forward in time?
Im looking for a time travel partner, male or female who is open minded with a good sense of humour to accompany me on my first human transportation.
Owner drivers would be a plus as the machine needs to be taken to a wide open space like a beach to prevent property damage. Happy to split fuel costs :-)

Five Irish students have died in the US after a balcony collapsed during a 21st birthday party.
Eight others are serious injured after the fourth-floor balcony gave way in Kittredge Street, Berkeley, California, at around 1am, according to local reports.
Dublins Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said: It is with great sadness that I confirm that a number of young Irish citizens have lost their lives, while a number of others have been seriously injured following the collapse of a balcony in Berkeley, California, earlier today.
My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of the deceased and those who have been injured in this appalling accident.

It is reported the balcony fell on to a footpath from the top of a four-storey building shortly after midnight local time.
Berkeley Fire Department and city officials are on the scene, which has been sealed off.
At least four people have beentaken to the Sutter Alta Bates Summit Medical Centre.
Five have died and either others are seriously injured (Picture: Corbis)
Jennifer Coats, a spokeswoman with the Berkeley Police Department, told local media that many of the injured have critical, life-threatening wounds.
We dont have a lot of specific detail at this point because [investigators] are still trying to work through it all.

A man has died after ordering a glass of wine in a cafe and instead being given dishwasher detergent which he proceeded to drink.
Andreas Lorente ordered a glass of wine on Sunday afternoon, however he was served the colourless industrial cleaner which was in an empty wine bottle left in the fridge by one of the staff in the cafe.
Upon drinking the odourless detergent Mr Lorente suffered sever burns to his throat and stomach, and was rushed to hospital in Vinaros, Spain.
Sadly he died before he could be airlifted to a specialist centre nearby.
Police are now investigating the incident and have arrested the cafe owner on suspicion of manslaughter and have released him on bail.
He is due to appear before a judge today for further questioning.
The Mirror have reported a source close to the investigation saying: Everything at the moment is pointing towards a tragedy caused by negligence rather than ill-intent.
The source added that Mr Lorente only took a small sip of the liquid.

Alexander McDonald, 27, appeared at Exeter Crown Court and admitted manslaughter (Picture: Police handout)
A man raped and killedhis mother while high on cocaine after downing four bottles ofalcohol at a wine-tasting event, a court heard.
Alex McDonald, 27, ofNorton Fitzwarren in Somerset, denied murder but admittedmanslaughter at Exeter Crown Court on Monday.
The court heard how he used three or four different weapons on his 57-year-old motherCatherinewho died from stab wounds and strangulation.
McDonald, a restaurant worker,got drunk during a wine tasting sessionat work and then snorted cocaine before returning to his mothershome near Taunton late one night lastSeptember.
The jury heard he exchanged some sexualised texts during the smallhours of the morning and prosecutor Simon Laws QC said only childMcDonald was in a state of sexual excitement.
Mr Lawssaid the victim, who worked as a carer for elderly people,wore ear plugs in bed to help her sleep  but she was still wearingthem when her body was found.
He said: The evidence suggests she was attacked while she was in bedasleep. It was a surprise attack. She stood no chance against her 27-year-old son who is well over six feet tall.
He used at least three and in all probability four weapons againsther. Catherine McDonald died as a result of being stabbed andstrangled.

Mr Laws told the court McDonald had used knitting needles to stab her inthe neck and one was still in place, and a pathologist said she wasstill alive when this happened.
There were scratches and bruises on her face, body, arms, legs andneck as she struggled for survival in the attack.
Mr Laws said on her neck there were also small cuts which had beencaused by a pair of nail scissors used to poke and prod her neck.
He told the jury McDonald used the scissors to force her to submitto a sexual assault and Mr Laws said he raped her.

A condom was found and DNA was discovered on the victim. He said afterwards he fetched a knife from the kitchen to stab hismother and strangle her with the cable.
The court was told McDonald tried briefly to clear up the scenebefore he fled in his mothers Smart car taking his passport andemptying her purse.
But he later crashed the car, flipping it over near Tiverton,Devon, and he was later arrested by police who then went onto discover his mother had been murdered.
At one point he texted an ex girlfriend to say that he would eitherbe dead soon or in jail.
Mr Laws said: He knew perfectly well what he had done.
He said virtually nothing in police interviews and officers said heappeared quite nonchalant.
When he was told about the rape of his mother, he said that was abit of a shock to him.
McDonald denies murder and his trial continues.

Davina Tavener died from heart problems (Picture: Facebook)
A mum-of-two died on a Ryanair flight to Lanzarote after she suffered heart problems and there was no medical equipment on board to revive her.
Davina Tavener, 47, collapsed in the planes toilets 20 minutes before the flight landed  but fellow passengers were left shocked when they discovered there was no life-saving apparatus on board.
And while paramedics rushed on board when the plane landed, Davina failed to regain consciousness and was pronounced dead.
Now, a coroner at the inquest into her death has urged airline bosses to ensure that medical equipment is placed on-board all flights.
If you are trapped in an aircraft without access to any other facilities that authority needs to consider the equipment to be carried on these aircraft whether short haul or long haul, Coroner Alan Walsh said.
Davina Tavener was described as a very intelligent and successful lady (Picture: Facebook)
It is difficult to know if any equipment would have assisted because she was in the toilet 5 to 10 minutes prior so we do not know how long she was unresponsive.
And while Ryanair were found to be compliant with all regulations, Mr Walsh said he would write to the Civil Aviation Authority, European Aviation Safety Agency, and Irish Aviation Authority asking them to consider making the equipment compulsory.
Another man charged with historic paedophile offences at posh private school
He added: I do not believe there is any difference between short haul and long haul flight. It takes a second for someone to have a cardiac event and it will not choose if it is 10 minutes or 10 hours into a flight.
They can happen at any time. For her to get on an aircraft and to go on holiday with her husband, it is unimaginable what happened on the journey.
The inquest heard that Mrs Tavener worked for HSBC, and was a very intelligent and successful lady who had been travelling around India, China and Hong Kong only a month before her death.
The incident occurred when Mrs Tavener and husband Andrew flew to Lanzarote for a week.
Pathologist Dr Emile Salmo was unable to establish the cause of Mrs Taveners death, but said: I think it is necessary to have basic life support equipment and probably a defibrillator which are very simple these days  portable and friendly.
In a statement to Metro.co.uk, Ryanair said: While we dont comment on legal matters, Ryanairmeets all regulatory requirements in terms of medical assistance provided on its flights andis not legally required to carry defibrillators on board.
All our crews are trained in first aid and are responsible for the safety and security of the cabin. Should an incident occur in flight which requires medical intervention, our crew divert to the nearest suitable airport and request medical assistance to be on standby before landing. We offer our sincere condolences to the bereaved.

What having Aspergers is like': Moment dog stops owner self harming as she has violentbreakdown
Amy Willis for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 16 Jun 2015 10:52 am
Warning: Content some may find distressing
A young woman with Aspergers syndrome has released footage of herself suffering a violent breakdown to raise awareness of the condition.
Danielle Jacobs, who published the video on YouTube, is seen crying and self-harming in the clip before her dog jumps up to stop her.
She hits herself several times in the head and on the chest while her dog Samson uses his paws to tryto calm her down.

Eventually Danielle drops to the floor and Samson curls up next to her and licks her face.
Danielle said: This is whats considered a meltdown.Yes, Samson is alerting. I trained him to alert to depressive episodes [or] self-harm [but] not both, but [still] he alerted.
Samson is then seen using his paws to stop her (Picture: Youtube)
She added: It appears the response is late, but its actually supposed to be, because as Im coming out of the meltdown I tend to have a panic attack after.
Danielle, from Arizona, uploaded the video in the hope it will help people understand the struggles people suffering from the autism spectrum disorder go through.
She specifically asked people to refrain from posting negative comments about her self-harming.
She wrote: This is what having Aspergers is like.Please no negative comments this really happened and its not easy to open myself and share what its like on a daily basis.

The second-in-command of Al Qaeda has been killed by a U.S drone strike, the terrorist group has confirmed.
Nasir al-Wuhaysi, who was described as the designated successor of leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, is thought to have been killed by strike in southern Yemen on Friday.
Former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel claimed that al-Wuhaysi was responsible for running Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which he described as the most effective part of al-Qaeda.
AQAP claimed responsibility for Januarys Charlie Hebdo attacks earlier this year, and U.S. officials have confirmed that the strike aimed to directly target the group.
Confirming al-Wuhaysis death in a video statement, senior member Khaled Batarfi said: We in al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula mourn to our Muslim nation that Abu Baseer Nasser bin Abdul Karim al-Wuhayshi, God rest his soul, passed away in an American strike which targeted him along with two of his mujahideen brothers, may God rest their souls.

A $10 million dollar reward had previously been offered by the US government for anyone who could bring al-Wuhaysi to justice.
The US State Department said he was responsible for approving targets, recruiting new members, allocating resources to training and attack planning, and tasking others to carry out attacks.

But its not time to change our diet just yet, warn scientists (Picture: Getty)
Yes. Just, yes.
Eating more than two chocolate bars a day has been linked to alower the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Research led by the University of Aberdeen found that compared to people who ate no chocolate, those with a higher intake had an 11 per cent lesser risk of cardiovascular disease and a 25 per cent reduced risk of associated death.
It was also linked with a nine per cent lower risk of hospital admission or death as a result of coronary heart disease, while it was similarly associated with a 23 per cent reduced risk of stroke, even after taking account of other factors.
The perfect amount of chocolate to eat is up to 100g, the research suggests. The average Cadbury bar is around 45g.
But its not time to change our diet to pure Cadbury just yet, warn scientists.
MORE: 90s chocolates ranked from worst to best
The study, which came from analysis of almost 21,000 adults taking part in the EPIC-Norfolk study, which is tracking the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women in Norfolk, concluded that there is no evidence for cutting out chocolate to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Around one in five participants said they did not eat any chocolate but among those that did, daily consumption averaged 7g (0.25oz) with some eating up to 100g.
MORE: You can now buy chocolate hummus (like Nutella, but healthier)
Those who ate the most also tended to be younger, have a lower weight, waist to hip ratio, and blood pressure, and were less likely to have diabetes and more likely to carry out regular physical activity  all of which add up to a favourable cardiovascular disease risk profile, researchers said.
Eating more chocolate was also associated with higher energy intake and a diet containing more fat and carbohydrates and less protein and alcohol.
The study authors pointed out that dark chocolate is usually said to have more beneficial effects than milk chocolate, but milk chocolate was more frequently eaten by the Norfolk participants.
Professor Phyo Myint, of the School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry at the University of Aberdeen, said: Our study concludes that cumulative evidence suggests higher chocolate intake is associated with a lower risk of future cardiovascular events.
The study is published online in the journal Heart.
Why we shouldn't get too excited
Dr Tim Chico, reader in cardiovascular medicine and consultant cardiologist at the University of Sheffield, said: This study adds to the evidence that people who consume chocolate tend to have lower rates of cardiovascular disease, although such studies cannot say whether the chocolate is the cause of this protective effect.
There is evidence from other studies that have randomised people to be given chocolate that this can have effects that might reduce cardiovascular disease, such as a reduction in blood pressure. These studies taken together suggest that there might be some health benefits from eating chocolate. However, it is also clear that chocolate has the potential to increase weight, which is unequivocally bad for cardiovascular health.
The message I take from this study is that if you are a healthy weight, then eating chocolate (in moderation) does not detectibly increase risk of heart disease and may even have some benefit.
I would not advise my patients to increase their chocolate intake based on this research, particularly if they are overweight.

The network has stooped to new, selfie stick related lows.
Roving reporters are now recording their interviews on phones strapped into SmartGrip. Its probably saving Sky a tonne of money while giving the brand free publicity in the process.
A total of 12 selfie sticks have been rolled out to journalists in Australia.

Its like the house from Amityville Horror and we dont like it one bit.
The 1880s Victorian three-bed on the outskirts of New York City was mysteriously abandoned by its owners years ago and is on the market for a bargain$105,000 (67,268).
And now, to top off the creepiness, ghostly hands have been spotted in the windows on Google Street View.
Its been on the market since 2010 and is probably filled with unspeakable horrors.

Nature. Its awesome.
This isCalbuco volcano in Chile. Until April it had not erupted since 1972. The eruption came as a surprise to scientists, but thankfullyTimestorm Films was on hand to capture the entire thing over a beautifully hypnotic time-lapse.
The HD footage shows clouds of ash billowing into the orange sky.
Filmmaker Martin Heck saidhe and his crew had been visiting a neighbouring volcano and were heading south when Calbuco blew its top.
They quickly set up camp and this is the amazing result:

So what was in that mystery bag winched over a prison wall during live FOX News TVcoverage?
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 16 Jun 2015 8:08 am
Theworld isobsessed with a mystery package that was winched over a prison wall on live TV.
FOX News reporter Molly Line was covering the story about the two prisoners whoescaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York when the bizarre scene unfolded.
In the background, a man is seen walking over to the prison wall with a package. Suddenly, its winched up the wall and disappears. The man leaves promptly.
Obviously, speculation was rife at the time.
But it turns out that was a legitimate delivery. It was confirmed by theGreta Van Susteren show after journalists did some digging.
However, a question mark still hangs over what was inside the box.
A man can be seen crossing the road before the package is winched(Picture: YouTube)
More than 800 police officers continue their search for Richard Matt and David Sweat as the manhunt enters its tenth day.
Local schools have re-opened but the main road leading to the community remains closed.
The murders made the headlines after they used power tools to dig through several barriers and tunnel more than one mile away from the prison.

First there was Weaselpecker . Now meet Gatorcoon. 
When thisamateur photographerwent walking through Ocala National Forest in Florida, he came across something quite odd.
Richard Jones, who was out in the forest with his family, spotted a raccoon riding on the back of an alligator.
Mr Jones said he believed the raccoon had leapt aboard the alligator after being startled by his son taking a picture of the reptile.
He said he snapped a lucky picture right when the gator slipped into the water and before the raccoon jumped off and scurried away.
Without the context youd think the raccoon was hitching a ride across the river.
Oh, and and in case you missed it, heres that weasel riding a woodpecker.

Guinea pig is a delicacy in parts of Latin America (Picture: Getty Images)
A man was discovered roasting a guinea pig over a flame in a New York park on Saturday and police saidit was perfectly legal.
Cops were called to Brooklyns Prospect Park followinga call by a concerned resident who thought someone was torturing a squirrel.
But arriving police instead found a man having an early morning snack of roasted guinea pig, which is a delicacy in his native Ecuador and other parts of Latin America.
You might have expected police to intervene (given that in New York a guinea pig is more commonly thought of as a pet rather than breakfast) but officers were happy to letthe man to go back to his meal.
He wasnt holding an animal down and torturing it, a police source told the New York Daily News .
If he wants to feed on guinea pig thats his prerogative.

It might look like a thinly drawn line on a black background, but it is actually something far more impressive.
It shows the International Space Station (ISS) and it was taken by an eagle-eyed passenger on a Southwest flight from New York to Chicago.
It wasnt easy for Trevor Mahlmann though.

The wannabe astronaut had to find out what time the station would be viewable from his plane (it was 10pm) and then use his GoPro camera to take 30 second exposures over ten minutes.
Once he had the images he merged 12 of them mid-air and with the help of Adobe LightRoom software was able to publish the final picture.
And it was so impressive Nasa tweeted it out from its ISS account.

The 2.5-mile-wide zone separates North and South Korea
Leaving North Korea is not easy.
You can flee to China or Russia, but you willalmost certainlybe deported if discovered by the authorities; you can try and obtain a student visa to somewhere like Pakistan and thenattempt to escape from there; you canbrave the waters and try and finda boat to take youto mainland Japan or, most dangerously, you canattempt to cross the heavily-guarded demilitarised zone and get to South Korea.
Thats what one teenage soldier managed to do today, braving a2.5-mile-wide zone of electrical fences topped with barbed wire, minefields and guard poststo get toHwacheon in South Korea.

It is not clear how exactly he managed to get through, but a South Korean spokesman said there was no violence.

Upon his arrival,the teenager told South Korean officials that he decided to defect because of the widespread beatings and abuse he saw within the North Korean military.
He has become the first North Korean serviceman to defect to the South in three years. In2011, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un tightened border controls, almost halving the number of refugees entering South Korea in that year.

He was caught ten daysafter the incident on December 12.
Mr Tostevin, 55, was left covered in injuries and suffering from depression, but has bravely spoken out after his attacker was jailed for 12 months at Jerseys Royal Court.
I honestly believe that if I hadnt managed to get him away I would have part of my ear missing now, he said.

Police initially found Newby outside her car  and the child inside it  on 26 May, but could not arrest her because they had not witnessed the alleged crime.
Officers swore out a warrant if Newby promised to turn herself in later. But when she did so, she left both her children  aged six and one  inside the hot car, police said, with surveillance footage showing they were there for over an hour.
No windows were open and temperatures were at least 32C, officers said.
The children are now in the custody of their father.

        <MainBody>Nicholas Reilly for Metro.co.uk Monday 15 Jun 2015 3:17 pm
Rented tuxedos. Theyre a firm staple of high school proms and weddings, even if the wearer is often left looking like a walking, talking penguin.
But it seems that the combination of a dicky bow, a dinner jacket, and a ruffled shirt might have had its day after a leading clothes rental firm said that business had been down 2.8 percent in the last quarter.
It isnt for sartorial reasons, but because people arent getting hitched  the U.S marriage rate is at its lowest level for a century.
Douglas Ewert, the chief executive of Mens Wearhouse, said: There are indicators that the overall wedding business is slowly shrinking due to shifting cultural attitudes toward traditional weddings.

However, price is also believed to be a factor too, with the price gap between renting and buying a tuxedo rapidly shrinking.
And a move away from traditional weddings also plays a part, with hosts opting for a more casual union, a world away from the high-end fashions of tuxedos.
Ewert added: We believe this is a function of a movement toward more casual and destination weddings.

A man who accidentally entered the wrong poker tournament ended up going home with the top prize of 52,000.
Christian Pham, from St Paul, Minnesota, thought he had registered for the $1,500 (966) Texas Hold Em game at the World Series of Poker tournament in Las Vegas, only to sit down and be given the wrong number of cards.
Mr Pham suddenly realised he had accidentally entered the no-limit deuce-seven lowball  a game he had neither played before nor heard of.
But that didnt stop him from going home with the top prize  $81,314 (52,345).
When I got to the table, and I got dealt five cards, I realised something was wrong,he said.

I said, Oh my god! because in Minnesota they dont have this game.
This was the first time I played it, but I tried to learn the game from the people at the table.
Mr Pham told PokerNews.com that he had to fold hisfirst seven hands and have the rules explained by the person sittingnext to him.
But, after calling a huge bluff, he took in 100,000 chips and became chip leader.
In the future for sure I will register for this game. I love it now, he said.

The house boat was raided earlier this year (Picture: Cascade)
Police seized a bag of icing sugar that was going to be used in a banoffee pie.
Richard Nicholson isdemanding compensation from Essex Police for the cost of the door to his houseboat, that wassmashed in the drugs raid.
Mr Nicholson, owner of the barge Blacksmith at King Edwards Quay, Colchester, said: When the police came and I was not there they smashed the door which cost 850 to replace.
I think you need more than a couple of malicious phone calls to do something like this.
They found a bag with decanted icing sugar because my girlfriend wanted to make a banoffee pie so had brought some and put it in the kitchen cupboard.
Essex Police defended its decision to raid the boat.
A spokesman said: Police executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act after acting on intelligence received.No illegal substances were found.
We can confirm Essex Police has received a claim for a replacement door.
While it is unfortunate the door was damaged, Essex Police may not be held responsible in such circumstances for damage caused as officers carried out the entry and search of the property under a legally obtained warrant issued by the magistrates court.
The raid took place in the morning of Thursday March 5 this year.

Michael gave up his job, flat and car to volunteer with orphans in Asia (Picture: Cascade News)
A British man volunteering in south east Asia has been killed by mosquito bites.
David Murray, originally from Lancashire, gave up his job as a lorry driver and sold his BMW to venture overseas to help orphans in Laos.
The 39-year-old went into shock after mosquito bites on his legs became infected.
He died of typhus, a disease caused by Rickettsia bacteria and dengue fever, on June 7, a blood test revealed.
David  fondly known as Muzz to his mates  was three months into a year-long voluntary role when he was rushed to hospital at the Sae Lao Project in Nathong, Laos.
His father, Michael Murray, said: He was really dedicated. He was giving something back in life. He was a saint to the people in Laos.
He was very quiet and did not brag about things, but all this time he has been doing this good work.
His mother Rita added: We spoke to him on Skype four days before he died. He was so happy. He found something good in life, thats our only comfort.
Its thought that Michaels body will be flown back to the UK via Manchester Airport this Wednesday (June 17) and a coroners investigation is likely to be launched.

Talha Asmal from Yorkshire is Britains youngest suicide bomber
The family of a teenager believed to be Britains youngest suicide bomber said they have been left utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy of his death.
Talha Asmal, 17, who reportedly detonated a vehicle fitted with explosives while fighting for Isis in Iraq, has been described as a loving, kind, caring and affable teenager.
But in a statement, his family said those who sent himto his death had preyed on his innocence and vulnerability.
The teenager fled his home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in March to allegedly join Isis along with his friend Hassan Munshi, who was also 17.
They said despite him never exhibiting any extreme or radical views, he had been exploited by extremists on the internet.
Unbeknown to them and completely against their will, they said he travelled to Iraq via Turkey and fell under the spell of Isis handlers.
The family said: We are all naturally utterly devastated and heartbroken by the unspeakable tragedy that now appears to have befallen us.
The 17-year-old has been described as loving and caring (Picture: PA)
We need time and understanding to come to terms with our unimaginable and painful loss. As a family we would like to take this opportunity to unequivocally state that Isis are not Islam.
They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like Isis to hijack our faith.Isis  not and never in our name.
West Yorkshire Police said they were unable to confirm the identity of the person who had died but were continuing to support families who have loved ones that are believed to have travelled to Iraq and Syria.
MORE: Islamic State fighters execute at least 400 people  mostly women and children
Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster said people who travel to Syria and parts of Iraq are likely to witness extreme violence and could become victims of violence themselves.
He said: As part of the Prevent initiative West Yorkshire Police is committed to working with communities and local authorities, to highlight the dangers associated with radicalisation and travel to regions such as Syria and Iraq.
We are all working together to help identify vulnerable members of our society and intervene and engage them before it is too late.
If anyone has concerns that a friend or relative may be vulnerable to radicalisation, expressing extreme views or contemplating travelling to Syria or Iraq, it is vital that we work together to try and prevent that person from travelling.

If youre running to become president of the United States, its pretty important to deliver a campaign thats filled with authority, power and conviction.
But try telling that to Jeb Bush, after the Republican hopeful unveiled this logo for his campaign  complete with a weirdly placed exclamation mark.
It certainly doesnt look like the hallmark of a man whos trying to get into the Oval Office, but instead comes across like some kind of short-lived domestic sitcom from the 1980s.
Apparently, hes used the logo for all his political activities since 1994, but that doesnt make it any less shouty and overly familiar.

Spare a thought for the billionaire owner of jewellery company Cartier, who has revealed that hes kept awake at night by the thought of the poor rising up to overthrow the rich.
Pretty terrifying stuff, right?
Johann Rupert, whos worth an estimated $7.5 (4.8) billion, reportedly made the comments at a Financial Times summit in the billionaires playground of Monaco.
How is society going to cope with structural unemployment and the envy, hatred and the social welfare? he said.
We are destroying the middle classes at this stage and it will affect us. Its unfair. So thats what keeps me awake at night.

Mr Rupert is also known for referring to himself as a reformed prostitute, after spending a decade working as an investment banker.

Nestl argued that the bars shape and snap are synonymous with the Kit Kat brand (Picture: File)
Theres a split-second moment, between stripping a Kit Kat of its wrapper and snapping off the first finger, where you go to pierce the foil crack and remember there hasnt been one for over a decade.
Nestl are also having trouble putting their finger on what makes the Kit Kat so memorably distinctive, and it wont be having a break any time soon.
The Swiss-based food and beverage company, which filed to protect the Kit Kats four-finger shape through the European Courts of Justice (ECJ) in 2013, had its appeal rejected on June 11 on the grounds that the trademark does not comply with EU law.

The ECJ ruled that the Kit Kat trademark did not comply with EU law (Picture: Getty Images)
Nestl argues its chocolate wafer bars shape and snap novelty have become synonyms with the Kit Kat brand since it was introduced by Rowntree in 1935.
Nestl originally appealed to the UK High Court, but was forced to approach Europe with its case when its biggest rival, Cadbury, blocked the move in 2013. Nestle had claimed 90 percent of people shown a picture of a Kit Kat without its wrapper identified it as a snack associated with the slogan Have a break, have a Kit Kat.
However, after hearing Cadburys cross-appeal, the court said that it found no clear distinction between the number of consumers that identified an image of the product with Nestls trademark, and those for whom the trademark alone was sufficient to identify the origin of Nestls Kit Kat.
Sharon Daboul, a trademark attorney with intellectual property law firm EIP , told the Guardian that confectionary-producing multinationals are keener than ever to protect product designs such as shapes, sounds and hues, though only some succeed.

Toblerone successfully won its case to protect the iconic zigzag prism design (Picture: File)
Toblerones zigzag prism, for instance, won its case for shape design protection at the ECJ in 2002. Cadbury meanwhile appealed to trademark its Dairy Milk shade of purple at the UK Supreme Court in 2004, though was blocked in 2014.
Shapes of products present a difficulty for companies, Daboul said, because its difficult for applicants to show that consumers look at the shape of the product alone as an indicator of trade origin.
She added that consumers normally pay more attention to the label than the shape.

Ramadan is set to begin later this week, and its a period when Muslims embark on a month-long daily fast thats only broken when the sun goes down.
So thats led to some very understandable confusion for Muslims living in the Arctic Circle, as most of the region is set to experience sunshine for 24 hours a day.
The all-day sunshine has left worshippers unable to differentiate between suhoor (the meal eaten before dawn) and iftar (the meal after sunset) .
Now, the Swedish Islamic Association is trying to devise new guidelines to clear up any confusion relating to the fasting periods.

Mohammed Kharraki, a spokesman for the countrys Islamic Association said: Weve got two difficult questions, not just when you can break the fast in the north but also when you should start fasting.
Youre supposed to start fasting before the sun rises, at dawn. But there is no real dawn in the summer months in Stockholm.
Its believed that the new regulations will involve allowing those affected to break their fast at the same time as Muslims in southern Sweden.

As a rule of thumb, unless youre part of the cast of The Producers, Nazi-themed dances are not a great idea.
But that didnt stop a group of Mexican teenagers donning military uniform, brandishing a swastika flag and goose-stepping around a stage.
The three-minute routine, performed at Cheerdance ACMX in Guadalajara, has polarised internet users.

Some have adopted the attitude that it is just a dance, while others have called the teenagers stupid and criticised the competition for allowing the group to enter.
One YouTube user even demands that the choreographer be fired for their part in planning the routine.
Enrique Casas, director general and organiser of Cheerdance ACMX, defended the dance, saying it was not intentionally offensive and was simply acting out a story.
Art in any form can be surprising, he told FOX News Latino .

Mark Gubin may sometimes work as an artist and photographer, but hes a full-time wind-up merchant.
Decades ago, he realised that passengers landing at Milwaukee airport would see his house as they descended.
So he painted WELCOME TO CLEVELAND on his roof.
According to Mr. Gubin, the sign has caused a lot of confusion for flyers over the years. Which, of course, is its intention.
He recalls one incident where passengers on a Denver to Cleveland flight due to stop in Milwaukee en route started panicking because they thought the plane had skipped its layover.
And Mr. Gubin still keeps a letter from former Common Council president Ben E. Johnson, in which Mr. Johnson complains the sign is causing outrage and panic among air passengers.
Keep up the good work, Mr. Gubin.

Neuroscientist Lori Marino of Emory University and the NonhumanRights Project said of the new study:We have shown that pigs share a number of cognitive capacities with other highly intelligent species such as dogs, chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins, and even humans.
There is good scientific evidence to suggest we need to rethink our overall relationship to them.

The group analysed dozens of studies compiling a series of conclusions about our porky friends.
They found out that pigs have very good long term memories, can learn complicated series of signals, enjoy playing together and live in complex co-operative social communities.
The Nonhuman Rights Project and Peta have claimed that such scientific conclusions demand much better treatment of pigs being bred for slaughter.

French people, stop being so moody and unwelcoming.
Thats the call of French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who has urged the Gallic people to stop living up to their international reputation for unfriendliness.
Paris, for example, has been named one of the worlds most hostile places for foreign visitors in a number of international surveys.
And speaking at the launch of a new scheme designed to boost tourist levels, Mr Fabius said: Tourism is a national treasure that needs to be protected, nurtured and developed  thats the aim of all these measures.
But he then went on to encourage French people to be more welcoming to tourists.
To put it diplomatically, we have room for improvement here. When we come up against a foreign tourist, we are all ambassadors for France he said.
He made the comments at the unveiling of a new Tourism Investment Fund, which hopes to boost French tourist levels to 100 million by 2020.
The campaign also aims to increase the spending habits of visitors, with tourist revenues hitting 47.1 billion euros in 2013, compared to the 130.4 billion dollars from visitors to the United States.
And in an attempt to lure in more visitors, Mr Fabius also called on French TV channels to broadcast the Tour de France and create documentaries that promote different regions of the country.

What is the key to long life? Healthy, happy relationships? Daily exercise? Regular baths in the blood of virgins?
Apparently not.
According to a new study, eating peanuts might just extend your life.
Researchers in the Netherlands found that people who ate at least a third of an ounce (10g) of peanuts were 23 percent less likely to die over a 10-year period than those who didnt eat any.
Peanut-eaters seemed to be less at risk from respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes (Picture: Getty Images)
Peanut-eaters seemed to be especially resistant to respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes.
It was remarkable that substantially lower mortality was already observed [at this level of consumption], said Piet van den Brandt, a co-author of the study and professor of epidemiology at Maastricht University.
Professor van den Brandt and his colleagues are not yet sure exactly what it is about peanuts that seems to extend life, though they said that peanuts and other nuts contain healthy fats, vitamins, fiber and antioxidants, which are known to provide numerous health benefits.
The study, which involved 120,000 middle-aged Dutch men and women, also found that the benefits of eating nuts plateaus at 15g daily.

Sunborn Gibraltar is the inception of a surge of super yacht hotels. It already has a sister yacht in London near the ExCel and plans are well under way for chains to spring up in Barcelona,North America, South-East Asia, the Middle East and Russia.
A rise in so-called yotels would be more than welcomed, if Sunborn Gibraltar is the blueprint for future vessels.
The majority of rooms have a private balcony or terrace area, are fitted with glistening minibars, a spacious bathroom area and  more importantly  have 24 hour room service. Steak at 3.41am? Not a problem.
And if you some how get itchy feet on board the mammoth boat, theres a plethora of activities to do on land. Off-road safaris, wine tasting at a vineyard and golf a one of Spains top courses  all can be arranged by the concierge wholl sort out a private jet, helicopter or car (if youre a peasant).

The 83-year-old caught the wrong bus and was faced with a quarter-mile hike home in Kingsthorpe, Northampton.
PC Stevens spotted Richard leaning up against a wall.
He grabbed his heavy shopping bag and offered to walk the elderly man home.
A photo of the kindhearted gesture was snapped and, inevitably, went viral.
PC Chris Stevens said its nice to seepolice getting recognition(Picture: PA)
Richard said: I got off the bus when I realised it wasnt going on the route I thought it would take.
It meant I had a few hundred yards to walk and thats when the officer saw me and asked if I was alright.
He helped me cross over the road and took hold of my shopping and walked me home. We just chatted and passed the time. He did a good job and Im grateful.
Mr Stevens added: His wife looked a bit shocked when she opened the door and I was there with him, but he was fine.
Its nice that the police are getting recognition for doing good things, but its nothing more than any of my colleagues would have done. These things happen on a daily basis up and down the country.

The protest is powerful but peaceful (Picture: Facebook/My Stealthy Freedom)
Allowing the wind to blow through your hair is an offence punishable by law for women in Iran.
Iranian ladieshave been legally required to cover their hair while out in public since 1979.
The law is enforced pretty heavily and many woman are arrested or fined by police if they fail to cover up with the attire considered appropriate.
But brave ladies have begun rebelling against the law which they feel is outdated and unfair.
Women of Iran are empowering one another (Picture: Facebook/My Stealthy Freedom)
Launching a subtle yet powerful protest, Iranian females are empowering and inspiring one another with pictures of themselves without their head scarves on the Facebook group My Stealthy Freedom .
Alongside their courageous photos, the women are revealing how freedom from their hijabs make them feel.
They want to be heard (Picture: Facebook/My Stealthy Freedom
One member writes: I want my real self, which is reflected inside me, to be reflected outside as well; I dont want to be masked neither by make-up nor some imposed dress.
I am an Iranian woman and I have never wanted to let my own body be politicised by Irans mandatory dress code, adds another.

The animal broke into a home through a cat-flap, destroyed the couples bedroom and defecated everywhere.
But instead of trying to usher the fox out, they locked it in their room to try and minimize the damage it did  after smashing several mirrors.
The couple bunked up with the urban critter all night, and at one point even laid next to each other on the bed.
It broke in just as the couple went to bed (Picture: YouTube)

The statement said Ahmadov was the driver of a bus which struck three members of Austrias synchronised swimming team in the athletes village on Thursday morning.
Reports in Azerbaijani media suggested some staff at the village had been drinking on site. The European Games confirmed said it is looking into these claims.

When will this horror end.
The spider siege is relentless. We can deal withthe eight-legged freaks on bananas  but inside them!?
Imagine reaching overfor one of your five a day to notice something squirming beneath the skin.
Kaleb Lechowski did just that and began recording the bizarre scene.
Slowly, the skin rips and then bursts to reveal a mammoth spider.

For some unknown reason, a Thai man has stuffed red ants down his pants.
A video, which has emerged on YouTube, showsa man stripped down to his underwear as his friends pick up a branch covered withthe fiery insects.
The nest is shoved against his genitals and, for a moment, the guy appears to be dealing with it well.
Then all hell breaks loose. He screams in agony, throws away his pants and gets hosed down by his pals.

This slow motion footage shows the exact moment a bolt of lightning struck a beach.
Footage of the lightning strike was filmed by Clint Blevins during a storm at Daytona Beach in Florida, then published on YouTube.
Clint set up his shot on the beach first of all. Seems pretty innocuous.
Then theelectrical dischargeis seen hitting the salt water and illuminating the beach.
In slow motion we can see how this has the appearance of fire in the sky.
Which quickly fades away into the air before disappearing entirely.
Lightning seriously injured a boy at the same beach this week while he was fishing with his father.

When it comes to popping the question, most people will opt to take their loved one to a place of real significance before getting down on one knee and asking them for their hand.
But if youre a gamer, you instead opt to reprogram one of you and your girlfriends favourite games so that it contains a marriage proposal. Obviously.
Thats what James Dowdell did, when he reprogrammed The Legend of Zelda for the NES console so that it contained a pretty important message for girlfriend Natalie.
Firstly, he grabbed a cartridge.
(Picture: Natalie/Funnybunnyphoto.com)
And then it was a case of using some seriously impressive skills to create a character that looked like Natalie.
He painstakingly sorted through code. Lots and lots of code.
Then this emerged as the final product  and its totally brilliant.
Unsurprisingly, she said yes  and hes even wearing a Zelda t-shirt to celebrate that fact.

A female writerwho attended a Slutwalk rally holding a sign that read There is no rape culture in the West has accused her critics of spreading slanderous lies.
Lauren Southern was filmed waving the controversial sign as she attended the feminist protest in Vancouver, Canada.
In a YouTube video entitled What Really Happened At The Vancouver Slut Walk, Ms. Southern explained that she had been subjected to completely slanderous lies about the events that actually happened.
Detailing one accusation, she said: The most prominent one [accusation] being that I yelled over and tried to silence women who had been assaulted.
(Picture: YouTube)
I did no such thing and wouldnt dream of it. I waited for the woman who was speaking to pass her part and share her story before I went and stood in the crowd.
I stood silently and simply showed my opinion, not interrupting anyone. It was you ladies at the Slutwalk who walked up the stairs and tried to hide my sign from people watching.
Ms. Southern then proceeds to show footage of the event, which seemingly supports her version of events  with protestors appearing to block out her controversial sign.
Lauren added: Im astonished and disgusted that people are knowingly lying and trying to ruin my character because I disagree with them and I respect the right to an opinion and believe you should be able to try it.
Slutwalks are a series of organised protests that began after a Toronto police officer remarked in 2011 that women should avoid dressing like sluts if they wish to avoid sexual assault.

Rebecca and her son Ethan have been found (Picture: PA)
Rebecca Minnock and her three-year-old son Ethan Williamshave been found,Avon and Somerset Police said.
They went missing two weeks ago after a court ruled Ethan should be handed over to his father.
Ethans grandmother,Louise Minnock, has been sentenced to ten days in prison and her partner Andrew Butt for 28 days for contempt of court.
Louise admitted lying about her partner driving Rebecca and Ethan from Highbridge, in Somerset, to Cheltenham in Gloucestershire late last month.
The court ruling had taken place earlier that day.
However, Butt  who said the whole thing was a publicity stunt claimshe did not know where they went after he dropped them off.

He later issueda written statement pleading Rebecca to come out of hiding.
It read: Becky, you need to seriously look at the situation. Its only going to get worse, not just for you but for all of us.
There are some very good people who will help and support you.
We have made our point, we have our support. Come home.
The bitter custody battle led to a search of the mother and her son (Picture: SWNS)
Judge Wildblood told Butt: Yesterday I said that I was in no doubt that you know precisely where Rebecca Minnock and Ethan Williams went that day because you conveyed them both to their destination in your motor car that morning.
Today you have admitted taking mother and child to Cheltenham but you have continued to lie about where in Cheltenham you took them.
You know how important it is that Ethan and Rebecca Minnock are found. They cannot remain in hiding for ever and you know that they will found in the very near future.
In the meantime Ethan is not receiving the stability and care that he should. Further, you know how serious it is that orders have been made for Ethan to live with his father and that those orders are being thwarted by Rebeccas deliberate disobedience, a disobedience that you have assisted.

One of the worlds best universities is planning to hire a professor of Lego.
The lucky candidate will be the head of their own research department at prestigious Cambridge.
Officials say the role is expected to be created within the Faculty of Education after the university received 4million of donations from the Lego Foundation.
Cambridges general board has recommended for the Lego professorship of play in education, development and learning to start in October 2015.
The professor will be director of the Research Centre on Play in Education, Development and Learning.
A Cambridge University spokesman said more details will be provided after the proposal has gone before Regent House in October.
The Lego Foundation owns 25 per cent of Denmark-based toy company Lego.

Sir Tim Hunt (Picture: Johnny Green/PA Wire)
Earlier this week, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Tim Hunt faced a barrage of criticism after he made a series of ill-advised comments about the trouble with girls in scientific research.
Speaking at a conference in South Korea, Hunt said: Three things happen when they [women] are in the lab.
You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry.
But while he claimed his comments were light-hearted and ironic, he was slammed for an apparently regressive attitude to the battle for female equality in science, and has now resigned from his post at University College London.
Since then, Twitter has lampooned his comments in the best way possible, using the #DistractinglySexy hashtag to encourage female scientists to share pictures of themselves at work and prove that Hunt is totally wrong.
Look at these goggles, were in love.

An elderly man has been taken to hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack when his house was pelted with bricks, paint and smoke bombs.
It was the third attack on the home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, which the 68-year-old victim shares with his wife and daughter.
Police have released CCTV footage of the relentless campaign of abuse and vandalism and have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
Detective inspector Cheryl Hughes said: It is no exaggeration to say this family have suffered a terrifying campaign of abuse at the hands of this gang.

The gang smashes several windows in the attack (Picture: YouTube)
After three attacks, they are living on their nerves in a boarded-up home in which they no longer feel safe. It is heartbreaking to think they feel so distressed in what should be the sanctity of their own home, without any clue as to why they are under repeated attack.
Following the last attack, the man was hospitalised with a suspected heart attack and while he is recovering, clearly the stress of what he and his family have endured in recent weeks has taken an unimaginable toll on the familys lives.
On the last occasion, June 5, five masked offenders are seen pulling up outside the house before throwing up to 15 bricks as children and parents on the school run looked on.
The gang then got back into a car  thought to be a stolen black Nissan Qashqai  before driving off.
Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 9987 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

Theres a map in Gottfried Federleins Marsch-Impromptu score (Picture: Facebook)
A man claims to have located 50m worth of Nazi treasure after deciphering a code in a sheet of music.
Whats more surprising is Cyril Whistler has released the name of the burial spot instead of going to claim the diamonds and gold for himself.
Theyre located in Mittenwald, Germany, according to the map found in Gottfried Federleins Marsch-Impromptu score.
Theroute was supposedly put there by Martin Bormann, who was Adolf Hitlers secretary.

The more I studied the piece, the more I discovered. The letters, the number and the signs reveal a route, Dutch violin maker Whistler told the Express .
I soon discovered a typical number that returns over and over again, between the bars as well as encrypted throughout the score.
But theres a slight hitch that might explain Whistlers reluctance to go and fetch the 100 gold bars and diamonds for himself.

Theyre apparently on land owned by the German army and he needs permission to start digging.

To guide a inflatable raft down the Grand Canyon must be really intimidating  what about a shallow wooden rowingboatthat hasnt changed in design since the 19th century?
Amber Shannon, 27, has spent nine years learning the Colorado river rapids but her eyes are on taking wooden dory boats through the canyon.
MORE: Developers want to spoil the Grand Canyon with a huge shopping centre
However, she still has 11 more years on the job before she will be allowed to pilotpassengers through the rapids in a dory on herown.
Experience is key to guiding these boats as theydo not react at all well to rocks, easilycapsizing and breaking up if hit at the wrong point.
Now this looks fun (Picture: Vimeo)
While many people might see twenty years as a long time to earn achance to pilot such a vessel  getting to spend two decadesridingrapids and eating barbecues on the way down doesnt seem too bad.
So until she gets the green light  Amberwill continue to practice with the dory while guiding the baggage boat day-to-day.
Needless to say  Amber Shannonhas serious commitment and upper body muscles.

Canadian siblings Lindsey Peterson, 23, and Danielle, 22, and Dutch tourist Dylan Snel, 23, also received the same sentence.
They group were ordered to pay 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (approx. 860) and face prison for three days.
But the court decided their sentences could be back-dated to reflect the days they have already spent in police custody.
The public prosecutor called for a harsh sentence to attempt to deter similar behaviour, but the judge ruled that as the four defendants had shown remorse, their jail time could begin on June 9.
Eleanor and her fellow holidaymakers are expected to fly home fromMalaysia tomorrow, her lawyer said.

Even the most devoted Pokemon fan would probably admit that the Pikachu tattoo on the left side of the image isnt exactly a fitting tribute to the iconic comic book character.
But then a proper tattoo artist got involved, and turned the crudely drawn image into an adorable inking of Pikachu creating a self portrait.
And as it turns out, theres plenty of tattoo artists who are willing to transform a shoddy inking into a true work of art.
Likethis dodgy inking of the Grim Reaper, transformed into a stunning portrait of a Native American.
Needing to get rid of that unfortunate memory of your ex? Turn it into a cool looking bird.
That hideous skull and crossbones looks a lot more attractive when it adopts the guise of a sprawling, flower covered anchor.
The before shot looks like something from Shaun of the Dead. The after is a stunning likeness and a great tribute.
However, it doesnt have to be all about covering dodgy tattoos. Sometimes, it can be about covering a scar.
Amazing.

Details of thealtercation remain sketchy, at best, although the spirited OAP clearly takes issue with one ofthe men acting aggressively  and lashes out.
Within seconds, the impressiveolder gent had knocked two of the mento the floor with only three punches.
According to Spanish news site 24 Horas ,their swift demise was instigated after they drunkenlydemanded money from the man outside a bar.
We have not been able to independently verify this information and it isnot clear from the video who is at fault,or if the two youths or the man were arrested for their parts in the (one-sided) brawl.
Still, after the video went viral in Russia and then worldwide (with 4million views to date)those on the receiving end definitelylearned alesson  respect your elders.

Jack King was the Voice of NASA (Picture: Alamy)
The man known as the voice of Apollo who called the countdown of the first moon landing has died at the age of 84.
Jack King counted down hundreds of early rocket launches, but his most famous hour came when he counted down the historic Apollo 11 Mission on 16th July 1969.
Lift off, we have a lift-off, he said as the rocket soared into space with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on-board.
Thirty-two minutes past the hour, lift-off on Apollo 11. Tower cleared.

Speaking in 2009, on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Mr King said that he still enjoyed listening to the recordings of his voice on footage of the historic mission.
He died on Thursday at a hospice facility, after suffering congestive heart failure.

This video shows the amazing moment that a Boeing 787 Dreamliner begins a steep climb into the sky only moments after leaving the tarmac.
In the impressive footage, the plane can be seen performing the bold manoeuvre as it takes off from Washington Airport, en route to the 2015 Paris Airshow.
At present, 509 of the airliners have been purchased by companies including Vietnam Airways, while Boeing have claimed that the craft are far more economical than previous planes- using 20 percent less fuel.

Eleanor Hawkins, the Brit touristwho angered Malaysian mountain gods with her nudity, has pleaded guilty to a public nuisance offence.
The 23-year-old admitted her offence during an appearance at Kota Kinabalu Magistrates Court.
Eleanor, who was among a group of backpackers, was blamed for triggering an earthquake by posing naked on the sacred peak of Mount Kinabalu.
She could face a possible three-month prison sentence or a fine.

A magnitude-5.9 earthquake struck the 13,400ft-high mountain last Friday, killing 18 people and leaving hundreds more stranded.
Sabah state deputy chief minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan blamed the earthquake six days later on travellers showing disrespect to the sacred mountain.
The group of 10 tourists stripped naked before taking photos at the peak of Kinabalu on May 30.
Miss Hawkinss lawyer Ronny Cham said: She may be charged today or have her bail extended. I dont know.

Yesterday her father said his daughter was sorry for any offence caused by her actions.
He said: She knows what she did was stupid and disrespectful and is very sorry for the offence that she has caused the Malaysian people.
He added: We hope that the Malaysian authorities deal with the misdemeanour and not link it to the unfortunate tragic events that occurred the following week.
Miss Hawkins, who recently graduated with a masters in aeronautical engineering fromSouthampton University, was in the middle of a gap year travelling around south-east
Asia which began in January.
Police obtained a court order to detain her and three other westerners for four days while they are investigated for indecent behaviour, Sabah state police chief Jalaluddin Abdul Rahman said.

Rachel Dolezal, 37, is a civil rights leader in eastern Washington, on the United States west coast.
She is president of a civil liberties organisation called Spokane NAACP, who claim their mission is the enhancement of coloured people to eliminate race-based discrimination.
This is Rachel.
(Picture: Facebook)
She is also part of Spokanespolice oversight commission and is a professorofAfricanstudiesat Eastern Washington University.
Rachels bio says: Her passion for civil rights is influenced by her years in Mississippi, where she advocated for equal rights and participated in community development.
She also claims tohave been subject to eight documented hate crimes although reports suggest no suspect has ever been identified.
But Rachels parentshave come forward to claim that their daughterisnt black.
They claim she is passing herself off as an ethnic minorityand she was actuallyborn Caucasian with bothher mother Ruthanne and father Larry beingwhite. Her brother Izalah  who is black  was adopted, they added.
Her father Larry Dolezal said:
Shes our birth daughter and were both of European descent. Were puzzled and its very sad.
Her parents say her heritage is in fact Czech, Swedish, German and traces of native American. They say their daughter has cut off all communication with them and suspect this is because she does not want to be seen with Caucasian parents.
Asked why his daughter might be pretending to be black, he told Buzzfeed :
She has over the past 20 years assimilated herself into the African American community through her various advocacy and social justice work, and so that may be part of the answer.
Dolezal's parents, who live in Troy, MT, say Rachel has been deceiving people. They want people to know the truth. pic.twitter.com/sS3aiUwD0H
 Taylor Viydo (@KREMTaylor) June 11, 2015
This man was alsointroduced as her father:
When Rachel was asked by a news channelwhether she is African American, she is reported to have giventhis response:

But she maintains that she is black, telling one local newspaper, the Coeur dAlene Press : They can DNA test me if they want to.

A Malaysia Airlines passenger jet has made an emergency landing at Melbourne airport on Friday after a reported engine fire, an official said.
Flight 148 from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur landed without incident or injury, airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said.
Gillett could not confirm media reports that the Airbus A330 returned to Melbourne because of an engine fire.
The pilot called an emergency landing and as standard procedure when a pilot calls any sort of emergency landing, emergency personnel are currently on site, Gillett said shortly after the landing.
She confirmed that the jet had dumped fuel, saying that was standard procedure before an emergency landing.
The troubled state-owned airline lost two airliners in disasters last year.

An elderly man has died of heat exhaustion along with his dog after they both became trapped in a car.
James Rogers, 72, became trapped in his Covette after the battery failed and he was unable to open the electric doors or windows.
He wasnt even able to operate the horn on the car, and due to the strong Texas heat he perished along with his dog Leia.
The Corvette did have a manual release button in case such a situation occurs, however Mr Rogerswas apparently unaware of it.
In a tragic coincidence James had left his phone in the restaurant he was visiting, meaning he was unable to call for help.

It was four hours before staff discovered him and called the police, as temperatures climbed as high as32.2C outside.
By the time firefighters arrived to try and free him Mr Rogers and his dog were both dead.
Several people on Corvette forums have shared stories about being locked in their cars.

The design of the last tower to be built on the 16-acre Ground Zero plot in New York has been unveiled by its developers.
2 World Trade Center (WTC) will be1,340ft tall with 80 storeys and is due to open for business in September 2021  20 years after the tragic events of 9/11.
Its architect, Bjarke Ingels, explained that he wanted to design a building which will both respect the fallen of 9/11 and help rejuvenate the downtown area of New York
Hetold Wired :On one hand its about being respectful and about completing the frame around the memorial, and on the other hand its about revitalizing downtown Manhattan and making it a lively place to live and work.

This new addition to the plot will only be 28ftshorter than Freedom Tower (Official title: One World Trade Center) if you do not include the latersspire which adds another 424ft.
The press release for 2 WTC states:The design of 2 WTC is derived from its urban context at the meeting point between two very different neighbourhoods: the Financial District with its modernist skyscrapers and TriBeCa with its lofts and roof gardens.
The design combines the unique qualities of each.

Skip to the four-minute-mark for some window smashing
A police officer has been filmed smashing in the car window of a motorist who allegedly broke the speed limit.
The officer continually asks 49-year-old Scott Richardson to provide his driving licence and insurance documents, however herefuses to give them over, and instead bizarrely asks the officer: As a man what right do you have to pull another man over?
Richardsonthen claims that in the State of Texas speeding in and of itself is not illegal.
Losing his temper with the mouthy driver, the officer eventually whips out his baton and makes short work of the car window.

The standard issue this is you last warning face (Picture: Youtube/SNAFU radio)
Richardson, who was reportedly traveling at 50mph in a 40mph zone, claims he has committed no crime because Texas has presumed speed limits, which state a driver can break the speed limit by a small margin provided they are driving safely (however this doesnt excuse you from having to present an officer with your driving licence when requested).
He also informs the officer that he is a sovereign citizen  a movement of people who claim they are not subjects of any government and therefore do not have to follow their laws.
Sadly the officer is having none of it, and after battering through Richardsons window drags him out of the car and arrests him.
He was charged withdriving with an invalid license, having expired license plates, failing to present his drivers license upon demand and traffic violations.
Addison Police Department have said the officer was absolutely right to break Richardsons window.
A spokesperson said: Richardson did not comply with the lawful order from the police officer repeatedly and the officer is permitted to force him to comply.

        <MainBody>Metro News Reporter for Metro.co.uk Thursday 11 Jun 2015 4:33 pm
Words like moist make us want to throw up our small intestine and now science has revealed why.
Weare universally grossed out by words that we mentally associate with bodily functions like phlegm and sticky and apparently for 20 per cent of us its as bad as hearing nails down a chalkboard.
Psychologists revealed in a new study from Oberlin College and Trinity University in the US on word aversion that its a question of what our brains associate it with.
Unsurprisingly, most of the words cameinto the language with a non-offensive meaning, but with our filthy animal instincts weve given them sexual undertones.
In fact a load of them are baking terms like sticky, flan, moist, curd, smear, soggy, crusty and my personal favourite  yeasty. Theyre mostly disgusting because they make us think of a juicy or gone-off lady garden.
Then there are wonderful action wordslike squelch which the study says are just plain phonologically unpleasant.
Our poll on Twitter reveals these are the 23 words you hate the most:
1. Moist

Mountain gods are currently livid with one Brit girls boobs.
Eleanor Hawkins , 23, is being investigated for indecent behaviour after she allegedly posed naked in front of Mount Kinabalu  which locals consider sacred.
A senior minister in Malaysia has blamed the nude photoshoot for a subsequent earthquake.
But Ms Hawkins isnt the first Brit abroad to make our country blush while hitting the headlines, meet fiveother offenders.
1. The Magaluf party girl
Oh dear (Picture: Supplied)
Who can forget the 21-year-old Irish tourist that performed oral sex on 24 men in a sweaty crowded Magaluf nightclub?
Now weve all made mistakes after one too many shandies, but this poor girls misguided antics went viral.
Plus, she thought she was going to be rewarded with a holiday in a luxury resort, only to be further humiliated when she was fobbed off with a cocktail of the same name.
2. This couple who just couldnt control themselves
Rebecca Blake and Conor McRedmond were jailed after their sex session (Picture: Reuters)
In 2013 a couple were arrested for getting jiggy in the back of a Dubai taxi.
British businesswoman Rebecca Blake and Irish welder Conor McRedmond, aged 30 and 28 at the time of the incident, were convicting after falling foul of Dubais strict decency laws.
They received a two month jail sentence and were later deported.
3. These extremely naughty nuns
Pray for forgiveness (Picture: EPA)
Rewind back to 2009 and 17 British holidaymakers were arrested for posing as naughty nuns in Greece
Although residents of Crete are used to the hustle and bustle of living in a tourist hotspot, those native to Chania  on Cretes northern coastline  try to preserve local traditions.
So its not exactly surprising that they were offended by a bunch of burly blokes in skimpy nun habits and lingerie.

4. This bitey gent
Fastforward to last summer in Magaluf (Can you see a pattern emerging here?) for this pleasant gentleman who had to be restrained by 10 police officers after he tried to bite other tourists.
Instead of topping up his tan, the then 28-year-old man later admitted that hes decided to take a load of drugs instead.
Each to their own.
5. This woman who couldnt help butscratch that itch
Almost (Picture: Getty)
In March, a Londoner very nearly made it back from her trip in Jamaica without any embarrassing incidents.
But then she stripped off and performed a sex act on herself mid-flight, British Airways staff confirmed.
When police met her at Gatwick Airport, she received a caution for being drunk.
The Foreign Office warn: Dont take risks with the law abroad  or you could end up throwing years of your life away in a foreign prison.
Which sounds like pretty good advice, really.

An astrophysicist has gone on the rant to end all rants about Tim Hunts bulls*** in light of comments made by the former UCL professor about women in science.
Sir Tim Hunt resigned from his position as honorary professor at University College London for saying women cry in laboratories and even accused them of falling in love with male colleagues.
Astrophysicist Sarah Tuttle, who says she is heavily salting the garden path of ignorance, has taken theRoyal Society fellow to task  and she is holding nothing back.For over an hour Sarah, from Texas, gave Hunt a piece of her mind while tackling the issue of misogyny in the sciences.

You might want to cut down on the camel urine (Picture: EPA)
You may have recently discovered people like to drink camel weeafter hearing aboutan outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Mers).
The deadly condition, which is caused by consuming the urine, has already killed seven people in South Korea.
But you maybe wondering why anyone would want to drink animal wee.
Some people apparently think it helps them cure their health problems.
This is because of a passagein the Hadith (Muslim holy book) that exalts its virtues.
Some people of Ukl or Uraina tribe came to Medina and its climate did not suit them,the extract reads.
So the Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine).
So they went as directed and after they became healthy
But this could be further from the truth, according toThe World Health Organisation (WHO), which has warned againstconsuming the urine.
Food hygiene practices should be observed, WHO said in a statement.
People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

This is the last thing you need while trying to get down from a roofin the blazing heat.
The poor victim in the video was left flapping his legs like a first time swimmer after his mate decided to play a prank on him.
The clip showed the sneaky trickster removing the ladder each time his mate attempted to climb down it.
This is one of the best ladder pranks ever (Picture: YouTube/Kidu Videos)
When he would get up to see what was going onthe prankster would quickly hide.
This happened a few times until his mate finally caught him in the act.
He wasnt too happy and hurled his shoes at the jokerwho scampered away.
But hopefully he came back as he dropped the ladder in the process, leaving his friend stuck on the roof.

Chuck out that spanking new Luis Vuitton (okay fake) bag you got for your holiday  its now probably way toobig.
The size of hand luggage is expected to shrink from 56cm by 45cm by 25cm (ish) to a minuscule 55cm by 35cm by 20cm.
On the plus side, this will hopefully eliminate the variety of different size allowances on different airlines.
At the moment Easyjet and British Airways allow 56cm by 45cm by 25cm while Virgin Atlantic only allow 56cm by 36cm by 23cm.
Ryanair meanwhile only allows 55cm by 40cm by 20cm.
Honchosat the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Miami havedecided that this variation is unacceptable as it causes problems with people changing carriers for connecting flights.
So theyve proposed this new tiny size as a solution. Emirates, Qatar and Lufthansa have already indicated that they will sign up to the guidelines with the rest expected to follow suit soon.
What do you think?
Hand luggage allowance at the moment
VIRGIN56cm x36cm x23cm

A Christian couple has saidthat they will divorce if gay marriage is legalised in Australia.
Nick and Sarah Jensen, from Canberra, Australia, said they would legally separate but would remain a couple in the eyes of God.
MrJensen wrote in the Canberra City News : My wife and I just celebrated our 10-year anniversary. But later this year, we may be getting a divorce.
Our view is that marriage is a fundamental order of creation. Part of Gods human history.
While the couple have stated they would legally divorce  they have said they would continue to be married in the eyes of god, live together and raise their children.
Nick Jensen has previously been employed bythe Australian Christian Lobby and now works as adirector of the Lachlan Macquarie Institute, a Christian political organisation.

Mr Jensen continued: Marriage is the union of a man and a woman before a community in the sight of God.
MORE: Father refused to let his son have his hair cut by gay stylist
And marriage of any couple is important to God regardless of whether that couple recognises Gods involvement or authority in it.
If our federal parliament votes to change the timeless and organic definition of marriage later on this year, it will have moved against the fundamental and foundational building block of Australian society and, indeed, human culture everywhere.
Canberra City News have been widely criticised for publishing this controversial opinionpiece according to news.com.au .
Natalie Sarah wrote on Facebook: This is absolutely disgusting, not to mention homophobic. I cant believe such an article was published.
You should be ashamed and you definitely owe to gay community an apology.

The magazines editor,Ian Meikle said: I think this couple had an interesting angle, and that it was newsworthy.
The article does not reflect the opinion of the paper.
We published arguments and I decided it was a serious enough argument to genuinely warrant some attention.

View from the peak of Mount Kinabalu (Picture: file)
To the local community living at its foot, Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia is seen as the resting place of their ancestors.
The mountain, the highest between the Himalayas and New Guinea, sits in Kinabalu Park which became a Unesco World Heritage site in 2000.
The Kadazan and Dusun communities have long held the mountain as a sacred place.
According to the Global Diversity Foundation, locals believe their loved ones must be buried facing the landmark when they die so their spirits can see the mountain as they start their journey to the afterlife.

The charity said: Although many have since embraced formal religions, Mount Kinabalu is still a venerated sacred place, a source of their identity and spirituality.
Rough guide to climbing the mountain
Do not attempt any nakedness
The park operates a no trace policy. Do not make a mess.
Never climb without a valid permit. Only 146 climb permits are issuedper day.
You should aim to stay in the Kinabalu Park or a highland resort prior climb for high altitude acclimatisation
Never attempt to catch a flight on the same day of descend as you are likely to miss it
The establishment of the park in the 1960s restricted access for villagers, and the mountains popularity with tourists grew.
Traveller manual Rough Guides said: Although there are other hikes within the park, the prospect of reaching the summit fires the imagination of Malaysian and foreign tourists alike.
Since 2010, an annual pilgrimage has been made by local villagers during which a ritual known as monolob is performed, asking the mountain spirit to keep those who climb it safe.
In recent years, efforts have been made to gather knowledge and history from elders to ensure the mountains traditions are not forgotten by the younger generations.

Mount Kinabalu, which can be seen from the west coast, is revered by locals as aki nabalu or the home of the spirits of the dead. It dominates the 290 square miles of Kinabalu National Park.
It sits in a region which boasts powerful ecology, flora and geology.
It is named after Sir Hugh Low, a British colonial administrator who made the first climb in 1851.
He did not manage to make it to the summit. This was achieved by zoologist John Whitehead in 1888. The summit trail through luxuriant jungle foliage is now a big tourist attraction.
A dangerous summit
The impressive sights from Mount Kinabalus 13,435ft peak entices tens of thousands of climbers but there is also danger in the beauty.
German tourist Victoria Paulsen, 22, died after falling around 100ft down a rocky surface from Lows Peak, the highest point in Kinabalu last year.
The weather can make the tough trek, along with any rescue attempt which may have to be launched, more challenging.
The body of Briton Ellie James, 17, who was lost in a storm on Mt Kinabalu in August 2001, was discovered at the base of a steep rock face.
Rescue teams, who scoured the peaks and gullies around the summit only to be beaten back by tropical storms and by dense swirling mist, had been frustrated by six days of bad weather which hid her location.
A threatening mix of lashing rain, gales and temperatures that plunged to below freezing at night made exposure a danger.
A 10-man British Army team survived for 29 days after becoming stranded in a narrow ravine in 1994.
Rescuers described the soldiers, who had been on a training expedition, as being trapped like a spider in the bathtub.
The men were stuck between two giant waterfalls and had written SOS in pebbles . Steep cliffs stopped a helicopter landing and a thick mist from the mountain peak had begun to flood the ravine. Stretchers had to be winched down from the helicopter.

Olesya Belmasova and Anastasiya Kirillova, both16, wentto a train station in the city of Taganrog in southern Russia.
They tried to climb on the tank car of an old freight train that was standing at the platform  but didnt realise itwas still in use and on a live track.
The pairaccidentally touched the track and were zapped with thousands of volts.
A horrified train worker who witnessed the scene said one of the girls appeared to explode.
He said: I was walking towards them to ask them what they were doing when they were suddenly blasted to the ground.

Anastasia, who was still able to talk, said: We climbed on top of the tank car and then I heard a loud clap.We fell off the car and onto the ground.
A witness said one girl seemed to explode (Picture: CEN)
My hair was on fire and I was in so much pain.

The student was expelled in 2013 (Picture: Getty)
An student is suing his university for a miscarriage of justice after he was expelled following the verdict of a rape case.
The 22-year-old man, who goes by thepseudonym John Doe, was kicked out ofAmherst College in Massachusetts, US, after the disciplinary board had concluded that he forced a female student to performoral sex on him in February 2012.
Doe has always maintained that he had in fact blacked out after drinking heavily and received the sex act without any knowledge of it.
Two years later, he was accused of sexual assault and found guilty.
But now, his lawyer has helped uncover powerful new evidence which proves his innocence  yet the college is not re-opening its case.
The accuser was the room mate of the woman Doe was dating at the time.
A text message sent from herto a friend immediately after the alleged raperead: Its pretty obvi I wasnt an innocent bystander.
Then she send another message reading: Oh my God I just did something stupid.
Later that evening she invited another male student back to her place for sex.
This man has since testified that she seemed friendly, flirtatious, and spirited and not in any way anxious, stressed, depressed, or otherwise in distress.
Late last month, Does lawyer, Max D. Stern, filed a lawsuit in US District Court in Springfield, arguing that the college is guilty of a miscarriage of justice against his client.

As the Department of Education and its Office of Civil Rights have made clear, Title IX protects any person attending college from sex-based discrimination, and requires colleges to have in place prompt, thorough and impartial means of investigating and adjudicating claims of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence.
The College has put in place a process that is consistent with the requirements under Title IX and is fair to all parties.
In this instance, the hearing board concluded that the individual violated the Colleges policies on sexual misconduct and respect for other persons.
The College is confident that the hearing board followed the Colleges process in making its decision.

Misshapen ears are among the traits of paedophiles, according to the study(Picture: PA Wire)
We may be able to spot a paedophile just by the way someone looks, a controversial study argues.
Scientists believe there are physical differences we can use to identify those who are more likely to commit sex crimes on children such ashaving non-detached earlobes, misshapen ears and being left handed.
Fiona Dyshniku, of the University of Windsor in Canada, said: Evidence is steadily accumulating to support a neurodevelopmental basis of paedophilia.
If we find that paedophilia has a biological basis, with a very early, even prenatal onset, this will influence and hopefully improve methods of treatment for this group.
A total of140 people took part in the study  all of which showed signs of distressing or illegal sexual behaviour.

They were interviewed about theirsexual history and erotic preference. Then their physical features were analysed.
The findings suggest that the paedophiles who participated in the study were more likely to have minor facial and head anomalies than thosewho were not paedophiles.
Physical irregularities, known as minor physical anomalies (MPAs), can also includehavinga curved fifth finger, a third toe longer than the second toe and an excessive gap between first and second toe.
They developwhile the baby is still in the womb and arethought to have a greater impact on the male brain.

Its about to get easier to change your contract (Picture: Alamy)
We all shudder at the thought of a 24-month phone contract. By the time you come to upgrade theres going to be at least seven new iPhone models and yours will look like a Nokia 3310.
But ditching and switching your contracts could be about to get a whole lot easier.
Sharon White, Ofcoms new chief executive, is to warn the industry that it must improve its service to customers who still find it too difficult to change provider and cancel contracts.
Shes mooting plans to introduce a quality line for broadband on all providers, with customers being able to opt out of the deal if it falls below an acceptable level.
Speaking at a conference hosted by consumer group Which?, Ms White will say: When Ofcom was established, access to a reliable internet connection and mobile phone was nice to have.
Now it is essential to the functioning of the economy, to the way people work and live their lives.
Providers like Vodafone will have to adhere to the rules (Picture: PA)
Improving delivery to consumers doesnt just fall at the feet of the regulator. The delivery of first-class communications services is primarily the responsibility of providers.
Our job is to ensure that markets work for consumers and citizens, principally by encouraging competition.
Where markets dont work well enough  or where competition alone isnt enough to secure good outcomes for consumers  then we have powers to intervene.
She will tell providers that they must improve in four areas by giving consumers better information to help them compare deals, ensuring straightforward switching, adopting clear and fair contracts, and handling complaints better.

From June 20, a new process will place responsibility for switching between landline and broadband providers who use the Openreach network  such as BT, EE, Sky and TalkTalk  with the company the customer is moving to.
Ms White will say: This will make a real difference for consumers and will encourage more people to take full advantage of competition in the sector.
Once this is in place, we will next month turn our attention to improving consumer switching between mobile networks.

So far it only works on mice though(Picture: Getty)
Its one of the fastest growing pandemics in the world  obesity.
But now scientists believe they have made a breakthrough which could help reverse this trend by testing, of course, on mice.
By turning off a certain enzyme in mice researchers from the German Cancer Research Center found they were able to feed the test mice fatty foods high in calories and yet they did not gain any weight.
Not only that, but none of the animals developed diabetes or any other illnesses which often accompany poor diet and excessive weight.
Before you gotlooking for a scientist to turn off some of your enzymes so you can stuff you face, be aware that the researchers have only been able to make this work on mice, and have no idea if the same will apply to humans.
MORE: Exploding spiders are being found all across Britain
The enzyme they switch off is called Kit, and is involved in the development of blood and immune cells, as well as stem cells.
Professor Hans-Reimer Rodewald said: We are quite convinced that immune cells play a role in the pathogenic consequences of obesity.
But apart from that, little is understood so far about the exact processes that lead to disruptions in metabolism.

A man who dug a 70m-deep hole in search of his own personalwater supply struck a huge natural gas reserve instead.
Sanya Sanyasiri, 41, was convinced if he went deep enough hed find groundwater he could tap into for his car repair workshop in Thailand.
He also fancied having his own privatewater supplyin Mae Sot district in western Thailand.

But after getting down to 70m he noticed gas was streaming out of the hole, and had to insert apipe to fill it up again.
Curious by his discovery, Sanya took it to the next level and decided to capture his new find in a plastic bag.
Picture:  CEN
No longer satisfied with just filling the bag with gas, he thought hedtest if itwas flammable by setting it alight.
Picture:  CEN
He then discovered the gas was under high pressure (oops) and had put a special valve on to stop it flooding into the workshop.
According to Bangkokpost.comofficials conducted tests on the gas and reported thattrapped samplesburned with a clear blue flame.
The burning gas could boil water in five minutes and fry an egg faster than ordinary cooking gas.
Authorities have askedSanya to move the gas pipeline, which was in the middle of his garage, to a safer spot to prevent a possible fire.
Theyve collected samples for further examination, butdensity checks revealedit is probably methane.

Two months after a mentally ill pilot crashed a plane into the side of a mountain, people are still struggling to understand what could have triggered such a shockingact.
Among those killedwas a group of 16 schoolchildren, who by a cruel twist of fate caughtthe Germanwing A320 flight on March 24 from Dusseldorf to Barcelona havingalmost missed it when one pupil forgot her passport.
The children, who were on an exchange trip to Spain, sent texts hometo their families just moments before the crash telling of their excitement at seeing their families. But they were never to reach their destination.
Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz murdered them alongside two teachers and 132 others when he deliberatelylocked his captain out of the cockpit and steered the plane into the French Alps.
Today those 16 children and their two teachers finally came home.
This picture of their funeral cortege snaking along a German motorway after their coffins were flown into Dusseldorf airport is a lasting reminder of that horror.
Something we should never forget. RIP.

WARNING: Footage features scenes of animal cruelty
Its no secret the food industry is pretty grim behind theproduction lines, but this footage takes it to new lows.
The Humane Society of the United States took this secret footage of battery farmed hens and the horrific conditions they are forced to live in.
The chickens are allegedly owned by Costco for egg production.
Among the horrific sights in the video are dead birdsbeing pounded into flattened pancakes by other chickens as their bodies are left in the cages, and henswith feathers missing and covered in what look like sores, crammed into tiny cages in the pitch black warehouse.
MORE: Rabbit manages to survive running through an avalanche
The HSUS say these conditions are not only inhumane, but also create a health hazard for humans consuming eggs, claiming that confining birds to cages in this manner increases the risk of salmonella.
They also accuse Costco of misleading the consumer by emblazoning their egg cartons with images of chickens happily living outside on green pastures.
Calling animal abuse the standard practise of the food industry, they ask consumers to put pressure on Costco to end battery farming of their chickens.

A female prison worker who is being questioned over the escape of two killers may have done it because one is very well-endowed, suggested a retired detective.
Richard Matt, 48, and David Sweat, 34, broke out of jail over the weekend by using power tools to tunnel through the walls ofClinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, 20 miles from the Canadian border.
They left a note behind with a smiley face and the words: Have a nice day.
Joyce Mitchell has been interrogated and retired detectiveDavid Bentley told the New York Post Matt has a way with the ladies.
He said: When hescleaned up, hes very handsome and, in all frankness, very well endowed. He gets girlfriends any place he goes.

Officials are believed to have taken the tool from a nearby construction site.
They blasted through a number of walls before snapping off a lock to open a manhole cover on a street more than a mile away from the prison.
The acting state corrections commissioner, Anthony Annuci, said: A search revealed that there was a hole cut out of the back of the cell through which these inmates escaped.

They went onto a catwalk which is about six stories high.
We estimate they climbed down and had power tools and were able to get out to this facility through tunnels, cutting away at several spots.
To add to the cinematic nature of their escape, Governor Cuomo stated thatthe men had even arranged their beds so it looked like people were sleeping.

This film may be the last footage of pioneering aviatorAmelia Earhart before her fateful final flight.
Experts are split on when the footage was actually taken, with some believing it was shot in March 1937, moments before setting off on her first soloround-the-worldattempt which ended prematurely when her plane crashed.
Others claim it is from May of that year, just two months before Earhart set out on her final voyage  making it the last footage ever taken of her.
Filmed on the runway atBurbank Airport (now Bob Hope Airport) in California, the footage shows Earhart smiling and posing on her plane, the Lockheed Electra L-10E.
Earharts plane famously disappeared over the Pacificoceanshortly after setting off fromNew Guinea.
Speculation as to how her flight ended continues to this day.

Are parents paying too much for school trips? (Picture: Getty)
Every year parents are put under pressure to fork out large sums for school trips.
A debate over whether or not educational establishments should cap the costof excursions has been re-ignited afterHorsforth School in Yorkshire asked parents to pay1,650 for a week-long sporting trip to Barbados.
The plan was criticised for segregating families who cant afford to send their children away.
This #Horsforth #schooltrip at 1650 highlights that most schools seem to think that money grows on trees. They have no link with reality.
 Tim Wallis (@TimWallis1969) June 9, 2015
Whether it's prom nights or foreign trips, ALL schools need to rethink the impact they have on  budgets of less well off families #Horsforth

But it probably wont surprise you toknowthats not the most expensive school trip to have ever been mooted.
Here are a few othersthatll make your eyes water and wallet whimper in pain.

Parents of studentsat Epsom College were asked to fork out the hefty sum for this trip, or two other trips at the time each totalling more than 3,000.
But not enough parents signed up so it was cancelled.

An interesting view from a teacher who posted about his/her experience on Mumsnet .
I used to work in an area with a much more mixed demographic. A really deprived area right near a much more affluent one. That college ran an annual NY trip for four days costing 800.
I went on it in my first year there. Totally pointless. One theatre visit, one tv studio, then sightseeing (empire state, statue etc). Most of the girls spent all their time in Bloomingdales. For less than 100 we could have gone to a show in London and visited a tv studio here.
To be fair to schools
The trips do offer unforgettable and exciting experiences which are, ultimately, educational in one way or another
Where they can, schools will help finance the trips
Theyre not compulsory
Staff give up their time to help out and volunteer
Teachers carry the heavy burden of being a parent as well

FBI agents have raided the home of a man who is alleged to have leaked nude photos of celebrities as part of The Fappening.
Jennifer Lawrence, Rhianna and Kate Upton were all targeted in the mass leak last summer.
Official FBI documents nameEmilio Herrera whose IP address was allegedly used to hack more than 500 iCloud accounts, reports Gawker .
Special Agent Josh Sedowskywrote: Based on victim account records obtained from Apple, one or more computers used at [Herreras house] access or attempted to access without authorisation multiple celebrities email and iCloud accounts over the course of several months.
The IP address accessed more than 330 iCloud accounts (Picture: Getty)
The IP address on Narragansett accessed 330 unique iCloud accounts between May and August 2014, according to the other.
Of those, 291 allegedly belonged to people who registered their accounts outside Illinois. Those 291 accounts were accessed more than 600 times.
The document lists othervictims by initials who are believed to beAbigail Spencer, Christina Hendricks, Hope Solo, Jennette McCurdy, Olivia Wilde, Anna Kendrick, Emily Browning and Amber Heard, Gawker adds.
The mass leak was branded The Fappening  a slang term for masturbation and play on apocalypticmovie The Happening.
Several computers, hard drives and phones have been confiscated from the Chicago home since the raid on October 16 2014.
Mr Hererra has not been charged with any crimes. The FBI has declined to comment.

A suicide bomber has blown himself up at one of Egypts most famous tourists spots.
Officials say there is no immediate word on casualties from the late morning attack.
The bomber attacked the ancient temple of Karnak in Luxor, a southern city frequented by millions of foreign and Egyptian tourists every year.
They say police have foiled two other suicide attacks also targeting the Nile-side temple, one of the countrys main tourist attractions, rivalling the pyramids at Giza.
Early news of Luxor bomb suggests complex op bearing hallmarks of IS loyalists. Haven't managed mainland significant attack since Jan 2014.

A teenager who had to have her left amputated after the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash has stood up for the first time.
Leah Washington, 17,from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was one of four seriously injured when a carriage on The Smiler crashed into an empty one on Tuesday last week.
She was taken into intensive care after she was trapped on the ride for more than four hours.
Her left leg was taken off above the knee and her condition has dramatically improved.
Speaking to the BBC, Leahs brother Luke said: She was heavily sedated. She was in intensive care and the machines were keeping her going.

Yesterday I walked into the room and she was standing up. It was great.
Each day has gone by and shes improved and improved.I dont know where shes got her strength from.
Leah was on a date with Joe Pugh when the crash happened.
Vicky Balch, 20, from Leyland in Lancashire and Daniel Thorpe, 27, from Buxton, Derbyshire, were also seriously injured.
Alton Towers has admitted full responsibility for the crash in letters to the victims and their families.

When 17-year-old Lily Lindquist usedher toilet and went to flush the chain  she was surprised to find it blocked.
She called in her mother Marian, who produced a very robust plunger. It failed.
Eventually the family, who live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, were forced to call in professional help in the form of plumber Ailsa Scott.
The toilet looked innocent enough (Picture: YouTube)
Ailsa, who has been a plumber for 12 years, used an industrial unblocker to dislodge the clog and was shocked to discover a giant slithering IGUANA.

Ailsa said: To my surprise, I pulled out that large iguana. At first I thought it was a toy, and then it started moving around.
Ive never seen anything like this before. This is the first time I pulled something like that out of a toilet.
This is what she pulled out. Actual picture. (Picture: YouTube)
The plumber believes the iguana made it into the toilet through a vent on the roofof the familys house.
Stunt iguana. Not the iguana involved. (Picture: YouTube)
Lily has now made sure the vent is firmly closed.
She said:I dont want to be there when an iguana flies out of the toilet or an iguana bites me when Im trying to go to the bathroom.

Unfortunately, the poor thing didnt make it and died shortly after his ordeal.
Lilys mother said: We didnt want the iguana to die. We did not know the iguana was there.

A police officer in Dallas has resigned after he was recorded pushing a black teenage girl to the ground outside a pool party and brandishing his gun at others.
Officer David Eric Casebolt was out of control and his actions were indefencible, though he was not pressured to quit, McKinney police chief Greg Conley said after the officer submitted his resignation.
The video was posted online after officers responded to calls on Friday and it quickly went viral.
The 41-year-old former Texas state trooper and ten year veteran of the McKinney force was put on administrative leave after the incident.
Conley said a review of the video showed that our policies, our training and our practices do not support his actions.

Casebolts actions are under investigation and no decision has been made whether charges will be filed against him, Conley said.
Charges of interfering with an officer and evading arrest against the only man arrested during Fridays incident have been dropped,he added.

Writer Andrea Eyland Sleyjar-og Bjrgvinsdttir has shared her story of sexual abuse before.
She said:I was very ashamed for having landed in such a situation and had very little self-esteem.
I think this is the beginning of a revolution.
Reading these stories encourages other women to come forward and tell their story. They have to know they have nothing to be ashamed about.
We need to tear down the wall of silence, which serves no purpose but to defend perpetrators of sexual violence.
Beauty Tipsfounder slaug Mara Agnarsdttir says she gets hundreds of new members every day. Only women are allowed to join, but the campaign has spread to other social media groups which encourages men to share their stories as well.

The theory is displayed among famous people throughout history (Picture: PA)
Scientists have found a link between creativity and mental health issues.
They say artistic types with unusual jobs and more likely to have genes that causes problems like manic depressionthan those with standard jobs.
The theory is displayed among famous people throughout history such as painterVan Gogh.
More than 250,000 people were studied as part of the Icelandic research which was published inthe journal Nature Neuroscience.
They found people who had creative careers like acting were more likely than others to carry the genes linked to mental health issues.
Van Gogh suffered from self-destructive behaviour(Picture: AP)
This was compared to the genes of those with average careers like salesmen.
Lead researcher, Kari Stefansson, of genetic research firm deCODE, said: We are using the tools of modern genetics to take a systematic look at a fundamental aspect of how the brain works.
The results should not be a surprise because to be creative you have to think differently from the crowd.

A 102-year-oldhas become Germanys oldest recipient of a doctorate today after waiting 80 years because her thesis was blocked by the Nazis.
Studying at university can feel like it is taking decades and sometimes you wish you could have an extra day or two to finish an essay.
But be careful what you wish for because Ingeborg Syllm-Rapoport had been waiting since 1938 to officially complete her PhDdue to her Jewish heritage.
After the Nazis came to power they expelled Jews from educationand many professions.

Ingeborgcleared the final hurdle by passing an oral exam then finally received her doctorate at the University of Hambury to come aneonatologist (specialist in caring for newborns).
In 1938 her supervisorwrote in a letter he would have accepted her work on diphtheria if it hadnt been for the Nazis race laws which, he said, make it impossible to allow Miss Syllms admission for the doctorate.
After the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, they gradually disenfranchised Jews, expelling them from universities, schools and many professions, before eventually deporting and killing them in death camps across Europe.
Medical director of the universitys hospital Burkhard Goeke said: After almost 80 years it was possible to restore some extent of justice.

A terminally ill six-year-old boy has been given an honorary diploma from a local high school during their graduation ceremony.
Jordan Planitz suffers fromMPPH (Megalencephaly, Polymicrogyria, Polydactyly and Hydrocephalus)  a rare and terminal neurological syndrome.
While it is unlikely little Jordan will see his own graduation, kind students at theTri-City High School in Illinoisinvited him along to their ceremony.
They had gotten to know Jordan during the principal for a day initiative started by the now ex-principal Dustin Day, which allowed sick children to come in and act as the schools head for a day.
Jordans mother, Deanna told ABC News : Jordan was invited, and we went and met the most amazing senior class that youll ever come across.
They took care of him all day, surrounded him going up and down stairs. It was a wonderful experience.
Jordans has cogitative difficulties due to his illness and has trouble walking up and down stairs.

Flanked by three senior students, Jordan took to the stage to receive his honorary high-school diploma during the ceremony.
Students rose to their feet and applauded as the smiling youngster gleefully grasped his scroll wearing a gown and even mortarboard.
While Jordan was delighted with the honour, mum Deanna, who wept as her sonsname was announced, described watching him receive it as a bittersweet experience.
I was watching all of these high school students getting up, receiving their diplomas and sitting down and knew that I wont have that, she said.
All Jordanknew that day was that he was on stage and everybody was standing and clapping for him.It was one of the most tearful and emotional days of my life.

This video shows the moment that two men pushed their suicide bomber cousin away from a crowded mosque  only moments before all three were killed when the bomb detonated.
In the clip, which was posted on Instagram, the men are purportedly standing outside a mosque in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, with the bomber disguised as a woman.
But the two men are suddenly seen frantically pushing the man away, only seconds before an explosion is seen, resulting in the deaths of four people.

Mosquitoes. Theyre the things of nightmares and must be stopped at all costs.
But until we haveNASAs handheld midgie vaporising gun, we can only follow these tips courtesy of Dr John Bairdof theCollege of Life Sciences and Medicine at Aberdeen University.
1. Dont have smelly feet
(Picture: Getty)
Dr Baird told Metro.co.uk: Females are attracted to the various chemicals we give off and our smelly feet produce many chemicals, so having clean feet or rubbing some peppermint moisturiser in may help.
2. Dont wear shorts
(Picture: Barcroft)
Because most importantly, theyre a terrible look. But as above, it makesthose flying needles more likely to smell your sweet chemicals. Dont give them an open goal.
3. Dont wear thin clothes
(Picture: REX)
Believe it or not, some mosquitoes can actually bite you through your clothes *shudders in disgust*.
DrBaird explained: Day-biting mosquitoes like Aedes that spread Dengue are really hard to deal with and covering up is a good option, but they can and do bite through thin clothing.
4. Have amazing genes
(Picture:Getty Images)
Mosquitoes use carbon dioxide to detect us. As they fly aimlessly upwards CO2 emitted by us as we breathe out pushes them downwards  thus giving them direction.
Our metabolic rate measures how much CO2 we give off, and some have higher rates than others.
Those people are big midgie magnets and should be avoided.
5. Use a fan
This is obvious, right? Surely those spawns of Satan are no match for the mean metal choppers currently in your loft.
6. Dont drink
Its sad, but true.
Drinking alcohol has been proven to attract more of the blighters in several studies. However, experts are still trying to figure out why exactly.
7. Wear light clothes
Colour is important when mosquitoes get all up in your personal space.
They find it harder to see light clothes so clad yourself in white and become a walking shield.
8. Dont sweat
The rumours are true  theyre attracted to body heat.
It goes back to CO2, and we expel more of it when were hot.
9. At night, get into this obvious routine:
CLOSE YOUR WINDOWS.
DrBaird said Malaria mosquitoes bite at nightbut are alittle easier to ward off and the most effective way by far is to close windows and sleep under an insecticide-treated bed net.

A teenager has just completed an epic 57-mile journey while carrying his younger brother on his back.
Hunter Gandee, 15, completed the entire walk with eight-year-old Braden strapped to hisback with a harness to raise awareness for cerebral palsy.
Braden suffers from the condition and cannot walk on his own.
The pairstarted their journey from Lambertville, near their home in Michigan.
Setting out on Friday, together they reached the finish line 57 miles away this Sunday, with Hunter saying he had a sore back.

Not only was Hunter raising awarensss for the condition, but also for The Cerebral Palsy Swagger , an organisation set up by the brothers and their family.
So far they have raised enough money to create a playground in Bradens school through their fundraising efforts.
Hunter said by undertaking his walk he and his brother were able to reach more people.
Thats what our goal was, he added.
At the end of the trek Hunters football team were waiting to dunk a bucket of cold water over his head.
This isnt a one off for Hunter and Braden. Last year Hunter completed a 40-mile walk again with Braden fastened to his back.

They roll around on the floor and repeatedly swipe at each other as onlookers film and do nothing to stop the fight.
Then one of the women  whos wearing a top that reads you only live once  orders her son to punch the other in the face.
Hegrabs what appears to behairspray cans and shampoo and throws them athis mothers contender before stamping on her head.
Local police were called and succeeded in breaking up the fight, according to local news sources, although it is not clear ifanyone involved was arrested or charged.

Jodie Niven wrote a heart-rendering note about her husbands condition (Picture: Jodie Niven/Facebook)
The wife of a stroke victim has written a heartfelt note about her husbands condition in a bid to outline the tell-tale symptoms that could prevent others from suffering a similar fate.
Jodie Niven, from Sydney, Australia, was left devastated when her husband suffered a stroke almost a year ago.
But in an insightful Facebook post , which has received over 200,000 shares, Jodie explained the symptoms that her husband experienced and warns people to look out for the signals.

Jodie Niven recalls her husband's stroke
In a few weeks it will be 1 year since my 41 yr old husband, and our 4 and 6yr olds Dad had a stroke. While we generally made the choice to deal with this privately, today I have noticed a number of people sharing an article on a new sign of stroke. It is, sadly, very indicative of the lack of public knowledge about strokes that this information is being shared as a new sign. I have done a quick search and noted internet reports of this particular story as far back as 2004. Thats 11 years ago! So I feel its time to put some first hand knowledge out there
(please feel free to share)
When my hard working, frequent traveling husband arrived home from work one Friday evening:
He didnt mentioned that he was home later than expected because his pinky and ring finger on his left hand just kept hitting the wrong damn keys, and he had to keep re-typing his emails.
He didnt mention that hed stumbled for no apparent reason when walking to the bus stop from work.
He didnt mention that the reason he knocked on the door at home to get in was that he had fumbled and dropped the keys a number of times while trying to open the door.
He did mention that he felt like he was getting the flu.
He did mention that he felt like he was having a hyper sensory experience when walking down the dark nature reserve pathway on his way home from the bus stop, with feelings of a heightened sense of hearing.
He didnt have a headache.
He initially seemed, to me, to be getting the man flu, and nothing more.
He almost made the worst decision possible, in suggesting he would go to bed early and sleep, after we had gotten the kids to bed, but thankfully (!) is such a workaholic he decided to send one more email.
About 2 hrs after arriving home from work (still *not* having mentioned the weird, mis-typing fingers, stumbling on the way to the bus stop, or dropping the keys at the door), he stood up from the dining table where he was working, to go upstairs to bed. His foot turned in an ever so slightly strange way, and he did the slightest stumble, but I saw it out of the corner of my eye. Thankfully:
I did stop and ask him what was that about, are you ok? He told me his foot had just gone to sleep.
I did stop him and tell him wait a minute, that was unusual, and get him to walk across the lounge room. Everything seemed fine. But he had stumbled, when there was nothing to stumble on.
I did make him walk over and sit on the lounge. He walked normally. He looked normal. He was speaking normally.
I did get him to put both his arms straight out in front of him. He held them perfectly level, and then, ever so slightly, the left hand dropped down lower, only a few centimetres. My subconscious said stroke. My brain said couldnt be. I told him to put his arms down, then lift them and do it again. Again, he initially held his arms level, then the left hand dropped and curled ever so slightly.
I did get him to hold his arms up straight above his head. Initially both arms stayed up, then his left arm pulled slightly down, and his hand turned slightly.
I did stop him from going to bed. I made him stay put, sitting down.
I did fight every part of my no nonsense its nothing, just get on with life upbringing and attitude and I did call an ambulance. As disbelieving as I was, I realised that it might be (probably was) a stroke, and every second mattered.
By the time I had given our details to 000, and was speaking to the operator while waiting for an ambulance, my husband had gone from looking and speaking fine, to not being able to control his fine arm movements very well, or speak as clearly as he normally would. It was only as the ambulance arrived that he started to show the classic signs of a stroke. The drooping face (but nowhere near as pronounced as the stroke awareness literature at this stage), trouble speaking, and significant loss of limb movement.
You may have heard that doctors can reverse stroke damage if patients get to hospital soon enough to clear the clot within a few hours. This refers to an Ischaemic stroke, where a blood clot has blocked an artery and cut off blood flow, and can be true, but this comment discounts the extraordinary rehabilitation and effort that can still be required by patients to get back to a normal physical existence.
In this instance, my husband had an Intracerebral haemorrhage, which occurs when a blood vessel within the brain bursts, allowing blood to flow into the brain. The only thing that could be done in this instance was to do everything possible to reduce his blood pressure, wait, and hope.
Due to the very early intervention, and the extensive knowledge and understanding of neuroplasticity at St Vincents hospital Sydney (surprisingly, something which has only gained significant and broad medical acceptance within the last 5-10 years), my husband, and we his family, have been some of the lucky ones. After being in Intensive Care, and then the Stroke Ward, my husband worked hard with his amazing rehabilitation team, and he was able to build new neural pathways to compensate for damaged areas of brain. He learnt to walk again. He learnt to use his arm again. He learnt to speak clearly again. He is back at work. Many stroke patients will never live any semblance of the life they led before the stroke.
Children, teenagers, and people in their twenties and thirties can also be, and have been, changed forever by stroke. If you notice the slightest strange incident, or physical behaviour in yourself, or in others, including an unusual trip, or slight change in coordination of fingers, stop. Stop for a minute and ask them to smile, to poke their tongue out, to hold their arms out in front of them, and above their head. Ask them to repeat a sentence. Name five things and ask them to repeat them back to you. If everything seems ok DONT let them go to bed, keep an eye out for small changes. If there are signs of stroke, no matter how minor, CALL AN AMBULANCE. There is a joke in my family that you would literally have to hit me over the head and knock me unconscious to get me into an ambulance, let alone call one, and I realise now that had it been me experiencing the symptoms, I would have ignored them. I would have gone to bed. I would be dead. Be self aware, as well as caring for others. Recognise early signs and save your life or someone elses.
My husband has been very, very lucky. But he is still changed forever to those who know and love him.
**Thank you to those of you who have cared enough to take the time to share this, and increase awareness. I am stunned that this post has now been shared by over 1,650 people, reaching over 160,000 people around the world. Hopefully our story will help someone, somewhere, recognise what can be early signs of stroke, they will act FAST, and another life will be saved. *In Australia, 1 in 6 people will have a stroke. Stroke is Australias second single greatest killer after coronary heart disease and a leading cause of disability. One in five people having a first-ever stroke die within one month and one in three die within a year

Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 9 Jun 2015 10:27 am
A bit of rain and sun for the weekend  surely perfect festival weather (Picture: Met Office)
Uh-oh  thats not the picture any Isle of Wight festival goers wanted to see.
Revellers excited to bask in the glow ofacts like Pharrell Williams, Paolo Nutini and The Prodigy over this weekend should definitely pack wellies (but youve been dying to break out those Hunters anyway, havent you).
June 11 to 14 will see a mixed bag of weather.
The fest will kick off with dry and fine tent-pitching conditions on Thursday.
But rain is due to dominate Fridaybefore clearing up again for Saturday and Sunday.
Temperatures look set to remain anywhere between 16 and 21C throughout the entireweekend.

Tourists walk on the street at the resort of Magaluf, in Calvia town (Picture: AP Photo/Joan Llado)
Tough new rules cracking down on drunken behaviour came into force in Magaluf last night  but everyone ignored them.
The measures include a ban on drinking alcohol on the street between 10pm and 8am and restrictions on the Majorcan towns notorious bar crawls.
Itcomes after a teenager from Northern Ireland caused a furore last summer when she performed sex acts on 24 menin a club game.
Some bars along the Punta Ballena strip had signs up with messages such as no alcohol permitted in the street and drink with moderation.
But no-one cared. Plenty of holidaymakers spilled out of bars with drinks in their hands.
Scuffles broke out and half a dozen police cars intervened to control youths singing football chants.

This picture of a woman passed out was well circulated last year when the furore was ignited over blowjob gate (Picture: PA)
Hannah MacDonald, 19, a mental health nurse from Perth in Scotland, said: Were here for a reason, were here to get f****** mortal and just love life, were not here to worry about drinking on the street, I do enough of that in Scotland.
Fine me, do whatever you want, Im going to get mortal on the street and I dont care.
The new rules say bar crawls must be accompanied by a company rep and accredited security staff, and reps are also required to have first aid training.
All crawls now require at least seven days notice to be authorised and the number of participants is limited to 20 per crawl, with companies only permitted to run one a night.

Bar owners say the rules are a token gesture and will lead to a negative impact on the tourist industry (Picture: PA)
Those running businesses in and around the strip complained about what they described as a token gesture from Calvia town hall to clean up the resorts image.
Juan Pedro Leon, 56, an owner of the Office bar on the strip, who has been working in Magaluf for more than 30 years, said the new rules could spell the end for its tourist industry.
Mr Leon said: What is the harm in letting people on to the street with drinks if they take them out in plastic cups?
Its still early in the season, but if the police do take a heavy-handed approach that is going to put people off coming here.
That could lead to the loss of up to 1,000 jobs for the local economy.

Someones actually made a frickin laser beam that burns through stuff.
The mad scientist-type person rounded up materials anyone could easily get hold of to make the weapon.
He said he made the beam because it wasnt illegal and wrote in the description: The output of this laser is complete insanity, and is made up of eight parallel 5W laser beams totaling to 40W. The parallel beams are manipulated with lenses, sort of like how a choke modifies the spread of a shotgun blast.
The massive diode array is powered by a huge lithium polymer battery pack (capable up dumping 250A) and the laser array is regulated by a whopping 24 LM317 drivers.

Wait a second, theres a kid driving that car.
The bizarre scene was captured on camera in Phoenix, US, during rush hour.
It shows a family car pull up and stop at traffic lights with a young boy behind the wheel.
Come on dude, youre going to get someone killed, the man recording can be heard saying.
As the video comes to an end the kid moves from the drivers seat and swaps with an adult who, you know, actually has a licence.

A woman who has been desperately searching for her dog since Februarynow believes something truly harrowing has happened to him.
Morgan Bogle hired caretakerTommy Doerr to walk her 4-year-old rescue dog Sugar in New York City earlier this year, however Doerr claimed to have suffered an unexplained psychotic episode, during which the dog seemingly escaped.
Following a social media campaign under the hashtag #FindSugarNYC, Morgan became more suspicious of Doerr and has now filed a law suit against him, claiming he either traded the dog for drugs or sold it for drug money.
In the lawsuit Bogle claims Doerr was detained by the police who had allegedly searched him and found him in possession of a controlled substance, believed to be PCP.
One of the posters Morgan put up around New York (Picture: Instagram)
The papers go on to allege that Bogle was told that Doerr traded her dog for the drugs.
Bogle is now requesting that Doerr coughs up $10,000 (6,500) damagesor returns Sugar.
Despite the claims the NYPD say no arrests have been made regarding the case.

If youre going to use an analogy to support a bigoted, backward, homophobic viewpoint, then its at least worth ensuring that said analogy makes perfect sense to illustrate your point.
But that wasnt the case when a reader called Jan wrote into Melbournes Herald Sun newspaper.
The recent vote to legalise gay marriage in Ireland has sparked renewed debate about the same taking place in Australia  and Jan wasnt having any of it.
Theywrote: When I was a kid at school, we were taught about the birds and the bees. Not the birds and the birds or the bees and the bees just saying.
But theyreso wrong  because surely the inter-species breeding that hes seemingly promoting is actually the kind of diversity that hes against?
This little guy understands Jan though, and thinks that a nice big furry hug might just make him feel a little less angry.

        <MainBody>Metro News Reporter for Metro.co.uk Monday 8 Jun 2015 4:21 pm
Recently a woman saved herself from being mugged by throwing her purse over some railings after being accosted by a biker.
Maribel Hernadez heard themotorbike pull up alongside her as she was about to walk into her flat but as she turned the rider leaped offand beganrunning towards her.
Without pausing for a second she chucked her bag, jacket and keysbehind the metal fencingin Ituzaingo, Buenos Aires.
The potential mugger was thrown and instead jumpedback on the motorbike empty-handed.
Shes not the only would-be victim who hasbamboozled a bandit. Here are seven of our favourite moments when underdogs have come up trumps:
The trouser whip
A man who appears to be hasslinga young woman gets his comeuppance when his trousers are whipped down within seconds by a good Samaritan  leaving him half-starkers on a train.
Too quick for them
In March this year a bravecyclist chased muggers who had assaulted a 53-year-old man and taken his bike .
The trio legged it down a road in Leyton, East London, but were forced to ditch the goods as theheroclosed in.
The old foot in door problem
An alleged shoplifter was caught outwhen he was outsmarted by his victims whotrapped one of his legs in the door. One half of the crime-fighting duo grabbed his foot while the other leaned against the door and with a free hand called the police. Even more satisfying is the reaction by onlookers refused to help the offender make his escape despite his pleas.
The Hilary Swank
This young lady channels her inner Hilary Swank in The Next Karate Kid to battle off her would-be attacker.
Groping revenge
Meanwhile in Russia awaitress unleashed a world of hate on this customer who thought it was okay to grope her.
Forgetful thief
Afterthreatening the woman with a weapon, this robber ranoff with the ladys bag forgetting to take his scooterwith him.
Using their strengths against them
Most people would be terrified if a shotgun-wielding thugtried to mug them late at night. This brave man snatches the weapon and chases the robber down the street.

Hippos might look like comical oafs, but they are in fact extremely aggressive, and have been known to capsize small river boats and maul people to death.
Obviously these kindly hippos are of a different mindset.
Things didnt look good for this duckling who fell into the hippo pond inBlijdorp Zoo, Holland.

Before long another hippo gets in on the act, and together they are able to save the terrified bird.
Hippos are primarily herbivores, but are known for their aggressive and territorial behaviour.
They kill roughly 300 people a year in the wild, but clearlysaw no threat from this little duckling.

Ed Stubbs. Wow. Youre our kind of man.
When the B&amp;Q worker served two elderly customers faced with hauling heavy bags of compost on the bus home, he went above and beyond.
The 26-year-old earned at least 71 Good Human Points when he pushed their trolley all the way home for them.
Mr Stubbs, from Hythe in Kent, told the Daily Express: One of the men had a mobility scooter and planned to load the bags on to it. But there was no way it would all fit, and they were talking about having to get a bus. They didnt have a car and the other gentleman had a walking stick.
I was more than happy to help and they were really grateful. I often help people carry stuff out to their car but this was a first.
I got some funny looks along the way but I really didnt mind.

Catherine Gwynne was raped on her birthday (Picture: PA)
A mother has told how she was raped on her birthday by her friends polite grandson who she had invited to her party as a guest.
Catherine Gwynne  who has chosen to waive her right to anonymity to encourage other victims of sexual offences to come forward  revealed how she was attacked by Arron Murphy, 23, shortly after hosting a meal to celebrate her 39th birthday.
Ms Gwynne, who was friends with Murphys grandmother, had said goodbye to guests and was getting ready for bed when she heard someone in the kitchen.
As she came through in her dressing gown he pounced on her, dragged her into her bedroom and raped her.
Her young daughter, who is now ten, was sleeping just metres away.
I thought his nan must have left something at the party and he had come back to get it for her, Ms Gwynne, now 40, said.
I started to say hello but he launched himself on me. It was horrific.
As he dragged me from the kitchen I was petrified  I didnt recognise him.
After raping Ms Gwynne, Murphy ran off.
Arron Murphy has been jailed for seven years (Picture: PA)
Mrs Gwynne called her boyfriend Shaun Phillips, 39, and he contacted police.
Murphy was arrested the same evening on suspicion of rape but was released on bail.
He was free to walk just metres from Ms Gwynnes home and went to the same pub as Mr Phillips.

He was tried at Cardiff Crown Court in September 2014 but the jury could not reach a verdict on a count of rape so it was sent for retrial.
When I heard this I was absolutely disgusted, she continued. But it just made me more determined to achieve justice.
Murphys grandmother lived in the same street as Ms Gwynne, and they had been close friends for three years when she told Ms Gwynne that her grandson was coming to stay with her.
Ms Gwynne remembered: She was quite a bit older than me, but we hit it off. I saw her as a mother figure and my daughter McKenzie used to call her Nana.

Wed go on holiday together, confide in one another.
It was over a cuppa one day she told me that her grandson Arron had been having a tough time at home and was going to live with her for a while.
She told me he was a bit of a wild child, so when I met him I was pleasantly surprised.
He was polite, and I spent a lot of time with him and his grandma. Thats why I invited them both to my 39th birthday party.
But now Murphy has been jailed for seven years and ordered to sign the sex offenders register for the rest of his life.
Ms Gwynne says she can hold her head up high for reporting the crime and following through to see justice months later.

THE HIIIIIILS ARE ALIIIIIVE WITH THE SOUND OF POLITICS.
Thats the general vibe that were getting from this photo of the world leaders in attendance at the G7 summit  which looks like something from a Von Trapp family portrait, and not a conference aiming to tackle some of humanitys biggest issues.

But we cant help feeling that the line-up was too selective, featuring the likes of David Cameron, Barack Obama, Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel.
It meant that we didnt get to see President Putin prove why hes the hunkiest despotin the world.

And Kim-Jong Un wasnt given the opportunity to up the sartorial stakes with his new hipster trilby.

It also meant that a pretty hands-on approach to defence policy wasnt discussed.

And then it came to the actual workings of the would-be singing sensations, and it seemed that one man was intent on taking lead vocals

Is the MERS virus likely to reach the UK? How worried we should be as sixth persondies
Ollie McAteer for Metro.co.uk Monday 8 Jun 2015 12:58 pm
Parts of South Korea have been in lock down since the outbreak (Picture:Getty Images)
A sixth person has died after contracting the MERS virus in South Korea.
A total of 87 people have been infected by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  also known as camel disease  in the last month.
The outbreak has closed around 1,870 schools and forced more than 2,000 people into isolation.
An 80-year-old man, who tested positive for the virus last week while being treated for pneumonia, died Monday and became the countrys sixth death linked to MERS, according to a statement from the Health Ministry.
Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan told a news conference Sunday that there was no reason to believe that the virus would significantly spread further in the country.
The virus has no vaccine, and health experts say it spreads through close contact with infected people.

MERS emerged in 2012 and can be extremely serious
It causessevere breathing difficulties, kidney failure and death
But it is possible to be a carrier of the virus and have no symptoms
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that 837 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection have been reported since 2012
It has a 30 per cent fatality rate and has been linked to291 deaths

A question mark hangs over how easily the virus is spread when airborne.
In 2013 health experts detectedgenetic fragments from the MERS virus in an air sample from a camel barn in Saudi Arabia.
Concerngrows that the virus may have mutated. But its fear of the unknown which is causing unrest among health experts.
Hakim Djaballah, chief executive of Institute Pasteur Korea, toldThe Korea Times: There is no treatment for Mers.
Since it is relatively a new virus, little drug discovery research has been done on it.

The total number of laboratory confirmed cases detected in theUK remains at four, according to Gov.uk .
The last known cases was in 2013.
A little over a year ago two men brought the virus to the US from Saudi Arabia but neither passed it on.
Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health, told National Geographic he expects the virus to reappear in America again.
He explained the best approach to tackle the virus is by not imposing travel restrictions  this will only drive people to hide that they have MERS.

She later tweeted about the incident.

The journalist told the Mail Online that she didnt want to blow the attack out of proportion and was only left with a red mark that quickly healed.
A Queensland Police spokesman said the alleged attacker was charged with public nuisance and will appear in court on July 23.
Its not the first time Alex has been attacked by those shes attempted to interview. Take a look at this

Septembers a rubbish month  its the end of summer, for starters.
Andthis year mankind could be totally obliterated by a giant asteroid.Itll probably rain too.
Conspiracy theorists are predicting the end of time via terrifying blogs between September 22 and 28.
The intense biblical types believe the event will spark a rapture with Hell on Earth.
The most widely circulated theories are from those who believe were being set up by the man and the end of the world is all the Governments doing.
But thankfully, science bods have reassured us that the event is highly unlikely.
Yeah, just like this (Picture: Getty)
A spokesperson for NASA said: NASA knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth, so the probability of a major collision is quite small.
In fact, as best as we can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years.
Its worth noting that the majority of large objects that come crashing down to Earths atmosphere usually burn up on entry.

Italian authorities investigating Libya-based smuggling operations say reliable intelligence is hard to come by, given Western diplomats have long left Libya, wracked by violence following the 2011 demise of Moammar Gadhafis regime.
At the G-7 summit in Germany Sunday, British Prime Minister David Cameron said his nation would not walk on by when people were in danger. He said the summit will see discussion about how we try and put a Libyan government together as a way to combat the trafficking.
European Union leaders have been grappling for a strategy to combat the traffickers in Libya. Germany, with two ships in the search-and-rescue mission Saturday, said four smuggler boats were destroyed after a total of 1,411 migrants were taken to safety.
Rome-based investigators, meanwhile, are alleging systematic kickbacks for public contracts to feed and shelter migrants.
Last week, 44 people, including local politicians from the centre-left to the centre-right in the Rome area, were arrested for alleged corruption.
he probe examined contracts for social services, including for asylum-seekers at a migrant centre in Sicily. In intercepted phone calls, one suspect is heard referring to migrant shelters as a cow to milk for money.

We are now getting ever closer to the reality of a being able to perform a head transplant.
A Chinese doctor, who has already clocked up 1,000 head transplants on mice, is now looking to perform this controversialoperation on monkeys.
Xiaoping Ren has been perfecting the complicated procedure on mice since 2013 according to the Wall Street Journal .
The doctors researching this field have been labelled by critics asDr Frankensteins withProfessor Arthur Caplan, the Medical Ethics Professor at the New York University, saying simply: The whole idea is ridiculous.
You may think there is no-one willing to be the first human guinea pig  however a Russian computer scientist suffering from a genetic wasting disorder has thrown his cap into the ring.

Valery Spiridonov, 30, has said he wants his head transplanted by neurosurgeonDr Sergio Canavero onto a healthy body as early as next year.
The MailOnline reported MrSpiridonovsaying: Am I afraid? Yes, of course I am. But it is not just very scary, but also very interesting.
But you have to understand that I dont really have many choices.
If I dont try this chance my fate will be very sad. With every year my state is getting worse.

Tenwestern tourists who stripped naked on a sacred Malaysian mountain have been blamed for an earthquake that killed at least 13 people  as a result they have been prohibited from leaving Malaysia.
Mount Kinabalu in Borneois held as sacred by the localSabahan people and the Malaysian Tourist Minister has said the tourists are being detained in the country for disrespecting the mountain, according to the Digital Journal .
Deputy Chief Minister of the Sabah region, Tan Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan said: Whether other people believe this or not, its what we Sabahans believe.
When the earthquake happened, its like a confirmation of our beliefs.
There is almost certainly a connection. We have to take this as a reminder that local beliefs and customs are not to be disrespected.

Supersonic travel was seemingly relegated to science fiction after the last Concorde Flight in 2003, but now Nasa are hoping to bring it back to an everyday reality.
However the days of Nasa simply wanting to go faster and faster are over, as they are now spending a reported $6million (3.9million) fundinggreener and cheaper supersonic travel.
MIT received one of the grants from the space agency famous for putting the first human being on the moon.
The Massachusetts-based university will be conducting research into the environmental effects of commercial supersonic travel, and studying how sonic booms (the pressure waves created when an object breaks the sound barrier) affect turbulence on passenger flights.
Obviously many fighter jets currently have the ability to fly faster than the speed of sound, however this is not considered to have an especially large impact on the environment as there are far fewer fighter jets than commercial airliners.

Two escaping convicts left a note for baffled prisonofficers on a section of steel pipe they had crawled through to reachfreedom.
The note read simply: Have a Nice Day.
Police are now hunting the two convicted murderers who used power tools to breakout of the prison.
The two prisoners used the tools to cut their way out of their cells before running and crawling along steel tunnels until they reached a manhole outside the prison walls.
200 police officers are involved in the manhunt ofDavid Sweat and Richard Mattwho had been servingtheir prison termsin neighbouring cells atClinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has described themas extremely dangerous stating: Its very important that we locate these individuals.

The acting state corrections commissioner, Anthony Annuci, said: A search revealed that there was a hole cut out of the back of the cell through which these inmates escaped.
They went onto a catwalk which is about six stories high.
We estimate they climbed down and had power tools and were able to get out to this facility through tunnels, cutting away at several spots.
To add to the cinematic nature of their escape, Governor Cuomo stated thatthe men had even arranged their beds so it looked like people were sleeping  with these sweatshirt hoodies on

Sweat, 34, had been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for murdering a police officer in 2002.
Matt, 48, was serving 25 years to life for three counts of murder including kidnapping, torturing and dismembering a man in 1997.

Toronto will host its first ever accessible orgy for the disabled in what has been called the coming down of the Berlin Wall of sex for people with disabilities.
Stella Palikarova, who uses a wheelchair because she has spinal muscular dystrophy, says she is one of thousands of people tired of being assumed to have something wrong with their libido because of their disability.
So the 35-year-old, who works as a disability awareness consultant, has comeup with an idea. An ideawhich, she believes,will bring down the Berlin Wall of sex for people with disabilities.
An orgy.
Ms. Palikarova has teamed up with theBuddies in Bad Times Theatre, a venue whichhas space for125  including around20 wheelchairs, plus walkers and canes  for the event, which is called Deliciously Disabled. Tickets will be $20 for everyone except personal support workers, who get in free.

There will be hydraulic lifts,an interpreter for the deaf, and people who are not disabled are also welcome, the Toronto Sun reports.
Ifyoure shy, the orgys theme is masquerade ball, so you can throw on your mask and no-one will know who you are.The date of the event is 14 August.
Awheelchair can become just a big sex toy, Andrew Morrison-Gurza, a co-organiser who has cerebral palsy, told the Toronto Sun .
Ms. Palikarova added: The naysayers are just subconsciously hating the fact that people in wheelchairs are having great sex -better sex than a lot of people are having.
By making this party accessible, we are saying openly that people with disabilities are sexual beings  and not only in more conventional ways.

Every year in China, millions of students sit an exam so stressful that it has been linked to sudden illness and even suicide.
So the terrified young people preparing to take the gaokao  dubbed the most pressure-packed examination in the world  will be pleased to know that they will now have anti-cheating drones hovering abovethem as they work.
The two-day exam is said to be so important to a young Chinese persons future prospects that in practical terms it determines the course of their entire lives.
Because of its importance, cheating has become common. And when we say cheating, we dont mean scribbling some notes on theinside of your shirt cuff.
The gaokao has been linked to suicides (Picture: Getty Image)
Some of the cheating equipment these students have used in recent yearslooks straight out of Q Branch. One such item involved using a pen to take a photo of the test which was then sent to a remote location, answered, and then read back to the student via an in-ear receiver.
To tackle this high-tech trickery, Wired reports that the Luoyang Radio Authority has deployed anti-cheating drones which can identify radio signals and their source. The drone will hover roughly 500m above the test site and has an interception range of around 1km.
The drone can also be controlled by exam staff using tablets. They can fly the drone lower and closer to suspicious students for greater accuracy.
We advise those people with ulterior motives as early as possible to give up trying to cheat in examinations via radio means, said Zeng Ying Yong, secretary of the LRA.

This is Holley Kitchena mother-of-two from Cedar Park, Texas.
When Holley was 39, she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. She underwent a double mastectomy, chemo and radiation therapy.
Aftera year of treatment, she believed she was cancer free. She believed the battle was over.
Itwasnt.
Holley was diagnosed withmetastatic stage 4 breast cancer, meaning cancer cells from her breast tissue had entered her blood stream and started growing on her spine and bones.
There is no cure.
Holleystreatment will never end. The disease is terminal and she is likely to only live for another 26 months.
Around 40,000 people die from metastatic breast cancer every year.
But what would you say to someone you knew, if they told you they had been diagnosed with terminal cancer?
This?
Even this?
No.
Sometimes its ok to say nothing at all or even thatyou are praying for them (and then actually do it).
Holleys mission now is to educate people about what to say to people with metastatic breast cancer, which is why she created this video on YouTube.
She says: I think it resonates with people because its honest. Its what people dont want to say what people dont want to hear.I was hoping to reach a thousand people just for a little bit of education which is now my mission.
We pray for you and your family Holley. We really do.

You would not want to wake up to this on your pillow.
TheGiant Weta is a flightless member of the cricket family that originates from New Zealand and is the heaviest insect in the world.
Not counting antennae and limbs, the Giant Weta can grow up to 10cm and weigh in at 35g.
How did this massive bug come into existence and why can it not fly?
Well, asNew Zealand hasno indigenous territorial mammals and isa remote island, there was no need for the Weta orbirds such as the Kiwi birdto fly away from ground-based predators.
The size of the Giant Weta is a result of the greater amount of oxygen available 300  400 million years ago as opposed to now as, Wired reports.
Insects breath through holes in their exoskeleton which limits their growth but with prehistoric oxygen levels the Weta was able to evolve to its current gigantic size.

Isis is likely to have the technical expertise and materials required for chemical weapons, Bishop said (Picture: PA)
Terror group Isis is likely to have the materials and technical expertiserequired to buildchemical weapons, Australias foreign minister has claimed.
Speaking in Perth, Australia, Julie Bishop voiced concerns about the Islamic States recruitment of well-trained engineers and chemists, saying it could indicate more serious efforts in their development of weapons.
And Ms. Bishop went onto say that it was likely that Isis now had both the materials and the technical expertise required to build chemical weapons should they wish to do so.
The use of chlorine by Daesh [an Arabic term for ISIS], and its recruitment of highly technically trained professionals, including from the west, have revealed far more serious efforts in chemical weapons development, Ms. Bishop said.

Daesh is likely to have amongst its tens of thousands of recruits the technical expertise necessary to further refine precursor materials and build chemical weapons.
The claims came after Kurdish officials came under attack from an Isis suicide bomber driving a lorryfilled with chlorine gas, which is a banned chemical under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.
Though Kurdish peshmerga destroyed the lorry with a rocket before the militant coulddetonate it, a number of fighters complained of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and weakness as a result of the chlorine, RT reports.
A fact-finding mission in Syria by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons last year found that chlorine was being usedsystematically and repeatedly.

Scientists have managed to grow a limb in a laboratory for the first time ever, which could openthe door to whole-limb human transplants.
While it was only a rats forearm that scientists managed to grow, the breakthrough from Massachusetts General Hospital could lead to human limbsbeing developed in the future.
The experts at Harald Otts lab used the decellularization/recellularization technique to produce the body part according to New Scientist .
It involved getting rid of the cells of a dead rodents arm and then regrowing them.
After rats, scientists hope to move on to primates (Picture: Getty Images)
The new limbwas only able to flex if stimulated electrically.
The next stepwill be to get a rat to move the new body part by itself, andhopefully a primate will be next successful subject.
This is science fiction coming to life, lung regeneration expert Daniel Weiss told the Standard Daily .
Its a very exciting development, but the challenge will be to create a functioning limb.

DO you want the urge back? (Picture: Getty Images)
There is a drug on the way designed to help women recover the magic.
FDA approval has been finally given to a pill designed that increase the psychological desire for sex in women.
Nicknamed female Viagra, Flibanserindoes not simply send blood to the genitals like actual Viagra- it is taken daily and targets two neuro-transmitters in the brain associated with sexual desire.
Bat Sheva Marcus, a sexual dysfunction specialist, told Business Insider : I see this all the time where a woman, she enjoys sex and gets aroused and orgasms, but she absolutely just doesnt want it anymore  shes just not interested.
Its something thats going on in the brain.
Its trying to change the parts of the brain that dont light up, the ones that arent responding.
The running issue with Flibanserinhas been its side effectswhich include fainting and drowsiness especially when taken with alcohol.
In addition, the effectiveness of the drug has been questioned with trial participants taking the drughad on average only one more satisfied sexual episode than those taking a placebo.

We have all sent drunken texts  incomprehensible at best and toe-curlingly embarrassing at worst.
So, the obvious question is what the greatest writers of the last few centuries would text after a few too many pinot grigios at the local All Bar One.
From William Wordsworth to Roald Dahl toSamuel Beckett  writer Jessie Gaynor has created these wholly believable drunken texts for the Paris Review .
So enjoy these comic parodies starting with the 18th author of the hymn Jerusalem and the poem Daffodils.

The craze, which was compared to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, took off under the hashtag #HoldaCokeWithYourBoobsChallenge and quickly went viral.

But thats exactly what happened today in New Yorks Times Square.
And thoughwe are well awarethat cats and mice are natural enemies,we didnt know that this was also the case for humans dressed as cats and mice.
In any case,the costumed characters came to blows.
BothSandra Mocha, 34, of Queens, and Giovanna Melendez, 40, of New Jersey were restrained, detained and then charged with assault.
This is another reason why we need regulations to address the growing problems in Times Square, Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, told the New York Daily News .

The thieves were brutally tortured for nine hours (Picture: CEN)
Dog thieves in a Chinese village were beatenfor nine hours by an angry mob and then had thecarcasses of the dead animals tied around their necks.
When police arrived to rescue the thieves, the village vigilantes turned their anger on the authorities too, assaulting them with metal bars and smashing their patrol car.
The attack took place at roughly 7am on Tuesday in Shaping village, Hunan province, after two thieves were caught with dead dogsthat they are believed to have killed for meat.
But an angry mob soon took justice into their own hands, givingthe thievesan unrelenting nine-hour beatingand then tying the dogs bodies around their necks, with their bottoms pointed towards their noses.
(Picture: CEN)
When police arrived to take the suspects to a nearby station, villagers stopped them and demanded a sum of 1 million Yuan (106,000) compensation to secure the pairs release.
They then decided to attack the police, and werent persuaded to stop the attack when they were warned that mob justice was against the law.
The mob eventually calmed down when authorities from the local Public Security Bureau arrived on the scene, with the two suspects being taken into police custody.
However, the mob could also face criminal proceedings  with several of the villagers reportedly guilty of illegal imprisonment, assault and obstructing police work.

This is probably the dirtiest street justice weve ever seen.
It involved an alleged flasher getting tipped over in a portable toilet, which led to him being covered in waste.
The incident, which was filthy in all regards, happened yesterday morning in Portland, Oregon, according to SergeantPete Simpson.
Apasserbytook a snap of the aftermath thatshowed theHoney Bucket toilet on its side, with the flasherapparently in it.
An anonymous homeless person approached the police and said that the man had been inside the porta-potty with his pants around his ankles, holding the door open as he pleasured himself, he told wusa9.com .
The person told the police that other homeless people were tired of his behaviour, so they knocked over the porta-potty and ran away.
The unnamed man wasnt injured but his pride must have taken a hit.
The culprits who shoved the toilet over have not been found and the alleged flasher was not arrested.

She claims the disturbingfootage isnt a recreation of the alleged rape.
Emma Sulkowicz, the artist and activist who carried around her mattress in protest against Columbia University after they refused to expel a male student she claimed raped her, has released another piece of performance art.
The website Ceci Nest Pas Un Viol  hosts Emmas latest video offering.
The eight-minute clip shows her engaging in what looks to be consensual sex which turns violent with a man whose face is blurred out.
The man slaps and strangles her, removes the condom before resuming extremely rough sex with Sulkowicz, who is protesting and whimpering in pain.
Disturbing(Picture: Emma Sulkowicz)
Sulkowicz alleged that fellow Columbia University student Paul Nungesser raped her in August 2012, leading to the conception of Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight), which became her senior thesis.
On the Ceci Nest Pas Un Viol host website, she explains the footage isnt a recreation of the supposed incident.
The accompanying text reads: Do you think Im the perfect victim or the worlds worst victim? Do you refuse to see me as either a human being or a victim? If so, why? Is it to deny me agency and thus further victimise me?
Sulkowicz adds: If you watch this video without my consent, then I hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and participating in my rape, for in that case, were you the one who couldnt resist the urge to make Ceci Nest Pas Un Viol about what you wanted to make it about: rape.

Smith beat an apology out of the man (Picture: Getty Images)
A female UFC fighter taught aman a lesson in manners after hegroped one of her friends.
Bantamweight Leslie Smith and strawweight Heather Clark were standing outside a San Francisco club with a group of friends when a man grabbed the behind of one of the women.
Smith instantly confronted the man, who has not been identified, saying Hey, you cant do that.
But as if the mans initial actwasnt bad enough, he then spat in Smiths face.
F*** you. I can do whatever he want, he told her.

Smith replied: No motherf***er, you cant.
Then the man swung. Bad idea.
Smith slipped the punch, drove the man back into a wall andtook him to the floor. Then she started raining down elbows on him.
He turned over and I just dropped elbows on him from mount against the building until he started saying, Im sorry, Smith told Bloody Elbow .
Then I stopped as soon as he said sorry, because that was really the only thing I went over there for.
Smith made headlines last year when she nearly lost an ear in a fight (Picture: Getty Images)
Smith said she that she initially wanted to the keep the incident quiet, but has changed her mind.
It has given my friend and all of my female friends so much pleasure to know that happened, she said.
Its not an unusual thing for a woman, a good-looking woman in public to get grabbed and fondled by strangers.
At first, I was trying to keep the whole thing on the down low and not say anything about it, but after seeing how happy it has made so many women, I changed my mind.
We suspect the man in question may keep his hands to himself in future.

This video shows the scary reality of just how easy it is to have drugs slipped into your drink while youre out with friends.
In the video, YouTuber Joey Salads proves that you should be extremely vigilant, as he manages to subtly slip rohypnol into a drink, while the person guzzling the beverage is blissfully unaware.
(Picture: YouTube/Joey Salads)
As he first succeeds in slipping the pill, its the fault of unobservant friends  who arent paying full attention after they promise to watch a pals drink while she goes to the loo.
But then it gets a little scarier as he drops a pill into a girls drink while talking to her, seemingly proving that looking away for a split second is all it takes for the crime to occur.
Terrifying  but hugely insightful.

Ireland is fast becoming one of the most progressive countries in Europe after it was announced that trans people will be allowed to self report their gender.
Currently transgender people in Ireland have to go through medical and even psychological testing to have their preferred gender recognised.
These new measures, which will come intoforce next month, come shortly after the country voted to allow same sex marriage.
Irish media have reported howthe move will make it easier for transgender people to get married and update official documents such as passports and driving licenses.
The new rules will not be extended to anyone below the age of 18 however.
MORE:Womens genes could be influencing when they start having children
Next month Ireland and Denmark will be the only two European countries which legally allow people to change their gender without medical support.
Irelands deputy prime minister Joan Burton said: A person who transitions gender will have their preferred gender fully recognised by the State for all purposes  including the right to marry or enter a civil partnership in the preferred gender and the right to a new birth certificate.
The move has been supported bySinn Fin,withMEP Lynn Boylan calling apersons gender identity a matter for each individual.
Transgender people know their own identity. They dont need medical evaluation to prove their identity to anyone, she added.

Jes and her father on her wedding day (Picture: PA Real Life)
She refuses to let the attack dictate her future.
A gun-wielding gang took it in turns to rape Jes Foord, 28, seven years ago.
The men approached while Jes was walking her dog near her home in Waterfall, South Africa.
When I saw the men I assumed they would rob us, Mrs Foord, who has since married, said.
But they tied my father to a tree and held a knife to his throat while the others took it in turns to rape me. They were urging each other on and jeering.
One ripped off my shorts while the other held a blade to my neck.One by one. I thought it would never stop.
Following the traumatic attack, Mrs Foordtookmedication similar to that of cancer sufferers to prevent the risk of contracting HIV.
The drugs made her hair fall out and she was sick for weeks, she recalled: I had to take the morning after pill, plus TB and STD medication.
Determined to seek justice, Mrs Foordgaveevidence against the men  who mocked her in court.
The rapists didnt laugh for long, as they were sentenced to a combined 107 years jail time.

Mrs Foord told how her father walked her down the aisle at her wedding to Jonathan, 28, in 2011and sheand her husband had twins, Layla and Daniel, in 2014.
Conviction rates are notoriously low in South Africa, so to encourage other rape victims to come forward, Mrs Foord waived her right to anonymity.
When it happened, I decided I wasnt going to let it control me. They took something from me, but the rest of my life is mine.
At first, I wasnt sure I made the right decision. But I started getting letters from well-wishers and I knew it was important.

Womens genes could be determining when they start having children.
Research by Oxford University found a 15 per cent variance between the ages women have their first baby, and they think its all down to genetics.
The average first-time mother is now aged between 28 and 29  four years later than the average in 1970.
However this is due to societal factors such as more women deciding to delay starting a family to focus on their career.
The researchers looked at women in the UK and the Netherlands, and found that women who had children at a younger age shared one particular gene.

Interestingly they also found that women who gave birth at a younger age tended to go on to have larger families.
While this may seem like yet another blow to women who are wish to have babies at a later stage in their lives, the researchers claim this is actually beneficial as it potentially means one day women will be able to analyse their genes to find out when their optimal time for having children is.
Natural selection is not just a historical process. Modern societies are still evolving today, with early fertility patterns being an inherited reproductive advantage, the researchers said in a press release.

By the end of the babys ordeal it is no longer moving or screaming, leading many to believe it has suffered brain damage or even died.
An NSPCC spokesman said: We obviously have deep concerns for the baby and would hope that Facebook does all in its power to help trace whoever was responsible for this appalling incident.
Its difficult to understand why such a dreadful film should have been posted and why Facebook allowed it to be viewed.
Our main concern is for the welfare of the baby but there has to be more control over the kind of material that is posted on social media sites and we will be talking to Facebook as a matter of urgency.
However Facebook have refused to remove it, claiming the women featured in the videoare actually practising baby yoga with the child.
A Facebook spokesperson said: We do not allow child abuse on Facebook and any illegal content which is flagged to us is quickly removed.
Whilst we understand that people may be upset by this video which depicts a form of baby yoga, after careful review we found it does not break our rules.
Update: Facebook have released the following statement concerning the sharing of the video on the site.
Like others, we find the behaviour in this video upsetting and disturbing. In cases like these, we face a difficult choice: balancing peoples desire to raise awareness of behaviour like this against the disturbing nature of the video. In this case, we are removing any reported instances of the video from Facebook that are shared supporting or encouraging this behaviour. In cases where people are raising awareness or condemning the practice, we are marking reported videos as disturbing, which means they have a warning screen and are accessible only to people over the age of 18.

He added: To top it off, the cruise lines system is that when the other passengers dial 911 they get the front desk, not security, and the front desk responds to the scene some 45 minutes to an hour later and does not even have access to the cabin?
If this is not the definition of outrageous, I dont know what is.

London has the highest concentration of cocaine in sewage in Europe, research shows.
Experts said the UK capital was slightly ahead of Amsterdam for the amount of the drug in waste water.
The EUs drug agency said the average daily concentration of cocaine in London sewage was 737mg per 1,000 people in 2014.
This was the highest level found in the analysis of more than 50 cities.
However, the capital fell below Amsterdam in the list when taking into account weekend samples only.

The survey showed London had the fourth highest daily concentration of ecstasy.
However, no traces were recorded in the city for the other three drugs tested  cannabis, methamphetamine and amphetamine.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction said waste water analysis is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring real-time population-level trends in illicit drug use.

Among those on board was Vanisha Singh, 29, who was in the second row of the carriage with her mother Chanda, 49, and her sister Meera, 26.
She told the Sun there had been technical difficulties moments before they embarked on the ride, as several test cars were sent ahead of them.
We finally went up and were kept at the top for ten or 15 minutes chatting, joking that we were the guinea pigs, she said.
The metal safety bar smashed into our legs. There was loads of screaming. I felt a burning sensation in my pelvis, and back and neck pain.
It was terrifying. There was blood all over the floor because it was pouring out of their legs in the carriage and dropping down. The doctors and firemen were covered in blood as they scaled the scaffolding to treat the guys on the front row.

Alton Towers remains closed for the third day, racking up losses potentially worth millions of pounds as health and safety inspectors comb the site in Staffordshire for clues to what caused the rollercoaster crash.
The theme park is believed to be losing500,000 a day.
It will remain closed on Friday as well.
Neil Craig, head of operations for HSE in the Midlands, said that a specialist team of inspectors were at the scene making inquiries.
He added: Our role is to establish the facts. We will want to determine that those responsible for operating this ride have done what the law requires. We will also ensure that if there are any lessons to be learned, they are shared as soon as possible.
Although the investigation is in its early stages, we will take action to protect the public if we uncover evidence that could affect the safety of other rides at the park or elsewhere.

An driver assaulting a young boy by squirting petrol into his mouth has been caught on camera.
Seven-year-old Jamal was sitting by one of the pumps at a petrol station in Cologne when a 29-year-old driver pulled up.
A flustered Jamal didnt have time to get out of the way so he just moved his legs instead, allowing the man to drive right up to the pump.
For no apparent reason the driver then gets out and grabs Jamals face before squirting petrol into his mouth.
Jamal quickly runs away from the man, who went on to fill up his car before paying and leaving  allegedly laughing at Jamal as he did so.

Mr Kulkamp Dias said: I played six songs at determined moments.
My right hand was a bit weaker because that was the side that they were operating on. So I stopped and rested.
I was interspersing songs and talking with them.

This was no publicity stunt for the Nossa Senhora de Conceio Hospital in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina.
Having the bank worker play his guitar and talk to surgical staff meant that the doctors wouldbe able to check that his ability for cognitive function wasnot damaged.
Daily Mail reported that the hospitals spokesperson said: While it surprised everyone, the surgery was performed.

Doctors use basil to lure out a worm thats been living in a boys eye for amonth
Nicole Morley for Metro.co.uk Thursday 4 Jun 2015 2:26 pm
The worm just couldnt resist the tastyherb.
If youre eating, then take this gentle warning to put the snacks down.
Medics have used basil to tempt out a worm that was living in a boys eye for four weeks.
Doctors at the National Childrens Hospital in Lima, Peru, treated Jamie, a 17-year-old boy who had a swollen and sore left eye.
They quickly discovered that a three centimetre worm had set up home in his eye socket.
It got there after he was bitten by a mosquito while sleeping, so were wearing an eyemaskevery night until the end of time.

Just when you thought things couldnt get any worse for Jamie, Ophthalmologist Caroline Marchena claims the creature was positioned near a particularly sensitive part of the face from where infections can easily spread to the brain.
She said: The location of the worm from the lower lid, which was getting bigger, made the risks increase because the youths tissue was swelling in an area close to the sinuses thats close to the delicate part which is the triangle of death [danger triangle of the face].
As soon as the peckish worm poked his head out in search of the basil, doctors used tweezers to remove it completely, which is lucky because nobody wants anything all up in their triangle of death, right?
Jamieis expected to make a full recovery, we cant say the same for the worm.
The worm measured over an inch long (Picture: CEN)

A woman was filmed risking her toddlers life by throwing him off a balcony into the arms of his father, simply to save her a journey down the stairs.
Concerned neighbourAkbota Rynzhanova capturedthe unbelievable moment, and claimed there was no emergency or any good reason to put the childs life at risk.
The little boy, who is only 18-months-old, is dangled over the balcony by his arms before finally being releasedto be caught byhis fatherstanding below.
Akbota, who shot the footage near his home inAstana City, the capital of Kazakhstan, said: How dumb can you be, to think of throwing the baby from the balcony? Im shocked.
The video was put on Facebook where the actions of the parents were widely condemned, being called irresponsible.
However other commenterspointed out that the baby was laughing in the video, and didnt seem to be in any distress.

Syncronized videos test whether Coriolis Effect is real (Picture: YouTube/Veritasium)
A set of videos that test ifwater drains in a different way depending on what hemisphere youre in are probably more interesting than the actual answer.
If youve ever wanted to know whether water flushes in a different direction on the other side of the world today is your lucky day.
Dr Derek Muller from Veritasium and Destin Sandlin from Smarter Every Day havecome up with the answer.
MORE: Digital drug brain cap makes you feel like you are high
But whats probably more impressive is the two friends have done it in the most ingenious way possible by syncronising two YouTube videos.
Its a bit fidgety at first but once you line them lined up its almost flawless, with the two men taking you on a journey from the United States to Australia.

Dr Muller and Mr Sandlin eventually reach the conclusion the Coriolis Effect is real but doesnt necessarily show up in your toilet or sink because of other variables that influence the spin.
They demonstrate this by using two paddling pools and placing dye in them, which shows Earths rotation does actually determine the northern and southern hemisphere water flow direction.
Thats great and all, but the most exciting thing for us was watching the two men seemingly jump into each others videos as a result of faultless synchronisation.

Migrant workers are allegedly forced to live and work in poor conditions (Picture: PA)
Qatar has flat out denied that any workers have died working on construction projects for the World Cup.
Many reports coming out of the country, which is due to host the 2022 Fifa World Cup, claim that more than 1,000 migrant construction workers have died in the building projects for the football tornament.
London Loves Business published a report from the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)claiming the number was as high as 1,200 deaths, far more than the eightworkers who died in the run up to the 2014Fifa World Cup in Brazil.
Since publishing their report officials from Qatar have hit back, claiming that not one worker has died in their construction projects.
These figures have absolutely no basis in fact. After almost 5 million man-hours of work, there have been no fatal industrial accidents on World Cup projects, they said in an email to London Loves Business.

They go on to blame any deaths in the million migrant workers currently living and working in the country on cardiovascular disease, which they claim the workers would have succumbed to even if they remained in their home countries.
Just to ram the point home, they finish the email with: To be clear: there have been no fatalities on World Cup projects in Qatar.
The2022 World Cup has been surrounded by scandal, with fans claiming that a desert climate in an alcohol free country is not suitable for an international sports competition.

It cant predict HOW you will die, however(Picture: Getty)
Forget those horoscopes, the internet is the only soothsayer you need now.
A new online tool has been launched which claims to be able to determine the likelihood of you dying over the next five years.
The UbbLE risk calculator will ask you a series of questions and use the information to estimateboth your Ubble age and your risk of death in the following half-decade.
You have to be between the ages of 40 and 70 for the test to work accurately  because as we all know, young people are invincible.
The questions start off by inquiring abouthow many people you live with, if you have suffered a death in the family recently and how much you walk/drive.

Then things get a little bit more direct.
One question asks ifa doctor has ever told you that you have diabetes?, while another is: Has a doctor ever told you that you havecancer?.
Were not physicians, but even we can see how this might affect your health over the coming five years.
As a test we created a fictional 47-year-old man with a wife a two kids  he also owns one car and has recently suffered a death in the family, but doesnt smoke and keeps in good health.
UbbLE predicted this gentleman had a 0.6 per cent chance of dying in the next five years, and that his Ubble age was actually 33-years-old.
Bad news for that red guy (Picture: Ubble.co.uk)
It also informed us that out of 100 men of the same age who gave similar answers only one of them would die in the next five years, statistically.
The website makes it predictions based onscientific research carried out by Andrea GannafromKarolinska Institutet Erik IngelssonfromUppsala University, as well as using data from the UK Biobank.
Dr Ingelsson said: In general, if your Ubble age is higher than your actual age, it could raise concerns and provide some incentive for lifestyle change.

Cannabistro is offering a 40 four-course mealdelicately designed to recreate the careful ritual of getting high.
Weed will be replaced by mackerel flakes and guests invited to roll up their own edible joint. Yummy.

A primary school dinner lady has been fired for giving free lunches to kids without money.
Mother of two Della Curry lost her job atDakota Valley Elementary School in Aurora, Denver, but said shed do it all again in a heartbeat.
She told CBS Denver: I had a first grader in front of me, crying, because she doesnt have enough money for lunch. Yes, I gave her lunch.
Any pupil who forgets their lunch and fails to qualify for a subsidised one gets a burger bun with a piece of cheese on it  Mrs Curry said thats not enough and the rules need to change.
Cherry Creek School District said in a statement: The law does not require the school district to provide the meal to children who have forgotten their lunch money, that is a district decision.
Mrs Curry said she would do it all again (Picture: CBS Denver)
According to our practice, we provide hot meals to students the first three times they forget their lunch money and charge their parents accounts. The fourth time, we provide a cheese sandwich and milk.
The district has worked to keep lunch prices low and still meet the federal nutrition requirements.
The costs of our lunch programme are not covered by the prices we charge.
At the end of the year, any unpaid accounts revert back to the general fund which also covers instruction, security, building maintenance and overall operations.

So, this snake just emerged from a spice rack and started eating an egg in true double-U tee eff fashion.
The reptile randomly appeared in the North Carolina, US, home on Sunday  scaring the bejesus out of this family.
Heres what happened
Laura Neff's 'excitement on Sunday' full story
It was a run of the mill Sunday afternoon here on our little farmette, until a noise in the kitchen made us look upat the spice cabinetwhere THIS was descending toward a basket of fresh eggs on the counter! To answer your questions:
 Rat Snake. Non-venomous, beneficial due to their penchant for eating rodents and (OUTSIDE) eggs.
 It got in through a hole in our laundry room floor, which is now covered by a VERY heavy concrete block and which will soon be permanently plugged.
 Yes, we let it finish the egg.
 Using two brooms, a whole lot of patience, nudging, and encouraging, we finally convinced it that going out the open window was a MUCH better option than slithering away behind the fridge! As soon as we could get its bulk under the brooms, we hefted it out the window, and off it went to the rest of its evening. And then we drank. (Kidding! okay, sort of. Lol!)
Alls well that ends well, butJEEZ!!!

Last week, we wrote of how a boy survived 42 minutes underwater after jumping into the Naviglio Canal west of Milan, Italy.
His survival was heralded as an exceptional event by doctors and miraculous by the boys mother.
But how did he survive for so long?
The team at On Demand News think they have the answer.
MORE: Boy survives after 42 minutes underwater
The teenager jumped from a bridge into the Naviglio Canal (Picture: Google)
When a persons head is submerged in waterthey will automatically hold their breath and their heart rate will slow down as a result of the human diving reflex. Blood is pulled away from the extremities to the vital organs, which in turn helps circulation between the heart and brain.
That is undoubtedlypartly to thank.
But a second, more controversial theory, reports ODNs Claire Lomas, is more likely to be responsible for the 14-year-olds recovery and it lies in something called the selective brain cooling hypothesis.
The quicker the brain cools, the more likely it is to survive. The hypothesis posits that if youre immersed in cold water  as the boy in question was  the body conserves carbon dioxide, the blood vessels in the brain dilate and more cool blood enters the brain, which keeps you alive.

So much choice, so little money (Picture: SHAUN CURRY/AFP/Getty Images)
Its the one song every Londoner is eager to sing along to  rent in the UKs capital is extortionate.
While everyone who doesnt have a job which keeps them in the office until 9pm each day is slowly pushed out to zone 5, its no secret that London is becoming a city that you can only live in and enjoy if you are fairly wealthy.
Berlin, the counter-culture capital of Europe has taken steps to deal with the problem faced by cities around the world and introduced a rent cap on landlords.
Landlords in Germanys capital city will no longer be able to increase rent by more than 10 per cent over the localaverage.
The legislation was put in place after fears that the large numbers of people moving to the city was giving landlords the opportunity overcharge residents, especially newcomers, similar to situations in London and Paris.

Reiner Wild, managing director of the Berlin Tenants Association, told the Guardian : We dont want a situation like in London or Paris.
The reality in Paris or London is that people with low income have to live in the further-out districts of the city.
The has prompted calls for London to introduce its own rent caps in order to allow lower income people to reside closer to the city centre.

Bearing that in mind, wedo have some sympathy for Joseph, and we think hes a good sport for posting the video for all to see on YouTube, but really, the whole thing is a disaster.
And, of course, it makes for utterly cringeworthy viewing.

As a parent, how do you encourage your child to want to be successful?
Do you tell them to follow their dreams? That hard work isa virtue?
No. You take them on a tour of some luxury villas because, the logic goes, it will show them that beingsuccessful means being rich and being rich means you can buya nice villa.
Around 50 families visit per week at some resorts (Picture: henan.china.com)
That is what Chinese media reports that parents in the country aredoing.
A growing number are taking their children on special tours of villas worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to stimulate a desire to become successful and wealthy.

During the course of the visit, parents will tell their children that wealth is a sign of success and working hard during school will allow them to buy luxury homes like the ones on show and join thesocial elite.

When Kenyon Salowalked through the town ofBoulder, Colorado, asking homeless people for a dollar, he was surprised to find that almost all of them produced a billand handed it over with no questions asked.
But the kindness of these people  who say that to receive a dollar from a member of the public is everything  did not go unrewarded.
With a little sleight of hand, health worker Mr.Salo, 42, changed the dollar bill into a 20 and handed it straight back.

Thats impressive! says one man.
That will put a smile on anyones face!
Dude, that was awesome! anotherwoman tells Mr. Salo.
Mr. Salo is the founder of The Bucket List Life , a community that works together to check off new experiences now rather than later.

The short time span meant they only spent two nights at each destination, and mostly slept on planes, spending only five nights in hotels.
I had the lowest expectations for the Great Wall but it was the best experience, said Megan, from San Francisco.
It was a beautiful day and Bejing was my favourite city too.

In total the pair visited Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Chichen Itza in Mexico, The Lost City of Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, the Colosseum in Italy and the Taj Mahal in India and the Great Wall in China.
However it wasnt smooth sailing throughout the whole trip, as the pair accidentally only gave themselves seven hours in Mexico meaning a rushed trip to the Chichen Itza temple.

Giulio Lampadawas deemed allergic to prison (Picture: CEN)
A Mafia boss has come up with what might be the greatest get out of jail free excuse ever  he is allergic to prison.
Senior Mafia Giulio Lampada, 44,was jailed for 14 years for his role in the organised crime unit of the Condella clan.
However he hasbeen allowed to go home after serving just seven months asdozens of doctors ruled he was incompatible with prison.
He reportedly lost 22lb due to only eating fruit and light snacks and never left his cell in the Liguria region of Italy.
Lampada, who was arrested in November 2011, could not even be transferred toa psychiatric ward, as it was believed he would not fare well in that environment either.

He reportedly became depressed because his life of crime had led him to develop an aversion to men in uniform and to prison bars.
A judge in Milan allowed Lampada to move back to his villa on the outskirts of the city under house arrest.
What horrors took place in this room covered in blood?
There, hell be reunited with his wife and three daughters so he can recover.
His lawyer, Giuseppe Nardo, said: During his time in jail he never left his cell. He even needed help to go to the bathroom.
Tony Soprano would be spinning in his fictional grave (wait  did he die in the end?).

The Pentagon sent live anthrax to three countries, 12 US states and the District of Columbia.
In a spectacular boo-boo US officials accidentally sent live samples of the deadly bacteria-based disease to an army base in South Korea and three laboratories in Canada.
They also managed to ship anthrax to28 government facilities acrossAmerica from the Army lab in Utah.
The spores should have been renderedinactive through irradiation, but for some reason that didnt happen.
A senior Defence Department official told USA Today that no casualties have been infected.

But up to four Americans and 22 military personnel in South Koreas Osan air base are currently receiving preventative treatment, according to BBC.
America also sent anthrax to Australia in 2008, so we doubt theyre expecting many Christmas cards at the Pentagon come December.

The ad was banned because the model is too thin, said the ASA (Picture: PA)
An Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) ad has been banned for featuring a model with a visible rib cage and knees and thighs of a similar width.
The ad, which appeared in Elle UK magazine, featured a black and white photo of a woman described by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) as unhealthily underweight.
A reader complained that the ad was irresponsible for using a model who appeared to be toothin.
The ASA said YSL indicated that they did not agree with the complainants view that the model was unhealthily thin but did not provide a detailed response.
Elle UK told the watchdog it had no comment to make on the complaint.
The ASA said the models pose and the lighting drew particular focus to her chest, where her rib cage was visible and appeared prominent, and to her legs, where her thighs and knees appeared a similar width.

It said: We therefore considered that the model appeared unhealthily underweight in the image and concluded that the ad was irresponsible.
It ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form, adding: We told the advertisers to ensure that the images in their ads were prepared responsibly.
YSL declined to comment on the ruling.
Earlier this year, a campaign for the YSL perfume Black Opium was cleared by the ASA following complaints that it glamorised and trivialised drug use and addiction.

Blatter announced his shock decision today (Picture: Ennio Leanza/Keystone/AP)
Fifa President Sepp Blatter will resign from soccers governing body amid a widening corruption scandal and has promised to call for fresh elections to choose a successor.
Heres what you need to know:
1. Explosive letter
Jack Warner is alleged to have been involved in a $10million bribe (Picture: Reuters)
Blatters shock decision comes on the same day a letter emerged appearing to contradict claims his right-hand man was not involved in the payment of an alleged $10million bribe.
The letter implicates former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner in an alleged corrupt bid to secure the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
2. Standing down for the good of football
(Picture:Getty Images)
During his resignation, Blatter said: I have thoroughly considered my presidency and about the last 40 years in my life, these years were closely related to Fifa.
I decided to stand again for election for the good of football, but my mandate does not appear to be supported by everybody.
The elections are closed but the challenges we are facing have not. Fifa needs profound restructuring.
3. New president to be announced ASAP
(Picture:Getty Images)
An extraordinary congress will be called to elect a new president, Blatter said.
As part of Fifas work, the organisation will re-examine the way in which it is structured. While it would be premature to speculate on the outcomes of this work, nothing will be off the table, including the structure and composition of the Executive Committee and the way in which members of the Executive Committee are elected
The governing body said there is significant work to be done in order to regain the trust of the public and to fundamentally reform the way in which people see Fifa.
4. Could England host the 2018 World Cup?
(Picture:Markus Gilliar Pool/Getty Images)
A question hangs over who should host the 2018 World Cup.
Lennart Johansson, the former head of Uefa,previouslyclaimed that England should host the World Cup instead of Russia and, amid the corruption crisis, anything is possible.
5. Beginning of the end
(Picture: Fox)
Blatters decision marks the beginning of the end of his 17-year reign as Fifa president, with much of it now tainted by investigations into the organisations conduct, specifically regarding the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively.
Fifa is likely to undergo substantial reform following the announcement, with United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch stating last week that the recent arrests of several senior officials suggest that the corruption in the organisation is rampant, systemic and deep-rooted.

Source: World Bank
The number of babies being born in Germany isofficially the lowest in the world.
Thats according to recent birth rate figures by the World Bank showing how just 8.28 babies are born per 1,000 people at the moment.
Britains birth rate meanwhile is ranked at 152nd out of 208 countries at 12.68 babies per 1,000.
The higher birth rate in the UK is believed to be dueto immigration, with foreign mothers giving birth keeping figures buoyant.
Germany has also experienced similar migration, but the birth rate has remained low indicating that foreign mothers there are adopting the national habit of having fewer children later in life.
This does not appear to be the case in Britain.
Elsewhere, Niger has the highest birth rate in the world with 49.93 births per 1,000 and Mali a close second with 47.54 births.

Simply being born in Germany is enough to make you richer than the majority of people in China and India(Picture: Getty Images)
If you type how into Google, the thirdoption is how to make money.
Unsurprisingly, getting rich isa goal for a huge number of people. But in a global context, many of these same people are already rich  and one economist claims to know why.
According to Branko Milanovic, wealth isnt so much about who your parents are as where you were born.
His research found that even if you are in the bottom 1 percent in Germany in terms of wealth, youre still richer than 90 percent of those in India and all but the top 40 percent of people in China.
MORE: Have any of these old gadgets? Theyre worth a lot of money now
Mr. Milanovic factored in the differingpurchasing power of different countries (Picture: Branko Milanovic)
In fact, more than half of what you earn is determined by the country in which you live, but since only 3 percent of the worlds population are immigrants, your wealth is effectivelydetermined by the country in which you were born.
For instance, if you work in McDonalds in India, youll make 30p an hour. In China, 53p an hour, in Russia, 1.54 an hour and in the US, 4.81 an hour. In Western Europe, youll make, on average, 6.19 an hour.
Of course, local goods and services are more expensive in Western Europe than in India. But even with this taken into account  as Mr. Milanovic does by using thepurchasing power parity (PPP) metric  the difference in wealth is huge.
MORE: Brits who change their route to work are likely to earn more money
Branko Milanovic specialises in global income inequality (Picture: Getty Images)
Being rich, then  in a global sense, anyway  is as simple as living in the right place. But how do yougetrich?
Matt OBrien, writing for the Washington Post , suggests that if those in poorer countries wishto become wealthier, the obvious solution is to move to richer countries.
Relocatingto wealthier countries allows immigrantsto earn more doing the same job that they were doing anyway.
However, Mr. OBrien hastens to add that large-scaleimmigration would inevitably drive down wages for the people already living in thatcountry  at least in the short-to-medium run.

He had opted for what appears to be a straw trilby  looking somewhere in between a Shoreditch hipster and a banjo-playing yokel.
But either way, the hat seemed to cover his blockhead hairstyle  and it seems that he isnt planning on abandoning the headgear anytime soon.

Motorcyclist Samuel Ayres asked a driver to put down his phone while waiting at a traffic light.
The driver obviously didnt take to kindly to his request, so decided to pursue Ayres and knock him off his bike in a potentially fatal revenge attempt.
Capturing the incident on a camera fastened to his helmet, Ayres said the journey started as a fairly typical commute.
But Ayres ended up sustaining injuries so serious hes had to set up a crowdfunding site to cover medical costs.
He said: On March 26, 2015, I was driving to work on my motorcycle. I noticed one man in a black BMW convertible. He was very busy texting and talking on his mobile phone.
Road rage revenge (Picture: YouTube)
He became visibly angry when I yelled at him to put down his phone.
Once the light turned green, I proceeded through the intersection. The BMW driver came flying up behind me very aggressively.
Describing the shocking attack, Ayres added: After a couple of blocks, he swerved into my lane, knocking both my bike and myself to the ground.
The clip then shows the driver speed away from the scene without stopping.

The smash left Ayres with a concussion so severe he couldnt remember what year it was when he came round.
He also suffered two hairline fractures in his left shoulder and a broken left foot, but because the driver is currently under criminal investigation, Ayres cannot claim compensation.
His crowdfunding site has currently raised $1,717.

Sometimes you have to lose everything in life to realise what its all really worth.
Tyler Mann recently sat down to have a conversation with a homeless man he saw outside a petrol station in Austin, Texas and had what might be one of the most profound conversations of his life.
In a sobering monologue the articulate mantook Tyler through his personal story, including his cushty life before prison, his drug conviction, and his life on the street.
Occasionally wiping a tear away from his eye, he ponders on why humanity has become so scared of each other, recounting the time when he asked a woman for the time only to be shouted at.

A Muslim womanwho was denied a job at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch because she wears a headscarf has won a legal battle to sue them for discrimination.
Samantha Elauf, 24, wasturned down for a job atAbercrombie Kids in Oklahoma when she was 17 because her religious attire did not fit in with the companys look policy.
However the Supreme Court hasruled that the decision was a form of religious discrimination in the landmark case.
The case was brought to the Supreme Court byU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency that sued the company on Elaufs behalf after she was turned down for the role in 2008.
Elauf, now 24, initially won a $20,000 judgement against Abercrombie before a federal district court, however the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver then threw that out, ruling in favour of Abercrombie, before the high court backed Elauf.

The editor of a daily newspaper in Qatar has resigned after inadvertently running part of the Kama Sutra.
The photograph, which appeared inAl-Sharq, showed a womans henna tattoo which depicted scenes from the ancient sex book.
It was carried alongside an article into the dangers of henna.
Editor in chief Jaber al-Harmi wrote: All apologies are not enough for such a serious mistake, which occurred by publishing morally inappropriate images.
Our values and principles provide a red line that cannot be breached and so I presented my resignation to the board.
This tragic incident revealed to us the extent of the adherence of our community to religion, values and morals.

Au Revoir! (Picture: Chesnot/Getty Images)
Dry your eyes, clichd romantics  because workmen in Paris have now begun removing the thousands of padlocks attached to the Pont des Arts Bridge, out of fear that the sheer weight of the romantic gesture could cause it to collapse.
The 19th century bridge has become a shrine for tourists who seek to immortalise their love by following thousands of other couples like sheep and adding a padlock to the bridges railings.
Its the end of the padlocks, deputy Paris mayor Bruno Julliard said.
They spoil the aesthetics of the bridge, are structurally bad for it and can cause accidents, he correctly explained.
The decision to remove the locks was taken after one section of railing collapsed, causing a potential risk to shipping on the River Seine below.
The railings will be replaced with panels covered in street art, and later by Plexiglass.
And dont come back! (Picture: AP Photo/Remy de la Mauviniere)
Left up to us, the locks would be destroyed in a fiery furnace, but sympathetic authorities will recycle the metal so that the symbol of love which these couples have invested in them will not be lost entirely.
And a no-nonsense attitude will be taken towards reckless romantics who instead decide to place the locks on other Paris landmarks  including the Eiffel Tower.

The attack occurred at around 2:30pm in Johannesburg, South Africa, when a lioness approached the passenger side of avehicle as the woman took photos.
They had their windows all the way down, which is strictly against policy, said Scott Simpson, assistant operations manager at the Lion Park.
He added: The lion bit the lady through the window.

The driver tried to punch the lion but was scratched by the animal before park staff quickly chasedit away and called an ambulance.
Unfortunately, she did pass away, said Mr Simpson, adding the US Embassy had been informed because the woman was American.
The Lion Park is a popular destination for tourists who can drive in their own vehicles through large enclosures where lions roam freely.
Big signs advise visitors to keep their car windows up and drivers entering the park are also handed a paper with the same warning.

A gay teen has been forced to have sex with his own mum in a bid to cure his sexual preferences.
Gay rights group LGBT Collective, who operate from Telangana in southern India, warn that parents are so desperate to have heterosexual children that so-called corrective rapes are being inflicted on gay adolescents by members of their own family.
Relatives  often cousins, but in some cases parents  force themselves on victims in a misguided attempt to ensure they are cured of homosexuality.
One teenage boy suspected of being gay was forced to have sex with his own mother.

The organisation said it hasreceived at least 15 reports of corrective rapes in the last five years, but believe some victims keep quiet because of the trauma and shame associated with sexual assault and homosexuality in the country.
LGBT Collective spokesperson, Vyjayanti Mogli said: We are sure there are many more cases, but they go unreported.
We came across such cases not because they reported the rape, but because they sought help to flee their homes, Mogli told the Times of India.
Its usually a cousin whos roped in for this project.
Mogli also described a string of cases in the south in which newborn girls are promised to a cousin for marriage, if she is later discovered to be in a lesbian relationship family elders oftenarrange for the intended spouse to carry out a forcible cure attempt.
In 2013 the Indian Supreme Court reinstated a colonial law which banned gay sex, which means homosexuality can be punished with up to tenyears in jail.
