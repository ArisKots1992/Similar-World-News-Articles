Gunmen have killed at least 27 people in an attack on two tourist hotels in a Tunisian town popular with British holidaymakers.
Tourists fled from the beach in Sousse to take refuge in hotel rooms after guns were fired on the beach.
One man said his son saw someone get shot as he raced back to the hotel from the sea.
Photographs seen by Sky News show one man in his 60s or 70s lying in a pool of blood in his swimming shorts.

One gunman has been killed, according to security sources cited by the Reuters news agency. The country's interior ministry says at least 27 people have been killed.
British tourist Gary Pine said: "We thought fire crackers were going off but you could see quite quickly what was going on.

"There was a mass exodus off the beach. My son was in the sea at the time and myself and my wife were shouting at him to get out and as he ran up he said Ive just saw someone get shot.
Another holidaymaker, Susan Ricketts, said: "It sounded like a machine gun going off. There are people crying and going hysterical. We just came up to our room."
Tourists are now gathered in hotel reception areas and hiding in rooms as the situation develops.
One said: "People are running around the hotel. No-one has really been told what to do."

A man has been decapitated by attackers brandishing Islamist flags at a French factory near Grenoble.
The severed head had Arabic writing scrawled across it and was found on a fence next to twojihadi banners.
Two other people were hurt in explosions at the factory, French President Francois Hollande said.
The blasts in France were triggered when two attackers deliberately crashed a car into gas canisters, according to police.
A 35-year-old man was among several people arrested after the attack.

Le Parisien reported gunshots and that one Islamist had been killed at the premises in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, southeastern France.
Le Dauphine newspaper reported that police are hunting for another man associated with the attack.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, speaking from the scene, described the attack as "barbarous" and a "terrible terrorist crime".
He said that one of the arrested people had been known to foreign intelligence services may have been radicalised.
The suspect was initially flagged as an extremist in 2006 and then police monitoring dropped off two years later, according to MrCazeneuve.
He did not have a criminal record, the minister added.
MrHollande has cut short all of his engagements at the EU summit in Belgium to return to France for emergency talks.
"The attack was of a terrorist nature since a body was discovered, decapitated and with inscriptions," MrHollande told a news conference in Brussels.
He added that a considerable police force had been deployed in the region and other industrial sites protected to avoid any further incidents.
"The president saw the first images of the attack on the 24-news channels with German Chancellor Angela Merkel beside him, who was visibly shocked," an official added.
The two leaders had just ended a short meeting with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
David Cameron has spoken to MrHollande in Brussels to express his sympathies. Downing Street described the attack as an "appalling incident".
Employees at the factory - Air Products - are said to be "very shocked". 
One witness called Caroline, from a neighbouring factory, said: "I heard a really loud noise. Fire engines arrived with the police.

"We thought it was a motorway accident."
Air Products is an American chemical company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
A statement from the company read: "Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for.
"Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities."
Henry Samuel, a correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, told Sky News: "The person arrested was allegedly carrying a flag of the Islamic State and he said he was a member of the IS."
The attack came nearly six months after the Islamist attacks in and around Paris that killed 17 people in January.
Those attacks started with a shooting at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo .
Sky's foreign affairs editor Sam Kiley said: "There has been a concerted effort by Islamic State to reach out to their followers in France and exhortations to conduct this sort of attack.
"We saw with the Charlie Hebdo attack these were also self-starter individuals who had had training from al Qaeda in Yemen.
"One of the three said he was there on behalf of Islamic State, the other two claimed membership of al Qaeda.
"In a sense it doesn't matter. What matters is that people are inspired to carry out terrorist attacks."

Emergency Cash To Continue For Greek Banks
The decision to maintain - but not increase - emergency funding for the banks still leaves Greece facing an uncertain week.

The European Central Bank has announced it will continue its emergency cash lifeline to Greece's banks at the amount agreed on Friday - but there will be no increase.
The ECB said it would watch financial markets and "the potential implications for the monetary policy stance" closely amid fears of turmoil and contagion when markets re-open tomorrow.
It added: "The Governing Council decided to maintain the ceiling to the provision of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greek banks at the level decided on Friday.
"The Governing Council stands ready to reconsider its decision,"
Greek finance ministerYanis Varoufakis said Greece would work with the ECBon responding to the cash crisis facing its banks before they open tomorrow.

When questioned, however, he seemed to suggest Greece might not pay the 1.6bn it owes to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, saying the European Central Bank should pay the money to the IMF out of the profits it made on Greek bonds in 2014.
The ECB's announcement came after Bank of Greece chief Yannis Stournaras said his bank "will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances".
The news will do little to calm the fears of thousands of Greeks who queued to clear out their accounts, despite pleas from finance minister NadiaValavani to remain calm and not try to withdraw their savings.
European creditors had already refused to extend Greece's international bailout beyond Tuesday and, with a bank run gathering pace, the country still faces a financial crunch.

Sky News Europe correspondent Robert Nisbet said the decision meant "a very uncertain week" ahead for Greece, adding: "people may not be able to get enough cash out of their bank accounts, it may affect businesses trading but all of this is done to protect the integrity of the banking system until that referendum happens on Sunday."
He said it was likely that "capital controls" would be brought in tomorrow, which would see banks closed until the referendum.
In a speech before the vote, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has already said he is confident that "the Greek people will say an emphatic no to the ultimatum" by the country's creditors.
The expression "emphatic no" is a reference to when Greek authorities declared "no" to an ultimatum by the Italian army demanding to occupy Greek territory in 1940. One of the two Greek national holidays, 28 October, is named "the day of no".

On Saturday, eurozone finance ministers refused to extend Greece's bailout programme beyond Tuesday - meaning Athens is at risk of defaulting on its 1.5bn IMF payment.
MrVaroufakis had requested an extension of several weeks until the referendum had taken place, but Mr Dijisselbloem said it would not be possible to provide a temporary extension until the result of the ballot is known.

Greece Referendum Not A Simple Yes Or No
If Greece does leave the euro, it would face even greater short-term austerity and pain than it has so far, writes Ed Conway.
13:28, UK, Saturday 27 June 2015
Some think a 'no' would effectively mean Greece has voted to leave the euro
Follow Ed
Austerity, deficits, loans and currencies. Greece's euro crisis is about lots of things, but in the end it has always been about something else: national sovereignty and democracy.
When Greece joined the Eurozone (without a referendum, it should be said) it ceded some of its sovereignty.
Since the country now shared a currency with fellow Europeans it would no longer have direct control over its monetary policy.
That was simply part of the deal - and it is part of the explanation for how it ended up in the mess it is in.
It meant a dilution of sovereignty in economic "peacetime".
Play video "Greek PM Says Ultimatums Won't Work"
Video: Greek PM Says Ultimatums Won't Work
As part of the single currency, Greece lost control of its own interest rates, and thus lost influence over the yield on government bonds.
The country could suddenly borrow at unprecedented cheap rates - despite not having the productivity to justify it.
So began the bubble that fuelled the Greek crisis in the first place (a simplified version of history, I admit).
But even during "peacetime" Greece still maintained a certain amount of control over its fiscal policy - taxing and spending.
When the crisis struck and it needed to rely on its fellow Eurozone nations (and the IMF, and ECB) for financial assistance, it effectively ceded most of its fiscal sovereignty too.
In return for the loans, the Greeks had to accede to certain demands.
There is nothing particularly unusual in this.
When the UK borrowed money from the US after the Second World War a whole host of demands came attached to it: that the UK should open up its economic system; that it should sell off a whole load of publicly-owned assets at cheap prices.
There was even talk about selling off the Crown Jewels.
None of this is particularly pleasant, but it is an unfortunate reality.
To make matters worse, in Greece's case, the lenders deciding those conditions discredited themselves repeatedly.
Their forecasts for the impact of austerity on Greece were completely wrong.
Their programme contributed to a depression deeper and longer than anything seen since modern records began.
1/5
Gallery: The Deadlines On The Road Ahead For Athens
After a series of shifting payment deadlines Greece's future within the EU could be decided in the coming days
But, having ceded its sovereignty - both monetary and fiscal - the Greeks could do little about it.
They had to suffer as a poorly-constructed bailout and overly-aggressive austerity was imposed on them.
In January the Greeks voted in Alexis Tsipras as prime minister on a manifesto which promised to cancel austerity.
The problem, of course, was that because of all of the above, in practice the Greeks did not and do not have the sovereign right to do that themselves.
The best Mr Tsipras could do was to try to get a better deal and improve the terms of the bailout, which is what he has been doing in Brussels and Athens for the past six months.
His decision to call a referendum next weekend seems to be a tacit admission he has failed.
There are a number of short and medium term problems, the most pressing of which is what happens to the financial system between now and next weekend.
The slow-motion invisible system-wide bank run afflicting Greece's financial system over the past couple of months threatens to turn into a rapid, visible one.
People are already being photographed queuing up to take money out of their bank accounts.
There is the question of what the Eurozone decides today at its finance ministers' meeting.
Do they grant Greece the five-day bailout extension they are demanding? Do they refuse?
Do they simply talk about plan b - the capital controls and restrictions they would need to impose to incubate Greece ahead of a possible euro exit?
What part does the International Monetary Fund, who will almost certainly not get paid on time on Tuesday, play in the saga?
1/17
Gallery: Pro-EU Protests In Athens
Pro-euro protesters take part in a rally in front of the Parliament in Athens, Greece
But more than these short-term questions is the bigger medium to long term one: if Greeks do as their prime minister is suggesting and vote no to the current bailout deal, what does that imply?
As far as many here in Brussels are concerned, it means Greece will effectively have voted to leave the Eurozone.
But Syriza figures are insisting it simply means another stage in the negotiations.
The answer to that question will determine the way many vote.
In Greece there is both widespread disdain for the bailout and the conditions attached to it, and widespread support for euro membership.
So the way the debate is framed will determine the result.
But the reality is that if Greece did leave the euro, it would face even greater short-term austerity and pain than it has in the past year or so.
It would face more financial turbulence.
It might swap euro bailout conditions with even more shady ones from Russia or China.
It would regain some of its monetary sovereignty, but in exchange for this it would suffer a fair amount of pain.
There are no easy answers here, which is why what looks like a simple yes/no question is far more complex and unpredictable than it seems.

French police say the attack on a US gas company in the southeast of the country bears the hallmark of Islamist militants.
A decapitated head was reportedly found on a gate at the entrance to the factory in Saint Quentin-Fallavier, along with two flags bearing Arabic writing.
Sky's Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said it was too early to be certain about who was responsible.
"Beyond some Arabic writing on a flag we don't really know the genesis of this attack" he said.
"Let's not start running up an Islamist flag and claim it to be a jihadi operation as such until we have further evidence.
Play video "Why Attack This Factory?"
Video: Why Attack This Factory?
"But at the moment there is a suggestion from the French media that this does look like an Islamist attack."
Kiley said there is a possibility that, whoever was responsible, it could have been a robbery that went wrong.
"At this stage there is a lot of confusion. It is not clear the decapitation... was linked to the explosions some time later.
"You have a lot volatile material in this location, so it is conceivable it was a robbery in which people were trying to get hold of potentially dangerous products to use in an attack elsewhere."

Two policemen have told Sky News that officers were following orders from senior commanders when they opened fire on striking South African mining workers in 2012.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the officers criticised the police tactics used to break up the demonstration at the Lonmin PLC platinum mine near Marikana.
One of the officers said police were told to "shoot to kill" by their superiors if they felt they were in danger.
He said police were instructed that "if your life is under threat, or your colleague's life is under threat, therefore you shoot to kill".
He added: "That is my interpretation."

Asked by Sky's Alex Crawford to confirm that senior police commanders told officers to "shoot to kill", he added: "Yeah, I think (so)."
He added: "We did what was instructed to us. We just followed orders."
Another policeman said: "We did what was expected from us. We followed the instructions.
"I guess we did not want those people to be killed in the first place."
Thirty-four people died during the massacre on 16 August, 2012.
Families of the victims have accused police of using excessive force.

South Africa's President Jacob Zuma said the government-appointed panel's report recommended prosecutors determine whether any officers are criminally liable for the deaths.
"The commission recommends a full investigation under the direction of the director of public prosecutions... with a view to ascertaining criminal liability on the part of all members of the South African Police Service who were involved in the incidents," he said.
Mr Zuma described the killings as a "horrendous tragedy that has no place in democracy", adding that the world did not expect such an episode in a "free and democratic South Africa".
In the days leading up to the attack, 10 others were murdered near the platinum mine, including non-striking miners, security guards and two police officers who were hacked to death.
Mr Zuma said the inquiry has recommended that all killings prior to 16 August should also be investigated.
"We should, as a nation, learn from this painful episode," he said.
"We should use it to build a more united, peaceful and cohesive society."

More than 500 people have been injured after an explosion and fire during a concert at a Taiwan water park.
The blast and ensuing blaze happened when a coloured powder being sprayed near a music stage ignited and turned into a fireball that swept through the 1,000-strong crowd.
Footage from the scene showed the stage on fire and crowds running away, some of them only dressed in swimwear.

Of those hurt, more than 80 are said to have been seriously injured.
There are reports some victims had suffered burns to more than 40% of their bodies.
Inflatable rubber dinghies were used to carry casualties away from the scene or used as makeshift beds to treat those injured.
A spokesman for the New Taipei City fire department said: "Our initial understanding is this explosion and fire... was caused by the powder spray. It could have been due to the heat of the lights on the stage."
Of those hurt, more than 80 are said to have been seriously injured
Officials said the blaze at the Formosa Water Park, just outside the island's capital Taipei, was brought swiftly under control.
One eyewitness told local news channel CTI: "It started on the left side of the stage.
"At the beginning I thought it was part of the special effects of the party but then I realised there was something wrong and people started screaming and running."
An injured man is given aid at the scene
New Taipei Mayor Eric Chu said: "We feel sad and regretful about the accident."
Extra medical staff had also been called in to help treat the victims.
"I've ordered the park to shut down immediately and be placed under a rigorous investigation," he added.

Identifying all British victims of the Tunisia terror attack will take time because few of the holidaymakers gunned down on the beach were carrying IDs, Theresa May has warned.
The Home Secretary, who chaired a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee, also said there was no evidence that the gunman had specifically targeted British tourists in Friday's attack, which left 38 people dead.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron has asked for the flags over No 10 to be flown at half-mast in memory of the victims of the attack.
"The process of identifying individuals who have been affected and the deceased is a complex one," she told reporters, rejecting suggestions that the Foreign Office had been slow in helping families looking for information on the missing.
"It is imperative that we get it absolutely right for the families, and that can sometimes take time."

Ms May said the victims would not have had passports or other forms of identification with them on the beach in Sousse and some victims were being moved between hospitals in the country.
She said the UK had dispatched a medical liaison team and a small group of advisers to look at security arrangements in the area, which attracts thousands of western tourists every year.
The British ambassador to Tunisia was due to meet with senior government officials later in the day.
Earlier on Sunday, the Foreign Office warned that further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible following the beach resort massacre.
"Further terrorist attacks in Tunisia, including in tourist resorts, are possible, including by individuals who are unknown to the authorities and whose actions are inspired by terrorist groups via social media," the updated advice on the Foreign Office website reads.
"You should be especially vigilant at this time and follow the advice of Tunisian security authorities and your tour operator."

Hundreds of people gathered for a peace rally near the site of the attack in Sousse, a Tunisian beach resort popular with foreigners
The victims of gunman Seifeddine Rezgui include 15 Britons , though officials have warned that the toll is expected to rise.
Ms May noted the Tunisia shooting marked the most significant loss of British life since the attacks on 7 July 2005 in London, in which 52 people were killed.
Speaking earlier on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, she warned that the risk to Britain had become "more diverse" in recent years - including not just the risk of groups plotting over time to strike in the country but also that of spontaneous attacks by a "lone wolf".
She said that some 40 plots had been foiled in the UK in the past decade, including "a number of plots" in recent months.
Mrs May said the Government will be introducing a counter-extremism strategy to tackle radicalisation.
In Tunisia, security officials added an extra 1,000 police to tourist sites and beaches.

"We don't want to make tourist establishments into barracks, that's not our goal. But we must act to guarantee the security of the tourist sector," saidInterior Minister Mohamed Najem Gharsalli.
But thousands of shocked tourists were leaving the nation after the attack.
Up to 2,500 more people could return to the UK from Tunisia today, as part of holiday firms' efforts to get those on holiday at the beach resort home as soon as possible .
On Saturday, Thomson and First Choice said it had already expatriated 1,000 of its customers, but added that there were still 5,400 remaining.
Tui Group, which runs the companies, was unable to confirm how many of the 38 people killed or injured in the shooting were its customers, but said there had been a "number of fatalities".
An additional 11 Thomson flights as well as one third-party flight with Nouvelle Air are currently due to leave today.

The Association of British Travel Agents, known as Abta, estimates there are approximately 20,000 customers currently on holiday with Abta members in Tunisia.
But it said there will also be a number of holidaymakers who have travelled independently.
Holidaymakers elsewhere in the country were advised to contact their tour operators and follow any instructions issued by local authorities.
While many have left, a scattering of foreign tourists are still reportedly at the resort.
Welsh couple Angela Chambers and Peter Phillips told the Associated Press they declined their tour operator's offer to take them to the airport last night.
"I think we feel safer here than last night going to the airport," said Ms Chambers.

In Sousselast night, people gathered for a protest against terrorism.
Crowds gathered after dark with some holding candles while others carried flags including those of the United Kingdom and Tunisia.
Some people held posters aloft proclaiming "Peace" and "Sousse will never die".

EU Talks Over Greece Debt End Without Deal
German Chancellor Angela Merkel tells EU leaders there must be a debt deal with Greece before financial markets open next Monday.

A meeting of eurozone finance ministers trying to agree a deal on Greece's debt crisis has broken up in Brussels without agreement.
The Greek government badly needs 7.2bn from creditors to keep its economy going and to help with a 1.6bn payment it has to make to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by next Tuesday.
Otherwise, Athens may default on its debts which could lead to the country leaving the single currency.
German Chancellor Angela Merkelhas said there must be a debt deal with Greece before financial markets open on Monday.
She also told a meeting of European leaders before an EU summit in Brussels that Germany "will not be blackmailed" by Greece.

The talks will resume on Saturday, but Germany's finance minister earlier on Thursday expressed pessimism that a deal could be struck.
Wolfgang Schaeublesaid the two sides were "even further apart" as discussions took place between the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsiprasand the IMF and European Central Bank (ECB).
The creditors presented Athens with new proposals over the economic reforms it wants made in an attempt to find a breakthrough over its bailout.
But Greece was still not on board, raising fresh doubts about whether it was possible to clinch a deal before the end of June.

However, Mr Tsiprassaid he was confident of reaching a compromise despite a deadlock in the talks.
According to Greek officials at the talks, creditors were seeking a different mix of austerity measures than those proposed by Athens, making the cuts more immediate.
They included broad pension cuts, higher revenue from sales tax, and a faster elimination of tax exemptions - demands that are likely to fuel dissent within the government if accepted.

Hopes of a settlement had faded on Wednesday evening after the IMF cast doubts on Greece's new debt plan .
The proposals put forward by Athens aim to raise 8bn, mostly through new taxes on the wealthy and businesses, early retirement restrictions, VAT increases and a cut in defence spending.
But the IMF was cautious about the mix of reforms Greece proposed, saying they rely too heavily on tax increases that can hurt the economy.

Video: Tragedy And Turmoil In Greece
It wants more spending cuts because of the possible effect of tax rises on businesses.
Stock markets across Europe were down after the IMF's negative reaction to the proposals.
Assuming a deal is thrashed out with the EU and IMF, Mr Tspiras still needs to convince his anti-austerity Syriza party to approve concessions needed to unblock the desperately needed bailout funds.
He only has a slim majority within the Greek parliament and opposition within his own party to proposed concessions means ratification in Greece is by no means assured.

It is a macabre scene, but it is the reality of what happened here.
The blood of the victims of the Tunisian terror attack is sluiced away from the still soiled paths and roadways of the hotel complex.
Their hotel is all but closed now. The predominantly British guests, the survivors, are on their way home in hastily arranged charter flights.
The Tunisian population, who depend on the tourist business, are left contemplating what happened here.
Shopkeeper Mohammed Kamis' stock was riddled with bullets
Their simple question is why would one of their own do this? It will ruin them.
Mohammed Kamis witnessed the gunman's final moments. He was killed a hundred yards from his shop, that he passed, still firing.

As he showed me the deflated blow up boats and rubber rings that were broken in a hail of bullets he said he had no answers to the events of Friday.
"What can we do. He isn't one of us is he?" he said.
"We saw him walking and then turning and firing at people chasing him. Workmen on the roof above threw cement and bricks at him trying to kill him. Then he turned the corner and the police saw him and he was killed," he added.
There were many other lucky escapes.
Kevin McCabe from Ireland, now resident here, took me round the shops and hotels where his friends are now looking at another summer of almost no trade.

He walks the same stretch of beach where the attack happened, every day. His son had emailed him that something was going on, so he decided to hurry home.
"I saw the guy. If I had stayed where I was I would be his first victim," he said as we walked the beach where the shooter attempted to escape.
"What is really important to remember is that local people took this guy on.
"They chased him and he fired and I saw them falling. I don't know if they were hit but they went down.
"They were unarmed but they chased him and others did everything they could to save the foreigners. It is amazing," he said.

The various hotel owners on the beach are demanding more security with armed police on patrol and at the hotels. But they want more.
"There needs to be a change in attitude both here and abroad," said Mohammed Becheur, the owner of the hotel where most casualties were recorded.
"The international community and Tunisia needs to control these Islamists or we will have lost."
Tunisia has suffered badly since the Arab Spring revolution of 2011.
Things have got better - but the terror attacks have continued and it is widely acknowledged that there is nothing to suspect they will stop any time soon.

Why Crucial Greek Debt Talks Keep Collapsing
Sky's Economics Editor Ed Conway examines the three main reasons why the negotiations to reach a deal remain deadlocked.

Play video "Five Questions Answered On Greece"
Video: Five Questions Answered On Greece
If you've been following the Greek crisis for the past week or so you're probably wondering why on Earth it is that all of these crunch meetings have been collapsing.
You can boil it down to three reasons.
First, it's because there's so much at stake:
Syriza came into power promising to fight austerity; if it signs up to all the lender conditions it will be seen to have failed.
IMF head Christine Lagarde and Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis
The lenders, meanwhile, worry that any concessions to Greece will simply encourage other troubled eurozone countries to borrow and spend even more in the future, casting the long-term stability of European Monetary Union into doubt.
Second, it's because none of the participants are particularly familiar with the protocol here:
Play video "What Would A Greek Default Mean?"
Video: What Would A Greek Default Mean?
The lenders are used to dictating the terms, but this time around theyve agreed to a Brussels-level negotiation with the Greeks. For their part, the Greeks are totally unfamiliar with the language of Brussels, since theyre a new government with little institutional memory of what it takes to be a "Sherpa" (a lead negotiator).
The upshot is that each of the three eurogroup meetings weve had in the past week has begun without an agreed draft text: instead there have been multiple drafts floating around, meaning the ministers dont have anything to use as the basis for discussion.
Third, it's because of the manifold misunderstandings that still float around about the Greek economy:
Take pensions, one of the main issues at stake here. The Greeks are under extreme pressure to reform their pension system in exchange for extending their bailout (there has to be a quid pro quo, after all). The Germans are furious that some Greeks can retire so early. They moan about the comparative generosity of the set-up.
And indeed, looked at through some prisms, they have a point. The average age at which Greek workers receive a pension is lower than most other EU countries - 57.8 years old. Then again, this is about the same as Italy (58), is far higher than Slovenia (56.6) and is already poised to go up sharply, with the retirement age set to be increased to 67 in the coming decades. (The speed with which this happens is one of the contentious points in the negotiations.)
Play video "Brexit vs Grexit Analysis"
Video: Brexit vs Grexit Analysis
The Greek pension system is costly - around 13% of GDP, compared with an average of 7.8% across the developed OECD nations - though it's worth attaching a couple of riders to this concern.
First, the Greek population is older, on average, than in the rest of the EU - which in turn makes pension costs higher. Second, the generosity of the Greek pension system is in part a consequence of the stinginess of the rest of Greeces welfare state. For instance, Greek spending on incapacity benefits is lower than almost anywhere else in the OECD.
Spending on family benefits (stuff equivalent to Britains child tax credits) is likewise lower than the average.
The upshot of all of this is that over decades Greece's pensions system has become a kind of surrogate form of benefits for many Greek families. Many people retire early, lured by the pension, but also use that pension not just for themselves but to, say, support their unemployed son.
And these issues are not lost on Greece's lenders. The IMF, for instance, wants to cut the amount Greece pays out on pensions (most of its proposals thus far have revolved around increasing pension contributions, not cutting spending). But it also wants Greece to increase the sufficiency of its welfare system.

Or take another issue: taxes. It's often assumed that Greeks pay too little tax. Actually, when you look at the governments total revenues and compare them with other countries, Greece is actually already quite highly taxed. Yes, in part this is an artefact of the low GDP against which taxes are measured, but even before the crisis Greece wasnt the lowest-taxed country out there. The fact that there is widespread avoidance often overshadows the fact that tax revenues in Greece are already pretty high.
Then there's defence. Why is it that Greece's military is better funded than any other country in Europe? This helps explain why the IMF are so keen that defence gets cut as part of any agreement. And yet there is a reason for high defence spending: Greece sits at a strategic point at the edge of the EU.
Moreover, the Greek military are particularly politically powerful. They wouldn't take cuts lying down. The fact that Greece has had its own (recent) history of military coups only underlines this issue.
Such nuanced arguments are often lost, both in the coverage of the negotiations and, sometimes, in the negotiation rooms themselves. But they matter enormously in the long-run. And they explain why this is one of those knotty subjects where straightforward answers on either side dont always help all that much.

Sky News has obtained video showing Seifeddine Rezgui as a breakdancing youth around five years before he murdered almost 40 people in a popular beach resort.
In the footage, thought to have been filmed in 2010, Rezgui wears skinny jeans, a hoodie and baseball cap and performs spins and handstands to a techno soundtrack.
The video was posted on a Facebook page set up by a group of friends interested in rap music and breakdancing and has attracted a string of comments since the Sousse massacre.
One reads: "Before he was an artist - then he became a demon."
The group was created in 2010 and while early posts focus on members' dancing exploits, entries took on a more political nature as the Arab Spring - which began in Tunisia in 2010 - gripped the region.

How and when the 23-year-old turned from an easy-going teenager into a disciple of the Islamic State death cult will be a central focus for investigators in Tunisia.
Friends told Sky News that even two days before the attack, Rezgui showed no signs of radicalisation, visiting a cafe and going for a walk.
Those accounts were backed up by the killer's uncle Ali al Rezgui, who told the Telegraph the family had seen nothing to worry them - although Seifeddine Rezgui had apparently been traumatised by the death of his brother in a lightning strike in 2010.

Mr Rezgui told the paper:"He used to use hair gel and wear the nicest of clothes, and he used to do break dancing.
"He even used to go to competitions and things like that in Tunis, he was well known for that here. He didn't even have a beard, and I've never seen him with anyone with a beard.

Fifteen Libya Emails Missing From Clinton Cache
The emails, relating to security in the country before a 2012 attack, are given to the State Department by Sidney Blumenthal.
09:24, UK, Friday 26 June 2015
Hillary Clinton has said she handed over all her "work-related" emails
Share by email
By Sky News US Team
The US State Department has said it cannot find 15 emails from Hillary Clinton's private server that were released by a House of Representatives panel investigating the 2012 attack in Benghazi.
The emails, which all pre-date the 11 September attack on the US diplomatic compound, contain intelligence reports passed to Mrs Clinton by her long-time adviser Sidney Blumenthal, officials have said.
Several previously undisclosed emails were handed over to the State Department by Mr Blumenthal, which revealed it did not have a complete record from Mrs Clinton's time in office as Secretary of State.
US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in 2012
The 15 emails were either missing from the records she provided, or included only in partial form.
They include a media account about the killing of one of Moammar Gaddafi's sons, reports on internal politics among Libyan rebels and news of the assassination of a former Gaddafi minister in Vienna.
Play video "Hillary Clinton 'Sensitive' Emails"
Video: Hillary Clinton 'Sensitive' Emails
The last one was sent 28 August, 2012 - two weeks before the Benghazi attack.
Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs Clinton, said the Democratic presidential candidate had given the department "all emails in her possession from Mr Blumenthal".
He said he could not explain where the origin of the additional correspondence Mr Blumenthal had provided in response to a subpoena.
Mrs Clinton - the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential election - has faced strong criticism that she flouted record-keeping and transparency rules by using a private email account for her work.
The private address was connected to a server in her home.
Mrs Clinton has insisted she used the private account for convenience and has broken no rules. The account was revealed in March, more than two years after she stepped down as the top US diplomat.
Trey Gowdy, the Republican congressman who heads the select committee investigating the Benghazi attack, said the incomplete email record "raises serious questions".
He said: "This has implications far beyond Libya, Benghazi and our committee's work.
"This conclusively shows her email arrangement with herself, which was then vetted by her own lawyers, has resulted in an incomplete public record."
In March, Mrs Clinton said that she had given the State Department all the emails she sent and received that "could possibly be work-related".
She said the 30,490 emails she handed over in December included all those that referred to Libya or Benghazi, along side work-related correspondence from "long-time friends".
She said that after those emails were copies, all her correspondence - including another 30,000 that were deemed personal - were deleted from the server.
It comes after an Islamic-State militant thought to have been involved in the attack in Benghazi was reportedly killed in a drone strike in Iraq last week.
Four Americans, including US ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed during the attack on the US outpost in Benghazi on 11 September 2012.

The pictures have emerged as witnesses described how he was "very, very calm" when he opened fire on holidaymakers after emerging from the sea.
Tourists also told how Tunisian builders threw bags of cement and bricks at Rezgui from the top of buildings as he fired his weapon in nearby streets.
Others described how Tunisians pleaded with the killer "why are you killing these people?" - but he just sneered and walked on.

"He was very, very calm - he then attacked one woman shooting her dead immediately.
"He then shot other individuals we are told and began spraying into the beach area which had a lot of people."

"Afterwards, after he'd been in, he came out and he walked now along the beach, which was full of people who had come to see what had happened and disappeared up a side road.
"He walked past a number of Tunisians who said to him 'why are you killing these people, why are you killing these people?'.
"He basically sneered at them and said 'well I'm not killing you' and basically walked on past them.

Ramsay said it is believed the shooting lasted between 30 and 35 minutes.

Family Flees $1.3m Home Over 'Watcher' Threats
Creepy letters about "young blood" and asking "have they found what is in the walls?" scare the family from their New Jersey home.
11:25, UK, Friday 26 June 2015
The family received threatening letters shortly after buying the $1.3m home
Share by email
A New Jersey couple has sued the people who sold them a $1.3m house after they claim a series of threatening letters from a stalker called "The Watcher" forced them to leave the property.
According to the lawsuit, the family began receiving creepy messages from "The Watcher" three days after they had bought their new home in Westfield.
It claims the previous owners of the house had also received letters from the stalker but failed to disclose it during the sale in the summer of 2014.
The letters read: "Why are you here? I will find out. My grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is now my time.
The couple never moved into the property because of the letters
"Do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Once I know their names I will call to them and draw them to me. I asked the [prior owners] to bring me young blood.
"Have they found what is in the walls yet? In time they will. I am pleased to know your names and the names now of the young blood you have brought to me."
The letters also asked "will the young bloods play in the basement?" and asked to know "who has the rooms facing the street?"
The family found the letters so disturbing, they never moved into the property, NJ.com reported.
The lawsuit, filed at Superior Court in Elizabeth, reads: "Upon information and belief, defendants suppressed all information regarding 'The Watcher' even though they were either on constructive or actual notice of the harm that could befall the plaintiffs and their minor children.
"Both [former owners] knew or should have known that 'peace of mind' and 'security' were and are of paramount importance to the plaintiffs, specifically and in general as is true to the high end market to whom defendants were marketing the home for sale."
Westfield Township Mayor Andrew Skibitsky told a public council hearing that an "exhaustive investigation" had been carried out into the threatening letters.
No suspect has been identified and no charges have been filed in the case.

Footage has emerged showing terrified people running away amid the terror attack in Tunisia.
The mobile phone video, filmed from the balcony of the Hotel Imperial Marhaba, captures the confusion and panic amid the attack.
People can be seen fleeing as gunshots ring out in the background.
"They're here, they're here," a voice is heard saying in the video, shot by holidaymaker Matthew Kenyon.
In the attack on Friday, a gunman disguised as a tourist opened fire at a Tunisian hotel with a rifle he had hidden in an umbrella, killing 38 people and injuring scores of others.

A deal has been struck to relocate tens of thousands of migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece to other EU states.
The deal, made by EU leaders in Brussels, will see member states share the burden of 40,000 migrants who have crossed theMediterranean.
However, there will be no mandatory quotas for countries, and Britain's opt-out on EU home affairs issues means it is not obliged to take part.
New figures from UNHCR- the UN refugee agency - reveal that 63,000 migrants have arrived in Greece by sea this year and 62,000 in Italy.
After late-night talks at the European Council summit, president Donald Tusk said: "Leaders agreed that 40,000 persons in need will be relocated from Greece and Italy to other states over the next two years.

"Interior ministers will finalise the scheme by the end of July."
The deal came amid chaos at Calais as hundreds of migrants boarded queuing lorries this week during French ferry worker strike action.
David Cameron described the situation as "totally unacceptable" and called for the French and British authorities to work together.
One of the lorry drivers who regularly makes the crossing to Dover says it has been a nightmare in recent weeks.

"Wednesday was the worst it's been. The migrants were everywhere, trying to get into lorries, and it was chaos," Dave Currie told Sky News.
"It felt like being in Beirut or somewhere."
MrCurriesaid it can be intimidating at times when desperate migrants try to get into the lorries.
But he said sometimes it is quiet and there is little interaction as police are out in large numbers.

The gunman in the Tunisian attack was not on a terror watch list, but may have been radicalised by extremist preachers about six months ago, according to security officials.
Seifeddine Rezgui was an aviation student from Gaafour  a town approximately 100 miles from Sousse, where 38 people were killed when he withdrew a Kalashnikov from a beach umbrella and began shooting at foreigners, most of them British.
He had been dressed like any other tourist, wearing dark shorts, a T-shirt and a necklace  and it is estimated his rampage lasted for seven minutes before he was shot dead by police outside the hotel.
Rezgui, who was in his early 20s, had never travelled abroad in his lifetime, prompting fears that he was radicalised at home, potentially at a local mosque.
His family said they had seen no signs that he had been drawn to the extremism of Islamic State - although he apparently been traumatised by his brother's death in a lightning strike in 2010.

One English tourist who was leaving Tunisia said: "It was horror what we saw, he was killing in an incredible way. It was clear he knew the hotel, he was everywhere.
"There was no sign he was an extremist, he just looked like a normal young man."
A waiter who was at the scene when the attack unfolded added: "I was on the beach when he started shooting. We got everyone back towards the hotel, but he followed us."

Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid described Rezgui as a "good student" who was always attending classes  and other accounts have emerged of a young man who liked partying.
More than 3,000 Tunisians are believed to be fighting for IS and other extremist groups in Iraq, Libya and Syria  with some militants warning they would return to their homeland to launch a terrorist attack.
