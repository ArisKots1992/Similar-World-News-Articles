The right of same-sex couples to marry is the biggest of five cases still to be decided by the Supreme Court.
The justices gave the Obama administration big victories Thursday, in upholding a key part of the health care overhaul and the use of a potent tool to fight housing discrimination. The justices will take the bench again Friday to hand down more opinions. They should finish their work by early next week.
In rare instances, the court will put off decisions and order a case to be argued again in the next term.
This is also the time of the year when a justice could announce a retirement. But no justice, including 82-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has given any hint that retirement is imminent.
A look at the cases that remain:
Gay marriage: Same-sex couples want the court to declare that gay and lesbian couples can marry anywhere in the United States. Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee are asking the court to uphold bans on same-sex marriage and allow the political process, not the courts, to handle major societal changes. Same-sex couples can marry in 36 states.
Lethal injection: Death-row inmates in Oklahoma are objecting to the use of the sedative midazolam in lethal-injection executions after the drug was implicated in several botched executions. Their argument is that the drug does not reliably induce a coma-like sleep that would prevent them from experiencing the searing pain of the paralytic and heart-stopping drugs that follow sedation.
Independent redistricting commissions: Roughly a dozen states have adopted independent commissions to reduce partisan politics in drawing congressional districts. The case from Arizona involves a challenge from Republican state lawmakers who complain that they can't be completely cut out of the process without violating the Constitution.
Mercury emissions: Industry groups and Republican-led states assert that environmental regulators overstepped their bounds by coming up with expensive limits on the emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from power plants without taking account of the cost of regulation at the start of the process. The first-ever limits on mercury emissions, more than a decade in the making, began to take effect in April.
Repeat offenders: The court is considering whether a catchall provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act, which gives longer prison terms to people with at least three prior violent felony convictions, is so vague that it sweeps in relatively minor crimes.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP)  Alaska emergency crews will attempt Friday to recover the remains of eight cruise ship passengers and a pilot who were killed when their sightseeing plane crashed in a remote and rugged area of southeastern Alaska.
Wind and rain prevented any recovery after the wreckage of the aircraft was found Thursday against a granite rock face, 800 feet above a lake.
There was no immediate indication of why the DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter turboprop went down, killing the nine people during the sightseeing excursion. No names have been released.
Clint Johnson, head of the National Transportation Safety Board's Alaska office, said it was too soon to know circumstances of the crash, including whether the plane flew into the cliff.
The NTSB was assembling a high-level team to investigate the crash, including three members from Alaska and at least two people from Washington, D.C.
"The initial rescue crew that went in had a very tough time because of the terrain," Johnson said. "It's a very steep, mountainous area, and weather conditions caused them to stand down."
The Holland America Line cruise ship Westerdam sits in dock in Ketchikan, Alaska, on Thursday, June 
He earlier confirmed the deaths: "''We have nine fatalities."
Coast Guard Petty Officer Lauren Steenson said the agency received a report around 2:15 p.m. that the plane was overdue. Troopers said an emergency locator transmitter activated in the Misty Fjords National Monument, and a helicopter pilot spotted the downed aircraft above Ella Lake, about 800 miles southeast of Anchorage.
Promech Air, an airline based in Ketchikan, operated the shore excursion sold through Holland America Line, the cruise ship company said in a statement. The eight passengers were guests on the Westerdam, which is on a seven-day cruise that departed Seattle on Saturday.
"We are incredibly distressed by this situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with those onboard the plane and their families," the statement said. "Holland America Line is extending its full support to traveling companions of the guests involved."
Promech said that the crash happened about 11:20 a.m., and the plane was one of five Otter aircraft in its fleet.
"There is nothing I can say that can alleviate the pain and overwhelming sense of loss that we and the loved ones of those affected are feeling," Marcus Sessoms, president of Promech Air, said in a statement. "At this moment, all of us share the pain and anguish of this terrible event.  Our thoughts and our prayers go out to everyone touched by this tragedy."
The Ketchikan Daily News reported the Westerdam had been scheduled to leave the city at 1 p.m., but it remained in port Thursday evening.
The airline's website advertises tours of the 2-million-acre Misty Fjord National Monument in its float planes.
"Towering granite cliffs, 1,000-foot waterfalls, lush and remote valleys and serene crystalline lakes make up this incredible landscape," it says.

A supporter of the Affordable Care Act celebrates after the Supreme Court up held the law in the 6-3
By James Oliphant
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Infuriated by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that kept President Barack Obamas healthcare program intact, conservative activists and Republican presidential candidates vowed on Thursday to make the role of the high court a central issue in the 2016 presidential election.
Conservative ire was trained particularly on Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion that preserved the subsidy regime underpinning the Affordable Care Act, even though another Republican appointee, Justice Anthony Kennedy, also voted with the majority.
Roberts, who was appointed to the court by Republican President George W. Bush, has voted with court conservatives on many landmark cases, including ones involving campaign-finance laws and voting rights.  But he also enraged opponents of the Affordable Care Act three years ago when he cast a deciding vote in rejecting a different legal challenge to the law.
Hes let down the [conservative] movement, said Curt Levey of the Committee for Justice, which advocates for conservative judicial nominees. He may feel he has no obligation to the movement.
Some conservatives have been skeptical of Roberts from the start, saying he was maddeningly opaque about his judicial philosophy during his 2005 Senate confirmation hearings. Roberts had spent only about two years  as a federal appeals court judge, which meant a sparse paper trail illuminating his judicial philosophy.

In opening remarks during his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate judiciary committee in 2005, Roberts spoke neutrally, noting that "Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain things in exchange for votes" and vowing to "confront every case with an open mind."
We wanted to be supportive, but there were these nagging doubts, said Carrie Severino, policy director of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. You cant assume someone is going to go south, but it appears the concerns were warranted. Its what happens when you nominate someone who doesnt have a clear record.
Levey said that the pressure will now fall on Republican presidential hopefuls to spell out in detail their views on court appointments - and simple generalities about being faithful to the letter of the U.S. Constitution wont cut it.
It might have been enough before today for presidential candidates to spout the usual things about appointing someone who interprets rather than writes the law. I think youll have to say more now, he said. Each candidate will have to do something to show the base how they will avoid appointing another Roberts.
Mark Levin, a frequent critic of the court who heads the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation, said Republican senators, too, will need to take their responsibility far more seriously and much more aggressively scrutinize these nominees.
Beyond that, Jay Sekulow, a prominent conservative lawyer who has argued a dozen cases before the high court, suggested that the healthcare ruling will prompt a debate on the presidential campaign trail over the justices proper function. What the court said that is that if legislation is written poorly, we can fix it, he said. Thats very different from the traditional role of the court.
Indeed, some Republican candidates were scathing Thursday in their assessment of the decision. Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, termed it an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny. Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, accused the high court of usurping the role of Congress. Unelected judges have once again become legislators, and bad ones at that, he said.
In that vein, the ruling, along with a decision on the legality of same-sex marriage bans that could come as early as Friday, could hand Republicans a twin-barreled weapon with which to galvanize conservative voters into action. Four years ago, conversely, it was Democrats who made a Supreme Court ruling a centerpiece of their election message, blasting the courts decision in the Citizens United case, which opened the door for massive corporate campaign expenditures.
Obamas successor, whether Republican or Democrat, could play an outsized role in shaping the future of the court, said Severino. The next president could replace Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg or possibly [Justices] Kennedy and Scalia, she said. It would be World War III in terms of the amount of influence that president would have.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - South Carolina will take a step forward in healing the wounds of last week's mass shooting when President Barack Obama arrives on Friday to deliver the eulogy for the pastor of the historic church where the attack took place.
Reverend Clementa Pinckney, a widely admired state senator and pastor of Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, was among the nine people who died when a gunman opened fire during Bible study.
The massacre has sparked an intense dialogue across the southern United States over the legacy of slavery and its symbols, centering on the Civil War-era battle flag of the Confederacy.
Addressing the shooting last week, Obama said it raised questions "about a dark part of our history."
Nicknamed "Mother Emanuel," the Gothic Revival-style house of worship is the oldest A.M.E. church in the southeastern United States, and was founded by slaves.

In an unusual step, Obama will be accompanied by both First Lady Michele Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for the funeral in a Charleston college arena. All three knew Pinckney personally.
During his presidency, Obama has spoken at half a dozen memorial services for victims of mass shootings in Texas, Arizona, Colorado and Connecticut.
"Ive had to make statements like this too many times," a visibly upset Obama said from the White House last week. "Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times."
Obama repeated previous calls he has made for tougher gun laws, a politically thorny issue in the United States where the constitution guarantees the right to own guns.
"At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesnt happen in other places with this kind of frequency," he said.

Married with two children, Pinckney was a talented orator with a baritone voice and began preaching at 13. A Democrat, at 23 he became the youngest African-American in South Carolina history to be elected to the state legislature.
Several thousand turned out on Thursday evening for Pinckney's wake at Emanuel, the line of mourners stretching for three blocks, including 200 college fraternity brothers, friends, politicians and members of the public, both black and white.
"I cried when I got here," said Katharine Moseley, a Texas bus driver who drove 20 hours from Austin. "I was raised in the A.M.E. church."
Lutheran bishop Mike Rhyne also drove down with his wife and three children from central Pennsylvania to pay tribute to his friend and fellow seminary student. "He was one of the best men I have ever met," he said.
Pinckney's high school friends Kevin Riley, 41, and Lachandra Colbert, 42, traveled from Maryland for the funeral. "We wouldn't miss this. He was our classmate," said Riley. "He was on track to be someone really important," Riley added.

Mourners universally echoed the words of forgiveness by relatives of their slain churchgoers for the white man, Dylann Roof, accused of the murders.
"We are not the ones to judge, we leave that to God," said Maxine Frasier Riley, 65, a retired school guidance counselor.
The Department of Justice has opened a hate crime investigation into the shooting.
Roof posed with the Confederate flag in photos posted online and allegedly made racist remarks to his victims as he opened fire.
In the aftermath of the slayings, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and other Republicans have called for the flag's removal from the State House grounds, saying it is divisive.
The controversy has spread across the country, with politicians adding to voices clamoring for the removal of Confederate symbols and names, and major retailers removing merchandise with Confederate images from stores and websites.

Supporters of the Affordable Care Act celebrate after the Supreme Court up held the law in the 6-3 vote
By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a conservative legal challenge that could have doomed President Barack Obama's healthcare law, upholding nationwide tax subsidies crucial to his signature domestic policy achievement.
Obama strode into the White House Rose Garden after the ruling to declare that the law known as Obamacare is working, helping millions of Americans afford health insurance who otherwise would have none, and that it is "here to stay."
Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, wrote in the 6-3 ruling that Congress clearly intended for the tax subsidies that help millions of low- and moderate-income people afford private health insurance to be available in all 50 states.
The court decided that the law did not restrict the subsidies to states that establish their own online health insurance exchanges, as the challengers in the case contended.
"Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Roberts wrote, adding nationwide availability of the credits is required to "avoid the type of calamitous result that Congress plainly meant to avoid."

Roberts was joined by fellow conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy and the court's four liberal members in a ruling that may ensure Obamacare becomes a lasting element of the nation's social programs.
The ruling means the current system will remain in place, with subsidies available nationwide. If the challengers had won, at least 6.4 million people in at least 34 states would have lost subsidies worth an average of $272 per month.
It marked the second time in three years the high court ruled against a major challenge to the law brought by conservatives. Both rulings were written by Roberts. Unlike the 2012 case, in which the court was split 5-4, Kennedy joined Roberts in the majority this time.
The law was passed by Obama's fellow Democrats in Congress in 2010 over the unified opposition of Republicans, who have fought it since its inception.
Republicans will keep attacking Obamacare in Congress and on the 2016 presidential election campaign trail to energize right-wing voters and raise money, but little chance exists of the law being rolled back before the end of Obama's presidency in January 2017, political analysts said.
Supporters of the Affordable Care Act celebrate after the Supreme Court up held the law in the 6-3 v
Obama said the law has been "woven into the fabric of America."
"After more than 50 votes in Congress to repeal or weaken this law, after a presidential election based in part on preserving or repealing this law, after multiple challenges to this law before the Supreme Court, the Affordable Care Act is here to stay," Obama added.
The question before the justices was whether a four-word phrase in the expansive law saying subsidies are available to those buying insurance on exchanges "established by the state" has been correctly interpreted by the administration to allow subsidies to be available nationwide.
The exchanges are online marketplaces that allow consumers to shop among competing insurance plans.
Roberts wrote that although the conservative challengers' arguments about the plain meaning of the statute were "strong,' the "context and structure of the act compel us to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase."

SCALIA DISSENTS
After Chief Justice Roberts announced the decision from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia read for 11 minutes from his dissenting opinion inside the court's white marble and crimson-draped setting.
Scalia said the statute's words were clear, that Congress wanted to limit the credits to the state exchanges. Scalia recalled the court's 2012 decision upholding the law, again over his dissent.
"We really should start calling the law SCOTUScare," Scalia said. SCOTUS is the acronym for the Supreme Court of the United States.
"This court has no free-floating power to rescue Congress from its drafting mistakes," Scalia added.

Roberts, sitting next to him on the bench, sat stone-faced. He smiled slightly at the SCOTUScare line, but otherwise betrayed no emotion.
Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined Scalia's dissent.
The Obama administration said 16.4 million previously uninsured people have gained health insurance since the law was enacted. There are currently around 26 million Americans without health insurance, according to government figures.
"This is not about the Affordable Care Act as legislation, or Obamacare as a political football. This is healthcare in America," Obama said.
Congressional Republicans vowed to continue efforts to repeal Obamacare despite appeals from Democrats for them to stop.
The top two congressional Republicans denounced the law on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnnell said it makes life "miserable" for many people it purports to help. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called it "fundamentally broken."
The U.S. hospital industry breathed a collective sigh of relief on Thursday and investors cheered that the growing number of paying customers created by Obamacare would not disappear.
The ruling sparked a broad rally in shares of health insurers with an especially heavy stampede into hospital operators, which were seen as being at particular risk of facing steep losses had the subsidies been struck down.
Shares of hospital chain Tenet Healthcare surged 12.2 percent to rank as the biggest gainer for the day in the S&amp;P 500. Four other hospital operators' shares hit lifetime highs: Community Health Systems, HCA Holdings, Universal Health Services and Lifepoint Health, with gains ranging from 7.6 percent to nearly 13 percent.
Conservatives have called Obamacare a government overreach and "socialized medicine" and launched a series of legal challenges.
The current case started as a long-shot by conservative lawyers opposed to law. Financed by a libertarian Washington group called the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the lawyers recruited four people from Virginia as plaintiffs. The lead plaintiff was a self-employed limousine driver named David King.
The plaintiffs said they were "deeply disappointed" with the ruling. The law "unfairly restricts the health insurance choices of millions of people, and it threatens their jobs as well," they added.
The case is King v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-114.

        <MainBody>LOSER: JAHLIL OKAFOR
Former Duke center Jahlil Okafor appeared to be the biggest competition for Kentucky forward Karl-Anthony Towns for the top pick in the draft. It was projected that if Okafor wasn't selected by Minnesota, that the Los Angeles Lakers would take him with the second overall pick.
Minnesota took Towns as expected. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak, however, never made Okafor a draft promise for good reason. Kupchak was quietly enamored with Ohio State guard D'Angelo Russell and selected him second.
Okafor ended up with the rebuilding Sixers with the third pick. Okafor was the best talent on the board and a surprise option for Philadelphia. Even so, the Sixers have drafted a center for the third year in a row after taking Nerlens Noel and still-injured Joel Embiid the past two seasons.
When asked how the Sixers can make it work with three young centers, Okafor said: "I don't know. It's not my job to figure out. I'll go there and work as hard as I can."
WINNER: MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
The T'wolves filled their biggest roster need by taking Towns with the first overall pick. He joins an intriguing group of young teammates that includes 2015 Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins , 2015 dunk champion Zach LaVine , injury-plagued guard Ricky Rubio , center Gorgui Dieng and forward Shabazz Muhammad . Minnesota also acquired the draft rights to Duke point guard Tyus Jones , a Minneapolis native who was the 2015 NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player.
Towns should be the next great power forward in T'wolves history after Kevin Garnett and Kevin Love . He also has the challenge of trying to get Minnesota to the postseason for the first time since 2004.
"That's going to be the main goal of the season for me, making the playoffs," Towns said.

LOSER: SACRAMENTO KINGS
The Sacramento Kings have had one of the least memorable weeks in franchise history, which is very hard to accomplish. Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski reported that coach George Karl would like All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to be traded. New general manager Vlade Divac and owner Vivek Ranadive maintain they don't want to trade Cousins. A disgruntled Cousins was not dealt on draft night but could be later, a source said. The Lakers had talks with the Kings leading up to the draft.
The biggest need in recent years for the Kings has been a point guard. Sacramento passed on All-Rookie Team point guard Elfrid Payton a year ago in the draft. On Thursday, the Kings had a chance to select perhaps the best true point guard in the draft in Emmanuel Mudiay with the sixth pick. Sacramento, however, passed because Divac said Mudiay refused to work out for the Kings. The Kings took Kentucky forward-center Willie Cauley-Stein instead.
Mudiay "refused to come here and work out and I just felt I didn't know him enough to make that very important decision," Divac told reporters in Sacramento.
Back in 2009, there was a talented point guard prospect who refused to work out for the Warriors, but former general manager Larry Harris drafted him seventh overall anyway. The point guard's name was Stephen Curry.
WINNER: PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS
It appears that Blazers free agent LaMarcus Aldridge has played his last game in Portland. The San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers are the front-runners to land the All-Star, a source told Yahoo Sports. The Dallas native is also expected to have interest from the Dallas Mavericks.
That's not good news for the Blazers. But in preparation for the expected departure, they acquired two forwards in trades: Mason Plumlee from the Brooklyn Nets; and Noah Vonleh from the Charlotte Hornets.
The Blazers acquired Plumlee and the draft rights to Notre Dame guard Pat Connaughton for the draft rights of Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and guard Steve Blake. Plumlee averaged 11.8 points and 7.6 rebounds in 45 games as a starter last season. Vonleh, acquired on Wednesday, was the ninth pick of last year's draft and was limited to 25 games primarily because of injury. Plumlee and Vonleh don't combine to be Aldridge by any means, but at least Blazers general manager Neil Olshey is being proactive.
LOSER: KEVON LOONEY
Former UCLA forward Kevon Looney entered the draft with two major red flags: a hip injury and sports asthma. While Looney was projected to be middle to late first-round pick, it's inevitable that such issues would hurt one's status. Even so, Looney was one of 20 prospects selected for the draft's green room with a late invitation from the NBA.
Late in the first round, however, Looney, his family and his agent Todd Ramasar abruptly departed from the room for the depths of the Barclays Center when the forward's prospects looked in doubt. But once Looney and his family received word that the champion Golden State Warriors were selecting him with the 30th and final pick of the first round, they rushed back to the green room to sit down and enjoy the once-in-a-lifetime moment in front of the TV cameras. After the Warriors' pick was announced, Looney hugged his family but turned his back on his agent who reached out to him.
Chalk this up to a tough and emotional night for the 19-year-old, who has a reputation as a good person.
WINNER: SATNAM SINGH BHAMARA
Satnam Singh Bhamara became the first Indian-born player to be drafted in the NBA when the Dallas Mavericks took him with the 52nd overall pick in the second round. The mammoth 7-foot-2, 290-pounder heard of his selection while sitting in the stands. He is considered a big project who will likely begin his career with the Mavericks' NBA Development League Texas Legends.

Done
NEW YORK  There might not have been a promise in place , but there's no longer any question that Flip Saunders sees immense, franchise-changing promise in the 6-foot-11-inch, 250-pound frame of Karl-Anthony Towns . The Minnesota Timberwolves head coach and president of basketball operations removed any lingering doubt on Thursday night, selecting the former University of Kentucky big man with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
[ Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]
"For me, I'm just blessed to be in this opportunity to just show that a boy from Piscataway, N.J., and the Dominican Republic can make it," Towns said during his post-selection press conference. "I'm blessed to be in this situation, to be in this seat talking to all of you. It just means the world that I'm going to be able to show kids around the world that with a little hard work, determination, a little bit of luck and some guidance, you can really make it far in this world."
To be fair, there wasn't very much lingering doubt about Towns. The 19-year-old had long been considered one of the top prospects in the class of 2015. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.3 blocks and 1.1 assists in 21.1 minutes per game at Kentucky, playing comparatively limited minutes for an insanely deep squad that won its first 38 games before falling to Wisconsin in the Final Four.
Even while surrounded by stars in Lexington, Towns stood out as something special in the making, earning a slew of honors during his lone collegiate season  SEC Freshman of the Year, an All-SEC First Team nod, an All-American Second Team selection  and joining the likes of Duke center Jahlil Okafor and Ohio State guard D'Angelo Russell in the running for the No. 1 spot. As the pre-draft process progressed, though, Towns separated himself from even his future-star peers.
Talent evaluators grew increasingly enamored with Towns' immediate and evident gifts on the defensive end, where he proved capable under John Calipari of stalling pick-and-rolls in space, defending the rim in the paint and cleaning the defensive glass. And as the workouts wore on, the videos kept coming, with Towns comfortably stepping out to the perimeter with a smooth touch that pairs well with the interior game he showed with the Wildcats.
Suddenly, a clearer, more expansive and far more enticing picture began to emerge. When you stepped back and took a look, you saw something that seemed an awful lot like the ideal power forward/center for the state of NBA play in 2015.
Towns topped many mock drafts even before May's draft lottery, which saw the Wolves win the No. 1 pick for the first time in franchise history, their reward for finishing a Western Conference-worst 16-66 in a down and dismal 2014-15 campaign. While Saunders was reportedly enamored of the polished low-post game of Duke's Okafor, he ultimately preferred the opportunity to pair Towns' two-way potential with that of reigning Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins , the No. 1 pick in last year's draft , to lead Minnesota into the future alongside playmaking point guard Ricky Rubio , electric skywalking swingman Zach LaVine and a group of young complementary pieces on a Wolves team that could soon be ready to run.
Towns steps into a high-profile frontcourt spot previously occupied by the likes of franchise legend and future Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett , who returned to Minnesota at last year's trade deadline and whose status for next season remains unclear, and former All-Star Kevin Love , whom Saunders traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers last summer in a blockbuster deal that returned Wiggins and 2013 No. 1 pick Anthony Bennett . The young fella's got some pretty big shoes to fill. It's a good thing he's got pretty big feet .
"The craziest thing about those two power forwards, I think you can see some resemblance of me in both of them," Towns recently told Yahoo Sports NBA columnist Marc J. Spears . "They've shown how effective they were in Minnesota. I'm trying to make my own stamp."
One thing's for sure  Towns won't lack for confidence as he sets about the work of giving the Twin Cities faithful a winning team to support after 10 straight sub-.500 seasons, no playoff berths since 2004 and just one trip past the opening round of the playoffs in the franchise's 26-year history.
"It doesn't matter to me where I play," Towns recently told Jon Krawczynski of The Associated Press . "It matters what you do at the place you play at. It doesn't matter how successful or how unsuccessful a team is. It can all change with one pick."
Saunders, the rest of the Timberwolves brass and fans across Minnesota are banking on Towns being that one pick.
"That's going to be the main goal of the season for me, making the playoffs," Towns said Thursday. "[...] We're going to work real hard right now in the summer, get everything straight, and we're going to make sure that we go into the season with the best possible team, with the best mindset, and go out there and try to win and make it to the playoffs."

WASHINGTON (AP)  The State Department cannot find in its records all or part of 15 work-related emails from Hillary Rodham Clinton's private server that were released this week by a House panel investigating the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, officials said Thursday.
The emails all predate the Sept. 11 assault on the U.S. diplomatic facility and include scant words written by Clinton herself, the officials said. They consist of more in a series of would-be intelligence reports passed to her by longtime political confidant Sidney Blumenthal, the officials said.
Nevertheless, the fact that the State Department says it can't find them among emails she provided surely will raise new questions about Clinton's use of a personal email account and server while secretary of state and whether she has provided the agency all of her work-related correspondence, as she claims.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, released a statement Thursday saying, "This confirms doubts about the completeness of Clinton's self-selected public record and raises serious questions about her decision to erase her personal server  especially before it could be analyzed by an independent, neutral third-party arbiter."
When asked about the discrepancy, Nick Merrill, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said, "She has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."
Clinton is running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.
Clinton's use of the non-governmental email while in office was not publicly disclosed until earlier this year, after the committee sought her correspondence related to the Benghazi attack. She says the single account for personal and professional purposes was a matter of convenience, and says all her work emails were included in the 55,000 pages of documents she later handed over to the State Department. Emails of a personal nature were destroyed, she says.
The State Department informed the Select Benghazi Committee on Thursday that they are no longer certain that's the case, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The officials said Julia Frifield, the assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, confirmed that nine emails and parts of six others that the committee made public Monday couldn't be located in the department's records.
As for 46 other, previously unreleased Libya-related Blumenthal emails published by the committee, officials said all are in the department's records. They weren't handed over to congressional investigators because they had no relevance to events in Benghazi and did not correspond to the committee's request, the officials said. The officials added that they are willing to provide emails outside the committee's initial request, but warned that doing so would require more time.
The emails missing from the State Department's records include missives from Blumenthal in which he sends media accounts about the killing of one of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi's sons, various reports on internal politics among Libya's rebels and news of the assassination of a former Gadhafi minister in Vienna. The last email was sent Aug. 28, 2012, two weeks before the Benghazi attack, and none focus particularly on the eastern Libyan city.
Clinton's responses are brief. In one from August 2011, she tells Blumenthal she will be in Paris the next day to meet rebel leaders and says she had "to resort to new iPad" because she didn't have electricity or Blackberry coverage after Hurricane Irene.
In another from March 2012, she passes on an adviser's skepticism regarding one of Blumenthal's reports about political intrigue in post-Gadhafi Libya, saying: "This strain credulity based on what I know. Any other info about it?"
And after a long August 2012 note from Blumenthal about Libya's new interim President Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, Clinton writes: "Another keeper  thanks and please keep 'em coming." Four days later, she responds to a follow-up reports about el-Magariaf, saying: "Fascinating. I had a very good call w him."
Clinton's critics are likely to focus less on the substance of the emails than on the fact that they weren't shared with the State Department.
Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, has pressed for an explanation of why Blumenthal gave the committee emails not previously shared by the State Department. The suggestion has been that either the department or Clinton was hiding something.
Gowdy said Thursday that the emails show Clinton "was soliciting and regularly corresponding with Sidney Blumenthal  who was passing unvetted intelligence information about Libya from a source with a financial interest in the country. It just so happens these emails directly contradict her public statement that the messages from Blumenthal were unsolicited."
Clinton aides say her submission to the department included all emails from Blumenthal and a dozen more exchanges that weren't in the records he provided the House committee. They said some from Blumenthal's record, which was provided as a Microsoft Word document, couldn't be confirmed as having been sent as emails.
State Department officials also questioned the provenance of some exchanges because they weren't formatted as emails.

        <MainBody>Complete interview
By Katie Brinn and Andrew Rothschild
He introduces himself as Sonny Moore, but to his millions of young fans, hes Skrillex  one of the biggest names in electronic dance music (EDM). Since he first found success as an EDM DJ and producer in 2011, Skrillex has collected six Grammys, 19 million Facebook fans and an estimated $20 million  all while giving away most of his music for free.
And at just 27 years old  an age he characterizes as not young  he says he has no plans of slowing down. The EDM prodigy is churning out new collaborations with superstars both inside and outside his genre, testing the limits of his craft  and his fan base  with every new innovation.
One of his boldest, and perhaps most polarizing new partners: pop heartthrob Justin Bieber. Moore and fellow EDM DJ Diplo, under the moniker Jack , teamed up with the Biebs in early 2015 to produce the single Where Are  Now. The track quickly shot to the top of mainstream charts, drawing the ire of some EDM fans who were vocal with their criticism that Skrillex was selling out.
Yahoo global news anchor Katie Couric met up with Moore at his studio in downtown L.A. to give him a chance to respond to the criticism and to take a rare, intimate look into the life and career of one of EDMs biggest stars.
Working with Bieber
He was super-polite, Moore says of his first encounter with Justin Bieber at a party at New York Fashion Week earlier this year. The rest was history. Teaming up as Jack , Skrillex and Diplo worked on Biebers a cappella vocal track to make a hit that few of his fans saw coming.
Childhood of music and Scientology
Sporting a hardcore look from an early age, Moore says he is no stranger to being misunderstood. Youre always bullied if youre an emo kid, he admits. But he says his parents were always supportive of his alternative style and his unconventional ambitions.
The family hit a rough patch when Moore learned at age 16 that his parents had adopted him. He says his music helped him get through that period and has helped as he deals with another trial his family is now facing: the recent death of his mother. He talks about his relationship with her, how his family has come together to mourn and how Scientology has long helped his family cope with hardship.
EDM, drugs and that hairdo
Of course, its impossible to ignore the drug culture that goes hand in hand with EDMs rave scene, a scene Skrillex has so helped to define. Some critics, in fact, have linked the rise of Molly to Skrillexs ascent. Though he emphasizes that he would never want to be telling kids how to run their lives, Skrillex insists that he never uses drugs. I wouldnt be able to do 300 shows a year if I was doing drugs, he says.
Amid their conversation, Couric and Skrillex take a phone call from a special guest star, Marshmello, a mysterious EDM newcomer whose identity remains top secret. Until now, fans have even been unsure whether the rising star is a man or a woman.
Before wrapping up their chat, Skrillex gets a chance to comment on the origins of his signature haircut and muse about what his life might look like in 10 years.
Skrillex ft. Katie Couric
Not to outdo Justin Bieber, Skrillex and Couric decide there is room for one more unlikely EDM collaboration. Together, they hit the studio to churn out what could be a pretty sweet hit. Check out the final product.

Paris (AFP) - Protests against ride-booking app Uber turned violent in France on Thursday as taxi drivers set fire to vehicles and blocked major roads.
American rocker Courtney Love was caught up in the demonstrations when a vehicle she was travelling in outside Paris was attacked.
Around 3,000 cabbies took part in the strike, blocking access to the capital's Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, and preventing cars reaching train stations around the country.
Ten people were arrested, seven police officers were injured and 70 vehicles were damaged in clashes between Uber drivers and taxi drivers.
The service, known as UberPOP, has been illegal in France since January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and it continues to operate.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said after meeting taxi drivers' unions following a fraught day: "UberPOP is an illegal service, it must be closed down."
Until that was done, "the vehicles of UberPOP drivers should be systematically impounded when they are openly breaking the law", the minister said.
"Governing the country will never be done by the law of the jungle," Cazeneuve added.
One of the taxi drivers' representatives, Ibrahima Sylla, described the minister's words as "promises, again" and said the drivers were considering continuing the demonstrations.
Love, Kurt Cobain's widow, was caught up in a confrontation near Charles de Gaulle airport.
She tweeted that protesters "ambushed" her vehicle and "were holding our driver hostage".
She appealed to the French president in another message, writing "Francois Hollande where are the fucking police???"

"This is France?? I'm safer in Baghdad," she added.
- Two vehicles torched -
In the most serious incident in Paris, one private chauffeur, who said he did not work for Uber "or any other app" was dragged from his van when he reached a blockade in the west of Paris.
Angry taxi drivers slashed the tyres of his vehicle, smashed a window and then set it and a chauffeur-driven van on fire.
Police eventually fired teargas to break up the protest on the western stretch of the ring road around the capital and cleared burning tyres.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls said during a visit to Colombia that the perpetrators of the "unacceptable" violence "can be found in both camps" and they would be found and prosecuted.
Taxi drivers are furious at what they see as unfair competition from Uber, which puts customers in touch with private drivers at prices lower than those of traditional taxis.
Licensed cabbies say the service is endangering their jobs by flooding the market with low-cost drivers.
One driver said the strikers had been driven to desperation.
"Taxi drivers -- alright, they've got big mouths -- but normally they're not aggressive," said Malia, 50, who has driven a taxi for three years.
"But these guys have families to feed, debts. They've been pushed to the brink."
- Illegal in France -
More peaceful protests took place at transport hubs in other major cities including Bordeaux, Marseille and Toulouse.
Cabbies argued that the disruption was justified.
"UberPOP is banned, but it's still here," cabbie Stephane Molla said in Bordeaux, southwest France.
Cabbies in France, like their colleagues in several other countries, have held several protests against the app -- some of which have turned violent.
On at least two occasions in Strasbourg in eastern France last week, taxi drivers posed as customers in order to lure Uber drivers to isolated spots where they were assaulted by cab drivers and their vehicles damaged.
In Paris, the government tried to strengthen its hand on Wednesday by obtaining a court order banning Uber from operating in the capital, but the company dismissed the move.
"We will fight it (in the courts) and we'll see what happens on appeal. For the time being it changes nothing, UberPOP can continue to operate," the head of Uber France, Thibaud Simphal, told the BFM Business channel.
San Francisco-based Uber, which offers several types of ride-sharing services, claims to have 400,000 UberPOP users in France.
However, its drivers do not pay taxes, do not need to undergo the 250 hours of training mandatory for French cabbies and do not require the same insurance as taxis.

        <MainBody>House completes Obama's trade items as Pacific pact looms

WASHINGTON (AP)  The Republican-led Congress completed President Barack Obama's trade package Thursday, overwhelmingly passing a worker training program just weeks after it was stymied.
The House voted 286 to 138 to renew the job retraining program for workers displaced by international trade. Obama had said he wanted to sign that bill alongside the "fast track" negotiating authority that Congress approved a day earlier.
Usually a Democratic priority, the retraining bill briefly became hostage to Democrats' failed efforts to block fast track.
The House measure also renews the African Growth and Opportunity Act.
Obama and his trade opponents are shifting their focus to proposed trade agreements under negotiation for years. The first, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, involves the United States, Japan, Canada and nine other Pacific-rim nations.
The fast-track law allows Congress to ratify or reject such agreements, but not change or filibuster them.
Most House Democrats, along with major labor unions, opposed fast track, saying free-trade pacts send U.S. jobs abroad.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday's votes mark "the end of phase one" in the trade debate, but "the fight will continue." The next step, she said, is "to shine a sharp, clear, bright light" on details of the Pacific-rim proposal.
Passage of the trade bills mark a huge win for the president, and one paradoxically spearheaded by Republicans. And it's a defeat for the AFL-CIO and unions and environmental groups that fiercely opposed it. Some have vowed to punish the relatively small number of congressional Democrats who opposed them.
But Obama  much like the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton  portrays expanded trade as crucial in a global, high-tech economy. Most Republicans agree, but most congressional Democrats, especially in the House, do not.
Trade has opened the most striking breach between a Democratic president and the lawmakers who overwhelmingly backed him on health care and other hard-fought issues.
Pelosi and fellow House Democrats dealt Obama a humiliating rebuke on June 12, when they derailed his trade package only hours after he traveled to the Capitol to personally ask for their help. The House voted 302-126 that day to reject the job retraining portion of the package. Nearly half the "no" votes came from Democrats.
Republican leaders, with White House support, restructured the legislative package and passed fast track with big GOP margins, plus modest Democratic support.
On Thursday, only six House Democrats voted against the job retraining program. Among Republicans, 132 voted against the program, and 111 voted for it.
Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said some Democrats had questioned Republicans' promises to support the job retraining program even after fast track was secured.
To pass the trade legislation, Ryan, R-Wis., told House colleagues before Thursday's vote, "We needed a little bit of trust. We are here today to keep our word."

        <MainBody>Supreme Court upholds broad housing discrimination claims
By Lawrence Hurley 16 hours ago

The U.S. Supreme Court in Washington. (Gary Cameron/Reuters)
By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday embraced a broad interpretation of discrimination claims allowed under the landmark Fair Housing Act, a blow to lenders and insurers that face such lawsuits and had urged the court to curb them.
In a 5-4 decision in a major civil rights case out of Texas, the court preserved a legal tool that has been used for decades to bring bias lawsuits over actions that have a discriminatory effect even with no evidence of discriminatory intent.
The unexpected ruling was a triumph for civil rights activists, who had feared the justices would rein in these lawsuits, and the administration of President Barack Obama, which had asked the justices to allow such claims to continue.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who often casts the deciding vote in close cases, joined the court's four liberals in the majority.
"By recognizing that laws, policies and practices with unjustified discriminatory effects are inconsistent with the Fair Housing Act, todays decision lends support to hard-working Americans who are attempting to find good housing opportunities for themselves and their families," U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said.
The case involved Inclusive Communities Project Inc, a nonprofit group that claimed Texas violated the law by disproportionately awarding low-income housing tax credits to developers owning properties in poor, minority-dominated neighborhoods. The group works to place low-income tenants in the more wealthy, majority white suburbs of Dallas.
The Texas case was closely watched by lenders and insurance companies, which say they are unfairly targeted. Industry groups say companies use neutral criteria when assessing risk. Based on how the law has been interpreted for decades, lawsuits could be filed over legitimate business practices, they argue.
Although a broad win for civil rights advocates on the legal theory, Kennedy, writing for the court, indicated in the ruling that the Texas plaintiffs ultimately could lose when the case returns to lower courts.
 The court was considering whether the 1968 law allows for "disparate impact" claims in which plaintiffs need to show only the discriminatory effect of a particular practice and not evidence of discriminatory intent. There was no dispute over the law's prohibition on openly discriminatory acts in the sale and rental of housing.
 For decades, disparate impact claims have been a way for lawyers representing blacks and other minorities to target policies that do not directly discriminate yet have the effect of putting certain groups at a disadvantage.
Kennedy wrote that Congress indicated in 1988 when it amended the law that it intended disparate impact claims to be available.
"It permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification," Kennedy added.
Kennedy also made clear there are limits to the types of claims allowed, saying "statistical disparity" alone is not enough. Plaintiffs must "point to a defendant's policy or policies causing that disparity," Kennedy added.

'INEFFECTIVE AND UNFAIR'
The disparate impact theory is opposed by business interests because it allows for a broad range of business decisions related to housing to be subject to civil rights litigation.
"Discrimination has no place in the United States, and the government should be equipped to hold accountable those who practice it. However, disparate impact is ineffective and unfair, and will ultimately harm those it is intended to protect," said David Hirschmann, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.
Hirschmann welcomed what he called "severe limitations" imposed by the court on what kind of claims can be made.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a dissenting opinion that the ruling will "have unfortunate consequences for local government, private enterprise, and those living in poverty."
Alito cited an earlier case in which what he called a city's good faith attempt to fix "deplorable housing conditions" for renters was subjected to a legal challenge under the theory.
 National civil rights groups had tried to keep the issue away from the conservative-leaning high court. In the past three years, two other cases that raised the same question about the scope of fair-housing law were taken up by the high court but settled with the help of the rights groups before the justices could rule.
 Under Chief Justice John Roberts leadership, a five-justice conservative majority previously had curtailed remedies for race discrimination in a series of cases involving federal voting rights, promotion tests for firefighters and integration plans designed to balance out whites and blacks throughout a school district and offset segregated housing.
"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race," Roberts wrote in 2007.
 The case is Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-1371.

NY Prison Escapees May Have Hidden In Hunting Camp

The president responds to the Supreme Court ruling that sided with his administration&amp;#39;s major health care overhaul.

A veteran New York state corrections officer rolled out the red carpet for two convicted murderers who have made a spectacular prison break -- giving them art supplies, tools and access to the catwalks behind the walls of their cell to do electrical work, stunning court documents say.
Gene Palmer, 57, of Dannemora , was arrested Wednesday and hit with promoting prison contraband and tampering with physical evidence, both felonies, and official misconduct, a misdemeanor in connection with the "Shawshank Redemption"-style June 6 escape of Richard Matt and David Sweat from Clinton Correctional Facility .
The veteran officer, who also allegedly inadvertently passed the inmates tools in frozen hamburger meat, appeared at Plattsburgh Town Court Wednesday and did not enter a plea. He was later released from Clinton County Jail after posting $25,000 bail, the jail confirmed.
He was set to be arraigned Thursday.
According to the court documents, Palmer went shopping for art supplies at Michaels in exchange for "elaborate paintings" done by Matt -- which he burned or buried after their escape -- in addition to information about misconduct for other prisoners. He also allegedly let Sweat alter the electrical box in his cell and provided him access to the catwalk behind it.

According to one of the criminal complaints, Palmer, who has 27 years on the force, gave the inmates a flathead screwdriver and needlenose pliers on four occasions between November 2014 to June 6, 2015.
He allegedly gave the inmates the tools in exchange for paintings. Matt, who reportedly painted stunning portraits of celebs , and Sweat were housed in the prison's "Honor Block," which gave well-behaved inmates privileges such as laundry and cooking as well as working as assistants to plumbers and electricians, a source told ABC News .

"I purchased and then provided paint and paint brushes for Richard Matt on two separate occasions," Palmer allegedly told investigators in a statement date June 20. He also described shopping at Michael's in Plattsburgh approximately two years ago for "white zinc paint" and "white titanium paint" as well as "one large tube of acrylic paint" for Sweat, the statement says.
Then on May 29, he said that he received a package from prison worker Joyce Mitchell, who is also accused of helping the inmates, to give to Matt, the statement said.
According to the documents, the package was a "green-colored, woven cloth bag" approximately 12 inches by 5 inches containing more than a pound of frozen hamburger meat.
The beef was packaged in styrofoam with plastic wrap but no price sticker on it, the statements said. There were also allegedly two tubes of paint and a "small, green cloth item."
The next day, he took the package and delivered it to Matt through his cell.

"I cannot remember providing him with anything else," he allegedly said.
Palmer also admitted to allowing Sweat to work on the electrical boxes of the cell by accessing the catwalk behind them "because inmate Matt asked me and I was doing him a favor," he allegedly said.
But he denied knowing the men would escape.
"I did not realize at the time, that the assistance provided to Matt or Sweat made their escape easier," he allegedly told investigators.
He said the electrical work was done "to enhance their ability to cook in their cells," according to the statement.

"Matt provided me with elaborate paintings and information on the illegal acts that inmates were committing within the facility," the statement said. "In turn, I provided him with benefits such as paint, paintbrushes, movement of inmates, hamburger meat, altering of electrical boxes in the catwalk areas."
In the wake of the escape, Palmer allegedly burned some of the paintings in a fire pit at his residence and buried others in the woods.
In an interview, Clinton County DA told ABC News that the pliers were used for the inmates' paintings.
"I'm not attributing those pliers in any manner to the escape," Wylie said.
He also added that bringing Matt and Sweat to the catwalk was "totally inappropriate" unless it was authorized.
Joyce Mitchell Allegedly Passed Tools to NY Prison Play video
Joyce Mitchell, who worked in the prison tailor shop, was accused of putting hacksaw blades, other tools and a screwdriver bit into the meat and then placing it into the shop's freezer, where Palmer would allegedly retrieve it, according to Wylie.
Palmer had been placed on leave, said he didn't know the tools were inside, the DA told ABC News. Mitchell echoed the sentiments, but bringing prisoners food is considered contraband, the DA said.
Matt was serving 25 years to life for kidnapping and beating a man to death in 1997. Sweat was serving life for killing a Broome County Sheriff's deputy.
The men escaped from Clinton Correctional facility, in upstate Dannemora, near the Canadian border, on June 6 in a spectacular breakout akin to that in "Shawshank Redemption."
Sweat and Matt allegedly used power tools to cut through pipes and made their way through a series of catwalks and walls to make it through to the outside where they emerged from a manhole.
They have been on the lam ever since, and despite a series of sightings, police have not been able to catch them.
This week, investigators found prison-issued underwear at a hunting cabin in Owls Head, NY. They also found food and positive DNA samples were confirmed from both suspects.
The time frame was not immediately clear.
Mitchell faces a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor charge of criminal facilitation.
She has pleaded not guilty.
Before the escape she was investigated for having a suspected relationship with Sweat over the course of the past year but not enough evidence was found to take action.
Investigators were also checking Wednesday whether Mitchell may have had sex with other inmates besides Sweat.
Her lawyer, Steve Johnston, denied the allegations.
"On her behalf all I can say is that she has consistently denied having any sexual relationship with inmate Sweat," her attorney Steve Johnston said today in a statement to ABC News.
