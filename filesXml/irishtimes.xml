A former Catholic Archbishop has told the High Court he first had sex with a Nigerian woman in 1989 when she was aged 20 and he was aged 40.
Co Tipperary-born Richard Burke (66) said he later paid sums totalling about  176,000 sought by Dolores Atwood .
He also agreed to have sex with her in an hotel in Canada in 2009 after she asked him to do that when he told her he could not pay her another  200,000 sought by her, he said.
Mr Burke said he felt terrorised by Ms Atwood and feared she would disclose their relationship which would bring disgrace and shame on himself, his family and his ministry.
Mr Burke said he first met Ms Atwood in 1986 or 1987 when she was aged 17 or 18 and he first had sex with her in 1989 when she was aged 20 in his bedroom in Cathedral House in Warri city in Nigeria . He did not know her when she was aged 13 or 14, he said.
He was ordained a Bishop in 1996 and an Archbishop in December 2007, the jury heard.
He was giving evidence in his continuing action alleging he was defamed in the RT Prime Time Investigates Mission to Prey programme of May 23rd 2011. RT denies defamation and has pleaded a defence of truth concerning the content related to Mr Burke.
Today, Mr Burke said he believed he first met Ms Atwood, born in August 1969, about 1986 or 1987 when she came to his office.
Ms Atwood told him she had been a confidante of another priest who was transferred from the cathedral parish about 1986 and soon afterwards was killed in a car accident, he said. He attributed his relationship with her as commencing after that priest was killed.
When his counsel said Ms Atwood told Prime Time about an event that happened when she was about the age of 13 in hospital, he said there was an event in hospital similar to that.
He said the first time he had sex with Ms Atwood was either September or October 1989 and the hospital event was after that. He had sex with her three more times before he returned to Ireland in 1990 and, while he was in Ireland, letters passed between them, he said.
He said Ms Atwood later married and moved to Canada, he believed that was about 1995. He was ordained Bishop of Warri in 1996 and had continuing contact with her between 1996 and 2003.
In 2003, he said she called him asking him to meet her in Lagos and spend three nights in an hotel and give her $4000 in cash, which he did.
Between 2003 and 2005, there was increasing phone contact between them, he said. The phone conversations had been about once a month or every three weeks but increased to between once weekly and ten days and the calls could last one or two hours and sometimes longer.
The calls sometimes became very uneasy and unpleasant for him because she was expressing a feeling for me I could not reciprocate, she was demanding intimacy.
He was devastated when he later learned she had phoned his brother in the family home in Tipperary and also his sister in Dublin.
He said Ms Atwood then phoned him demanding money and he eventually met her in the airport of Halifax in Nova Scotia by appointment in October 2007 and gave her a bank draft for  26,000 which she said was the full amount of all the phone calls.
He was incredibly worried if he did not hand over that money, she would reveal they had an intimate relationship.
He said he received more phone calls from October 2007 from Ms Atwood that were menacing, threatening, aggressive, abusive and demanding. He recorded a call of October 25th 2007 in which she gave him four options and told him to choose one.
One option was they would meet anywhere in the world over the next year any place and be together for at least one week, a minimum five days, and have full sexual intercourse, to be fully and totally intimate.
A second option was to give her  10,000 a year for five years, a third was they would meet somewhere and discuss it and the fourth was they should be together again the way we used to be.
He received another call about 11pm on November 7th 2007 where he was subject to a tirade of abuse from Ms Atwood for about three hours. That arose where he was to meet her in Lagos on November 8th to respond to the four options but she insisted the meeting was to have been on November 7th, he said.
Ms Atwood would not hear his explanation there was a clear arrangement for the 8th, he said.
She unleashed a tirade of abuse, saying he was treading on her and not to do that. That was the first time she mentioned :Youre a paedophile, he said.
Rather than give her  10,000 a year for five years, which was an eternity of prolonging this nightmare, he decided to try and end it once and for all and give her  50,000 in one payment.
She had said as God is my witness, I will never again bring up the matter of intimacy, we will be good friends, intimacy never, never again, he said.
He grabbed onto that phrase, chose the  50,000 payment, arranged to meet her in Dublin at the end of July 2008 and paid her that  50,000 in a bank draft and  5,000 cash.
After about a month, Ms Atwood started phoning again and demanding more money, he said. She was demanding  100,000 which he raised partly from his own and partly from diocesan funds. He met her in London and gave her a bank draft for  90,000 and 10,000 cash, he said.
He paid her because I was simply terrorised and afraid she would reveal we had a relationship when she was 20 and I was 40 which revelation would bring disgrace on himself and his ministry. I was ashamed, I was utterly terrified.
Under cross-examination, he said he regarded himself as someone about whom Ms Atwood had lied and lied extensively about.
Asked what kind of person he is, he said he would say truthful, sincere, generous, available, committed and flawed.
When Paul OHiggins SC said the Prime Time programme was about priests rightly or wrongly said to have abused young people and teenagers, he said that, in his case, it was clearly and unequivocally said that I was a child abuser.
He agreed the RT programme was not the first time the allegations by Ms Atwood had been made public and they had been featured in some newspapers.
The case continues.

Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan has said the Government will closely study todays judgment by the High Court in Belfast on the case of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane .
In a statement issued following Justice Stephens judgment on the legal challenge taken against the British governments decision not to hold a public inquiry into the murder, Mr Flanagan said:
I note this mornings judgement in the judicial review and will be studying it closely.
Kenny to raise British and loyalist collusion with Cameron, Dail told
The Irish Governments position remains unchanged. We continue to believe that an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, in line with the political commitments made by the British and Irish Governments at Weston Park in 2001, should be honoured.
Mr Stephens ruled this morning that British prime minister David Cameron did not act unlawfully when he refused a public inquiry into the murder by loyalists of Mr Finucane.
Delivering his reserved judgment, Mr Justice Stephens said: I uphold that the decision was lawful and accordingly I dismiss that part of the challenge.
In his statement, Mr Flanagan said the Government has consistently raised the matter with the British government.
I raised it most recently with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers on 19 May. Taoiseach Enda Kenny discussed the case with Mr Cameron when they met in London last week, Mr Flanagan added.
My thoughts at this time are with Geraldine Finucane and all the Finucane family, who have campaigned so tirelessly for more than a quarter of a century in pursuit of the full truth in the case of Pat Finucane, including the role of collusion in his murder.

Meath remains believed to be of Samus Wright and Kevin McKee

Two bodies unearthed in a field in Co Meath in a search in Co Meath are now believed to be the those of Samus Wright and Kevin McKee who were abducted and killed by the IRA in the 1970s.
Seamus Wright went missing on October 2nd, 1972. He was married and from Belfast. Kevin McKee was also from Belfast and he disappeared on the same day.
DNA samples from the remains discovered on the site at Coghalstown have been sent for testing and the remains themselves are due to be taken away later on Friday.
More than one body found in dig for Disappeared
The family of Mr Wright have arrived at the scene about 10kms north of Navan and relatives of Mr McKee are expected there shortly.
The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains which has been painstakingly stripping away topsoil from the reclaimed bog since March said the search would continue for the remains of former Cistercian priest Joe Lynskey who the IRA said they killed and buried in the area.
Speaking to the media at the site of the excavation, Commission spokesman Geoff Knupfer said the mood among those present was one of elation and sadness.
He said he believed the discovery of the remains, if established to be MrWright and Mr McKee would bring closure to the families of the men.
The forensic dig at Coghalstown involved the slow examination of more than six hectares of reclaimed bog. A sniffer dog was also brought in late last year to help locate human remains.
All of the disappeared were buried in unmarked graves. Searches have recovered the remains of a number of the disappeared based on information provided since the Belfast Agreement.
A statement issued on behalf of the Lynskey family yesterday said they were grateful to the commission and to those who had engaged with it in the search.
Sinn Fin president Gerry Adams TD welcomed news that remains had been discovered.
The uncertainty over who has been recovered must be hugely traumatic for the families involved. I am sure that the commission will move as speedily as it can to verify the identity of those who have been found, he said.
The list of disappeared includes Gareth OConnor, who was murdered in 2003. His body was recovered on June 11th, 2005 at Victoria Quay, Newry Canal, Co Louth. The commission has investigated 16 abductions and murders.
To date, the remains of 10 of the disappeared have been recovered, the most recent being Brendan Megraw, whose remains were found in Oristown bog, also in Co Meath, last October.
Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald said she hopes the suffering of at least some of the families will now be eased.
The work of the Commission is complex but it is a humanitarian task aimed at ending the suffering of those families brutalised by the disappearance of their loved ones so many years ago, she said.
The Commission will continue its work to find the remains of those who have yet to be found.

Belfast High Court rejects call for Finucane inquiry

The High Court in Belfast has rejected a call by the Finucane family for a decision that would have compelled the British prime minister David Cameron to hold a public inquiry into Pat Finucanes murder.
Lord Justice Stephens in issuing his findings on a judicial review taken by the Finucane family found today that Mr Cameron had not acted unlawfully in refusing to hold a public inquiry into the Belfast solicitors murder.
Mr Finucane was shot dead by a UDA gang in front of his wife Geraldine and family at their north Belfast home in 1989. The British government has apologised and accepted that there was official collusion in his murder but has refused to hold a full-scale public inquiry, as the family has been demanding.
Kenny to raise British and loyalist collusion with Cameron, Dail told
Rather than holding a public inquiry the British government commissioned a review of the murder case by British lawyer Sir Desmond de Silva.
In his 2012 500-page report Sir Desmond reported that there was a significant doubt as to whether Mr Finucane would have been murdered had it not been for the different strands of involvement by elements of the British state.
He found that a series of positive actions by employees of the British state actively furthered and facilitated his murder and there was a relentless effort to defeat the ends of justice in the aftermath of his killing.
My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucanes case has left me in no doubt that agents of the State were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder, it says.
Sir Desmond however said he did not believe there was an over-arching state conspiracy to murder Mr Finucane but that an extraordinary state of affairs was created in which both the British army and the RUC special branch had prior notice of a series of planned UDA assassinations, yet nothing was done to prevent the attacks.
The report said there were three UDA conspiracies to murder Mr Finucane that were known to RUC special branch and or MI5. These were in 1981, 1985 and 1988/89 and on none of these occasions was Mr Finucane warned of the threat against his life.
Mr Cameron said the shocking levels of collusion exposed by the report was unacceptable and apologised to the Finucane family: I am deeply sorry, he said. However, he again ruled out establishing an independent public inquiry.
At the time Mr Finucanes widow Geraldine dismissed the report a as a sham... a whitewash... a confidence trick. She renewed her call for a full public inquiry into her husbands death and said, This report is not the truth.
The family followed up that review by taking the judicial review. Today Lord Justice Stephens ruled against the family on their main call for a public inquiry.
Speaking after the ruling, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Charlie Flanagan said: The Irish Governments position remains unchanged. We continue to believe that an independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, in line with the political commitments made by the British and Irish Governments at Weston Park in 2001, should be honoured.

Grab the sunscreen and air out the swimwear because theres sunshine headed our way and this time its bringing some real heat.
A mini heatwave is set to hit Irish shores next week with Met ireann predicting temperatures in the mid-twenties.
According to the forecaster, temperatures will hit 25 degrees across the country next Wednesday, bringing warm and very humid weather.
The warm weather will move from the continent to Ireland, bringing sunshine and real heat for the first time this summer.
Forecaster Klara Finkele says temperatures will remain in the late teens and early twenties over the weekend and into early next week before the warmer weather rises up from the Bay of Biscay on Wednesday and Thursday.
However, she warns that high levels of humidity will bring a risk of thunderstorms and heavy downpours.
Weather from the Bay of Biscay tends to be quite unstable, its warm and very moisture laden so were certainly going to keep an eye on the rain, said Ms Finkele. Warm air holds more humidity and moisture so it can lead to heavy downpours.
Temperatures over the weekend will be similar to recent days, with bright and mostly dry weather on Saturday that will become cloudy in the afternoon.
Rainfall will spread across the country on Saturday night but will clear on Sunday morning , bringing slightly fresher temperatures of 16-20 degrees.
Monday will be a hazy day with temperatures of 18-20 degrees. The weather will get warmer on Tuesday and temperatures are set to reach 22 degrees.
The real warm weather from the south is due to arrive on Wednesday, bringing temperatures between 20-25 degrees across Ireland.
The United Kingdom is also set to enjoy next weeks warm weather, with a Spanish plume of hot air moving north, bringing temperatures up into the early 30s . France , Italy and Spain have been experiencing particularly hot weather in recent days, with parts of southern Europe on track to break records for June temperatures, according to the Weather Channel.
How to protect your skin from the sun
The Irish Cancer Society has warned people to take care in the sunshine, particularly the elderly and young children.
Parents are advised to dress babies under six months in loose-fitting clothes with long sleeves and to keep them in the shade as much as possible.
Children should wear hats and sun glasses in the sunshine and use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. Sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours.
Adults are also advised to spend time in the shade, wear a hat and sunglasses, and to use sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher.

Irish Water provisions, which ensure a house cannot be sold until charges are paid, have been introduced to bring clarity and certainty for landlords and tenants, according to a Minister of State Paudie Coffey .
The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment described claims that tenants who dont pay their Irish Water bills could face eviction as scaremongering on the part of the opposition.
Speaking on RTs Morning Ireland, Mr Coffey said the amendments to the bill had been introduced to create a method of enforcement to ensure that those who are not compliant and are refusing to pay, that they do pay.
Thousands march in anti-water charges protest in Dublin
Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly has introduced 33 pages of amendments to the Environment Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.
It contains a number of changes, including the setting up of a database for the water conservation grant and provisions to ensure a house cant be sold until the charges are paid. The Bill also obliges local authority tenants to pay their water charges.
Mr Coffey failed to confirm whether tenants would be evicted if they did not pay their bill, saying payment was a matter for the landlord and tenant as is the case in any contract situation for tenancy.
Asked if the landlord would have to pay if the tenant failed to do so, he said the owner of the property would be responsible for discharging any unpaid bills before selling the home.
We want to see people compliant with the law and we dont want to see people ending up in trouble and thats why were making measures that we feel are fair and bring certainty to the whole area.
Mr Coffey said users who applied for the Water Conservation Grant worth 100 before June 30th could expect to receive the money before the end of this year.
He also said an independent test due to be carried out by Eurostat , the EU statistics agency, was imminent and would take place in the next few weeks or possibly months at the latest.
Mr Coffey said he was unaware of how many people had actually paid their water bill so far, adding that it was a matter for Irish Water to respond to.
I understand theres a board meeting due to happen next week... and I would encourage them to publish the payment figures then.
People before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said earlier this week the amendments to the bill were desperate, devious and discriminatoryand were aimed at undermining the national movement against water charges.

American lawyers for the parents of one of the six students killed in the Berkeley balcony collapse have presented evidence to the local district attorney which, they claim, shows a litany of ignored problems at the California building dating back years.
San Francisco law firm Rains Lucia Stern  representing George and Jackie Donohoe , the Irish parents of Ashley Donohoe (22) of Rohnert Park, California  presented their findings to Alameda County District Attorney Nancy OMalley on Thursday, shortly after she formally announced a criminal investigation into the June 16th balcony collapse that killed six and injured seven more.
Ms OMalley told reporters that each family of the six victims deserve to have this matter thoroughly and extensively investigated.
Balcony was sloping downwards before collapse, witness claims
She promised to examine whether there was enough evidence to prosecute a criminal negligence case.
The findings presented by the lawyers for the Donohoes include a statement from a student who was at the 21st birthday party on the night of the collapse. She said the balcony was sloping downwards, away from the building towards the street, before it collapsed.
Water infiltration
The law firm maintains there was a history of water infiltration and balcony decay at the Library Gardens building at 2020 Kittredge Street dating back to at least 2010.
They presented the District Attorney and her officials with photographs of water damage to the buildings exterior at the fourth-floor balcony showing streaking and staining as far back as 2008.
Complaints of rot, roof and plumbing leaks and flooding were made as recently as three months before the collapse, the law firm has said, and the failure by management to act led the residents to complain to housing authorities.
Before the district attorney took over the investigation, the law firm sent legal letters to the buildings owner Blackrock, property manager Greystar and to city officials, raising concern that the initial investigation into the balcony failure may not be truly independent or neutral.

George and Jackie Donohoe, the Irish parents of the late Ashley Donohoe (above), through their lawyers, contacted the owners and property managers of the Library Gardens student accommodation block in Berkeley, California, where the fatal June 16th incident occurred. They demanded notification of where the destroyed balcony was preserved.

Lawyers acting for the parents of one of the six students killed in Berkeleys balcony collapse sent legal letters over the past week calling for evidence to be preserved and raising concerns that the City of Berkeleys investigation may not have been truly independent.
George and Jackie Donohoe , the Irish parents of Ashley Donohoe (22), of Rohnert Park, California , through their lawyers, contacted the owners and property managers of the Library Gardens student accommodation block where the June 16th incident occurred.
They demanded notification of where the destroyed balcony was preserved.
Lawyers for parents of Berkeley victim present claims
In addition, the familys lawyers from the San Francisco firm Rains Lucia Stern met the Alameda County district attorney, Nancy OMalley, her second-in-command, Kevin Dunleavy , and a number of their officials to present the law firms findings of what they believe was wrong with the building.
Preserved evidence
At the outset, the familys main concern was that the initial investigation by the city was not independent and that the evidence was not being preserved for an independent and impartial analysis.
Ms OMalleys announcement on Thursday that she would carry out a criminal and civil investigation into the collapse has allayed their concerns somewhat.
Ms OMalley said the remains of the collapsed fourth-floor balcony and a third-floor balcony beneath that was removed are being preserved by Berkeley police and the county sheriff.
Harry Stern , a partner with Rains Lucia Stern, said the Donohoes retained the firm as a priority to make sure that a proper independent impartial investigation was being conducted because there were some very disturbing indications early on about what was happening.
Mr Stern said they were very heartened that Ms OMalley and Mr Dunleavy have taken over this investigation, describing it as a step in the right direction.
Not only are they independent, the district attorney department has the resources and expertise to conduct this kind of complex investigation. And, moreover, the two of them are very sensitive to the nature of this tragedy.
The law firm presented the DA with its own evidence, including a statement from an Irish student who was at the party on the night of the incident.
She said the balcony was sloping downwards away from the building towards the street before the collapse occurred.
History of decay
There was a history of water infiltration and balcony decay dating back to at least 2010, the lawyers claim. They presented the DA and her staff with a number of photographs showing water damage to the exterior of the balcony as far back as 2008.
They claim these signs should have put somebody responsible on notice that there could be a problem that needed to be investigated.
They also presented the county prosecutors with evidence of complaints of rot, roof leaks, plumbing leaks and flooding, some of which occurred as recently as three months ago.
Complaints were made to the City of Berkeley housing authority because the existing building management failed to act or were unresponsive to the complaints and concerns, the lawyers say.
Letters seen by The Irish Times show the Donohoes raised concerns about the investigation as soon as three days after the incident.
They wrote to Berkeley mayor Tom Bates , city manager Christine Daniel and planning and development director Eric Angstadt on June 19th, urging them to hire engineers and contractors who would independently and impartially provide a neutral and detailed analysis of the cause of this incident.
At the time, it had appeared Belfor Property Restoration , the company hired by the buildings owner, BlackRock , to remove the third-floor balcony, had been hired by a potentially responsible party.
How can a potentially responsible party conduct a truly independent investigation? the lawyers asked in the letter.
On Tuesday, the lawyers in a follow-up letter wrote to BlackRock, Greystar , the propertys management company that looked after the property for them, and Belfor.
The letter was sent just hours after the citys building inspectors concluded in a report that the fourth-floor balcony appeared severely dry rotted.
Balcony failure
The Donohoe family is grieving the loss of their loved one. . . they have also discovered information that causes them great concern that the investigation into the cause of the balcony failure may not be truly independent or neutral, Joseph Lucia , one of the lawyers at Rains Lucia Stern, told them.
Due to these concerns, the Donohoe family has requested that we contact you regarding the investigation of what occurred so there can be an independent and impartial analysis of the cause of the deadly balcony collapse.
The lawyers added that ensuring an independent and impartial analysis will allow for a swift and just conclusion of culpability, whether it be civil and/or criminal in nature.
The lawyers said that the findings of the city building inspectors report had only increased the amount of concern for the Donohoe family.
The family was particularly concerned at the very limited nature of the citys investigation because it was limited to the direct observations of the citys building and safety division in the immediate aftermath of the collapse and because forensic examination and laboratory tests were outside the scope of the review.
The lawyers noted there have been contractors, structural engineers and architects hired and paid for by BlackRock and Greystar to perform tests and analysis.
BlackRock has responded to the Donohoes attorneys telling them - before the District Attorney took possession of the balconies - they would co-operate by giving them access to the apartment building and other materials when made available to all parties.
BlackRock told them they would carry out further demolition and repairs starting on July 1st.

Sen Haughey to be added to Fianna Fil ticket

Fianna Fil is likely to add former junior minister Sen Haughey to a general election ticket following his surprise defeat at a constituency selection convention earlier this week. Mr Haughey was beaten by Deirdre Heney , a councillor, at the Fianna Fil convention for the Dublin Bay North constituency, even though he was widely seen as the favourite.
The directive from party headquarters was to select just one candidate and Ms Heney has said she believes a single-candidate strategy is the best approach to take a seat in the five-seater constituency.
The decision whether or not to add Mr Haughey will be made by the Fianna Fil constituency committee, chaired by Cork North West TD Michael Moynihan . The task for the party is choosing which is the best option to win a seat, said one source, adding more likely than not Mr Haughey would be added.
Peter Fitzpatrick goes back on decision not to run for  Fine Gael
Mr Haughey, a son of former taoiseach Charles Haughey , did not return calls but party sources suggested he had been somewhat complacent in his approach to the convention. It was also suggested that some members who were supporters of Averil Power  who was expected to contest the convention but resigned from Fianna Fil  had switched to Ms Heney.
Separately, a councillor who lost out at a recent selection convention has left Fianna Fil, claiming he has become disillusioned with the party. Alan Coleman , the mayor of Cork county, says he will now stand as an Independent in Cork South West. He lost a Fianna Fil selection convention to fellow councillor, Margaret Murphy OMahony.
Meanwhile, a Fine Gael TD who said he was not standing for the party has changed his mind following a meeting with Taoiseach Enda Kenny. Louth TD Peter Fitzpatrick is understood to have secured a commitment from the Fine Gael hierarchy that the party ticket in the constituency would comprise only two candidates.
After announcing he was not standing for Fine Gael, Mr Fitzpatrick then suggested he could stand under a different banner, which reduced sympathy for him in the party. We mostly felt sorry for him, but that annoyed people, said one TD.

There were exchanges between Fianna Fil and Fine Gael in the Seanad over the Greek crisis. Mark Daly of Fianna Fil said the attitude of some of the EU governments could be likened to that of Captain Bligh of the mutiny on the Bounty.
When ordering some of the members of his crew to be given 50 lashes, he said the beatings would continue until morale improved. That is exactly what we are seeing in Europe where the EU and euro zone ministers are continuing to beat and punish Greece until its morale improves or it does what they want.
Paul Coghlan of Fine Gael remarked: That is a load of baloney.
Mr Daly said Germany seemed to forget the 1953 London debt agreement whereby nearly 50 per cent of its debt was written off. Greece might have incurred debt because of reckless spending but the Germans incurred the debt because they caused a world war, and yet they seem to be insisting that Greece would have to suffer the humiliation of a Versailles Treaty-type arrangement.
Maurice Cummins of Fine Gael, said reaching agreement for Greece would create certainty for the Greek people and secure their future. The euro zone has an obligation to Greece in this difficult time, but Greece has an obligation to itself. It certainly needs to reform the economy and return it to sustainable growth, which is not the case at the moment, he said.

National Concert Hall could benefit from pharma support
Dil debates Bill to put NCH on equal footing with other national cultural institutions

Pharmaceutical companies could have a philanthropic role in the work of the National Concert Hall , it has been suggested in the Dil.
Fianna Fil arts spokesman Sen  Fearghal said the concert hall was bringing music therapy into Irish hospitals and he asked if there was sufficiently widespread public appreciation of the work being done in that area.
Old and overmedicated: the drug problem in our nursing homes
He suggested that the NCH could benefit from pharmaceutical companies based in Ireland and the industry could realise the benefit of being associated with the work of the concert hall.
Mr  Fearghal was speaking during a debate on the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Bill to change the National Concert Hall Company from a company limited by guarantee into a statutory body.
The change is expected to facilitate greater transparency and accountability in corporate governance and puts the concert hall on an equal footing with other national statutory cultural bodies.
Minister for Arts Heather Humphreys , who introduced the Bill, said Mr  Fearghals suggestion was a good idea and it should be progressed. She supported the business-to-arts initiative which offers businesses great opportunities to support the arts and said engaging with the arts helped employees to think outside the box and has proved to be very worthwhile.
She described the NCH as a major cultural asset. I want to see it developed as a world-class venue that showcases the highest standard of musical excellence. She added that the NCH should have clarity on all governance and operational issues. The Bill sets the number of board members at nine and the first board appointments will be staggered at three, four and five years to ensure continuity. Appointments will focus on a broad range of skills and expertise including, of course, musical experience.
Audience figures are on the rise at the venue which contributed 38 million directly to the local economy last year, the Minister said. The venue had a turnover of 6.8 million, ticket sales of just over 7 million. It hosted almost 900 events with some 330,000 people in attendance.
Refurbishment plans include the creation of a 130-seat performance space in the Kevin Barry rooms, where the Treaty ratification debates took place, and the transformation of the old medical library into a new 500-seat recital hall.
The 1,200 seat-auditorium will also be refurbished and a jazz club will be established, along with rehearsal spaces and recording studios. A series of concerts each day during Easter week next year will commemorate the 1916 Rising.
Mr  Fearghal said an arms-length approach in ministerial direction was vitally important but he suggested that we have moved from an intolerable level of ministerial involvement to a point where there seems to be a total absence of ministerial oversight. He said Fianna Fil opposed as a regressive act the amalgamation of the National Archives, the National Library and the Irish Manuscripts Commission.
Sinn Fin arts spokeswoman Sandra McLellan said the Bill provided the opportunity to acknowledge the importance of the National Concert Hall as a national asset.
Ms McLellan said that until recently, 70 per cent of the concert halls funding came from ticket sales, which she described as an encouraging figure that demonstrates peoples appetite for the arts.
Independent TD Finian McGrath said a country without arts is a country without a soul. People often ignored the great work being done in the arts, the number of people it employed, how the arts lift the countrys spirit and their significant financial contribution to the country.

More than 850 people were told this week by two Galway hospitals that all outpatient rheumatology clinics for July and August had been cancelled, Fianna Fil TD Dara Calleary told the Dil.
He said University College Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital had said emergency outpatient appointments would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Already, he added, 1,500 people were on waiting lists at Merlin Park for outpatient rheumatology appointments.
When a person is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, there is a 12-week window within which there is a chance of dealing with the condition if he or she gets treatment, Mr Calleary added. If it goes longer, perhaps to 2 years, which is the length of time people are spending on the waiting list at the moment, the patients chance of beating that condition are severely restricted.
Mr Calleary asked if it was acceptable that a consultant had gone on maternity leave this week and would not be replaced until September, demonstrating a lack of planning. Is it acceptable that the appointment of a new rheumatology consultant to Manorhamilton, which was promised by the Taoiseach in December, still has not taken place ? he asked.
Is it acceptable that a consultant attached to Beaumont, one of our key hospitals, would tell a patient, as has happened this week, that he or she would be better off having urgent surgery at a private hospital because at Beaumont the wait would be 14 weeks ?
Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Alex White , who was taking Opposition Leaders Questions on the Governments behalf, said the HSE had advised that because of consultant staff shortages, a number of rheumatology outpatient clinics in Galway University Hospital were being postponed. New appointments would be scheduled as soon as possible and urgent patients would continue to be seen. Clinics in Manorhamilton would continue as normal, he added.
Mr White said there were currently three consultants covering outpatient clinics and an emergency intake and consult service in Galway University Hospital, as well as a day ward service in Merlin Park.
From October 1st, he added, there would be four consultant rheumatologists at Galway University Hospital. When extra medical staff are in place, the extra outpatient clinics will have to be held and will be held, Mr White said.

Whistleblower makes new Ansbacher claims

A whistleblower has named another former politician as having an Ansbacher account in a fresh document sent to politicians. Gerry Ryan , an official in the Department of Jobs , Enterprise and Innovation , had sent fresh correspondence to the Public Accounts Committee .
However, following legal advice, the document was not circulated to members and the committee was told the allegations were outside their remit. It is understood Mr Ryan criticised assurances by Revenue that all of his claims were investigated. He also named another politician who he alleges had an offshore account used to evade tax in the document sent to the committee.
PAC gets fresh whistleblower claims over Ansbacher accounts
The decision came down to a vote with only two members  Independent TD Shane Ross and Sinn Fin TD Mary Lou McDonald  voting in favour.
The committee met in private and Fine Gaels Patrick ODonovan said the letter should not be sent to members because it would then be read into the Dil chamber and produced in the media. This was said to be a direct reference to Ms McDonald who was found to have breached Dil privilege by naming the politicians in the chamber.
Fine Gael TD John Deasy told Mr Ross and Ms McDonald if they wanted the information they should contact Mr Ryan and seek the document. Afterwards, Mr Deasy said there had been no ambiguity about the legal advice. The legal adviser probably repeated five times that the committee had no remit to accept any part of correspondence, he said.
Mr Ryan is a senior official in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. He had served as the authorised officer under company law who investigated Ansbacher accounts in the Cayman Islands. He contended in a dossier given to the committee that a number of named former senior politicians had held such offshore accounts. This was denied by the politicians.
Revenue officials appeared before the committee and rejected the allegations.

Banking Inquiry told of warning over  repeat  Lehmans scenario
Central Bank chief Patrick Honohan insists bailout necessary regardless of  bank guarantee

A senior European official warned that Ireland could be a Lehman Brothers moment for Europe , the banking inquiry was told on Thursday.
It was a reference to the massive bankruptcy filing of the US-based global financial services company in 2008, not long before the issuing of the bank guarantee in Ireland.
Governor of the Central Bank Patrick Honohan told the committee when he joined the bank in 2009 there were no concerns about Ireland.
Banking Inquiry: Full coverage
Mr Honohan said this attitude changed dramatically in August 2010 and Ireland was the centre of attention.
I remember one senior colleague saying, Im afraid that Greece is Europes Bear Stearns but Ireland will be Europes Lehmans. That was in September 2010.
So, the view of Ireland had changed dramatically and it had changed dramatically because people had woken up to the scale of the banking losses being incurred by the State, and paid for, and the prospective budgetary situation.
Mr Honohan described how he first raised the prospect of a bailout with then minister for finance Brian Lenihan in April 2010.
Mr Lenihan told him Brussels was saying Portugal was next in line for the programme.
One month later, International Monetary Fund chief of mission to Ireland Ashoka Mody contacted Mr Honohan offering a precautionary line of credit.
The governor told the committee that Merrion Street rejected the proposal - but declined to say who made that call.
Mr Honohan told Mr Mody: I said Try it, it might be a good idea. They [the government] might not like it, but try it. It did not go anywhere.
Mr Honohan said he wrote to the European Central Bank raising concerns about the emerging problems in July 2010.
Dead silence
He said he expected an early meeting and to be quizzed about what was going on. Instead, he said, there was dead silence.
I thought this is good news, they must have figured it out for themselves. I wrote them another letter in August with the full information.
I did get a response then. Concern and anxiety was starting to build there.
Mr Honohan insisted the country would have needed a bailout, regardless of the bank guarantee.
He said the economic and banking crash had cost the State 100 billion - and that figure was still growing.
Mr Honohan said not guaranteeing the six institutions in September 2008 would have saved 10 billion at the most.
He said: All in all, a possible net economic saving in the area of 2-10 billion could be imagined, but surely no more than that.
If so, by September 2008, well over 90 per cent of the net economic cost to Ireland of the boom and bust had become unavoidable.
Mr Honohan said he wanted to put a figure on it because the narrative had been focused on whether the guarantee was the right decision. He said this was the least important question, but the most over-analysed.
He denied the ECB would ever have pulled funding from Ireland. It never would have availed of that decision, he said.

Nine months for boy who stole from home of sleeping mother

A teenage boy in care who stole from the home of a woman, while she and her two small children were sleeping, has been sentenced to nine months in custody and nine months on probation.
The boy, who had previously pleaded guilty to the burglary and other theft charges, had been found by garda on one occasion through a stolen phones tracker app; he was living in a tent behind a garage.
On Thursday, in courtroom 55, in the Dublin District Childrens Court , Smithfield, the boys story and the impact his crime had on one of his victims unfolded.
The 16-year-old sat to the right of Judge John OConnor. . He leaned on his elbows on the long table he shared with solicitors and garda. His hands were clasped together and his chin rested on them, as the sentence hearing proceeded.
A garda reminded the judge of the charges against the boy, for which he was remanded in custody earlier this month.
Unlocked cars
Last September, the boy found unlocked cars and stole items including a camera and laptops from them. On September 6th, during the night, he entered the home of a woman in Bray, Co Wicklow, after noticing a key had been left in the front door. He stole her laptop from the kitchen, 500 from her purse and her keys, before going upstairs into her bedroom and stealing her phone. She and her two young children remained asleep.
All of the items stolen were recovered, except for the cash, the garda said.
In her victim impact statement, read into the record by a garda, the woman said her world had been turned upside down by the robbery.
She did not sleep for two weeks afterwards and worried about what might have happened if she or her children had woken. She felt her home had been invaded and she had failed to protect her children. Her property was taken for which she had worked so hard, as a single parent, she said, and it was truly frightening and horrific that the thief had taken her keys.
Domino effect
She could no longer live in the house and had to move to a smaller one, with higher rent. There had been a domino effect and it was one of the worst experiences of her life. Yes, it has changed my view of Ireland, she said.
Judge OConnor read out the probation report on the boy. It said the Child and Family Agency was involved with his family since 2011 and the boy was taken into care last year, after the death of a family member in tragic circumstances.
He ran away from foster carers and was missing in care.
The probation officer said he had formed the impression the boy carried out the crimes to meet his basic needs. He also said the boy struggled since the death of the family member and there were concerns he misused tablets.
He had dropped out of secondary school but was going to school since being in custody, in a childrens detention centre. He had settled well, and his behaviour was excellent, but there were concerns about his mental health.
The boys solicitor said his client had got involved with a very negative peer group, and there was a belief he needed the money to live. He was also fully co-operative with garda.
The judge said it was tragic the boy had such a terrible youth, but his lifestyle was now so pro-criminal that something had to be done. He said he was not unconscious of the boys circumstances and hoped he would be successful in his school course.
The boy nodded his head at the judge and signed a form. He will appear in court again next month.

Minister for Defence Simon Coveney has received a report on the death of one soldier and the disappearance of another in Lebanon in 1981.
The report, an independent review of the investigation into the death of Pte Hugh Doherty and the disappearance of Pte Kevin Joyce (Caomhn Seoighe), is expected to be published in the coming days.
The two men were serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, manning an observation post at Dayr Ntar, when they came under attack.
Pte Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Pte Joyce was missing. The attackers are unknown. To date, no information has been elicited to lead to the recovery of Pte Joyces remains.
The review of the deaths and subsequent investigations was carried out by retired High Court Judge Roderick Murphy, at Mr Coveneys request.

Victims of paedophile priest Brendan Smyth are to sue An Garda Sochna for damages over its failure to take action when they were allegedly notified in the early 1970s that Smyth was a child sex abuser, it was stated on Thursday.
Belfast solicitor Kevin Winters said he was instructed to take legal proceedings against the Garda following evidence provided to the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry on Thursday that garda in Finglas were alerted in 1973 that Smyth was suffering from paedophilia.
That information emerged through the disclosure of confidential documents from St Patricks Hospital in Dublin where in 1973 Smyth was receiving psychiatric treatment for his sexual propensities.
Sean Brady says abuse kept secret to save churchs good name
Letter
A number of victims of Smyths abuse have asked us to write to the Garda Commissioner to find out why they didnt act on a letter sent to Finglas Garda station in 1973, said Mr Winters.
Our clients are shocked to learn that the document didnt alert garda and the authorities to the very real risk of future abuse by Smyth.
It has been deeply re-traumatising for them to learn about the contents of this letter and to that end feel they have no alternative but to issue civil proceedings for damages for what on the face of it was an appalling failure to take meaningful steps to prevent crimes against the innocent and vulnerable.
A Garda spokesman said that as the inquiry is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment.
Margaret McGuckian of victims group Savia said it was beyond comprehension to think that so many peoples lives could have been different had the authorities acted sooner.
It is a bad day for the garda but we also want to know why it took so long for these documents to be handed over.

First  Irish death  over  online pills  may  force a reckoning
Crackdown on illegal medicines about to get tougher as online trade continues to grow
No internet pharmacy, whether legitimate or not in another country, can supply drugs to customers in Ireland. That hasnt stopped the flow of medicines into Ireland from overseas merchants hawking their wares on the web.

Warnings about the dangers of purchasing medicines on the internet have become commonplace in recent years, but the first known Irish death of a person from consuming pills bought illegally online may finally force people to take heed.
The law, which predates the internet era, is clear: mail order of prescription-only medicines, including internet supply, is illegal.
That means no internet pharmacy, whether legitimate or not in another country, can supply drugs to customers in Ireland.
Discredited DNP raises bodys metabolic rate and can  damage  liver and kidneys
That hasnt stopped the flow of medicines into Ireland from overseas merchants hawking their wares on the web.
It is impossible to know exactly how much use consumers are making of the internet to satisfy their drug requirements, but the rising level of seizures of counterfeit and illegal medicines seized is one indicator.
Last week, the Irish authorities put on display a sample of the 142,000 tablets and capsules they seized as part of an international operation over a single week in over 100 countries.
Painkillers
The value of the haul, over 430,000, gives an indication of the size of the trade. Sedatives, painkillers, weight loss products, anabolic steroids and erectile dysfunction products were among the items seized after they arrived from Singapore, the US, India, the UK and other countries.
There are many strands, and many linked dangers, to the growing international trade in prescription medicines. Some Irish consumers have undoubtedly been driven online by the high cost of their prescription drugs at home.
Others seek unfettered access to medicines for which they would normally need a prescription. Still others want to procure products which are illegal in Ireland.
Taking any medicine without proper medical supervision is risky. Issues arise as to dosage, pre-existing conditions, combinations with other drugs and the availability of follow-up treatment.
The other main problem is the lack of quality control in relation to much of what is being sold online. Up to half of the medicines seized in Ireland have been found to be unreliable and potentially harmful.
Often, the medicine doesnt actually include the claimed active ingredient or includes the wrong dosage. Products may be bulked up with harmful substances, or passed off as natural or herbal when they are anything but.
Awareness
Most consumers of online medicines must have some level of awareness of these risks, but show themselves willing to take them anyway.
DNP (Dinitrophenol), the drug implicated in the death of a young man in mid-May, has been on the banned drug list for almost 80 years. Originally an industrial compound used in the manufacture of explosives, its potential for causing side-effects and even death have been known for some time.
The drug is often marketed to bodybuilders keen to lose fat and maximise a ripped or muscular appearance. Even in this milieu the dangers of DNP are well-known, yet a minority continues to use it, believing the advantage of massive fat loss outweighs these risks.
Some have paid for this belief with their life; worldwide, DNP has been linked to more than 60 deaths.
The authorities  the Garda Sochna , Revenues Customs &amp; Excise service and the Health Products Regulatory Authority  have made arrests and closed down websites in pursuit of their investigations into the trade of illegal medicines.
International co-operation is increasing under the leadership of Interpol , so there is at least a chance the purveyors of deadly chemicals may be pursued. However, the international trade in drugs is not going to disappear any time soon.

RT lied about abuse, former archbishop tells High Court jury

A former Catholicarchbishop has told a High Court jury that he was portrayed during an RT television programme as leading a young girl upstairs to his bedroom to sexually abuse, sexually assault and rape her.
I could not believe my eyes, Richard Burke said. This did not happen. I did not do that. What is portrayed there is a lie. When his counsel, Jack Fitzgerald SC, asked, Are you a paedophile? he replied, No.
Mr Burke (66), from Co Tipperary, said he was living in London with a member of his order, the Kiltegan Fathers , when Prime Time Investigates: Mission to Prey was screened on May 23rd, 2011.
He could not get access to RT TV, but his niece sent him texts which, as the programme went on, progressed from this is bad to this is really bad to, in essence, this is as bad as it can be. On getting those texts, my heart began to sink and sink and sink into darkness, utter fear.
He was unable to watch the full programme until about a month later when he saw it at his sisters home. His impression was that he was being accused of being a paedophile, especially in a section involving a dramatisation where a young girl was led upstairs.
A reference by the reporter that he had declined to be interviewed gave me a hook to hang on to because he got no invitation to respond to the claims being made, he said. That was tiny in comparison to the feeling of helplessness.

Evidence
Mr Burke has begun his evidence in his action against RT alleging he was defamed in the Mission to Prey programme, which included an interview with a Nigerian woman, Dolores Atwood . Mr Burke claims he had sexual relations with Ms Atwood, now aged 45, as an adult but not when she was under age. Having spent decades in Nigeria after his ordination in 1975, he tendered his resignation as archbishop of Benin in April 2010 over his failure to adhere to his vow of celibacy.

RT denies defamation and pleads a defence of truth concerning the contents of the programme relating to Mr Burke. It denies that the content bears some of the meanings alleged by Mr Burke, including that he was a rapist.
Mr Fitzgerald has told the jury that Ms Atwood leaned on Mr Burke about their relationship and that he had paid her 176,000, plus $4,300, to keep quiet. Counsel said he had also mistakenly told the jury that Ms Atwood sought an additional 50,000, when that sum was part of the 176,000.
Some of the 176,000 had come out of diocesan funds, money that Mr Burke had made an agreement with the Vatican to repay, counsel said.
The case continues.

Some 593 people have been rescued from six vessels off the Libyan coast by the Irish ship L Eithne.
The Defence Forces said the rescue operations commenced at 4am Irish time when 101 migrants were taken from a rubber craft 50 nautical miles northwest of Tripoli.
It quickly proceeded to five more consecutive rescue operations, which were completed at 1pm on Sunday.
Total of 519 migrants rescued by L Eithne in latest operations
There were 496 men, 92 women and five children rescued and taken safely on board the ship, according to provisional figures.
A Defence Forces spokesman said the vessel was now awaiting direction from the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-Ordination Centre for its next tasking.
Eithne departed Naval Service headquarters in Haulbowline, Cork, on May 16th to assist the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. Search and rescue operations began on May 28th.
The crew on the Irish ship has now rescued more than 2,700 people.
A Naval Service vessel will be deployed in the Mediterranean for a period of up to six months over the summer.
Earlier this month, vessels from Germany , Britain, Italy and other countries took on board some 3,000 people who had been crammed on to just five small boats in the Mediterranean.

There is no first World War grave more visited or more controversial than that of the boy soldier from Waterford city Pte John Condon .
Condon was with the 2nd battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment when he was killed at Mouse Trap Farm near Ypres on May 24th, 1915.
His headstone states that he was 14 when he died. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) recognises Condon as the youngest British soldier to have died in the war.
New project hopes to find out how many Irishmen died in the first World War
His grave at Poelcapelle cemetery outside Ypres attracts coach loads of tourists usually schoolchildren. He has inspired novels, songs, poems and a play.
There is also a monument to his memory in his native Waterford unveiled last year and a service to mark the 100th anniversary of his death was held last month.
However, the documentary evidence suggests that John Condon was not 14 but 18 when he died. His birth certificate states that he was born on October 16th, 1896. He is listed in the 1901 census as being 4 and in 1911 as 14.
Retired Belgian schoolteacher Aurel Sercu has spent the last 13 years researching the short life of Condon and now maintains that he is not buried in grave LVI F8 in Poelcapelle cemetery.
Condons remains were only discovered eight years after he died. He was identified by a piece of boot which was stamped with the inscription 6322 4/RIR.
The battlefield clearance team assumed the RIR stood for the Royal Irish Regiment and 6322 was Condons service number.
Mr Sercu believes the boot belongs to another Irish-born soldier Rifleman Patrick Fitzsimmons from Raphael Street, Belfast. He was serving with the Royal Irish Rifles and was killed at 35 years of age on June 16th, 1915, three weeks after John Condon.
He too had the service number 6322. Fitzsimmons enlisted with the 4th battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles (RIR) so 6322 4/RIR would also match his service record.
Highly unusual
Condons remains were found 3km away from Mouse Trap Farm in Railway Wood. It would be highly unusual for the remains of an unidentified soldier to be found so far away from where he fell.
Significantly, the regimental diary for the Royal Irish Rifles reveals that on June 16th, 1915, it was stationed between Witte Poort Farm and railway. This is where the body that is in Condons grave was located in 1923.
In what became known as the Battle of Bellewaarde, the Royal Irish Rifles suffered more than 300 casualties in an assault on the German trenches which was met with a terrific artillery bombardment. Fitzsimmons died during this assault.
His remains were never identified and his name is on the New Menin Gate to the missing in Ypres.
It has taken Mr Sercu until now to track down relatives of the man he believes is buried in Condons grave. In the intervening years he wrote to every Fitzsimmons in the Belfast phone book without success until he finally tracked down a retired British soldier Kenneth Hanna based in Cheshire. He is Fitzsimmonss great-nephew.
One hundred years to the day after his relative died, Mr Hanna and his son Adrian visited both Railway Wood and Condons grave or as he believes the grave of their relative.
Clearly from the stamping identified and because of the regimental battle histories, it cannot possibly be John Condon, Mr Hanna says.
Im convinced those remains buried in John Condons grave are Patrick Fitzsimmonss.
The only way the issue can be definitively resolved is through an exhumation and DNA test, something Mr Hanna acknowledges would be very controversial and hurtful to the Condon family who are entirely blameless.
My honest feeling is that both soldiers gave their lives for the cause of freedom. That they are commemorated in error is a fact of history. To switch now would create a huge controversy.
Mr Sercu says he is satisfied that his research is correct, but the issue should go no further as neither DNA testing nor a change of headstones would be palatable after 92 years.
In other words leaving alone, at least as far as I am concerned, would be the best option, he said.
Too late
Sonny Condon , whose father Nicholas was John Condons cousin and best friend, says it is too late at this remove to know definitively the truth about so many aspects relating to the John Condon story.
Mistakes can be made, but my father said he was 14 and they were mates. Unfortunately, all the people who can answer these questions are gone. To me John Condon was a symbol of youth and the futility of war.
For its part the CWCG continues to hold the view that Condon was the youngest British soldier to die in the war.
Spokesman Peter Francis said if anybody wishes to raise the issue of the soldier buried in Condons grave they should submit their request to the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre, a unit of the British army, for investigation.
He stated that the army graves registration teams who did the battlefield clearances after the war did an incredibly difficult job and were rather expert at what they did. There were rather stringent guidelines. Some of those guidelines are still in place today.

Labour Party support falls in separate opinion polls

Labour Party leader Joan Burton. Separate opinion polls have suggested a fall in support for her party.

Labour Party support has shown a decline in separate political opinion polls published on Sunday.
According to a Millward Brown poll for the Sunday Independent, the Labour Party is on 6 per cent (a fall of 2 percentage points) while their coalition partners Fine Gael have gained four points to 29 per cent, when dont knows are excluded.
The Millward Brown poll was carried out between June 16th and 19th and the results are compared to a previous poll in April this year. The margin of error is 3.1 per cent.
Noel Whelan: Its the economy, stupid: why FG is on the up
The strength of the other parties was: Fianna Fail 23 per cent, a rise of 4 points; Sinn Fein on 21 per cent down 3 percentage points; The Labour Party on 6 per cent, the Green Party on 1 per cent, down 2 points, and Independents and Others unchanged on 20 per cent.
Within this grouping are the Socialist Party on 2 per cent, Renua Ireland on I per cent, and People Before Profit also on 1 per cent.
If the results were reflected in a general election result it suggests the current Coalition would struggle to be returned without a third party.
The monthly Red C tracking poll for The Sunday Business Post has Labour on 7 per cent, a fall of 3 points. Its poll suggests Fine Gael support is unchanged at 28 per cent, Sinn Fein down three points on 18 per cent and Fianna Fail up 1 point to 20 per cent.
The most significant gains were for Independents and others which showed a 5 point rise to 27 per cent.
This poll was conducted last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

Clocks to go back one leap second on Tuesday
Move used by timekeepers to keep up with alteration in Earths spin is under debate
Due to slowing down of Earths rotation the solar day is getting longer each year. To compensate timekeepers add a second to the year to make sure our atomic clocks are synchronised to to the solar day.

On July 30th an extra second will be added to the days length, making this coming Tuesday 24 hours and one second long.
The move is often used by international timekeepers to keep up with tiny alterations to the Earths spin.
This represents only the 26th second that has been added since the practice began in 1972  however, it may also be the last.
Daylight saving time: why do the clocks change?
It has been known for some time that the Earths rotation is gradually slowing down. Because of this, the natural or solar day is getting longer each year. To compensate for this, official timekeepers need to add a second to days to make sure our atomic clocks  the most accurate measurements of time humanity has  are synchronised to this solar day.
If we did not use leap seconds our atomic clocks would become two minutes fast by 2100, according to the UKs National Measurement Office.
Although the addition of the extra second will be insignificant to many, the previous leap second in June 2012 wreaked havoc online; popular websites such as Reddit and LinkedIn slowed to a halt.
In an echo of the Y2K fears of the late 1990s, Australian airline Qantas had to switch to manual bookings after its online system failed entirely.
Delay
Since this years leap second will occur on a work day, there are now concerns that computerised micro-transactions worth millions may be lost in the international stock market as countries experience the delay at different points.
Because of these complications, official timekeepers the world over have suggested abandoning the idea of leap seconds entirely.
Announcements opposing leap seconds were made by China , Australia , Japan , and South Korea at a special meeting of the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity earlier this year.
However, a UK-based roundtable found last year that more than 60 per cent of the British public supported keeping the extra second, arguing that various social and cultural issues would be affected, as well as arguing that computer scientists could easily come up with a solution.
Some companies such as Amazon and Google choose to spread the extra second over the course of a day to prevent any such problems.
For the moment leap seconds will continue to be added when needed until at least 2020. Nonetheless the international community will debate whether to keep our notion of a solar day  which includes leap seconds  as the official day at a special conference in November.

Dublin explodes with colour as thousands come out for Pride
Organisers say 2015 parade twice as big in wake of same-sex marriage referendum
Upwards of 50,000 people walked, shimmied and disco-danced their way through Dublin today for Gay Pride. Organisers say the 2015 parade was twice as big in the wake of the same-sex marriage referendum.

OConnell Street, host to numerous protests against austerity and water charges in recent months, gave way to unbridled joy on Saturday as upwards of 50,000 people paraded for Gay Pride.
People of all ages and from across the world  with even a few from Roscommon-South Leitrim  walked, shimmied and disco-danced their way along the route from Parnell Square to Merrion Square.
Dublin city centre was a blaze of Pride hours before the parades start time of 1.30pm with people flying rainbow flags, wrapping rainbow flags around themselves and garlanding each other with multi-coloured flower leis. For today at least, Dublin was to be the capital-of-love.
Many were there in fancy-dress and drag  as golden angels, toreadors, flamenco dancers, Batman, priests and one man who was dressed as Robin was heard to say: Hes had a much-maligned life living under the shadow of Batman.
Senator David Norris described the atmosphere as absolutely wonderful.
The crowds on OConnell St were the biggest hed ever seen at the event, he said with the Yes vote in the marriage equality referendum last month bringing thousands out to celebrate.
It feels like everyone is gay in Dublin today. I think it becoming too fashionable, he joked. In fact I think Ill surprise everyone and come out as straight.
Patricia and Kevin, a couple in their 50s from Bray, Co Wicklow, said they had never been on a Gay Pride march before but they were there: because we have a son and were proud of him. He was a DJ and was somewhere nearby setting up for a party.
Jose Montilla, from Venezuela was there with his boyfriend, Kristof Baraniecki, from Poland. The parade was amazing said Mr Baraniecki. This country is much better gay-wise than Poland. Its much more comfortable.
Niamh McDonald from Wicklow said she was there for equality adding We need a bit of this in Ireland, a bit of joy but added: Theres still a way to go on tackling transphobia.
Heading up the parade were the main LGBTI representative groups  the Gay Lesbian Equality Network, LGBT Noise, the youth group BelongTo, Transgender Equality Network Ireland and the champions of the referendum, Marriage Equality. Also there was the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.
Numerous workers paraded behind their employers banners with the IT industry there in force. Banners from Linkedin, Yahoo, Airbnb, Yelp, Ebay, Dropbox, Paypal, Microsoft and Facebook were there as were Citibank, Mastercard, Bank Of Ireland and restaurant-chain Nandos was represented with a banner saying Worth coming out for.
All political parties were represented including Fianna Fil, Sinn Fin, the Anti-Austerity Alliance, People Before Profit and the Socialist Workers Party.
Tnaiste Joan Burton and Minister for Equality Aodhn  Riordin among those behind the Labour banner while TDs Regina Doherty, Derek Keating, Jerry Buttimer , Minister for Transport Pascal Donohoe ,Minister for Health Leo Varadkar and Minister for Children James Reilly were among those behind a Fine Gael banner saying Thank you for voting Yes.
University student unions, as well as youth organisations like Scouting Ireland were represented.
Perhaps the largest single contingent of young people danced and paraded behind a float representing the George pub.
By the time the parade reached its destination its tail was just leaving Parnell Square.
Grinne Healy of Marriage Equality told The Irish Times the parade had been massive and double the size of last year.
Its fabulous. Something perhaps were not so good at is to stop and celebrate what we have achieved. Today is a celebration of what so many people have worked over a decade to achieve  marriage equality.
There is more to do. The two key things for me are to get the gender recognition legislation through and then to get rid of Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act. The next equality issues are reproductive rights and income inequality.
I think there is a sense of hope that we can say Yes to these other issues too now. But today is about celebrating, and Dublin looked great today.

A man is being questioned by police following the discovery of a bomb at a house in west Belfast on Friday night.
An improvised explosive device was found during a planned search of a house in Lenadoon Avenue at around 8pm on Friday, police have said.
A number of people were moved from their homes while army bomb officers made the device safe.
Det Insp Stuart Griffin of PSNI Serious Crime Branch said: This planned search was carried out at premises in Lenadoon Avenue around 8pm.
Members of the community had to be moved from their homes while the search was carried out. I would like to thank the community for their patience and understanding during the operation.
One man was arrested. He is at Antrim police station for questioning.

Beaumont may face charges over closure of transplant programme
Patients suffering due to lack of pancreas transplants at hospital, says  David Hickey

Beaumont Hospital and the Health Service Executive could find themselves facing corporate manslaughter charges over the closure of the pancreas transplant programme in the hospital, a meeting of patients has been told.
Patients on the waiting list for a transplant are dying because of the failure of the hospital to carry out any pancreas transplants since the beginning of this year, according to retired surgeon David Hickey .
Mr Hickey performed all 118 pancreas transplants done so far in Ireland but this work has ceased since his retirement and Beaumont says it will be transferred to St Vincents Hospital.
Concern after Beaumont post-transplant clinic closes
In addition, the hospital has told post-transplant patients, who are at high risk of infection, they must go to overcrowded emergency departments for urgent care following the decision to close a specialised outpatient clinic.
With the closure of the clinic, more than 80 patients have been told to go to local hospitals for regular care, but they fear this service will be inferior to that provided in Beaumont.
More than 50 people attended the meeting in Liberty Hall, which was organised by three patients who have had transplants.
In limbo
Fiona Burke , a double transplant recipient from Annaghdown, Co Galway, said Beaumont had left patients in limbo though its actions.
Ms Burke said she hadnt looked back a single day since receiving new kidneys and a pancreas transplanted by Mr Hickey. She got married in 2002 and later gave birth to a boy, Jake, who is now a six-year-old and full of life.
Everything was going well until last Friday, when I was told the outpatient clinic in Beaumont was closing and I should access services in Galway. We had a wonderful team in Beaumont but this was like a loss in the family. We have to fight to get it back, she told the meeting.
A couple of managers in Beaumont flicked a switch, ticked a box and saved the hospital a few hundred thousand euro a year, Mr Hickey commented.
Mark Murphy , chief executive of the Irish Kidney Association (IKA), said he had never seen a group of patients being let go by a hospital as transplant patients had been since January.
Youve been thrown to the wolves, he told the meeting.
Mr Murphy expressed doubt about official figures indicating there are just 11 patients on the waiting list for a transplant, eight for a kidney/pancreas and three for a pancreas alone.
Mr Hickey said transplant patients in Beaumont were treated in a Portacabin, with a view of a toilet through the window. Amnesty International would have it closed down as a prison if it could, he said.
Beaumont declined an invitation to attend the meeting, saying direct communication with transplant patients and engagement with their representative body, the Irish Kidney Association, was the most appropriate way to deal with the issues.
Critical
A number of speakers at the meeting were critical of the association for not advocating more strongly on the issue.
There has been nothing from the IKA other than woolly comments, said Mr Hickey, who said it needed to give the hospital a kick in the boll***s and stop being nice.
Mr Hickey accused the hospital of waiting for years and years until he left to close down the pancreas transplant programme. He accused middle managers of hijacking the health system and grinding it into the ground.
Beaumont says it has agreed with St Vincents to develop a collaborative approach to pancreas transplants.
This will begin with joint assessment clinics in Beaumont at the end of July.
The hospital was unable to say when pancreas transplants will resume.

There may be a heatwave on the way but we will have to wait to break out the sunscreen.
Temperatures over the weekend will be similar to the past week according to Met ireann , with bright and mostly dry weather that will become cloudy on Saturday afternoon.
Rainfall will spread across the country on Saturday night, including some heavy falls in the south and east. However, it will clear on Sunday morning, bringing slightly fresher temperatures of 16-20 degrees.
Weather: check the 5-day forecast in your area, tides and weather warnings
Monday will be a hazy day with temperatures of 18-20 degrees. It will get warmer on Tuesday, reaching highs of 22 degrees.
The real warm weather is due to arrive on Wednesday, bringing temperatures between 20-25 degrees across Ireland , according to the forecaster.
Forecaster Klara Finkele says the warmer weather will rise up from the Bay of Biscay on Wednesday and Thursday.
However, she warns that high levels of humidity will bring a risk of thunderstorms and heavy downpours.
Weather from the Bay of Biscay tends to be quite unstable, its warm and very moisture laden so were certainly going to keep an eye on the rain, said Ms Finkele.
Warm air holds more humidity and moisture so it can lead to heavy downpours.
The UK is also set to enjoy next weeks warm weather, with a Spanish plume of hot air moving north, bringing temperatures up into the early 30s.
France , Italy and Spain have been experiencing particularly hot weather in recent days, with parts of southern Europe on track to break records for June temperatures, according to the Weather Channel.
How to protect your skin from the sun
The Irish Cancer Society has warned people to take care in the sunshine, particularly the elderly and young children.
Parents are advised to dress babies under six months in loose-fitting clothes with long sleeves and to keep them in the shade as much as possible.
Children should wear hats and sun glasses in the sunshine and use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. Sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours.
Adults are also advised to spend time in the shade, wear a hat and sunglasses, and to use sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher.

A new Irish language and enterprise development centre in the Kerry Gaeltacht is expected to boost the local economy to the tune of 7m.
Located in Baile an Fheirtaraigh in the heart of the Corca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht, the 3.5m Lrionad Forbartha Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta will provide a range of Irish language-based activities and courses as well as pre-school and family support services.
Courses held in the centre are expected to attract over 2,500 students this year alone.
Stark warning for future of Irish in Gaeltacht areas
Co-funded by dars na Gaeltachta , the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht and Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne, the centre will also support both new and existing business.
Opening the centre on Friday, Minister of State, Jimmy Deenihan said he was pleased that such a significant investment has been made in the area.
Since it was founded, the Comharchumann has been organising activities through Irish, said Minister Deenihan, and this new centre is a significant accomplishment by the Comharchumann, the local community and dars na Gaeltachta, and will assist in further developing and promoting these activities.
Toms Mac Gearailt, the Chairperson of Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne, said the Comharchumann is extremely proud of this development centre.
The Lrionad will ensure that there is a permanent facility available in the area that will benefit the community, support the maintenance of the Irish language and provide employment for generations to come, he said.
He said that 2,500 students will attend courses in the Lrionad this year, and that these courses will be worth 7 million to the Corca Dhuibhne economy.
Chief Executive of dars na Gaeltachta Steve  Clin said the centre would help increase employment with the development of local business.
Modern enterprise facilities are required in the area and this development now ensures that the business development needs of Corca Dhuibhne are catered for and will help attract more employment to the area.
Mr  Clin said Comharchumann had pioneered Irish language activities in the area and that the new centre would strengthen this work.
The Lrionad will act as the supportive backbone to reinforce Irish as a community language in the area and offer a language haven for native speakers and learners alike for years to come.

Irish tourists intending to travel to Tunisia over the coming weeks should exercise extreme caution, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said.
Charlie Flanagan issued the warning has he confirmed that three Irish citizens died in Fridays terror attack. Mr Flanagan said he had been in contact with their families over recent days.
Laurence and Martina Hayes, a couple in their 50s from Athlone, Co Westmeath and Lorna Carty from Robinstown , Co Meath, were killed in the attack on Sousse.
Sincere sympathy to the Hayes family Athlone who suffered their tragic losses in the terror shooting in Tunisia.

The Minister said he did not believe any further Irish people were injured in the incident and he urged those planning to travel to the region to be extremely vigilant and extreme caution.
He told RTEs This Week programme: I would urge those there to continue to liaise with tour operators on the ground and with the consular assistance from Foreign Affairs.
My travel advice for Tunisia is to exercise extreme caution. Anyone wishing to visit the region, anyone with holiday plans over the next few days or weeks I wish to acknowledge the Tunisian authorities have declared the incident to be over but nevertheless I would urge Irish citizens heading there and those in Tunisia to remain extremely vigilant, to follow instructions given to them by the police, the tour operators, the hotels.
Mr Flanagan said he was not in the business of imposing travel bans but his advice for anyone travelling there was to exercise extreme caution.
Relatives of Laurence and Martina Hayes have been contacted by Irish officials, a Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman said. The department has set up an information line for those affected by the attack: 00353 1 408 2000.
Westmeath Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) has tweeted a message of condolence to the family. Sincere sympathy to the Hayes family Athlone who suffered their tragic losses in the terror shooting in Tunisia, it said.
The Irish ambassador accredited to Tunisia, David Cooney, is working with Irish citizens still in the country.
Ms Carty, a nurse and mother of two adult children, had travelled to Tunisia with her husband Declan, a well-known dairy farmer.
The couple received the Tunisian holiday as a gift from a relative as Mr Carty was recovering from heart surgery.
Their daughter Hazel (18) had just completed her Leaving Cert and is believed to have been notified of her mothers death while on holiday in Turkey .
Their son Simon (21), a science student at UCD, was at home in Robinstown. The authorities are gradually identifying those killed in the attack.
One of the British victims has been named as Adrian Evans, who worked for Sandwell Council in the West Midlands . Joel Richards, reported to be Mr Evanss nephew, was also named as a victim.
It is understood Mr Richards was a student at the University of Worcester.
Birmingham-based Gaelic football club James Connollys GFC also paid tribute to Mr Richards, tweeting that the club was devastated to learn of his death.
They said he was an exceptionally-talented footballer who represented both club and county with conviction on numerous occasions. Mr Richardss 16-year-old brother Owen is reported to have survived the attack.
The attack has seen thousands of tourists rush to leave Tunisia. An Aer Lingus flight from Monastir arrived in Dublin last night and other Irish holidaymakers in the country are expected to cut short their holiday and return home. It is unclear how many Irish nationals were in Tunisia at the time of the attack.
Sunway managing director Tanya Airey has offered her sincere condolences to all Irish nationals affected by the attack. The Irish tour operator provides holidays to Tunisia.
The company flies weekly on Fridays to Tunisia. She said a number of Irish Sunway holidaymakers had decided over the weekend to remain in Tunisia.
The tour operator is expected to make a call this week on whether to allow those booked to depart on Friday to travel to Tunisia.
In a tweet she noted that the department advises extreme caution but has not issued a do not travel notice.
Irish citizens returning on Friday night told RT of the chaos during the attack, describing a large explosion and gunfire. Many praised the staff for the assistance they gave guests.
Six nationalities are among the 39 dead.
They are thought to have been killed by a 23-year-old Tunisian aviation student Seifeddine Rezgui who disguised himself as a tourist and began firing at holidaymakers on a beach using a Kalashnikov hidden in a beach umbrella. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Fifteen of the dead are from Britain.
Confirming the figure, British foreign minister Tobias Ellwood said the Sousse atrocity was the most significant terrorist attack on British people since July 7th, 2005, when 52 people were killed.
Speaking at the Foreign Office, Mr Ellwood said: Sadly, I can confirm that at least 15 British nationals were killed in yesterdays atrocity but I should stress that the number may well rise as several more have been seriously injured in this horrific attack.

Thousands have taken to the streets of Dublin to celebrate the annual Dublin LGBTQ Pride Parade.
Rainbow flags and balloons were in evidence as dancers in colourful costumes joined marchers along the route against the background sound of whistles and music.
Senator David Norris described the atmosphere as absolutely wonderful. He said the crowds on OConnell St were the biggest hes ever seen at the event.

The result of the same-sex marriage referendum along with yesterdays decision by the US Supreme Court to give same-sex couples the right to marry has added to the sense of celebration.
Senator Norris said: We led the way on gay marriage, adding that it was wonderful to see the [US]Supreme Court ruling yesterday.
It feels like everyone is gay in Dublin today, he said.
I think its becoming too fashionable, he joked, before adding:  I think Ill come out as straight!
A number of other politicians were also in attendance including Tnaiste Joan Burton, Minister Alex White, Sinn Fins Gerry Adams , Lynn Boylan , Mary Lou McDonald and former Fianna Fil Senator Averil Power.
Along with the citizens of Dublin, staff from Ebay, Facebook , Paypal , the Irish Red Cross and the Bank of Ireland carried colourful banners and balloons.
A Facebook banner read: Equality rocks, thank you Ireland.
Recently featured in the Lonely Planet guide to the best gay pride celebrations in the world, the Dublin LGBTQ Pride Parade is expected to attract record crowds some 32 years after it was first held.
The parade started at the Garden of Remembrance, Parnell Square, at 1.30pm, before heading down OConnell St, crossing the Liffey and then culminating at the specially constructed Pride Village at Merrion Square.
Ongoing works on the Luas line meant the parade could not cross the river at OConnell Bridge this year but instead it turned left on to Eden Quay before crossing the Liffey at the Talbot Memorial Bridge.
Grand Marshals Grinne Healy, Mark Kelly and Brian Sheehan , will address the crowd at the Pride Village.
Participants will be entertained by Le Galaxie, Jerry Fish , ELM, MC Panti Bliss and Veda. A community zone, family area and costumes will also be on hand.
Dublin Pride has grown from a single-day event first held in 1983 to a week-long celebration featuring art exhibitions, music and other cultural events.

Finucane family pledge to continue campaigning for public inquiry
Court rules British prime minister had not acted unlawfully in refusing to hold a public inquiry

The Finucane family has pledged to continue campaigning for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane , despite failing in a judicial review seeking to compel the British prime minister to hold such an investigation.
Lord Justice Stephens at Belfast High Court upheld the right of David Cameron to refuse a full-scale public inquiry into the 1989 UDA killing of the Belfast solicitor, notwithstanding that such a commitment was given under the British Labour government following the 2001 Weston Park peace process talks in England.
He dismissed the application except in relation to a continuing procedural obligation on the state to investigate the murder. Rather than an inquiry, Mr Cameron commissioned a review of the murder case by British lawyer Sir Desmond de Silva QC.
De Silva report
In his 500-page report, Mr de Silva said there was a significant doubt as to whether Mr Finucane would have been murdered in front of his family at their north Belfast home had it not been for the different strands of involvement by elements of the British state.
He found that a series of positive actions by employees of the British state actively furthered and facilitated his murder and there was a relentless effort to defeat the ends of justice in the aftermath of his killing.
My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucanes case has left me in no doubt that agents of the State were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder, he reported.
This, however, failed to satisfy the Finucane family, with the solicitors widow Geraldine describing the report as a sham and a whitewash.
Direct evidence
In his judgment, which took two hours and five minutes to read, Lord Justice Stephens rejected the sham claim and that there was no direct evidence of a closed mind on the part of the UK government.

He referred to how inquiries into the killings of Billy Wright , Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill and into Bloody Sunday cost 304 million. He found that a full independent inquiry would be costly, protracted and could not be confined to narrow issues surrounding the murder.
The judge also found that the British government had not met its obligations to conduct a prompt investigation of new evidence into Mr Finucanes murder uncovered by the de Silva report. He invited lawyers for the Finucane family and the British government back to court on Tuesday to further discuss this element of his ruling.
The judicial review was taken by Geraldine Finucane , who did not attend the reading of the judgment. Solicitor John Finucane , a son of Mr Finucane, attended the hearing with his sister Katherine and his two uncles Seamus and Martin.
John Finucane said the family would press ahead with their campaign. He said politically there should be a public inquiry while legally they would attend Tuesdays hearing and consider what to do next. This could involve appealing yesterdays ruling, he said.
We have been on a campaign for 26 years. We have had numerous setbacks, numerous successes along that way. We see today not as a setback which would end our campaign once and for all, he said outside the court.

Almost 43 years after Samus Wright and Kevin McKee were abducted by the IRA, two hearses crossed a field at Coghalstown, Co Meath, on Friday to collect what is believed to be their remains from an unmarked grave.
The hearses had held off, parked in the grounds of the Wilkinstown Community Centre nearby, until the families of the two men had arrived to pay their respects.
A small group comprising local priest Fr John OBrien, Geoff Knupfer and staff of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains, stood with the families as the remains were placed in coffins.
The Bosnia-based group that names the nameless
They then walked slowly behind the hearses as they travelled back across the field to an impromptu car park near a cattle shed.
The families later released a joint statement saying they hoped they could at last see an end to the torment that has lasted over 40 years and bring Samus and Kevin home. They added: We want to thank the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains and whoever provided information to the ICLVR.
Without that information this would never have happened. While this will change the lives of our families our thoughts are with the Lynskey family and all those who still wait for the news that their loved ones have been found. We pray for them.
Both families asked for privacy. Wright and McKee both disappeared in Belfast on October 2nd, 1972. It is widely believed they were taken and interrogated by the IRA for a period of weeks before being killed by an IRA killing squad called the unknowns.
Wright, who was aged 25, was an asphalt worker and was married. McKee, who was 17, was also from Belfast.
Postmortem
Mr Knupfer said the remains would be taken to Dublin where a postmortem would be carried out, most likely on Monday. Following this DNA samples would be taken from the remains to confirm what the commission already thought very likely.
The commission has been stripping away topsoil from a six hectare area of the reclaimed bog at Coghalstown, about 10km north of Navan, since March.
Earlier this week, the commission was looking for the body of former Cistercian monkJoe Lynskey when they discovered the remains believed to be Wright and McKee.
Mr Knupfer said the commission organised its digs on the basis of intelligence received and did not dig on a speculative basis. He said the search for the remains of Lynskey would continue in coming weeks.
The Lynskey family said in a statement said they were grateful to the commission and to those who had engaged with it in the search.
Sinn Fin president Gerry Adams welcomed news that remains had been discovered.
The uncertainty over who has been recovered must be hugely traumatic for the families involved.
I am sure that the commission will move as speedily as it can to verify the identity of those who have been found, he said.
Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald said she hopes the suffering of at least some of the families will now be eased.

Remember violence. Dont glorify it
We must seize the centenary of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme as a chance to transform conflict on the island of Ireland

The people of Ireland, north and south, are in an enviable position on the eve of the centenary of 1916. We have the opportunity to end a century of violence, enmity and misunderstanding between us for good. Much has been achieved, but much remains to be done.
Diversity and difference are increasingly seen as positives  note last months marriage-equality referendum in the Republic  but our traditional differences of green and orange still generate fear and division for many. Political and sectarian violence has, thankfully, largely stopped, but have we created the conditions in which they will never be tolerated again? Not yet.
How we remember and publicly commemorate the past is an important element in our ongoing peacebuilding efforts.
There is much to remember in this decade of centenaries, but 1916, the year in which both the Easter Rising and the first World Wars Battle of the Somme took place, is particularly important.
For many the Easter Rising is a key moment in securing the independence of Ireland and the eventual establishment of a separate republic. For others the Battle of the Somme is a key foundational moment in the creation of Northern Ireland.
These two narratives are contested and in many ways symbolise the deep, traditional divisions on this island. For that reason we must seize the centenary of these two events as an opportunity to transform violent conflict and build peace.
Today the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation , in Co Wicklow, is hosting 1916 and the Ethics of Memory  an event at which President Michael D Higgins will be the opening speaker  to consider how it is most appropriate to remember the year 1916. There will be a wide range of participants from diverse backgrounds and political viewpoints from across the island.
Peacebuilding
Although Glencrees primary role is to provide a space where differing views can be exchanged, we need to consider some key issues. There are also important reasons why the way we remember the past is important for peacebuilding.
One is that acts of remembering, such as Queen Elizabeth bowing her head in the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin on May 17th, 2011, have the power to be transformative.
This was a moment when most Irish people were deeply impressed by a simple act of respect and openness to their history by the queen  an act that, at a stroke, led to a striking improvement in relations between Britain and Ireland. A seed was sown, with a simple bow . . . she remembered our losses, she remembered her own, as Luka Bloom described it in his song.
Another, which we have come to learn in Glencree after 40 difficult years of peacebuilding, is that without confronting the hard issues of our past there can be no lasting change towards a peaceful future. Dealing with that past is central to peacebuilding.
The Troubles clearly had some of their roots in what happened a century ago, in an earlier period of brutal political and sectarian violence. If we choose to remember only our sides narrative about what happened 100 years ago we will make understanding the more recent conflict and overcoming the deep divisions it opened up even more difficult. So it is important that we look at our own interpretation of the past and be open to hearing others perspectives  something that the prominent northern Methodist minister Dr Johnston McMaster, who will also speak today, calls narrative hospitality.
This is not to suggest that shared commemoration is necessarily appropriate, but it does require us at least to ensure that commemorations are as inoffensive as possible to others  which requires asking others what they would find offensive. Nationalists and republicans need to ask unionists that question, and unionists need to do the same to their historic antagonists.
Dialogue
Dialogue, a key approach that Glencree uses in its peacebuilding work, is important here, as it offers the opportunity to genuinely hear the other and be heard by them and allows for a joint working-through of difficult issues. Dialogue is a key part of the Glencree event today.
It is also important that we remember forgotten narratives of the centenary period. The dominant nationalist/unionist state building narratives of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme often drown out the voices of other significant groups.
We must rediscover the voices of women and the suffragette movement, pacifists and conscientious objectors, the labour movement and, of course, the civilians  including children  who were caught up in these conflicts not of their making.
Conflict resolution
Finally, if we are to achieve a long-term peaceful future for the island we love and share, it is vital that we commit ourselves to nonviolent and nonadversarial approaches to resolving conflict. Conflict is inevitable; violence is not. This is an important reason why we need to guard very carefully against any glorification of violence as part of our commemorations.
It has been pleasing to observe that there has been little noticeable glorification of violence in commemorations to date, but there is still a risk of it happening, particularly as we get closer to the anniversary of the actual events of the spring and summer of 1916, and as people remember the courage and sacrifice of those who all fought for their concepts of country, culture, identity and freedom.
As the eminent philosopher Onora ONeill  who has strong British and Irish elements in her background and will also be participating today  has argued, what we should remember above all is that we have spent much of the past century killing and deriding others with whom we share these islands. She even questions whether any of this should be commemorated at all.
I would not go as far as that. But it is crucial that we remember with sadness, and with as much mutual understanding as we can muster, the pain caused and divisions created by the conflicts of 100 years ago, and vow that they will never be allowed to happen to this island again.

Berkeley: Students  thought sloped balcony was intentional

Legal papers show two students at a party in Berkeley last week say they saw a balcony sloping unusually before it collapsed, killing six Irish students. However, they initially believed the slope may have been an intended design rather than a sign of deterioration in the structure.
Lawyers for parents of one of the six victims of the disaster told investigators that two students at the 21st birthday party in the Library Gardens student apartment block when the balcony collapsed on June 16th provided statements about what appeared to be an unusual slope.
The witnesses, who have been named by the lawyers for the parents of Ashley Donohoe (22), Rohnert Park, California , thought the balcony may have been designed with an intended slight slope downwards toward the street.
Berkeley investigation to look at bringing criminal charges
However, in hindsight the students thought this may be evidence there was a visible deterioration in the balcony structure, according to the lawyers for Ms Donohoes family.
San Francisco law firm Rains Lucia Stern , which is representing George and Jackie Donohoe , met Alameda County district attorney Nancy OMalley on Thursday afternoon shortly after Ms OMalley announced a criminal and civil investigation into the collapse.
The lawyers presented Ms OMalley, who is responsible for prosecuting crime in Berkeley, with evidence from their investigation into the tragedy at Kittredge Street showing a litany of ignored problems at the property, including leaks, rot and flooding, dating back years.
The Donohoes, through their lawyers, told the district attorney they were concerned a proper, independent investigation had not yet been done and called for such an inquiry to identify any potential design or construction flaws and determine if any responsible parties should be criminally prosecuted.
The family expressed satisfaction that Ms OMalleys office had opened a criminal investigation.
The law firm, whose staff includes former police investigators, handed over a large amount of information and potential leads from its own investigation. The firm produced evidence that it claims shows a history of water infiltration and balcony decay at the property dating back to 2010, referring to an online review posted by one tenant at the property.
Also handed over were photographs showing water staining to the exterior of the fourth- floor balcony before the incident. The lawyers argue that the staining should have made the propertys owners BlackRock and management company Greystar on notice that an inspection of the balcony was necessary.
The photographs showing the exterior of the balcony surface were taken in April 2008, July 2009 and April 2011.
The law firm told the district attorney the complex had a history of poor management and failure to respond to maintenance problems. They provided evidence showing complaints to the City of Berkeleys housing enforcement unit concerning violations including holes in walls, trip hazards from damaged floors, loose metal strips in doorways, inoperable ceiling fans and missing exit signs.
There is a clear indication both from the evidence in terms of staining on the exterior of the building and the pointed complaints from the residents themselves that the people responsible for the building should have known that there was a looming problem, said Harry Stern , a lawyer at Rains Lucia Stern.

Big night on Wednesday for the pro-life campaign. It hosted its inaugural annual fundraising dinner in the Mansion House. Special guest at Ceiliradh Cois Life was former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe, who was given a rousing reception by over 500 guests in the Round Room.
Other speakers included Spirit Radio broadcaster, Wendy Grace and Senator Rnn Mullen. Earlier, Rnn escorted Dame Ann to a lunch in her honour at the papal nuncios residence in the Phoenix Park.
Later in the evening, a potentially unpleasant incident was avoided when Aodhn  Rordin, Minister of State for Equality, pitched up at the door of the pro-life ball and sought admittance.

He was turned away because he had no ticket, which is understandable because he thought he was attending the Ringsend and District Respond to Drugs Awards, on in another part of the building.
It was a pity, really, because Aodhn could have gone in and continued his spat with Rnn Mullen. And Mattie McGrath. Its all to do with Twitter and acrimonious exchanges between the Senator and Minister this week.
McGrath twice took up the cudgels on behalf of the Senator during the Dils Order of Business.
On Tuesday, he informed the Ceann Comhairle he wanted to raise an item about the tweeting system.
What tweeting system, asked the chair, wearily.
Tweetest thing
I have to ask because it goes on. There is an adage that if there are too many tweets, the tweeter becomes a twat. Are we going to have government by tweets? asked McGrath.
Minister  Rordin today sent a terribly insulting tweet to people who happen to be pro-life. he complained.
The Tipperary TD told the Taoiseach to rein in his Ministers. He was also unhappy with tweets from Leo Varadkar over the free GP scheme for the under-sixes.
He returned to the topic the next day. Varadkar and  Rordin were tweeting about unsavoury issues and insulting GPs and pro-life supporters. The Broadcasting Bill should be amended to deal with this outrageous type of behaviour.
Dame Widdecombe visited Leinster House on Thursday as a guest of Senator Mullen and Senator Jim Walsh. Its nice to see them recovering from their same-sex marriage setback.

Educate Together takes legal advice on admissions
Body says   the enrolment policy exemption for  older schools could be discriminatory
Educate Together chief executive Paul Rowe
Sat, Jun 27, 2015, 10:08
First published: Sat, Jun 27, 2015, 01:03
Educate Together is taking legal advice on admissions regulations from the Department of Education which could be discriminatory.
It says hundreds of parents, who prefer not to have their children baptised, are being blocked from accessing their schools.
Educate Together, which operates 77 schools across the State, argues that the stipulation, announced in 2011, that new schools must prioritise children from the catchment area, is denying parents who live outside the catchment area of an Educate Together school, their choice of school for their children.
Students in direct provision working hard for college place
In contrast, older schools  the vast majority of which are denominational  can continue to prioritise on the basis of religion. Baptised children from outside the catchment may be preferred over non-baptised children living locally.
According to Educate Together chief executive Paul Rowe , this means some parents whose children are not baptised face difficulties accessing local schools and may find it impossible to get into Educate Together schools further away, given that most are hugely oversubscribed.
Mr Rowe said it had been hoped the 2015 Admissions To School Bill would address the issue of religious schools, which are publicly funded, being allowed to prefer baptised children.
Minister for Education Jan OSullivan has said the legislation was drafted in the context of the Constitution and equality legislation. We cant within that take away the provision whereby schools can protect their own ethos.
Educate Together schools
Educate Together schools have become increasingly oversubscribed, with hundreds of parent from outside school catchment areas applying for junior infants places, particularly in Dublin.
Some of the schools are receiving four, five or six times more applications than available places, said Mr Rowe.
For example, Balbriggan ET national school has 258 applications for 48 places. Holywell national school in in Swords , Co Dublin has 335 applications for 90 places, while Castleknock ET national school has 350 applications for 58 places.
Mr Rowe says the restrictions on new schools, compelling them to prefer children from the local area, may contradict powers granted to boards of management over this area under the Education Act.
Educate Together has, like other patron bodies, sought legal advice on the issue, he said. The fundamental underlying issue however, is that many more Educate Together schools are needed."
It could also be necessary for Ireland to comply with its international legal obligations.
A spokeswoman from the department said: The reason for establishing new schools is to serve a local community where a local demand exists and hence priority is given to pupils from the local area."
The United Nations has repeatedly called on Ireland to end religious discrimination in publicly-funded schools.
Most recently this week, the UN Council on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Geneva called on Ireland to take all necessary measures to bring all relevant laws, including the Equal Status Acts 2001 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015, in line with the international human rights standards and to increase the number of non-denominational schools at the primary and post-primary education levels.
