An attacker with suspected ties to French Islamic radicals rammed a car into a gas factory Friday in southeastern France, and a severed head was staked on a post at the entrance, officials said. France immediately opened a terrorism investigation.
Two people were injured, authorities said.
President Francois Hollande, speaking in Brussels, said the attack began shortly before 10 a.m. when a car crashed through the gate of a gas factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, southeast of Lyon. The car then plowed into gas canisters, touching off an explosion, he said.
"No doubt about the intention - to cause an explosion," Hollande said, calling the attack "of a terrorist nature."
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a man who had been flagged in 2006 for suspected ties to extremists was seized by an alert firefighter, one of multiple people in custody after the attack.
He said authorities were trying to identify the victim whose severed head was posted at the factory's entrance.
"People who could have participated in this abject crime are in custody," he said.
Cazeneuve said the suspect had been known to intelligence services, who had him under surveillance from 2006-08. The man is from the Lyon region, he said.
A severed head was found staked on a gate at the factory's entrance, in what appeared to be an echo of the Islamic State group's practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads for all to see.
An official said two flags - one white and one black, both with Arabic inscriptions - were found nearby.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release details to the media, said the victim was not decapitated by the blast.
France's anti-terror prosecutor said an investigation was opened into the attack, and potential charges including plotting as part of "a terrorist group."
Hollande spoke after watching TV news reports about the attack with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as both leaders attended a European Union summit in Brussels.
The industrial site belongs to Air Products, an American chemical company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The company would not confirm whether any employees were injured or killed.
"Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for," the company said in a statement.
"The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities."
Cazeneuve said the investigation had just begun and cautioned against jumping to conclusions.
France went on high alert after attacks in January against the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher grocery store and a policewoman that left 20 people dead in the Paris region, including three Islamic extremist attackers.

Young girls have gone bananas for perhaps the most handsome ape in captivity.
Shabani, a western lowland gorilla, has been described as a "heart-throb" and responsible for a huge spike in female visitor numbers at the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens in Japan, News Corp reports.
Originally from Sydney's Taronga Zoo, Shabani has been admired for his "brooding poses", "ripped muscles" and "flirtatious glances".

A Kiwi on holiday in Alaska very nearly boarded a tourist flight which has crashed today.
The sightseeing plane crashed near Ella Lake in Alaska, the Holland America cruise line said in a statement today, and the condition of the plane and its passengers was not known.
The United States Coastguard and Alaskan authorities were on their way to the site, more than 250m above a lake on a cliff face.
Kiwi Sam Caughey tweeted that her mother was very nearly on that flight.
"Just got word from my mum...she pulled out of a scenic flight in Alaska...plane just reported as crashed," she wrote.
"What a near miss. So sorry to all those on board."
Eight passengers and a pilot were aboard the floating plane owned by Promech Air.

Comedian offers to sell drugs to pair of cops (0:44)
An American comedienne faced no consequences after trying to sell two police officers antidepressants in a video she made to illustrate white privilege.
Jessie Kahnweiler, 30, posted a video to YouTube which she captioned: "Jessie sets out to see if white privilege really exists and can she get arrested or will her whiteness prevent it?"
The video comes at a time when racial tensions in parts of America with police are high, with several high-profile cases of undue police force against minorities hitting the headlines recently.
"My one black friend told me that because I'm white, I have all of these privileges, and I get treated totally different by the cops than black people get treated," she says in the video.
In the video, she drinks in public, cartwheels naked in front of a restaurant and ultimately tries to sell prescription medicine to police officers - with no apparent consequences.
"Those are prescribed drugs, and you are becoming a drug dealer by selling them," a police offer tells her.
"Oh, sorry!" she says, and walks away.

Arthur Goldberg - Source: AP
A nonprofit organisation that claimed it could turn gay men straight violated New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act, a jury concluded in a civil trial that an attorney for the plaintiffs called "a momentous event" for LGBT rights.
The jury said that Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing, co-founder Arthur Goldberg and counsellor Alan Downing made misrepresentations and engaged in unconscionable business practices.
Three men and two parents were awarded more than $100,000 in damages.
The judge will rule later on their request to revoke the company's license, plaintiffs' attorneys said.
"This is a momentous event in the history of LGBT rights," attorney David Dinielli said. "The same lies that motivate gay conversion therapy motivate homophobia - that gay people are broken and need to be fixed. The strength of our plaintiffs brought that to light."
Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued during the trial that the group, known by the acronym JONAH, claimed a success rate that wasn't backed up by actual statistics and used therapy methods that had no scientific basis, including having one client beat a pillow, meant to represent his mother, with a tennis racket.
In an emailed statement, defence attorney Charles LiMandri called the verdict "a sad day, not just for my clients, but for America."

Greece's parliament voted early today in favor of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' motion to hold a July 5 referendum on creditor proposals for reforms in exchange for loans, with the country's future in the eurozone looking increasingly shaky.
Tsipras' surprise call stunned Greece's international debt negotiators, and the country took a big step closer to falling out of the euro currency union after fellow eurozone member states refused to extend its bailout program past its expiry date on Tuesday, leaving Greece on the brink of financial chaos.
In the streets of Greece, worried people queued outside banks for cash from dawn to dusk after Tsipras' announcement in the early hours of Saturday, after billions of euros had already been emptied in the preceding weeks.
Greece has a 1.6 billion euro ($NZD 2.61 billion) debt due to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday and its bailout program expires the same day, after which it is unclear how the country might survive financially.
The referendum is set for next Sunday with the question on whether to accept proposed reforms needed to get bailout loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF. The government is advocating a rejection of the proposals.
The radical left-wing leader accused the creditors of using blackmail and ultimatums against his proud but struggling people. European officials and all Greek opposition parties except the extremist far-right Golden Dawn party called his move for a vote a foolish and rash gambit that effectively ended negotiations to keep Greece financially afloat.
The sudden move comes after five months of stalemated negotiations, with Tsipras accusing creditors of trying to strong-arm his country into taking harsh austerity measures he says would hammer an economy already on its knees after months of creditor-demanded spending cuts and tax hikes.

"They didn't ask us to agree, they asked us to surrender our political dignity," Tsipras said during a tumultuous and nearly 13-hour parliamentary session that cumulated in a vote just before 3am. Out of parliament's 300 lawmakers, 178 voted in favor and 120 against, with two people absent.
He insisted the Greek side had "exhausted every limit" of concessions so there could be an agreement, adding that "perhaps some saw that as a weakness."
The referendum move further crumbled already strained relations between Greece and its European partners, but Tsipras dismissed harsh criticism from other European countries on his decision.
"The referendum will take place as scheduled, next Sunday, whether our partners want it or not," he said.
Without a bailout program extension or more loans from creditors, Greece is likely to be in arrears on a debt payment due the same day. Its banks face the risk of collapse.
Now much will depend on whether the European Central Bank will accept to continue to prop up Greek banks even after the country's bailout program expires. It would be under huge pressure to stop using eurozone taxpayer money to keep alive the banks if there is no prospect for a deal.
If Greece's banks collapse, the government would have to support them itself. Penniless, it would have to revert to printing a new currency, effectively drawing the country out of the euro union.

A Wellington family has been forcibly separated from its father and husband as concerns mount over democracy on the island of Nauru.
Growing tension and reports of restrictions on freedom have drawn the attention of the New Zealand Government.
The Wellington-based Kun family have been forcibly separated from their Nauru opposition MP dad, Roland Kun. When he boarded his plane to join them in New Zealand he was hauled off by Nauruan officials and had his passport cancelled.
"I was deemed a risk to the nation. And the other reason was there were criminal investigations with which I was directly linked," Mr Kun told ONE News in a telephone interview.
The criminal investigation relates to protests last week at Parliament. Three opposition MPs have been charged, two of them imprisoned, accused by the Government of trying to destabilise it. Mr Kun is under investigation, having been suspended from Parliament a year ago.
"We are concerned to hear that there have been steps taken that might impinge on the liberties of individuals, and particularly elected representatives," says Murray McCully, New Zealand Foreign Minister.
The arrests are the latest in what critics say are moves towards a dictatorship. The Nauruan Government has suspended five opposition MPs, banned the use of Facebook, deported outspoken foreigners and introduced a law where threatening public order can result in up to seven years in jail.
"It's an attempt to try and stifle democracy in a way that is not good for the future of the country," says Dr Steven Ratuva of Canterbury University.

New Zealand gives $2 million a year towards Nauru's justice system and wants some answers over recent events. Mr McCully will be meeting with Nauru's president early next month, but it's also drawing international attention.
"It's serious enough for the Pacific Islands Forum to seriously look at what it can do," says Dr Ratuva.
The Nauru Government insists it is upholding law and order, looking after the best interests of its people. But those on the receiving end, including the Kun family, are paying a harsh price.

Big wave surfers have travelled to Western Australia to catch a "once in a decade swell", which has already left one thrill seeker with a badly broken leg.
Gold Coast surfer Justin Holland told Nine News he flew to Gracetown, south of Perth near Margaret River, to catch the massive waves at open-ocean surf break Cow Bombie.
However, the brave father of two was swamped by a massive wall of whitewater, breaking his leg, after he rode the giant for several seconds.
"His left femur is completely broken ... It was one of the biggest waves ridden in Australia, for sure," Mr Holland's jet ski tow-in partner Jamie Mitchell told Perth Now .
Mr Holland has been taken to a Bunbury hospital for surgery.
Photographer Jamie Scott was filming the event and said the wave was "huge" with an 18-21m face.
The swell has been generated by a low pressure system in the Southern Ocean, and the conditions have been described as a "once in a decade".
The biggest wave ever ridden was reportedly a 33m monster off the coast of Portugal two years ago.

Officials announced that a ban takes effect Wednesday at all four Disney theme parks in Orlando, Florida. Selfie sticks will also be banned at Disneyland Resort in California and at Disney's parks in Paris and Hong Kong starting July 1.
Spokeswoman Kim Prunty tells the Orlando Sentinel that selfie-sticks have become a "growing safety concern for both our guests and cast."
Officials say guests will have the option of turning in their selfie sticks for pick-up later, or returning them to their cars or hotel rooms.
The sticks have been banned at a growing list of museums, music festivals and sports venues.

A fire on a music stage spread into a crowd of spectators at a party Saturday night at a Taiwan water park, injuring more than 200 people, authorities said.
An accidental explosion of an unknown powder set off the fire near the stage in front of about 1,000 spectators, said Wang Wei-sheng, a liaison with the New Taipei City fire department command center.
Wang said 83 people had serious injuries and 131 others have light injuries.
Taiwan's Central News Agency reported the fire at the Formosa Water Park in New Taipei City near the island's capital was quickly brought under control.
Video showed rescue workers and bystanders carrying burned and injured people on their backs, in inflatable boats and on stretchers to get medical treatment.
CNA reported witnesses as saying the fire spread quickly after the colored powder was blown into the air.
It wasn't clear if the powder was part of a performance. The cause of the fire is being investigated.

French taxi drivers pulled out the throttle in an all-out confrontation with the ultra-cheap Uber car service, smashing livery cars, setting tires ablaze and blocking traffic during a nationwide strike that caught tourists and celebrities alike in the mayhem.
Travellers going to and from the airport were forced to walk alongside highways with their bags, while others, including singer Courtney Love, had their cars set upon by striking taxi drivers.

The French government was aghast, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls lamenting: "These incidents give a deplorable image to visitors of our country."
Taxi drivers justified their rage, saying Uber's lowest-cost service UberPop was ruining their livihoods.
Despite repeated rulings against it and an October law that explicitly outlaws UberPop, its drivers continue to ply French roads and the American ride-hailing company is actively recruiting drivers and passengers alike. Uber claims to have a total of 400,000 customers a month in France.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve rushed back from a trip to Marseille to meet with taxi unions, declaring afterward that UberPop must be shut down and its vehicles seized if caught by police carrying passengers. He said 70 vehicles had been damaged around France in yesterday's protests and 10 people were arrested.
Taxi drivers in other European countries also complain that car services like Uber unfairly undercut them.
A judge ordered a temporary suspension in Spain, and in the Netherlands a Dutch court has ruled that UberPop must stop service. A world away, in China, the government banned drivers of private cars from offering services through an app.

Biggest jury selection in US history begins in Batman movie massacre trial
A psychiatrist who determined that Colorado theater shooter James Holmes was insane at the time of the 2012 shootings says that people suffering from delusions can't always control behavior - even if they know the behavior is wrong.
Dr. Jonathan Woodcock interviewed Holmes four days after the attack and concluded that he wasn't sane. Two other court-appointed psychiatrists later concluded that Holmes was sane at the time of the attack.
Woodcock testified today that Holmes had a strong family history of mental illness and was in the grip of a psychotic compulsion he could not control.
He said Holmes' emotions also were extremely flat. About midway through the two-hour jail interview, Woodcock said Holmes said he was bored. That kind of reaction in the wake of the mass shooting helped Woodcock conclude that Holmes was suffering from significant mental illness.
Two court-appointed psychiatrists concluded that Holmes was sane at the time of the attack. They interviewed Holmes much later - in December 2013 and July 2014.
Jonathan Woodcock is an assistant professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Colorado's medical campus, the school where James Holmes was studying before the July 2012 attack. He didn't treat Holmes before the attack; the defense asked him to interview Holmes after.
A total of 12 people were killed and 70 were injured when the 27-year-old opened fire in the packed cinema in Denver in 2012, where The Dark Knight Rises was playing.
Holmes has admitted he carried out the killings but has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

Escaped New York murderer involved in shootout with police video
With one escaped prisoner shot dead, police hoped that the other one still on the run in a remote New York forest will quickly be worn down by lack of sleep, little food, biting bugs and another night of rain.
Richard Matt, who once vowed never to be taken alive, was fatally shot during an encounter with border patrol agents yesterday, almost three weeks after he and David Sweat staged an elaborate breakout from a maximum-security prison.
More than 1,200 searchers remained focused intensely on 56 sq. kilometres of thick forests and heavy brush around where Matt was killed.
"Anyone in the woods and on the run from the law, so to speak is not getting a full eight hours sleep, they're not eating well and they have to keep moving," Franklin County Sheriff Kevin Mulverhill said of Sweat. "He's fatigued, tired, and he's going to make a mistake."
Sweat also could have an even tougher time now without someone to take turns resting with and watch his back, said Clinton County Sheriff David Favro. "And I'm sure fatigue is setting in for him as well, knowing the guy he was with has already been shot."
The manhunt broke open when a person towing a camper heard a loud noise and thought a tire had blown. Finding nothing, the driver drove on before looking again and finding a bullet hole in the trailer. A tactical team responding to the scene of the gunshot smelled gunpowder inside a cabin and saw evidence that someone had fled.
A noise, perhaps a cough, ultimately did Matt in. A border patrol team discovered the escaped prisoner, who was shot after failing to obey a command to raise his hands.
Matt had a shotgun. He and Sweat apparently had been relying on the region's many hunting camps and seasonal dwellings for supplies.
Matt, who turned 49 the day before he died, was serving 25 years to life at Clinton Correctional Facility for the killing and dismemberment of his former boss.
Sweat, 35, was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy. Mulverhill said investigators believe he may be armed.

While there have been no confirmed sightings of Sweat since the escape, police said investigators saw a second set of tracks near where Matt was shot. Searchers hoped for one last break before heavy rains forecast for tomorrow come in.
Ultimately, how the chase ends is up to Sweat, Mulverhill said.

        <MainBody>Text size + -

Canadian police are on the hunt for a group of boaties who posted a video of a man riding a moose.
The YouTube clip shows a group of men chasing a moose that was wading across a river in British Colombia before one of the men jumps on its back and rides it.
The others can be heard laughing at their friend from the boat.
Now police are looking for the group, who could be fined over $100,000 for the incident.
"I was absolutely disgusted," says Steve Wolfe, a hunter who saw the video online.
"It's not illegal, it's absolutely unethical. That moose was chased around for who knows how long."
Under the British Columbia Wildlife Act the actions are classed as illegal and conservation officers are keen to take action against the group.
According to media reports the incident was believed to have taken place last July on Tuchodi Lakes in Northern Rocky Mountains Provincial Park.

A woman who survived a plane crash with her months-old baby, drinking water to stay alive, was finally rescued after four days lost in the jungle, Colombia's air force and rescuers said.
Maria Nelly Murillo and her child were aboard a twin-engine Cessna that crashed last weekend in a remote area of western Colombia shortly taking flight from the city of Quibdo, the air force said.
The pilot was killed, but rescuers said a heavy load of fresh fish in the cabin absorbed much of the crash impact, allowing Murillo and her son to survive against the odds.
She forced open the cabin door and climbed a hill to get away from the aircraft, which she feared might explode, the air force reported.
Apparently disoriented, she wandered in the jungle carrying her child, surviving on coconut water and trying unsuccessfully to trap rodents for food, said Acisclo Renteria, the Red Cross volunteer who eventually found her.
Searchers reached the plane two days after the crash but found the two passengers missing.
The air force said it sent out a helicopter with a loudspeaker urging the woman to return to the crash site, and Renteria said a team of about 40 people began to search for her. They were aided, he said, by a trail of clues left by Murillo, including a flip flop sandal, her son's birth certificate, a cellular phone and the remains of coconuts.

But after two more days, as rescuers began to lose hope, Renteria said he spotted a buzzing circle of flies hovering over something on the ground. As he approached, Murillo began to shout for help and attempted to get to her feet in a state of near-starvation and apparent shock.
"I told her 'Mama, Mama, be calm. The Colombian Red Cross is here to rescue you,'" Renteria said.

While New Zealand hovers around near-record low temperatures, four-year-old Bruiser the bear's busy focussing on where he can cool off.
The clever bear, at Single Vision wildlife park in Florida, can let himself in the free-standing pool after he learned to climb its ladder.
Bruiser was born in 2011 and when fully grown will weigh about 270 kilograms, the Single Vision website says.
His hobbies include swimming and tearing up boxes, and "Bruiser will also stand up on his back legs and walk around when he wants something from you, but sometimes he just wants to latch on and suckle".
Bruiser's friend Honey, a black bear who can be seen in the video, was born in 2014 and when fully grown will weigh about 130 kilograms.
Staff at the not-for-profit wildlife park provide him with a surfboard and other toys to play with in the pool.

Woman who helped prisoners escape was a 'serial cheater' - ex-husband (0:26)
A second worker at a maximum-security prison accused of helping two murderers before their brazen escape was being arraigned today after being accused of delivering frozen meat to the men with tools hidden inside.
Prison guard Gene Palmer, 57, admitted to providing the two inmates with tools, paint and even access to a catwalk electrical box, but he says he never knew they planned to escape.
Officials at Clinton County Jail said Palmer was released just after midnight after using a credit card to pay his $25,000 bail.
His lawyer, Andrew Brockway, said his client will plead not guilty to charges of promoting prison contraband, tampering with physical evidence and official misconduct. Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said investigators have no proof Palmer knew hacksaw blades were embedded in the meat and have no indication he was knowingly involved in the escape.
Palmer's statement to authorities says he allowed one of the convicts access to an interior catwalk behind the men's adjacent cells that was later used in their escape. He says he did it to change the wiring on electrical boxes as "a favor" to make it easier for them to cook in their cells.
The statement also says he provided one of the men with paint and paintbrushes and provided the other on four separate occasions with needle-nose pliers and a screwdriver. In return, one of the inmates provided "information on the illegal acts that inmates were committing within the facility," Palmer's statement says.
After the escape, Palmer burned and buried the elaborate paintings he had received from one of the men, according to court documents. He had known both of the men for at least five years.
David Sweat and Richard Matt remained on the run after slipping out of the Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6. Authorities say they cut through the steel wall at the back of their cells, crawled down a catwalk, cut their way into and out of a steam pipe and emerged from a manhole outside the prison.
Sweat, 35, was serving a life sentence without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy. Matt, who turned 49 Thursday, was doing 25 years to life in the kidnapping, torture and hacksaw dismemberment of his former boss.

Prison employee Joyce Mitchell also has been charged with helping them escape. Mitchell, a prison tailor shop instructor, has pleaded not guilty and remains in custody.
Wylie said Mitchell told investigators she smuggled hacksaw blades, a screwdriver and other tools into the prison by placing them in the frozen meat. He said she placed the meat in a refrigerator in the tailor shop and Palmer took the meat to Sweat and Matt.
More than 1,000 searchers this week have focused on a section of a large wilderness area near the Canadian border after a man was seen running away from a hunting cabin Saturday morning and items inside had DNA evidence.
Challenges in the search include thick woods, bogs, biting bugs and the possibility that the two men are armed. The region in the coming days will get a surge of holiday visitors, including young campers.
Police still have no substantiated sightings of Sweat and Matt.

ISIS recruiting scientists to build chemical weapons
Islamic State militants have launched major attacks in northern Syria after a string of recent setbacks, storming government-held areas in a mostly Kurdish city and setting off deadly car bombs as they pushed into a border town they were expelled from six months ago.
The two-pronged counter-offensive left dozens of people dead or wounded. On one front, Islamic State fighters advanced early in the morning into the northeastern city of Hassakeh, long split between Syrian Kurds and government forces, capturing parts of it.
The other push was into the Syrian border town of Kobani, which famously resisted a months-long IS assault before the extremists were driven out in January. An activist group said 12 people died in fighting in Kobani - the first time in six months the IS had managed to enter the town along the Turkish border - and that the militants had detonated three car bombs.
In the Kobani attack, the extremists donned Syrian rebel uniforms and carried flags of the mainstream Free Syrian Army to deceive the town's Kurdish defenders, said Redur Khalil, a spokesman for the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG.
In Hassakeh, Khalil said IS militants attacked government-held neighbourhoods on the southern edge of the town, capturing some areas.
Syrian state TV reported intense clashes inside Hassakeh's southern neighbourhood of Nashawi. According to the report, IS fighters killed several people they captured in the city, including the head of a military housing institution. It said the militants sustained many casualties, including the commander of the group, who is a foreign fighter. IS tried to storm the city earlier this month and reached its southern outskirts before facing strong resistance from Syrian government troops who pushed them away.
The Hassakeh and Kobani attacks came just days after YPG fighters and their allies captured the Islamic State stronghold of Tal Abyad on the border with Turkey and the town of Ein Issa to the south. Kurdish fighters have been advancing since January under the cover of airstrikes by the US-led coalition.

        <MainBody>Amazing shots of life after the deadly Nepal earthquake (1:07)
Donor nations and agencies announced $US4.4 billion ($6.3b) in aid for Nepal today, covering about two-thirds of what the Himalayan nation says it needs to rebuild from devastating earthquakes that killed more than 8,800 people and made millions homeless.
Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said the amount was pledged by donors that attended a one-day conference in Kathmandu.
The biggest pledge came from Nepal's large southern neighbor, India, which offered $1 billion in grants and low-interest loans.
"Nepal and India are joined in both their joys and sorrows. Therefore, we need to closely coordinate our disaster response, and help each other in the wake of such calamities," Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said.
Nepal says it needs about $6.7 billion for reconstruction following a magnitude-7.8 earthquake on April 25 and a magnitude-7.3 quake on May 12, which together killed 8,841 people. About 875,000 public and private buildings were damaged, according to the National Emergency Response Center.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his country would provide $483 million.
Asian Development Bank President Takehiko Nakao pledged $600 million.
"ADB will make the best use of its long-term experience in rehabilitation and reconstruction work after serious disasters," he said.
ADB is a major donor for Nepal and has supported several development projects in the past.

Japan said it would give $260 million and the United States $130 million. The World Bank has already announced $500 million for Nepal.
European Union's Neven Mimica said it would give $112 million to Nepal's government for spending on reconstruction.
Earlier, Mahat said Nepal's trade deficit will widen because of the earthquakes, but foreign reserves will remain adequate with transfers from the rest of the world increasing. The quakes destroyed factories and farmland, reducing exports and pushing up imports.
Revenue collection will face a shortfall of 8 percent during the current fiscal year, he said.
"This is the reason why we are looking to our development partners to fill a growing fiscal gap for the next three to five years," he said.

Text size + -

The devastating heat wave that struck southern Pakistan last weekend is slowly subsiding but the toll was still climbing Thursday, to a total of 860 confirmed deaths, a senior health official said.
Jam Mehtab Hussain, the provincial health minister in the southern Sindh province, said people were still being admitted to hospitals with heat-related ailments - though in smaller numbers than in previous days, when dehydrated patients lay in hospital corridors and outside on the streets as overwhelmed medical staff struggled to cope with the disaster.
Ahmad Kamal, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority, said authorities were providing free medical treatment to people in Karachi, the capital of Sindh province. He said the situation was improving due to lower temperatures.
On Thursday, the temperature dropped to 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in Karachi from a high of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday.
TV footage showed ambulances transporting heatstroke patients to various hospitals in Karachi, where people continued holding small rallies against power outages, which had exacerbated the effects of the heat wave.
The heat wave was the worst seen in the city since 1979, officials said, and came as Muslims were fasting from dawn to dusk for the holy month of Ramadan.
The drinking of even a single drop of water invalidates the fast, but Muslims are also encouraged not to fast if they are sick or if doing so would cause serious physical harm.
Mohammad Ayaz said he and other Karachi residents were struggling to stay cool, with hundreds of people sleeping outside because of long power cuts.

Wakil Ahmed, another resident, said the weather had improved from previous days, when it was so hot it became difficult to breathe. He said Thursday brought clouds and a slight breeze.
Karachi is home to some 20 million people and has long suffered from an inefficient power grid and a shortage of potable water.

Dominique Cottrez, 51, appears with her lawyer Franck Berton, left, in the courtroom of Douai, northern France - Source: AP
One day in the summer of 2010, a man was digging in his garden in northern France when he discovered a trash bag containing the remains of an infant. When he summoned the police, they found the body of another newborn. A few days later, they found more bags in the garage - with six additional small corpses.
Police contacted the house's previous owners, and quickly discovered the horrifying explanation: Frenchwoman Dominique Cottrez confessed to secretly bearing and then killing eight of her newborns, saying she feared they were children of a long, incestuous relationship with her father.
Cottrez, a 51-year-old mother of two grown daughters, went on trial Thursday in the city of Douai, accused of multiple counts of first-degree murder of minors.
Cottrez wept as she took her seat. She faces life in prison if found guilty.
Her lawyers are expected to argue that she was a victim of rape and incest, and ask for a lesser sentence.
The worst infanticide case in modern French history stunned the country when the bodies were discovered in and around the Cottrez' former home in 2010.
Cottrez's obesity appeared to hide the pregnancies, which went unnoticed by her husband, children, neighbors, colleagues - and even doctors at a nearby hospital.

Dozens of forensic and psychiatric experts, police investigators and witnesses, including her husband, daughters and siblings, are scheduled to testify to help understand the incomprehensible, and perhaps to help the defendant open up.
A withdrawn, secretive nurse's aide, Cottrez told investigators she was raped by her father, first when she was 8 and repeatedly through her childhood and teenage years, according to judicial documents. She later entered a long, incestuous relationship with him as an adult, including after she married, and said that it became consenting - and even said she was in love with her father more than she was with her husband.
Her father died in 2007.
One of the first witnesses called to the stand Thursday is Leonard Meriaux, who bought the Cottrez family house and discovered the first corpse in 2010. He called police, who found another in the garden.
From one interrogation to another, the police went from surprise to stupor. Cottrez first admitted killing the two infants found in the garden. Then she herself informed the investigators that several other bodies were in the garage of the house, but she didn't know how many exactly, according to court documents.
She told the investigating judge that she had never used contraception or had an abortion because of a phobia of doctors. She also said she didn't keep the babies because she was afraid that they were the results of her incestuous relations with her father. She said the killing had become a "means of contraception," according to the judicial documents.
She said she told her father of the eight pregnancies and the eight murders, and investigators believe he could have helped her hide some of the bodies.
The death she described the most clearly is the first one, in 1989. She said she smothered the baby boy with sheets, placed him in a trash bag that she had prepared in advance, and put the bag in her wardrobe, according to the documents.
The second killing happened when she was hospitalized for an epilepsy seizure. She said she gave birth in the hospital toilet, strangled the child, wrapped it in plastic sheeting and towels, placed it in the closet of her hospital room and then brought it back home, hidden in her garment bag.
Her memories became blurred for the following births and deaths. The last infanticide was in 2000.
Her husband and daughters say they noticed foul odors in various parts of the house, but thought they came from sewage, or their dog, or even their father's feet.
Cottrez was released from jail in 2012 after spending two years in temporary detention. In a January interview with a local newspaper, she said: "I never gave first names to the babies. The first one, I saw he was a baby boy. The others, I didn't look, I didn't want to. But when they were in the garage, when it was cold, I went there and covered them with a blanket. "
The verdict is expected next Thursday.

A European passenger jet has made an emergency landing because it is thought there were explosives on board.
The plane, operated by Irish airline Ryanair, was forced into an emergency landing during its flight from Oslo in Norway to Warsaw in Poland due to a bomb threat, Sky News reports .
The jet landed safely at Modlin airport, near the Polish capital, while police were searching the plane using bomb disposal experts, a police spokesman told Sky News.
Ryanair later said in a statement that the Modlin Airport received an anonymous call about an explosive device on the aircraft.
"The airport security authorities ordered an immediate inspection of the aircraft and closed the airport to inbound arrivals as a security precaution."
"Warsaw Modlin believes this is a hoax call and expect the security sweep to confirm this fact. They expect to release the aircraft and reopen the airport shortly," the statement read.

Text size + -

The Confederate flag was temporarily removed from the front of the South Carolina Statehouse when a woman climbed the flagpole removing the banner.
Bree Newsome, 30, of Charlotte, North Carolina, was about halfway up the more than 9-metre steel flagpole just after dawn (local time) when officers of the South Carolina Bureau of Protective Services told her to get down. Instead, she continued climbing to the top and removed the banner. The flag was flown by forces supporting the pro-slavery, secessionist southern states in the American Civil War.
Newsome and a man who had climbed over a 1.2-metre wrought-iron fence to get to the flag were arrested.
The flag, which is protected by state law, was raised about 45 minutes later.
Later today, dozens of people holding up Confederate flags held a rally at the monument to support keeping the flag flying there. A similar rally was held outside the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, after the state's Republican governor, Robert Bentley, acted by executive order to take down Civil-War era flags outside the building.
Sherri Iacobelli, a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Public Safety, said that Newsome and James Ian Tyson, 30, also of Charlotte, have been charged with defacing monuments on state Capitol grounds. That's a misdemeanour that carries a fine of up to $US5,000 and a prison term of up to three years or both.
A staff member at the Alvin Glenn Detention Center where the two were taken said she did not know if the two had attorneys. About the time of her arrest, Newsome released an email statement to the media.
"We removed the flag today because we can't wait any longer. We can't continue like this another day," it said. "It's time for a new chapter where we are sincere about dismantling white supremacy and building toward true racial justice and equality."

Authorities said Newsome was from Raleigh. However, Mervyn Marcano, a spokesman for the small group of activists who worked together to take down the flag, said she had recently moved to Charlotte.
Calls for removing the flag have been renewed since nine black churchgoers were killed in what police characterized as a racist attack at a Charleston, South Carolina church last week.
South Carolina lawmakers took the initial steps last Tuesday toward removing the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds by agreeing to allow discussion of the matter during the legislative session.
The agreement came a day after Republican Gov. Nikki Haley reversed course and called for the divisive symbol to come down. The flag has flown in front of the state Capitol for 15 years after being moved from atop the Statehouse dome.
The momentum in South Carolina sparked further calls from politicians across the state and country for flags and Confederate symbols to be removed from public displays in other states.

        <MainBody>Fifteen Britons among dead in Tunisian beach massacre

Three ISIS 'linked' terror attacks, dozens killed in Tunisian slaughter video
Thousands of tourists fled from Tunisia after the country's worst terrorist attack killed 38 people - including 15 Britons - as the government struggles to prevent future jihadi attacks against the all-important tourism sector.
New measures to increase the numbers of troops on the streets and crack down on organizations with radical links, however, won't bring the tourists back in the short-term, further threatening the fragile economy.
When a 24-year-old Master's student at Kairouan University strolled on to the Sousse beach and pulled out a Kalashnikov assault rifle and grenades hidden inside his beach umbrella, he was sounding the death knell for Tunisia's 2015 tourist season.
Tunisian authorities identified the attacker as Seifeddine Rezgui, saying he killed 38 people, 15 of them British, as well as German, Irish, Belgian and Portuguese victims, and sent thousands of tourists fleeing to airports.
The wounded included 24 Britons, seven Tunisians, three Belgians, and a German, Russian and Ukrainian.
"It's the first time I've ever been on holiday and feared for my life," said British tourist Matthew Preece, adding it was his third time visiting Tunisia and likely his last. "So obviously you can't come back somewhere it's not safe."
Tourists and employees are returning home with tales of horror cowering in rooms or offices as the killer stalked through the hotel wearing shorts.
European countries and tour operators sent planes to evacuate their citizens. By midday Saturday, nine flights had whisked away 1,400 people, according to Mohammed Walid Ben Ghachem, manager of the Enfidha-Hammamet Airport near Sousse.
At the Imperial Marhaba Hotel itself, the guests had left, according to manager Mohammed Becheur.

"We may have zero clients today, but we will keep our staff," he said, lamenting the 75-percent occupancy rate the day before. "This summer will be hard, but we are very confident for the long term."
On the beach, there were still a few tourists from neighboring hotels. Some laid flowers at the site of the attack while police patrolling on horseback moved down the beach and security boats patrolled the waters.
Armed men on the beach may well become a more common sight in Tunisia, as Prime Minister Habib Essid announced a raft of new security measures that many have questioned why they weren't implemented after the last horrific attack against tourists in March at the National Bardo Museum that killed 22.
"It's clear that the government's security policy requires a massive revision, in the sense that most of the tourist sites weren't well-protected," Tunisian security analyst Alaya Allani said. "If the measures announced are well implemented, we could reduce but not eradicate terrorism."

Egypt faced treacherous weather conditions as a sandstorm blanketed the north of the country and a magnitude-5.2 earthquake centred in the Sinai peninsula shook buildings more than 200 miles away in the capital, Cairo.
The epicentre of the quake was 4 kilometres southeast of the beachside town of Nuweiba in the Sinai, and about 75 kilometres south of Egypt's border with Israel, according to the US Geological Survey.
Airports near Alexandria and Marsa Matrouh, along the Mediterranean coast, closed and diverted flights to Cairo due to poor visibility from the day's sandstorm, Civil Aviation Minister Hossam Kamel said in a statement. Visibility reached as low as 500 meters at the Burg al-Arab airport near Alexandria, he said.
Fierce winds whipped through the capital as many residents took cover from the sand by staying indoors. Others were seen braving the storm wearing surgical masks or covering their faces with clothing, as the wind sent rubbish and dust swirling.
At its peak, the sandstorm covered the capital in a thick orange cloud, dramatically reducing visibility.
In the Red Sea town of Dahab, 68 kilometres south of the epicentre of the quake in the Sinai peninsula, the tremor shook loose clouds of dust that enveloped nearby mountains, according to a witness. The quake appeared to startle local residents and tourists. It also shook the nearby Gaza strip. No serious damage was immediately reported from the earthquake in Egypt or in Gaza.
The Egyptian Ministry of Health said in a statement that there were no reports of deaths or injuries anywhere in Egypt due to the quake.

Israeli media reported that very mild aftershocks of the earthquake were felt in some places in the south of the country, but that no damage or injuries were caused.
The extreme weather conditions provided fodder for social media humour. Some wondered which of the nine Biblical plagues would come next, while the popular Zamalek football club tweeted that it wasn't actually an earthquake--just preparation for their match tonight.

        <MainBody>French terror suspect took selfie with beheaded victim

The top suspect in the beheading of a businessman that French authorities are calling terrorist attack took a "selfie" photo with the slain victim and sent the image via WhatsApp to a Canadian mobile phone number.
French investigators were working to confirm the identity of the recipient, but weren't able to immediately confirm media reports that it was an unspecified person now in Syria, where the radical Islamic State group has seized territory, the security officials said.
Leading suspect Yassine Salhi, a truck driver with a history of radical Islamic ties, as well as his sister and wife remained in custody in the city of Lyon a day after he allegedly crashed a truck into an US-owned chemical warehouse and hung his employer's severed head on a factory gate, officials say.
One of the security officials said the selfie was forwarded via WhatsApp, the globally popular instant messaging system owned by Facebook, to a phone number in Canada.
No group immediately claimed responsibility. The severed head appeared to mimic Islamic State's practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads for all to see, and came days after the militants urged attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. French authorities say Salhi had links to radical Salafists in the past.
Paris prosecutor's office spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said that Salhi was refusing to speak to police investigators. She said that one of the other suspects initially arrested yesterday was released without being charged.
Investigators have not turned up any motive or possible foreign connection, Thibault-Lecuivre said. Under French anti-terrorism laws, Salhi and the women can be held up to four days before either being released or handed preliminary charges and locked up.
Separately today, hundreds of people turned out in the region to honour slain businessman Herve Cornara and denounce the violence. Dozens turned out for a minute of silence in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, the town southeast of Lyon where yesterday's attack took place at an Air Products chemicals warehouse.

Several hundred people also gathered outside a housing project in the town of Fontaines-sur-Saone to honour Cornara, 54, the manager of a transportation company that had employed Salhi since March. They recalled a kind, humble man who was active in the community of the Lyon suburb.
"He lived on the fifth floor, me on the fourth. He spoke with all the young people in the neighbourhood. He didn't differentiate between (non-Muslim) French and Muslims," said Leila Bouri, a 24-year-old cafeteria cashier. "If you ever had a problem, you would go see him."
"When I heard this, I was shocked. It's shameful," she said. "I am a Muslim, but you can't kill like this. It's not who we are. In Islam, we're not told to slit throats. We only slit the throats of sheep. You don't slit the throats of people."
The suspected killer, she added, "isn't a Muslim in my opinion."

US police check out new lead on escaped New York prisoners video
One of two convicted killers who staged a brazen escape from a northern New York state maximum-security prison is engaged in a gunbattle with police just hours of the other was shot and killed shot and killed three weeks after they escaped.
An official with knowledge of the manhunt said Richard Matt was killed by police and David Sweat is still on the run.
The official wasn't authorized to talk about the development publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.
Matt and Sweat used power tools to saw through a steel cell wall and several steel steam pipes, bashed a hole through a brick wall, squirmed through pipes and escaped early June 6 from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, near the Canadian border.
Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff's deputy in 2002. Matt was serving 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss.
A civilian worker at the prison has been charged with helping the killers flee by giving them hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools.
Prosecutors said Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailoring shop instructor who got close to the men while working with them, had agreed to be their getaway driver but backed out because she felt guilty for participating.
Mitchell pleaded not guilty June 15 to charges including felony promoting prison contraband.
Authorities said the men had filled their beds in their adjacent cells with clothes to make it appear they were sleeping when guards made overnight rounds. On a cut steam pipe, the prisoners left a taunting note containing a crude caricature of an Asian face and the words "Have a nice day."

        <Link>http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/gay-couples-rush-tie-knot-after-us-same-sex-marriage-decision-6347931?ref=rss</Link>

        <MainBody>Supreme Court declares same-sex couples right to marriage in all 50 U.S. States
Benjamin Moore and Tadd Roberts wore matching tuxedos to the county clerk's office in Louisville to get married, and the mayor greeted them with a bottle of champagne.
They were among a rush of gay couples across the South and Midwest who celebrated the Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage with spontaneous weddings.
They were young and old, they wore gowns and suits or T-shirts and jeans, they kissed and waved flags that read "love wins."
"It's just been incredible and historic and amazing to live this moment," Moore said, after the mayor took commemorative photos of him and Roberts getting their license.
But the reaction wasn't so welcoming in some of the 14 states that had been the last holdouts against same-sex marriages.
In rural Alabama, the heart of the battle against gay marriage, Pike County Probate Judge Wes Allen said he would stop issuing all marriage licenses to avoid having to give them to gay couples.
Allen said Alabama law gives judges the option of granting licenses, and "I have chosen not to perform that function."
Governors in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas also railed against the ruling. And clerks in some of the affected states refused to issue licenses, citing a three-week grace period allowed by the Supreme Court or forms now out of date that specify "bridge" and "groom."
Other clerks scrambled to issue licenses as gay couples rushed to their offices.

In Arkansas, Pulaski County Clerk Larry Crane held a hand to his heart after the Supreme Court's ruling.
"It is a special day," he said, choking up. "I'm honored to be a part of it."
Jessica Dent and Carolee Taylor got married a few blocks from the courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama.
"Never thought it would happen in our lifetime," said Taylor.
After their ceremony, they returned to the courthouse to file their license, making them officially married in the conservative state that had fought back against efforts to legalize gay marriage.
After a federal judge ruled earlier this year that the state's gay marriage ban was unconstitutional, about 500 same-sex couples were married before the Alabama Supreme Court directly ordered probate judges to stop issuing the licenses.
"We waited so long. When it came through, I can't think of a better way to celebrate, the decision and our love," said Dent, walking out of the courthouse holding a sign that said "All love is equal."
The Human Rights Campaign sent letters to the governors of the 14 affected states warning that delaying issuing marriage licenses would be unlawful.

Dozens of tourists killed in Tunisian bloodbath - Source: ONE News
A young man pulled a Kalashnikov from a beach umbrella and sprayed gunfire at European sunbathers at a Tunisian resort, killing at least 39 people - one of three deadly attacks Friday from Europe to North Africa to the Middle East that followed a call to violence by Islamic State extremists.
The shootings in the Tunisian resort of Sousse happened at about the same time as a bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a U.S.-owned factory in France that included a beheading.
It was unclear if the violence was linked but it came days after the IS militants urged their followers "to make Ramadan a month of calamities for the nonbelievers."
In all, the assailants killed at least 65 people.
The SITE Intelligence Group reported later that the IS claimed credit for the Tunisia attack on its Twitter account and identified the gunman as Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani.
The attack in Tunisia, the country's worst ever, comes just months after the March 18 massacre at the national Bardo museum in Tunis that killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, and has called into question the newly elected government's ability to protect the country.
"Once again, cowardly and traitorous hands have struck Tunisia, targeting its security and that of its children and visitors," President Beji Caid Essebsi told reporters at the RIU Imperial Marhaba hotel, near the beach rampage site.
Essebsi promised "painful but necessary" measures, adding: "No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries."

Rafik Chelli, the secretary of state of the Interior Ministry, told The Associated Press that the attack was carried out by a young student not previously known to authorities. At least 36 people were reported wounded in the shooting spree, which ended when the gunman was shot to death by police.
The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at the Shiite mosque in Kuwait City that killed at least 27 people and wounded scores of other worshippers at midday prayers - the first such attack in the mostly quiet and relatively secure Gulf Arab nation in more than two decades.
In southeastern France, a man with ties to Islamic radicals rammed a car into a gas factory, touching off an explosion that injured two people. Authorities arriving at the site made a grisly discovery: the severed head of the driver's employer was found hanging at the plant entrance.
The suspect, Yassine Salhi, was seized by an alert firefighter, authorities said, and French President Francois Hollande said the attacker's intention had been to cause an explosion.
A security alert for the southeast region was raised to its highest level for the next three days, and the U.S. Embassy in Paris warned American citizens to be vigilant.
In an audio recording released Tuesday, the Islamic State called on its supporters to increase attacks during Ramadan and "be keen on waging invasion in this eminent month and commit martyrdom."
In Britain, police said they were tightening security at major events after the attacks in France, Kuwait and Tunisia, including for the weekend events of Armed Forces Day and the Pride London gay and lesbian festival.
The attacks were condemned by the United Nations, the U.S., Israel and others.
"We stand with these nations as they respond to attacks on their soil today," the White House said. Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren added it was "too soon to tell whether or not these various and far-flung attacks were coordinated centrally or whether they were coincidental."
The carnage in Tunisia began on the beach, where tourists described hearing what sounded like fireworks and then running for their lives when they realized it was gunfire. Video of the aftermath showed medics using beach chairs as stretchers to carry away people in swimsuits.
"He had a parasol in his hand. He went down to put it in the sand and then he took out his Kalashnikov and began shooting wildly," Chelli said of the gunman.
He then entered the pool area of the Imperial Marhaba hotel before moving inside, killing people as he went.
British tourist Gary Pine told AP he was on the beach with his wife around noon when heard the shooting. They shouted for their son to get out of the water, grabbed their bag and ran for the hotel. Their son told them he saw someone shot on the beach.
There was "sheer panic" at the hotel, Pine said. "There were a lot of concerned people, a few people in tears with panic and a few people - older guests - they'd turned their ankles or there was a few little minor injuries and nicks and scrapes."
Elizabeth O'Brien, an Irish tourist who was with her two sons, told Irish Radio she was on the beach when the shooting began.
"I thought, 'Oh my God. It sounds like gunfire,' so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things" before fleeing to their hotel room, she said.
Since overthrowing its secular dictator in 2011, Tunisia has been plagued by terror attacks, although only recently have they targeted the tourism sector, which makes up nearly 15 percent of GDP. Tourism is especially important in coastal resorts like Sousse.

Kiwi's near miss as sightseeing plane crashes in Alaska
A Kiwi woman's last minute decision to pull out of flight in Alaska has saved her life.
Sam Caughey's mother was due to fly on a sightseeing plane which crashed near Ella Lake in Alaska yesterday, killing all eight cruise ship passengers and the pilot on board.
But she pulled out at the last minute.
"Mum thought the weather looked too dangerous and it was making her nervous," Ms Caughey told ONE News.
Ms Caughey says her mum and a friend were on a similar cruise as the Holland America passengers who took the flight which crashed 250m above a lake on a cliff face.
"Mum and her friend had been planning a float plane flight all week and likely would have been on the same plane as the one that crashed."
It was in Seoul while waiting for a flight to London for her brother's wedding that Ms Caughey got the message from her mum saying she had just heard from the cruise's captain that the plane had crashed.
"I was really shocked. It's so crazy that such a simple choice can be life or death and I'm so glad she followed her instincts.

"We all just feel shattered for the people on board and their families. Awful, awful news."
Alaska State Troopers hope to retrieve the bodies from the crash site today after poor weather hampered the mission yesterday.

        <MainBody>Text size + -

United States President Barack Obama has banished a transsexual heckler during a civil rights speech at the White House today.
President Obama was midway through an address about lesbian, gay and transgender rights at the famous Pennsylvania Avenue home when he was rudely interrupted by a guest, The Daily Mail reports.
The person was later identified as transsexual Mexican campaigner Jennicet Gutierrez, and the abuse projected towards Obama was reportedly pre-planned to raise awareness about deportation centres.
After Ms Gutierrez failed to stop her protest, Obama intervened and said: "Okay, you know what? No, no, no, no, no. You're in my house."
"It's not respectful when you get invited ... You're not going to get a good response from me by interrupting me like this," the President said.
The crowd also started booing Ms Gutierrez, who said she was "tired of the abuse" against minorities from immigration officials in the United States.
"Shame on you. You shouldn't be doing this," Obama said, before the heckler was escorted from the White House.

An Algerian footballer was kidnapped by a group of masked, armed men and taken into the middle of the North African desert for execution before it was revealed to be a reality television stunt.
Madhid Bougherra, 32, who has played for English clubs Sheffield Wednesday and Charlton Athletic and Rangers in Scotland, was at a cafe with a friend when the elaborate prank began, Nine News reports.
Video of the practical joke shows hooded men waving weapons as they seize control of the cafe and capture the sports star.
Bougherra, who appears overwhelmed with fear, is then blindfolded and escorted by car into the Algerian desert for what appears to be a mock execution.
It is only after the footballer's blindfold is removed that it is revealed the prank was for Algerian television show Camera Cache, reportedly similar to MTV's show Punk'd.

An 8-year-old boy suffered minor injuries after being bitten by a shark yesterday while swimming in Surf City, North Carolina.
The incident is the fourth shark bite off a North Carolina beach in the past two weeks.
Town Manager Larry Bergman says the town does not plan to warn visitors about the shark bite or tell swimmers to get out of the water, but it has increased police beach patrols.
He said some beachgoers have approached police officers after hearing about the bite on social media.
Bergman said the boy had superficial wounds on his lower leg and ankle, and was treated by emergency personnel at the scene. Afterward, his parents took him to an emergency room to have the wounds cleaned.
"Police and EMS felt like it wasn't a serious bite," Bergman said.
The child had been swimming about five blocks from a fishing pier afternoon. Town policy prohibits people from swimming or surfing within 120 metres of a fishing pier, Bergman said.
On June 11, a 13-year-old girl suffered small cuts on her foot from a shark bite at Ocean Isle Beach. Three days later, two separate shark attacks occurred within 90 minutes at Oak Island, North Carolina. Both victims, ages 12 and 16, had an arm amputated after the attacks. One victim had been swimming about 100 metres from a fishing pier when she was attacked.

Pope Francis says sometimes the separation of a husband and wife may be "inevitable" or "even morally necessary" to protect the "weaker spouse or small children."
Addressing damaging dynamics within families, the Pontiff said some troubled spouses are able to overcome their problems and revive their marriages. However, he said not all separated couples can do so.
"There are cases in which separation is inevitable. Sometimes it can become even morally necessary, precisely when it comes to subtracting the weaker spouse, or small children, from more serious injuries caused by arrogance and violence, by humiliation and exploitation ... and by indifference," the pope said, at his weekly general audience.
Francis has been making a series of statements about family issues ahead of a much-anticipated October synod, or meeting, of bishops to address the topic.
The bishops will take up many issues, including how the church can be more welcoming to divorced Catholics who remarry without going through the church process that declares their first marriage null.
"Let us ask the Lord for a strong faith to see with his eyes the reality of family life, and for a deep love to approach all families with his merciful heart," Francis said.

Young women jailed for twerking in front of WWII memorial (+video) video
Twerking may be older than you think.
The provocative dance that gained global fame thanks to an attention-grabbing performance by Miley Cyrus has been admitted to the venerable Oxford English Dictionary - and lexicographers say its origins go back almost 200 years.
The dictionary now describes twerking as dancing "in a sexually provocative manner, using thrusting movements of the bottom and hips while in a low, squatting stance."
It had previously listed the word, but then to refer to a twisting or jerking movement or twitch. Researchers found it used as a noun with that meaning in 1820, spelt "twirk." It became a verb by 1848, and the "twerk" spelling was popularly used by 1901.
Senior editor Fiona McPherson called revelations about the word's roots "quite spectacular."
She said the word as a description of a dance has its roots in the 1990s New Orleans music scene.
Other new entries, announced Thursday, include social-media term "twitterati" and smokers' helper "e-cigarette."
The OED charts the historical development of the English language and has stricter admission criteria than other Oxford dictionaries. New entries must have been in use in both news stories and fiction for at least 10 years.

If the mothers of the world needed any more proof that motorcycles are dangerous, this crash is it.
Jesse Lopez, 24, was out for a cruise in the Angeles National Forest in California, so he strapped a GoPro to his head to capture the day.
Except when he entered a blind bend, instead of recording the sights, he captured what could have easily been his death.
Mr Lopez smashed into a truck, which was travelling around 80km/h at the time of impact, NBC Los Angeles reported.
"I don't remember what happened due to memory loss, but I might have panicked when I saw the truck," Mr Lopez told NBC LA.
"So I applied the front brake, which straightened me out and I went straight toward the truck."
Mr Lopez miraculously survived, suffering a broken femur, tibia, fibula, ulna and humerus.
The truck's driver was not injured.

Six tigers, seven baboons, four camels and three dromedaries have been found abandoned in cages without food, water or adequate care in the southern Mexico state of Yucatan.
The passage of laws forbidding animal acts in circuses has raised fears that the exotic species might be abandoned once they could no longer pay for their keep by performing.
The Attorney General's Office for Environmental Protection said a total of 20 animals were found near the city of Merida, many missing claws, teeth or fur.
Many were underweight or had scars or skin infections and the animals were seized.
A circus had been set up nearby.
"Circuses are urged to avoid fines for abandoning exotic animals," the office said. Circus owners say they will no longer be able to feed the animals if they can't show them.

Hungary will build a temporary fence on the border with Serbia as fast as possible to stop the flow of illegal migrants, the foreign minister said.
Austria, meanwhile, reacted angrily to Hungary's announcement that, for an indefinite period, it would not take back refugees it registered when they entered Hungary but left for other destinations in Europe before their asylum requests were decided.
Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said several laws needed to be amended before construction of the fence could begin so he could not say exactly when the work on the "temporary border seal" could start.
"In the future, we will apply temporary border seals on every border section where there is no other effective way to impede illegal immigration," Szijjarto said, adding that the government had set aside 6.5 billion forints (20.9 million euros) for the project.
Szijjarto said the fence, which is opposed by neighbouring Serbia, "is not a bilateral issue. Relations with Serbia have never been as good as now."
He said 61,000 migrants had entered Hungary this year, nearly all by crossing Hungary's southern border with Serbia. Most of those who request refugee status in Hungary quickly leave for other destinations in western Europe, like Austria, Germany and Sweden.
Austria's Foreign Ministry said that Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz told Szijjarto that Hungary's suspension of the agreement on refugees was "unacceptable."

Authorities say two men were bitten by sharks off the coasts of the Carolinas, bringing to six the number of attacks in the past two weeks.
A 47-year-old man was bitten multiple times in the back in waters off North Carolina's Outer Banks today.
The other, a 43-year-old man, was attacked by a shark near Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Both were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries.
Sharks have attacked several children along North Carolina's coast this month, including a 13-year old girl who lost her left arm below the elbow and a 16-year old boy who lost his left arm above the elbow.

Invoking scripture and song, President Barack Obama stood before those grieving the deaths of nine black people slain in church and sang Amazing Grace to the mourners of last week's church shooting.
He closed his rousing address which called on Americans to confront the "uncomfortable truths" of the racial prejudices that still infect American society by singing the words to the famous Christian hymn Amazing Grace.
The US president also called on Americans not to "lose our way again" by failing to reckon with the questions stirred in the past week.
Eulogizing the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the pastor and legislator that was killed in the attack, Obama said it would be a betrayal of everything the man stood for "if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again once the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on."
He pleaded with Americans not "to go back to business as usual."
Obama, in his 40-minute address, spoke movingly of all that Pinckney had done in his life, then confronted the hard questions raised by his death and the deaths of eight others slain by a white man.
He said it was time to remove the Confederate flag from American flagpoles, saying that action would "not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers" but an acknowledgement that "the cause for which they fought, the cause of slavery, was wrong," as was racial segregation and resistance to civil rights efforts.
The Confederate battle flag represented the southern states in the 19th century US civil war, in which northern states fought to abolish slavery and the South fought to preserve it.

Removing the flag, he said, "would be one step in an honest accounting of America's history, a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds."
The president called, too, for an American reckoning with the nation's history of gun violence, saying "for too long we've been blind to the mayhem that gun violence inflects upon this nation."
The deaths of Pinckney and eight others sparked spirited debate in Southern states over the Confederate battle flag, which for years has flown at a monument on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse.
Following the service for Pinckney, the president was expected to meet privately with the families of other victims.

Gay and lesbian couples already can marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia.
The court's 5-4 ruling means the remaining 14 states, in the South and Midwest, will have to stop enforcing their bans on same-sex marriage.
The outcome is the culmination of two decades of Supreme Court litigation over marriage, and gay rights generally.
The decision saw celebrities take to social media to celebrate the decision.

        <MainBody>French beheading suspect previously investigated for radical Islamic ties

A truck driver once under surveillance for radical Islamic ties crashed into an American-owned chemical warehouse in southeastern France and hung his employer's severed head on a factory gate, along with banners with Arabic inscriptions.
The attack, which triggered an explosion that wounded two people, came on a day of violence that spanned three continents.
The suspect is the latest French citizen implicated in extremist bloodshed in recent years after being flagged to authorities, then falling off the radar.
Police were put on higher alert in the Lyon area after the assault, which revived fearful memories of attacks in January on a kosher market and satirical newspaper that left 20 dead.
"Islamist terrorism has again struck France," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
The attack in France came on the same day that a gunman mowed down scores of European tourists on a beach in Tunisia and a suicide bomber killed more than two dozen worshippers at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait - violence that
followed a call by Islamic State extremists to target "nonbelievers."
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the factory attack in France.
The severed head appeared to mimic the Islamic State group's practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads for all to see, and came days after the militants urged attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The bloodshed was condemned by the United Nations, the United States, Israel and others.
The French attack began when Yassine Salhi drove a utility truck to the gate of the Air Products factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, southeast of Lyon, authorities said.
Prosecutor Francois Molins said Salhi was known to factory staff because he regularly made deliveries there, and they let him in the gate. Once beyond the sight of security cameras, Salhi plowed his truck into gas canisters in a factory warehouse, touching off an explosion, Molins said.
A knife and the decapitated body of Salhi's employer were found at the site of the explosion, and the severed head was posted on a gate at the factory entrance with two flags bearing proclamations of Islamic faith, the prosecutor said.
Firefighters apprehended Salhi, and he was in custody along with his wife, sister and another person, while police sweeps of the vehicle and the suspect's apartment were continuing, the prosecutor said.
Authorities described Salhi as a father of three who was married for more than 10 years, and who had been monitored for links to radical Islam from 2006-2008. "He continued to attract the attention of intelligence services from time to time from 2011 to 2014 for his links to the Salafist movement in the Lyon region," Molins said.

He is the latest Frenchman to have been on authorities' radar before staging attacks in recent years. Others include Mohamed Merah, who attacked a Jewish school in 2012, Mehdi Nemmouche, chief suspect in a 2014 attack on Brussels
Jewish Museum, and two of the gunmen in the January shootings in Paris.
"We are dealing with 'sleeper' terrorists who are able to disappear from the surveillance radar for years and then reappear," Parliament member Georges Fenech, on a commission for surveillance of jihadist networks, told reporters near the factory.
"It's really important to reflect and act to make sure that this surveillance lasts as long as possible. If not, we can have perpetrators of attacks who have been located, but who disappear off all surveillance."
President Francois Hollande raised the security alert for the southeastern region to its highest level for the next three days. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said security was tightened at religious sites around the country.
Three French officials said the man who was decapitated ran a local transportation company that employed Salhi. The victim's name was not released. One official said the businessman was believed to have been killed before the attack on the factory. The officials were not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity.
Hollande said the key question was determining whether there were any accomplices.
Others, including Salhi's wife, were seen on television being taken into custody from his apartment building in the Lyon suburb of Saint Priest hours after the attack.
The Paris Mosque condemned the attack, and a Muslim forklift operator who lives next to the factory described his horror and fear of reprisals.
"Doing this during Ramadan is disrespectful," said Mehdi, a 23-year-old who did not want his full name published out of security concerns. Wearing a long white Muslim robe, he said: "There are Muslims who have nothing to do with these
things. Now they find themselves mixed up in this story for nothing."
No further details were released about the two people injured in the explosion, though Hollande said their injuries were light.
The gas factory belongs to Air Products, an American chemical company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and owned by Seifi Ghasemi, an Iranian immigrant. The company said all its employees had been accounted for and were evacuated from the premises but did not say if any had been injured.

Hundreds of far right supporters have rallied against immigration and Islam in the Czech Republic's second largest city Brno, while others gathered nearby in support of immigration.
The rally follows a similar demonstration in the Slovak capital of Bratislava today which turned violent. They reflect the rising tensions surrounding immigration Europe, even in countries that have not been significantly hit by the recent wave of asylum-seekers.
Riot police separated the groups and were pelted with objects such as beer cans and bottles by the anti-migrants protesters.
Tomas Vandas, the leader of the far right Workers Party of Social Justice condemned the decision of EU leaders to relocate 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece in Europe and demanded they are sent back to their countries of origin.

The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States.
Gay and lesbian couples already can marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The court's 5-4 ruling means the remaining 14 states, in the South and Midwest, will have to stop enforcing their bans on same-sex marriage.
The outcome is the culmination of two decades of Supreme Court litigation over marriage, and gay rights generally.
"No union is more profound than marriage," wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by the court's four more liberal justices.
The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration.
But some state officials and county clerks might decide there is little risk in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
The cases before the court involved laws from several states that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.

Those states have not allowed same-sex couples to marry within their borders and they also have refused to recognize valid marriages from elsewhere.
Just two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law that denied a range of government benefits to legally married same-sex couples.
The decision in United States v. Windsor did not address the validity of state marriage bans, but courts across the country, with few exceptions, said its logic compelled them to invalidate state laws that prohibited gay and lesbian couples from marrying.
The number of states allowing same-sex marriage has grown rapidly. As recently as October, just over one-third of the states permitted same-sex marriage.
There are an estimated 390,000 married same-sex couples in the United States, according to Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, which tracks the demographics of gay and lesbian Americans. Another 70,000 couples living in states that do not currently permit them to wed would get married in the next three years, the institute says.
Roughly 1 million same-sex couples, married and unmarried, live together in the United States, the institute says.
The Obama administration backed the right of same-sex couples to marry. The Justice Department's decision to stop defending the federal anti-marriage law in 2011 was an important moment for gay rights and President Barack Obama declared his support for same-sex marriage in 2012.

Young girls have gone bananas for perhaps the most handsome ape in captivity.
Shabani, a western lowland gorilla, has been described as a "heart-throb" and responsible for a huge spike in female visitor numbers at the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens in Japan, News Corp reports.
Originally from Sydney's Taronga Zoo, Shabani has been admired for his "brooding poses", "ripped muscles" and "flirtatious glances".

A Kiwi on holiday in Alaska very nearly boarded a tourist flight which has crashed today.
The sightseeing plane crashed near Ella Lake in Alaska, the Holland America cruise line said in a statement today, and the condition of the plane and its passengers was not known.
The United States Coastguard and Alaskan authorities were on their way to the site, more than 250m above a lake on a cliff face.
Kiwi Sam Caughey tweeted that her mother was very nearly on that flight.
"Just got word from my mum...she pulled out of a scenic flight in Alaska...plane just reported as crashed," she wrote.
"What a near miss. So sorry to all those on board."
Eight passengers and a pilot were aboard the floating plane owned by Promech Air.

        <MainBody>Will Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev become a martyr? video
Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized for the deadly attack for the first time today, just before a judge formally sentenced him to death.
"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the damage that I've done, irreparable damage," the 21-year-old college student said, breaking more than two years of public silence.
To the victims, he said: "I pray for your relief, for your healing."
His five-minute speech included religious references and praise of Allah. He paused several times, looking as if he was trying to remain composed. He stood and faced the judge while speaking, but spoke of the victims.
The apology came after Tsarnaev listened impassively for about three hours as victims and their loved ones lashed out at him for his "cowardly" and "disgusting" acts.
"He can't possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing," said Karen Rand McWatters, who lost a leg in the attack and whose best friend, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, was killed.
Campbell's mother, Patricia Campbell, spoke directly to Tsarnaev.
"What you did to my daughter is disgusting," she said. "I don't know what to say to you. I think the jury did the right thing."
The judge was required under law to impose the jury's death sentence for the April 15, 2013, attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260.

An appeal is automatic in death penalty cases.
The only real suspense today was whether Tsarnaev would say anything when given a chance to speak near the end of the proceedings. He had said almost nothing publicly since his arrest more than two years ago.
U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. said no one will remember that Tsarnaev's teachers or friends were fond of him. What they will remember is that he "murdered and maimed innocent people" and "did it willfully and intentionally."
Tsarnaev looked down and rubbed his hands together as the judge sentenced him.

Embarrassed by leaked conversations of three successive French presidents and angered by new evidence of uninhibited American spying, France is demanding answers from the Obama administration while calling for an intelligence "code of conduct" between allies.
France's foreign minister summoned the US ambassador to respond to the WikiLeaks revelations, as French eyes fixed on the top floor of the US Embassy after reports that a nest of NSA surveillance equipment was concealed behind elaborately painted windows there, just down the block from the presidential Elysee Palace.
"Commitments were made by our American allies. They must be firmly recalled and strictly respected," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said. "Being loyal doesn't mean falling into line."
President Barack Obama told French President Francois Hollande in a phone conversation that the US wasn't targeting his communications. The White House said Obama told Hollande that the US was abiding by a commitment Obama made in 2013 not to spy on the French leader after Edward Snowden disclosed the extent of NSA surveillance powers.
The White House said Obama also pledged to continue close cooperation with France on matters of intelligence and security.
If not a surprise, the latest revelations put both countries in something of a quandary.
France's counter-espionage capabilities were called into question at the highest level. The United States, meanwhile, was shown not only to be eavesdropping on private conversations of its closest allies but also to be unable to keep its own secrets.

Comedian offers to sell drugs to pair of cops (0:44)
An American comedienne faced no consequences after trying to sell two police officers antidepressants in a video she made to illustrate white privilege.
Jessie Kahnweiler, 30, posted a video to YouTube which she captioned: "Jessie sets out to see if white privilege really exists and can she get arrested or will her whiteness prevent it?"
The video comes at a time when racial tensions in parts of America with police are high, with several high-profile cases of undue police force against minorities hitting the headlines recently.
"My one black friend told me that because I'm white, I have all of these privileges, and I get treated totally different by the cops than black people get treated," she says in the video.
In the video, she drinks in public, cartwheels naked in front of a restaurant and ultimately tries to sell prescription medicine to police officers - with no apparent consequences.
"Those are prescribed drugs, and you are becoming a drug dealer by selling them," a police offer tells her.
"Oh, sorry!" she says, and walks away.

A nonprofit organisation that claimed it could turn gay men straight violated New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act, a jury concluded in a civil trial that an attorney for the plaintiffs called "a momentous event" for LGBT rights.
The jury said that Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing, co-founder Arthur Goldberg and counsellor Alan Downing made misrepresentations and engaged in unconscionable business practices.
Three men and two parents were awarded more than $100,000 in damages.
The judge will rule later on their request to revoke the company's license, plaintiffs' attorneys said.
"This is a momentous event in the history of LGBT rights," attorney David Dinielli said. "The same lies that motivate gay conversion therapy motivate homophobia - that gay people are broken and need to be fixed. The strength of our plaintiffs brought that to light."
Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued during the trial that the group, known by the acronym JONAH, claimed a success rate that wasn't backed up by actual statistics and used therapy methods that had no scientific basis, including having one client beat a pillow, meant to represent his mother, with a tennis racket.
In an emailed statement, defence attorney Charles LiMandri called the verdict "a sad day, not just for my clients, but for America."

At least 749 people have been killed in a scorching heat wave in Pakistan as temperatures have begun to drop in the country.
Officials say the hardest-hit has been the port city of Karachi where temperatures have soared to 45 degrees Celsius.
Meteorologists say the heat wave is the worst in at least a decade.
Hours-long power outages, little running water and the majority of people fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan had worsened the situation.
However slightly cooler temperatures yesterday appeared to be helping.
Hospital officials said admittances had dropped compared to previous days, when dehydrated patients lay in corridors and outside of clinics.

Ebola ruled out for healthcare worker video
Despite hopes that the deadly Ebola outbreak could soon be contained in West Africa, it shows no signs of abating in Guinea and may be flaring up once more in Sierra Leone as people are flouting rules limiting travel meant to stop it.
The election in Guinea in October adds a new layer of worry for Guineans and health workers, with some residents saying that campaign events, in which people crowd together, shouldn't be held yet.
The deadly virus, which has killed over 11,100 people mostly in West Africa in its worst outbreak ever, has been stamped out in neighboring Liberia, but is hanging on stubbornly in Guinea, where the Ebola outbreak was first reported in March 2014. Impending presidential elections could make it even worse.
"Ebola is on the rise again because of population movements. People move from one place to another," said Dr. Amadou Talibe, an Ebola response team worker in Dubreka, 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of capital, Conakry. "People who have come into contact with Ebola but have not been identified, they go to another village and only then develop the symptoms of Ebola and then contaminate others."
In Dubreka, a burial team put on protective equipment and sprayed themselves before entering a facility to collect the body of a baby, not even 20 hours old. They left with the newborn, wrapped and on a stretcher, for safe burial.
The virus, which is transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone showing Ebola symptoms, has killed more than 2,400 people in Guinea, officials estimate. New cases keep cropping up because some communities refuse to follow safe burial practices, among other reasons.
Intense efforts are being made to identify the chain of transmission for the most recent cases, with checkpoints on roads and tracking down those infected. Some people are nervous about election campaigning.
"You have a lot of people gathering here. We are at risk of Ebola, yet we are gathering here. There are no preventative measures for us," said Abubacar Sylla at a campaign event in Conakry last week for President Alpha Conde.
Ebola also returned to Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, last week after being absent for 18 consecutive days, officials there said. A third case was confirmed in government figures released Tuesday.
The first new case popped up in Freetown after a young man sick with the disease in another part of Sierra Leone ran away from a quarantine area and came to Freetown, said Patrick Fatoma, a spokesman for the National Ebola Response Center.

"Infected people are still running away from quarantine areas with the consequences of infecting other people. Right now we have 12 suspected high risk people on the run from the (Northern) Port Loko District," he said
Fatoma said health workers are mobilizing and engaging the local community so they are more aware of bad practices, providing support to quarantined homes and enforcing curfews in hotspots.
"If people do not change their attitude, there are bound to be more Ebola cases," he said.

In a sweeping victory for Dutch environmental activists that could have global repercussions, a court ordered the government today to cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020.
The ruling by The Hague District Court could lay the foundations for similar cases around the world, said the director of the organisation that took the government to court on behalf of 900 Dutch citizens.
The plaintiffs argued - and the court agreed - that the government has a legal obligation to protect its people against looming dangers, including the effects of climate change on this low-lying country, much of which is below sea level and vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by global warming.
"This is a great victory - the judge said exactly what we wanted and had the courage and wisdom to say to the government 'you have a duty of care toward your citizens,'" said Marjan Minnesma, director of Urgenda, the group that filed the case.
Climate activists in the packed courtroom clapped and cheered as Presiding Judge Hans Hofhuis read the ruling.
"A courageous judge. This is fantastic," said Sharona Ceha, another Urgenda worker. "This is for my children and grandchildren."
Dutch government lawyers swiftly left the courtroom after the judgment and could not immediately be reached for comment.

The court said, based on current government climate policy, the Netherlands will cut its emissions by only 17% by 2020, compared with benchmark 1990 levels.
"The state must do more to avert the imminent danger caused by climate change, also in view of its duty of care to protect and improve the living environment," read a statement from the court.
The Dutch government can appeal the ruling to a higher court.
It remains unclear exactly how the court can enforce its ruling. It has the power to impose fines for failure to carry out its orders, but never uses such powers against the government and Urgenda did not request such a move, said judge Peter Blok.

French taxi drivers pulled out the throttle in an all-out confrontation with the ultra-cheap Uber car service, smashing livery cars, setting tires ablaze and blocking traffic during a nationwide strike that caught tourists and celebrities alike in the mayhem.
Travellers going to and from the airport were forced to walk alongside highways with their bags, while others, including singer Courtney Love, had their cars set upon by striking taxi drivers.

The French government was aghast, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls lamenting: "These incidents give a deplorable image to visitors of our country."
Taxi drivers justified their rage, saying Uber's lowest-cost service UberPop was ruining their livihoods.
Despite repeated rulings against it and an October law that explicitly outlaws UberPop, its drivers continue to ply French roads and the American ride-hailing company is actively recruiting drivers and passengers alike. Uber claims to have a total of 400,000 customers a month in France.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve rushed back from a trip to Marseille to meet with taxi unions, declaring afterward that UberPop must be shut down and its vehicles seized if caught by police carrying passengers. He said 70 vehicles had been damaged around France in yesterday's protests and 10 people were arrested.
Taxi drivers in other European countries also complain that car services like Uber unfairly undercut them.
A judge ordered a temporary suspension in Spain, and in the Netherlands a Dutch court has ruled that UberPop must stop service. A world away, in China, the government banned drivers of private cars from offering services through an app.
