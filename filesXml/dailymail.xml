	The 21st-century police ‘service’ seem to model themselves on Monty Python, concentrating on so-called ‘crimes’ that most people wouldn’t consider illegal, writes RICHARD LITTLEJOHN.

The inspector glances around him and replies: Yeah, all right.
Fast forward 40 years and there would be nothing unusual about the police refusing to investigate the theft of a wallet. Nor would the portrayal of a homosexual police inspector be considered remotely funny.
These days if Cleese and Palin poked fun at a gay copper, theyd probably find themselves up at the Old Bailey charged with hate crime.
These days if John Cleese and Michael Palin (pictured) poked fun at a gay copper, theyd probably find themselves up at the Old Bailey charged with hate crime
A couple of other Plod-related sketches come to mind, too. One involved Terry Jones attempting to report a burglary at a police station, where the officers only spoke in silly voices. That joke wouldnt work today, either. For a start, the odds of finding a police station open to report a burglary are right up there with Ukip forming the next government in coalition with Plaid Cymru.
And the only silly voices on offer would be the computer-generated platitudes at a remote call-centre. All our operators are busy playing Grand Theft Auto on their iPhones. To hear this menu in Swahili, press three...
The other was set in a courtroom, where a PC played by Palin reads out the charge against the defendant. You are hereby charged ... that you conspired to do things not normally considered illegal...
I precis, but you get the gist.
Conspiring to do things not normally considered illegal was the basis of the recent malicious prosecution of innocent journalists under an obscure 13th-century statute against misconduct in public office.
The 21st-century police service seem to model themselves on Monty Python, concentrating on so-called crimes that most people wouldnt consider against the law, while conspicuously refusing to do the job theyre paid for.
Her Majestys Inspector of Constabulary reported that the police were telling the public to investigate crimes themselves. For instance, burglary and vandalism victims were expected to check CCTV evidence and interview neighbours before troubling the Old Bill.
Many officers had given up investigating what he called high volume crimes and concluded: Effectively, whats happened is that a number of crimes are on the verge of being decriminalised.
This week, Kent Police told people who find lost items that they are now responsible for tracing the owners, either by going door to door or advertising on Facebook and Twitter.
As if that isnt bad enough, they are also warning people that if they keep lost property without making an effort to trace the owners they could be charged with theft by finding, which is a crime under the 1968 Theft Act and carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.
Theft by finding sounds like something from Monty Python.
I dont know whether to file it under Mind How You Go or You Couldnt Make It Up.
Ukip candidate Kim Rose, 57, was questioned by police after being accused of bribing voters with sausage rolls
Nigel Farage defends Ukip candidate following 'sausage roll gate'
Meanwhile, the election has given the Old Bill another excuse to make a nuisance of themselves. A Tory candidate in Herefordshire found himself being investigated for allegedly bribing people to vote for him, after he was spotted on the campaign trail carrying a box of chocolate muffins and some cherry Bakewell tarts.
In Southampton, a Ukip candidate was interviewed by the Old Bill over allegations he had laid on sausage rolls and Jaffa Cakes at an election event.
Far more sinister has been the intervention of police in Northern Ireland, where the socially-conservative DUP candidate voiced his disapproval of children being brought up by homosexuals.
They said they would question Jim Wells after complaints that he was guilty of hate speech. They also intend to gather evidence and speak to concerned citizens.
You dont have to approve of what Mr Wells said to be deeply disturbed by this development, especially in the middle of what is supposed to a democratic election.
Here is yet another example of the police acting as the paramilitary wing of the dominant, Left-wing political class. Investigating candidates for expressing inappropriate opinions is a fundamental characteristic of a police state.
(Compare and contrast this outrageous case with the appalling failure of the police to investigate serial sex crimes in Rotherham and political corruption in Tower Hamlets because they didnt want to upset the local Muslim community.)
I know, I know. I keep promising to go easy on the police. But what got me started on this riff was the news that a former Monty Python cameraman had been arrested and interviewed for two hours over a series of posters poking fun at local politicians. John Wellard, 71, said six officers turned up at his house and started searching through his belongings, which seems to be standard police procedure these days.
Mr Wellard refused to comment on the allegations, but did say: Lampoonery and satire have been part of the British way of life for centuries. I do not believe any offence has been committed.
Which brings us back to Monty Pythons trumped up charge of conspiring to do things not normally illegal. At least Mr Wellard could joke about it: I didnt expect the Spanish Inquisition.
And where did this latest abuse of police power take place? Faversham, in Kent. Yes, Kent  where the police say they are so stretched because of the cuts they are no longer willing to take in lost property.
Yet they can rustle up six  six  coppers to arrest a pensioner for the not normally illegal offence of poking fun at a bunch of po-faced local politicians.
And now for something completely different...

Progressive? No, this is the sound of the Seventies
Ive written before about the way the Left have managed to turn the English language on its head.
Fascist bigots are now free to describe themselves as liberals. Extortionate tax rates are called fair.
The word which really drives me tonto is progressive, which actually means the opposite. The policies favoured by progressives couldnt be more regressive and would drag us back to the dark days of Seventies socialism.
One of the most bizarre 'progressive' Seventies supergroups wasGinger Bakers Air Force, which featured about 15 different drummers
In fact, when I hear progressive I always think of those self-indulgent Seventies supergroups, famous for their ear-splitting 20-minute drum and guitar solos.
One of the most bizarre was Ginger Bakers Air Force, which featured about 15 different drummers. An Air Force concert was like being locked a cement mixer for the evening. They should have called it Ginger Bakers Air Raid.
Which, come to think of it, will be whats in store if we end up with a Labour-led progressive government next Friday.
Only it wont just last a night, itll be a nightmare that goes on for five years.

It's enough to drive anyone to drink...
Five years ago, the Tories promised to scrap the European Yuman Rites Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.
Predictably, the Lib Dems stamped their little Fairtrade bootees and it didnt happen. So were still lumbered with this pernicious affront to justice.

The 53-year-old man, who cant be identified  that would breach his yuman rites, obviously  argued that if he was sent back he would face persecution because alcohol is illegal in Libya.
This ludicrous case has already cost us more than 100,000 in legal fees. So at least the lawyers have had a nice drink out of it.
Trebles all round.

Funniest story of the week was the news that the all-singing, all-dancing Apple watch wont work on someone with tattoos.

Maybe they could persuade her to pose in a bikini. If that doesnt convince the chubsters to diet, nothing will.

Previous seasons have featured shots of the candidates leaving the home they share before setting off for Lord Sugar's boardroom in a line of waiting taxis.
Residents fear they will be forced to look for parking spaces elsewhere in order to give the production company more space to film these shots, which are among the most well-known in the show.
One resident told the Camden New Journal: 'It really isnt fair to suspend so many parking bays over such a long time.
Apprentice contestants make their way into the line of taxis
It is understood that candidates will be based on the upmarket road in Holborn, London, over the coming weeks as they film the eleventh season
'The council may talk to the producers about it, but when were we asked whether wed like The Apprentice house to be in our street and all that that means?'
Camera crews were reportedly spotted in the area over the weekend.
The upmarket area of London is popular with production companies who have featured the elegant townhouses in a number of TV shows, including period drama Mr Selfridge.
A Camden Council spokesperson said: 'We are proud that Camden is such a thriving destination for the film and TV industry and encourage the economic benefits that filming brings.
'As with all filming requests that we receive, minimising disruption to residents is our most important consideration.
'We have set out our expectations with the production company and are assessing the impacts of different parking plans on local residents to ensure any concerns from local residents are taken into account.'
MailOnline has contacted the BBC and Freemant le, producers of The Apprentice, for comment.

	Wedding fraudster Sarah Cawthorne who conned brides out of more than £30k jailed

	Mother-of-two Sarah Cawthorne, 32, of Sedgley, promised hundreds of couples celebrity-style receptions but instead conned them out of £30,000 to fund her gambling addiction.
      </Description>

Yesterday she sobbed as she was jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to fraudulent trading.
Her solicitor, Mukhtar Ubhi, said his client had been suffering from a gambling addiction combined with depression.
He added Cawthorne had never set out to con her clients.
But today, her furious victims have hit out and revealed how her con affected them on their big days.
Jade Caddick, 32, from Birmingham, and her husband Andrew, 39, paid her a total of 1,053 for wedding decorations for their wedding venue - the Castle Hotel in Tamworth, West Midlands.
Victim Sarah Broadley (pictured) said she was left devastated by Cawthorne's deceit over her wedding in 2013
Caren Larkman-Ayre, 31, pictured, told the Mail how her wedding venue had been left bare when none of the decorations ordered from Cawthorne arrived
Their package had been for two Ferrero Rocher trees, a starlit dance floor, tables with chair covers and candelabras as well as a candy buffet.
And it was only on the morning of her wedding in September 2013 that the mother-of-one discovered she had been conned.
Cawthorne failed to show up on the day - forcing Jade to spend another 400 for last-minute decorations from the hotel.
She said: 'At the time I just couldn't believe it. I don't understand how you could do that to somebody.
'We paid Sarah to do everything from chair covers, to flowers and centre pieces.'
Cawthorne, from Dudley, West Midlands, promised to meet brides on their wedding day but cancelled at the last minute
But she added: 'I wasn't actually that surprised when she didn't turn up. I started to get bad vibes a few weeks before when I saw some comments on the internet about her company.
'Before I booked her, I did my research and saw loads of positive reviews.
'Sarah seemed really professional and I was really looking forward to seeing what she could do but a couple of weeks before the wedding that all seemed to change.
'I had to complete the payment to her eight weeks before the wedding but from then on, she stopped replying to my calls.
'I tried every way of contacting her: Facebook, email, phone, WhatsApp but she didn't respond at all.'
She added: 'I was really stressed and couldn't sleep but in the end the hotel staff had to bail me out and provide the decorations.
'To be fair they did an amazing job and really saved the day but that doesn't excuse what Sarah did.
'I've been in touch with the other brides Sarah conned and the overriding feeling has always been frustration. At least now we've finally got justice.'
She added: 'I am really pleased with the sentence.
'I wrote off the money because I felt like I had to so the jail sentence makes up for that.'
Caren Larkman-Ayre, 31, told the Mail how her wedding venue had been left bare when none of the decorations ordered from Cawthorne arrived.
Two years on, she remembers her marriage morning as filled with tears and panic as she tried to hastily find replacements.
The sales manager, from West Yorkshire, said: 'Two hours before my wedding I was frantically ringing around everyone I knew. Every time anyone came to speak to me I just burst into tears. I didn't know what was going to happen.'
She added: 'It might not sound much but it's your wedding day  it's something you have been planning for years, since you were a child.'
On top of the 484 deposit she lost, Mrs Larkman-Ayre had to spend around 1,000 ordering in hastily arranged replacement decorations for her big day.
Sarah Broadley was left in tears on the morning of her wedding after A Little Bit of Bling failed to turn up with the decorations she had chosen.
She eventually received a message which blamed a 'family emergency'. Their wedding venue made last minute arrangements to make sure her wedding to fiance Ben went smoothly, but she had to pay an extra 300 for their help.
And Jenna Batty paid the company 1,400 to provide the decorations for her wedding at the Buchan Braes Hotel in Peterhead, Scotland.
She and fiance Ian King had selected bouquets, centrepieces, chair covers, a chocolate fountain, starlit backdrop and Mr and Mrs signs.
But Jenna was devastated when she saw a post on Facebook from the company stating that it had ceased trading, leaving her with a frantic scramble to make alternative arrangements.
Jenna Batty and Ian King from Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, saw their wedding plans left in tatters

	Susanna Reid defends her flirty interview style after David Cameron interview
      </title>

	Good Morning Britain host Susanna Reid, 44, has been criticised for her interviewing style, after she giggled and was seen nibbling her pen while interviewing prime minister David Cameron.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Buy now
Ms Reid has recently interviewed the likes of David Beckham, Jeremy Renner, Alex Turner and Tom Cruise and has often garnered attention for her light-hearted  interviewing style.
The mother-of-three, who split from partner of 16 years Dominic Cotton last year, says she does not get star-struck and says some of her exchanges had been reported in a mischievous way.
Last week she  said she interviews the way she does because she does not want to come across as rude and stonewalling.
She said: Any interviewer's mission is to get the best from a guest. I enjoy the interviews I do and it would be bizarre, wouldn't it, if I didn't laugh at a guest's joke, or didn't smile?'
Ms Reid made her most recent comments as part of an Evening Standard magazine feature on women in broadcast which also interviewed Sky's Kay Burley and BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat presenter Tina Daheley.
Ms Reid (pictured left and right with Tom Cruise) insists she does not flirt with male guests on the show
In the interview the Sky News TV anchor said that female news presenters face more criticism than their male counterparts.
Ms Burley made the claim after critics said she was 'too hard' on Labour leader Ed Miliband during an interview, arguing 'no one would accuse Paxman of being an over-tough interview.'
She said that people are more 'openly critical' of her if she is tough because she is a woman.
Ms Burley also said that she hopes having three female party leaders in the election debates makes a difference to how women are represented.
She said someone had suggested to her that a woman who would be 50 at the next election would be 'too old to be a candidate' and that had 'made her blood boil'.
'Imagine someone saying that to a man,' she said. 'They wouldn't.'
Radio 1 Newsbeat presenter Tina Daheley, 35, told the magazine her celebrity friends think she is 'really cool' for working in news.

FLIRTY OR FRIENDLY? SUSANNA'S MOSTEMBARRASSINGMOMENTS
Viewers often comment on how Ms Reid becomes flirty when she interviews handsome men, playing with her hair, nibbling her pen and giggling at their answers.
She previously raised eyebrows when Luke Evans nuzzled into her neck as he promoted his film Dracula: Untold.
She told the actor she was 'a bit scared' of him, then proceeded to let him pretend to bite her neck in homage to his film role as Vlad the Impaler.
After the bizarre moment, Ms Reid quipped, 'That was quite nice, actually,' before the pair dissolved into fits of laughter.
In her most recent interview with actor Jeremy Renner the Avenger star said he would need to be in better shape to take part in Soccer Aid.
Ms Reid then told the actor, 'You look in pretty good shape by the way  you look in great shape.'
Explaining her comment, she said to co-host Ben Shepherd: 'I thought that was an invitation for you to say that but as you didn't, I thought I better.'
'Well I think it's probably better coming from you,' Ben explained.
Susanna Reid flirts outrageously with Luke Evans on GMB
As Renner giggled, she went on: You look in great shape ... and now you've landed me in it. I always get into trouble for that kind of thing.
She also caused a storm during an unfortunate interview with Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens in September, when she unintentionally made an embarrassing double entendre.
The interviewer asked him if he had to 'beat off a lot of American men' for his latest part in a Hollywood film - not realising that the innocent question could be misinterpreted.
When she spoke to football star David Beckham earlier this year, Ms Reid smiled and laughed through the interview as she asked him about his relationship with his children.
Ms Reid also caused some raised eyebrows during an interview with Arctic Monkeys singer Alex Turner, who is 15 years her junior, when the pair appeared to get on like a house on fire.
Ms Reid asked: 'When I said I was interviewing you, people did say, 'Would he do Strictly?', because they bet that you look good on the dance floor.'
The musician replied: 'Of course... I should have been the one that said you look good on the dance floor.'

Pressed on the issue, he said the Coalition had increased child tax credit by 452, despite cuts to other parts of the welfare budget, because he wanted to continue the drive against child poverty.
He added: Child benefit to me is one of the most important benefits there is  it goes directly to the family, it is a key part of families budgets in this country. That is not what we need to change.
The Prime Minister said he had rejected further cuts three years ago and said the handout was not what we need to change
Labour said Mr Camerons words left open the possibility of cuts. Ed Miliband said: David Cameron might have sounded like he gave you an answer but he didnt give you a guarantee. Child benefit and tax credits are still on the ballot paper. Ruling out cuts to child benefit would severely reduce the Tories options as they try to find 12billion welfare savings.
TWO CITY PAPERS BACK A CONSERVATIVE VICTORY
Two influential City newspapers backed David Cameron and the Tories yesterday.T
The Financial Times and The Economist both say Britain would be better off with Mr Cameron in Downing Street and praised the Coalition Governments handling of the economy  and both warned of the dangers of a Labour government.
The Economist spoke of the certainty of economic damage under Labours Statist agenda, and attacked Mr Milibands plans to meddle in markets, while resisting competition in the public sector.
The FT accused Mr Miliband of modelling his campaign on the French socialist President Francois Hollande, whose victory there led to a weak economy and an exodus of talent. It said the Conservatives economic record should be a winning hand and praised the Governments political courage in tackling the public finances.
Earlier yesterday the Lib Dems were accused of a desperate smear after leaking the three-year-old Cabinet papers on the changes to the handout.
The Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander claimed the discussions showed the Conservatives had proposed deep cuts to child benefit and child tax credits in 2012. But, in an extraordinary twist, George Osborne said the proposals had been commissioned by Mr Alexander and had never been supported by David Cameron.
The Chancellor said: This is a three-year-old document of policy options that was commissioned by the Chief Secretary himself. We have not put into practice any of these options. We dont support them. We didnt support them. We dont support them in the future.
The Lib Dems insisted the proposals had been drawn up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith at the direct request of the Prime Minister.
Vince Cable joined the Lib Dem attack on the Tories yesterday, accusing them of undermining workers rights by instigating charges for employment tribunals.
The Business Secretary claimed the decision, taken by the Coalition two years ago, showed the Tories were the nasty party.
David Cameron, campaigning in Wetherby, West Yorkshire today, has hit back at claims the Tories have a secret plan to cut child benefit
Mr Alexander, who is facing a desperate fight to save his Highlands seat, accused the Tories of slashing support for families. He said he had a duty to release the child benefit papers because the Conservatives are refusing to say where they would find the 12billion in welfare cuts. Nick Clegg backed the unprecedented move, saying he shared Mr Alexanders intense frustration, verging on anger over the Tories refusal to spell out welfare cuts.
The discussions, which were leaked to The Guardian, date back to 2012 when the Tories were considering plans for an additional 8billion cut to welfare. Mr Alexander said he had blocked proposals which included means-testing child benefit, removing it from 16-to-19-year-olds and limiting the benefit and child tax credit to two children per family.
Tory environment secretary Elizabeth Truss accused Mr Alexander of a pathetic bid for attention for his partys flagging campaign. Miss Truss said: Lets be clear  the reason the Liberal Democrats are doing this is because they are absolutely desperate. They are doing very badly in the polls.
Mr Cable launched his attack on the Tories in a newspaper interview. Fees of up to 1,200 for bringing a tribunal case were welcomed by employers.
Mr Cable said he agreed to charges, driven by Tory justice secretary Chris Grayling, on the condition the system be reviewed after a year, but he accused Mr Grayling of failing to do this and the Tories of pursuing an aggressively anti-worker, anti-union agenda.
LABOUR IS HANDED 1.2MILLION IN ONE WEEK BY TRADE UNION GIANTS
Labour has raked in 1.2million from trade unions in one week, a report revealed yesterday.
The party accepted two huge gifts: 600,000 from the GMB and 500,000 from the CWU.
Other sizeable donations include 100,000 from Usdaw, 50,000 from Aslef and 25,000 from TSSA.
Eighty-three per cent of the 1.53million raised by Labour this week came from trade unions.
Political parties must report donations over 7,500 to the Electoral Commission on a weekly basis during the campaign.
In three weeks, Labour has received more than 3.4million from the unions. With 1.5million, Ukip pulled in more than the Tories in the latest round.
Its biggest gift was 1million from Northern &amp; Shell Media Group, which is owned by Express newspapers proprietor Richard Desmond. There was also 500,000 from Growth Financial Services, which has a Mayfair postal address. The financial consultancy has donated to Ukip before.
Tycoons and hedge fund managers continued to fund the Conservatives, who received a little over 1million.
For the third week in a row, the Tories registered a donation from Beatrice Tollman, who was once wanted for tax fraud by the US authorities. Charges were dropped but the hoteliers husband Stanley was convicted of tax evasion.
The couple have given 60,000 to the Tories during the election campaign. But the party has returned all donations, including the gift registered this week.
The Liberal Democrats received 75,000, including 50,000 from a long-term supporter, Margaret Roper.
Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by the Lib Dems but they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill.
WE WILL END THE NORTH-SOUTH GROWTH DIVIDE, VOWS CAMERON
By Daniel Martin, Chief Political Correspondent 
David Cameron will today promise a Northern surge to put economic growth on a par with the South.
The Prime Minister vowed to close the North-South gap, making a truly national recovery the central goal of a future Tory-led government.
Pledging to make the North grow at least as fast as the rest of the country over the next five years, he will promise that the region will experience the most exciting period since the Industrial Revolution.
The Tory leader will tell voters to forget Labour, warning that the North wont get a look in if Ed Miliband is propped up by the SNP. His four-point plan will include new road projects, the HS2 rail link, investment in science and devolution of major city regions such as Greater Manchester.
He will say: Forget about Labour: theyve let you down before and theyll let you down again. This time next week, Ed Miliband could be propped up by the SNP, funnelling cash north of the border. The next five years will see a Northern surge  and, economically, it will be the most exciting time to be here since the Industrial Revolution.
The Tories say raising growth rates in the North could add more than 37billion in real terms to the regions economy by 2030  an increase of more than 2,000 per person.

Yesterday's furious row erupted between the Lib Dems and Conservatives over claims the Tories are plotting to 'slash support for families'.
Lib Dem minister Danny Alexander released details of what he claimed are secret plans drawn up in the last government to cut Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits.
The Prime Minister 'flatly rejected' the plans, claiming they were drawn up by civil servants on the orders of Mr Alexander.
BENEFITS CUTS WHICH LIB DEMS ACCUSE TORIES OF PLANNING
According to Danny Alexander, the unimplemented Tory proposals included:
Banning child benefit and child tax credits for more than two children, leaving a family with three children up to 3,500 worse off
Removing higher rate Child Benefit from first child - an average cut of over 360 for every family with children
Means-testing Child Benefit - cutting 1,750 for a two child middle income family
Removing Child Benefit from 16-19-year-olds - a cut of over 1,000 for parents of a single child
But the Lib Dems hit back, claiming Mr Cameron himself had asked officials to examine ways to curb access to benefits.
The clash is the worst row between the two former coalition partners and will raise serious doubts about whether they could work together again, if the Tories fall short of a majority.
Conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by Mr Alexander.
But they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill.
Tory Chancellor George Osborne has promised to cut 12billion from the welfare bill after the election, but has repeatedly refused to say where the axe will fall.
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg expressed outrage that the Tories could not be 'bothered' to come clean about their plans.
The Lib Dems have vowed to block the plan as the price of any future coalition deal after May 7.
Mr Alexander, who served as Chief Secretary for the Treasury, has now released details of benefit cuts put to the Quad of senior ministers, which included him, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Osborne.
He said he was lifting the lid on the internal coalition discussions because his former government colleagues were 'trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election'.
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told LBC's Nick Ferrari that he backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions
Clegg: 'If you think back to 2010... we could have been Greece'
The Lib Dems revealed that in June 2012, the Quad was sent a document called 'Welfare Reform Quad Summer Reading Pack' produced by officials working for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.
Mr Alexander said the previously dropped plans - including limiting Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit to two children at a cost of 3,500 for a family of three - were a clear signal of where the axe would fall.
CONSERVATIVES HAVE A 'NASTY STREAK', VINCE CABLE CLAIMS
Vince Cable has claimed the Tories have a 'nasty streak' as he warned workers had been hit hard by the coalition he served in.
The Business Secretary claimed the Conservatives would resurrect plans to allow bosses to 'fire at will'.
He told The Independent: 'They have an unfinished agenda.
'There is a very nasty streak [in the Conservative Party]. They are not all nasty as individuals.
'I have worked with them for five years. Some of them are perfectly decent, moderate people.'
But he warned the Tories would 'chisel away' at workers' rights.
But he was forced to admit that many of the claims set out in today's document had been made public - and rejected by the Tories - in the past.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There are lots of ideas that have been doing the rounds for years, so I think it's not credible for the Conservatives to say they do not know what they're going to do.
'If they are proposing 12billion of welfare savings without knowing what they're going to do, that is highly reckless.
'Equally, if they do know what they want to do and they're not telling the British people, that is deceitful.
'And that does frustrate me because I think that this is one of the issues that in the last seven days of the election campaign people would expect the Conservatives to come clean about.'
Mr Clegg  backed Mr Alexander's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions saying the Conservatives needed to say where their planned benefits cuts would fall.
'I share Danny's intense frustration verging on anger that the Conservatives think it is okay a week before an election to say that they are going to take the equivalent of 1,500 off eight million of the most vulnerable families in this country and they can't even be bothered to spell out exactly what their plans involve,' he said on an LBC radio phone-in.
But the Conservatives dismissed the claim as 'desperate stuff' from the Liberal Democrats and insisted the proposals were 'definitely not our policy'.
Mr Osborne told BBC London: 'Well this is a three year old document of policy options that was commissioned by the chief secretary himself.
'We have not put into practice any of these options. We don't support them. We didn't support them. We don't support them in the future.'
Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured in Dewsbury today, said the future ofchild benefit and tax credits is 'on the ballot paper next week'
Miliband: 'You can't trust the Tories with your family budget'
Tory Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'This is just a desperate attempt by the Lib Dems to try to move their position in the polls, but it's not going to work because these proposals were never proposed or supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor and they would never be supported by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor.
'Our principles are very clear when it comes to welfare: it is there to help people, especially to help people get back into work, but also to support the disabled, to support pensioners - and those principles will not change.'
IT'S TIME TO LET RIP, SAYS PM WITH PROMISE OF TAX CUTS FOR YOUNG
David Cameron will today pledge to cut taxes for the young as he warns Labour would 'reach into your pay packet' by raising them.
Young people have been the biggest winners from the increases in the personal allowance since 2010, according to new figures, with five million under-30s gaining an average of 70 a month each from being taken out of income tax.
A further 500,000 will gain from the extension of the policy after the election.
The announcement is part of a wider offer to young voters today. This includes a target to cut youth unemployment to the lowest level in the G7 group of nations.
With just a week to go until polling stations open across the UK on May 7, Mr Cameron told the Guardian it was 'time to throw caution to the winds, let rip and tell people what you really think'.
The Prime Minister - who has in recent days deployed a more energetic approach after criticism of a lacklustre pitch to the electorate - said: 'I think we will get there. But the reason it is taking time is, quite rightly, people want to have a good look and a good think.'
Mr Alexander's revelations came as The Times reported growing dissent in Lib Dem ranks over the possibility of entering a second power-sharing deal with the Conservatives if the General Election fails to produce a clear winner.
Nick Clegg has based his campaign around the premise that his party would be a restraining influence on either of the main parties.
But the newspaper said a number of - mostly unnamed - parliamentarians were increasingly hostile to the prospect of a Tory tie-up, which would have to be approved by a special party conference.
Mr Alexander said: 'For five years I won battle after battle to stop the Tories veering off to the right with ideological cuts, and it's been worth it to get the economy back on track while ensuring a fairer society.
'The coalition has delivered savings in a fair way, but the Tories now want to balance the books off the backs of ordinary working families and the most vulnerable in society.
'The Tories have turned their backs on the plan delivered in coalition government. Instead they want to cut 1,500 for eight million households, singling out middle and low-income families to bear the burden - and asking nothing from the best off.
'It's clear from our time in government that the Tories' target will be slashing support for families. I'm lifting the lid on this now because the Conservatives are trying to con the British people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election.
'They now ask the British people to trust them when they make unfunded pledges on health and tax, yet won't tell us how they will cut welfare for millions of families to pay for their plans. They may give with one hand, but they will take away twice as much with the other.
'The Liberal Democrats will take a fairer approach, cutting less than the Conservatives and borrowing less than Labour, to deliver a stronger economy and fairer society with opportunity for everyone.'
Labour leader Ed Miliband also seized on the revelation.Speaking ahead of an event in Yorkshire, he said:'Today we've learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week.
'The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds away from millions of families.
'The Tories' secret plan has been revealed. 'And they will put it into practice in just seven days' time if they get the chance. 'It's the final proof that working families can't afford five years of the Tories.'

The comments from the former Home Secretary, who admitted that Labour was unlikely to win the Election because of the SNP tsunami, will fuel growing alarm in the rest of the UK at the prospect of the Scottish Nationalists extracting a high price for propping up a weak Labour administration.
But Len McCluskey, leader of the super-union Unite, Labours biggest financial backer, branded those worried about the rise of the SNP Little Englanders.
Nicola Sturgeons party is on course to win more than 50 seats in Scotland and hold the balance of power at Westminster, and there is mounting Labour turmoil at polls suggesting their party  which has 41 MPs in Scotland  is facing a total wipeout at the hands of the nationalists
Mr Miliband said he would also be prepared to sacrifice his chance to run the country. We are not going to do a deal with the Scottish National Party. If it meant we would not be in government, then so be it, Mr Miliband said. Im not going to give in to SNP demands  whether that is on Trident or on the deficit'
Miliband: You don't always do what the polls tell you to do
Nicola Sturgeons party is on course to win more than 50 seats in Scotland and hold the balance of power at Westminster, and there is mounting Labour turmoil at polls suggesting their party  which has 41 MPs in Scotland  is facing a total wipeout at the hands of the nationalists.
In a last-ditch attempt to halt the SNP surge, Mr Miliband will today appear at a campaign rally in Glasgow and urge voters: Dont gamble with the SNP.
Former Cabinet Secretary Gus ODonnell last night warned an SNP landslide would put extra tension on the UK, particularly if the party ends up holding the balance of power. Hinting at the perils of a Labour-SNP deal, Lord ODonnell, now a crossbench peer, said an incoming government may face legitimacy issues.
TORIES RACE INTO 5-POINT LEAD
The Tories have seized a five-point lead while David Camerons personal ratings have soared to their highest level since 2012, a poll reveals.
The Conservatives are up two points to 35 per cent as Labour support has plummeted five points to 30 per cent in a fortnight, according to an Ipsos MORI survey for the London Evening Standard.
Ukip stays on 10 per cent, while the Lib Dems rise one point to 8 per cent, level with the Green Party.
Nigel Farages personal ratings have slipped again, and are now behind even those of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.
The poll comes after yesterdays ComRes survey for the Daily Mail put the two main parties neck and neck and shows the election is likely to result in a hung Parliament.
Mr Camerons personal ratings leapt from 39 per cent to 46 per cent in two weeks, his best net rating in three years.
The poll also showed that just 65 per cent of Britons have decided which way to vote  and 34 per cent say they may change their minds.
Yesterday, Miss Sturgeon was accused of planning to use her victory as a springboard for a second Scottish independence referendum.
Senior nationalist Jim Sillars, a former deputy leader of the party, suggested the first line of the SNPs manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood election could demand another contest. Miss Sturgeon said talk of another referendum was desperate scaremongering, but pressed on the issue, would say only: The people of Scotland are in charge.
Mr Blunkett, who is standing down as an MP, said voters in Scotland were beyond rational argument.
Once people have stopped listening, once their minds have switched off to even rational argument, then its extremely difficult to win that back. I think thats happening, he told BBC Radio 4s World at One.
It is though a great part of the Scottish nation have switched off, and that is so dangerous for the Union and for the future of Britain as a whole.
Mr Blunkett suggested Labour could rely on the SNPs votes to get legislation through. Its possible that we could put a minority government in place which did not have a formal agreement  was not in hock to and did not find itself run by a minority national nationalist party  but could expect them to actually vote on the things that they themselves have committed to, he said.
Mr McCluskey, meanwhile, accused critics of seeking to play the anti-Scottish card [and] seeking to turn little Englanders back to their cause.
Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: A former Labour Home Secretary admits what all the polls show  it is impossible for Ed Miliband to get the keys to No 10 without being propped up by Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond.
MERCILESS NICOLA WOULD MAKE A MEAL OF MILIBAND: QUENTIN LETTS SEES THE SNP LEADER IN ACTION
To Queen Bees hive: the Scottish Parliament, demesne of potentially the most powerful woman in Britain, Nicola Sturgeon.
At noon yesterday she took half an hour of First Ministers Questions.
In svelte burgundy suit and nude power shoes, she commanded the airy Chamber before even saying a word.
Above and around were the modernist squiggles and ceiling beams of what might have started life on the architects pad as a Bond villains ski lodge.
But all attention was focused on this slender, un-mumsy, dirigiste figure, perched forward on her large seat, legs crossed, sipping water from a highball glass.
Everyone watched her  watched the back of her Bay City Rollers hairdo, her Thunderbirds-puppet gestures, the slender hands curled under her pointy chin.
Beside her sat her best friend Shona Robison, Scotlands Health Secretary and married to SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie.
Nicola Sturgeon, in svelte burgundy suit and nude power shoes by the SNP helicopter, took half an hour of First Ministers Questions
Is it a bird, is it a plane? Sturgeon delighted with her 'copter
What with Miss Sturgeons own husband being SNP chief executive, its a wee world, north of the Tweed. Yet soon (if Ed Miliband scrapes enough seats) these two couples may trump the choice of millions of voters elsewhere in the UK.
First Ministers Questions proved less noisy than PMQs at Westminster.
They have a rather sweet habit of announcing any distinguished visitors. Thus, yesterday, we heard presiding officer Tricia Marwick say that the Indonesian ambassador was in the VIPs gallery.
As in a game show, His Excellency stood to accept the applause. Perhaps an English ambassador will sit there one day.
The central wodge of the Chamber was SNP territory, Nationalist Members sitting there at desks with little microphones.
The average age seemed older than Westminster. One of the creakers on the SNP side, Chic Brodie, could have been an OAP Elvis Presley.
To Miss Sturgeons right: a few Tories, Lib Dems, a Green, one oatmealy Independent; on Miss Sturgeons left (geographically) sat Labour, about 15 of them, glum. Labours leader, Jim Murphy, is not in this House.
Questions were therefore led by his deputy, Kezia Dugdale  hesitant voice, timid manner. How remote the days of rampaging Scots-Labour supremacy seem.
Ms Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, attends First Minister's questions at the Scottish Parliament, Edinburgh
Miss Dugdale and her Lib Dem counterpart, Willie Rennie, accused the SNP of wanting to hold another Scottish independence referendum.
Miss Sturgeon laughed, snorted, ridiculing her opponents. I thought Kezia Dugdale was going to ask a serious question! she scoffed. Labour should desist from negativity and scaremongering.
I find it quite sad watching the demise of a once-great party.
Yet just an hour earlier, former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars had demanded a push for another referendum, pronto. Miss Sturgeon, ice entering that taut, tight voice, said Sillars was old news. I am now the leader. Of Alex Salmond, her predecessor, there was no sign. Shes a merciless operator, this one. Shed do to Ed Miliband what Mongolian chefs do to mutton: kebab and speed-broil him on the flames of her flashing eyes.
Her language about the referendum was chosen, it could be noted, with care. She left fully open the chance of another push for Scottish home rule. As it ended, she left the Chamber the undoubted ruler of this thanedom, the old men parting before her like the Red Sea under Moses staff.
In the bar afterwards, I just had time to bump into Sir Jamie McGrigor, Bart., an old-school Highlands and Islands Tory. Was every Westminster seat really about to go SNP? Sir Jamie, sucking down a bucket of lunchtime vino collapso, shrugged.
When he first fought a seat in 1997 he had been told by a crowing Labour man that the Scots Tories were as rare as corncrakes. Yet now, thanks to sparky Tory leader Ruth Davidson, they are almost polling the same as Labour.
And with that the splendid baronet (an amateur folk singer) burst into a song he had written about Labour and the SNP, the Gallic chorus of which I had better not tell you because it was saltier than the briny off the Isle of Mull.

	The Prince of Wales was overjoyed when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had Prince George but he has made no secret of his desire for his next grandchild to be a girl.

The Prince of Wales said in September that he was hoping for a little princess, telling well-wishers that he and the Duchess of Cornwall were crossing their fingers for a girl.
Congratulated by entrepreneur Corey Johnson on becoming a grandfather, the heir to the throne replied: 'I am already. But it's wonderful to be a grandfather again. I'm looking forward to it - but I hope it will be a girl this time.'
Charles is not the only royal to state a preference for a girl, with Prince Harry also revealing shortly after the Palace revealed that Kate was pregnant that he would like a niece - if only for the chaos she would bring to his brother's life.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sent an 80th birthday cake to royal fan Terry Hutt, who is camped outside the Lindo Wing

At an Invictus Games event, Harry joked that he would love to see Prince William 'cope with that' should the new baby prove to be a girl.
The wait for the birth of the prince or princess continues and Kate - who said her baby was due in mid to late April - is now several days overdue.
The arrival of the royal baby - who will be fourth in line to the throne - is edging closer to the bank holiday weekend and the General Election on May 7, which is just six days away.
The Duchess of Cornwall told the wife of another veteran that there was still no news about whether Kate was about to go into labour.
Maureen Morris, whose husband Bill served with the Welsh Guards between 1952 and 1955, said: 'I asked if she had any news and she said; "No".  I said: "It will be great when it happens".'
Avid royalists have been waiting along with the world's media outside the Lindo Wing, the private maternity unit of St Mary's Hospital in London, for any news of the duchess going into labour.
But one man was left feeling  'over the moon' after receiving an 80th birthday cake from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge themselves.
Terry Hutt, who is camped outside the hospital, said he was 'overwhelmed' to be recognised by the royal couple.
The chocolate cake was delivered in a box wrapped in pink and pale green ribbons and came with a handwritten card.
It said: 'This comes with our best wishes on your 80th birthday from the team at Kensington Palace.'
Mr Hutt, 80, from Weston-super-Mare, has been waiting patiently outside the hospital for 10 days and joked about being recognised by the royal couple, saying: 'I know they like me anyway.'
Asked to read the message on the card he said: 'I can't see without my glasses, I think it's something nice.'

	Cutting a fizzy drink each day slashes diabetes risk by 25%

	Switching from fizzy drinks and hot chocolate to drinking water and unsweetened tea could slash your risk of developing diabetes by a quarter, researchers say.

Lead researcher Nita Forouhi, from Cambridge University, said: We were able to study beverages, including sweetened tea or coffee, sweetened milk drinks, artificially sweetened beverages and juice  and examine what would happen if they were substituted for water.
HOW GYMS CAN MAKE YOU FATTER
It might be the perfect excuse to put off going to the gym  some of us are genetically programmed to put on weight when we exercise.
A study of women of all shapes and sizes found that a handful of genes blamed for making us fat may make exercise less beneficial.
Those with high numbers of the obesity genes were heavier at the end of the study than at the start, despite sweating it out at the gym three times a week for a year.
But the study, published in the International Journal of Obesity, found those whose genes put them at a low risk of obesity lost weight when they exercised.
It isnt clear why our DNA affects the impact of exercise. One possibility is that those with obesity genes feel hungrier after a workout than those without the rogue DNA.
However Dr Hannah Moir, from Kingston University, said: Genes are not the only factor. Having certain genes doesnt mean you cant lose weight, it just makes it a little harder.
The report in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, found that replacing one soft drink or sweetened-milk beverage with a healthier alternative every day reduced the rate of diabetes by between 14 and 25 per cent.
It concluded: Reducing consumption of sweet beverages and promoting water, unsweetened tea or coffee may curb the escalating diabetes epidemic.
Dr Forouhi said: The good news is that our study provides practical suggestions for healthy alternative drinks which can help the prevention of diabetes.
And Professor Tom Sanders, from Kings College London, said drinks tended to reveal a lot about lifestyle.
He added: Soft drinks are associated with fast food outlets compared to water, tea and fruit juice  which are associated with a healthy lifestyle.
Professor Sanders went on to say: As the risk of diabetes is associated with weight gain, it makes sense to replace high-calorie beverages with those with fewer calories.
But Gavin Partington, from the British Soft Drinks Association, said: Rather than singling out a particular product we should be encouraging people to enjoy balanced diet and active lifestyle.

It was only several days later she discovered that her bracelet had been sold after being priced up at 1.99.

Its part of the job to assess what something is worth.
'I really want to get it back, it means a lot to me and because I used to wear it every day it is strange not to see it on my wrist.
Mrs Aston-Thwaites has since quit her job at Age UK.

Hugh Forde, of Age UK, said the charity had also launched an investigation into the incident.

	The Labour leader was taking part in one of three separate Question Time sessions on BBC One in Leeds, along with Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

But the Daily Mirror reported that Labour's deputy campaign chief Lucy Powell told journalists in the spin room: 'He slipped on David Cameron's sweat.'
And Match of the Day host Gary Lineker joked on Twitter: 'Thought Ed Miliband did well to stay on his feet. Many would have gone down under those circumstances, especially on the box.'
Meanwhile comedian David Baddiel tweeted: 'Liked Ed's tiny trip on the way out. Reminded me of his lovable inner klutz.'
Goodbye: Mr Miliband lost his footing while stepping off the stage at 9pm as he turned to wave to the audience
Three decades ago:The incident was immediately compared to when Labour's Neil Kinnock fell into the sea on Brighton beach in October 1983 - creating a video that became part of the opening credits of Spitting Image
Mr Miliband was last night accused of failing to learn the lessons of the mistakes of his last time in government and failing to respond to voters' concerns.
I'll leave you to interpret that and find the correct metaphor
Chancellor George Osborne
A snap poll showed Mr Cameron had won with 44 per cent saying he had performed best, while 38 per cent favour Mr Miliband. Some 19 per cent put Mr Clegg down as the winner.
Mr Miliband faced the toughest exchanges, as he was challenged over the embarrassing note left by Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010 admitting that 'there is no money left'.
The Labour leader was told shadow chancellor Ed Balls should be sacked after he dismissed the letter as a joke - despite it leading to five years of austerity.

	The system, reportedly tested by Nasa at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,  is based on electromagnetic drive which converts electrical energy into thrust without the need for rocket fuel.

Warp drives that let humans zip around other galaxies may no longer belong purely in the realm of science fiction.
Nasa is believed to have been quietly testing a revolutionary new method of space travel that could one day allow humans to travel at speeds faster than light.
Researchers say the new drive could carry passengers and their equipment to the moon in as little as four hours. A trip to Alpha Centauri, which would take tens of thousands of years now, could be reached in just 100 years.
The system is based on electromagnetic drive, or EMDrive, which converts electrical energy into thrust without the need for rocket fuel.
Warp drives that let humans zip around other galaxies may no longer belong purely in the realm of science fiction. Nasa is believed to have been quietly testing a revolutionary new method of space travel that could one day allow humans to travel at speeds faster than light
HOW DOES AN EMDRIVE WORK?
The concept of an EmDrive engine is relatively simple. It provides thrust to a spacecraft by bouncing microwaves around in a closed container.
Solar energy provides the electricity to power the microwaves, which means that no propellant is needed.
Researchers previously believed this wouldn't work in the vacuum of space, but Nasa has allegedly shown otherwise. 
The implications for this could be huge. For instance, current satellites could be half the size they are today without the need to carry fuel.
Humans could also travel further into space, generating their own propulsion on the way.
According to classical physics, this should be impossible because it violates the law of conservation of momentum.
The law states that the momentum of a system is constant if there are no external forces acting on the system  which is why propellant is required in traditional rockets.
Researchers from the US, UK and China have demonstrated EMDrive over the past few decades, but their results have been controversial as no one has been exactly sure how it works.
Now, Nasa has built an EMDrive that works in conditions like those in space, according to users on forum NasaSpaceFlight.com.
A number of those discussing the plan on the technical forum claim to be Nasa engineers who are involved in the project.

We bid the doctor and his nurse a purposeful goodbye as we left. A cancer diagnosis tends to enhance Britishness. Pleasantries, talk of the weather, cups of tea ... as though in a crisis, politeness is all we have left.
In the car, afterwards, P continued to run through what the doctor had told us.
And then they said that theyd need to determine whether its invasive or non-invasive. Non-invasive is better  you might get away without chemotherapy then. But if its invasive, youre going to need chemotherapy and radiotherapy as soon as your mastectomy is out of the way.
I couldnt get my head around the multi-syllable medical vocabulary I was suddenly having to learn.
Tragic: Sheridan Smith as Lisa and Paul Nicholls as her husband 'P' in the C Word, which will air on BBC One
Sheridan Smith stars as cancer patient Lisa Lynch in The C Word
And thats really necessary, is it, the mastectomy? I spat, as though it were P whod decided that it must be done.
If Id hoped my cancer was early-stage and non-invasive, my follow-up appointment that Friday revealed a different story.
In his office, the doctor pointed with his pen to a diagram of a breast that reminded me of a GCSE Biology paper. He explained that my five-centimetre  five-centimetre!  tumour wasnt just invasive but that it was not early stage at all.
It was likely to be grade two or three, depending on whether he discovered a spread to my lymph nodes during my mastectomy.
What I cant understand is how I didnt find this sooner. How neither of us found this sooner, I said, gesturing to P.
I mean, its five centimetres!
The professor drew more shapes on the breast diagram to demonstrate how the tumour had been growing immediately beneath my nipple and had only begun to push out to the side  where P and I discovered it  as it had grown.
Poignant: Lisa Lynch asked Sheridan Smith to play her in the drama before her death in March 2013
The surgery  the mastectomy  was arranged for the next week. Oddly, I found myself actually looking forward to it.
I want this thing out of me, I thought. Cut me open, take my nipple, take the lot, scar me right up. Just. Get. It. Out.
But on the morning of the operation, I cried immediately after waking.
I dont want to do this, I whimpered into Ps shoulder. I dont think I can. I looked up to see his face wet with tears.
But you must, he croaked. You must. You must. You must... He wept more with every command, and I realised for the first time that it wasnt just me whod had this diagnosis, it was us. Me and P. Team Lynch.
We were always ready to catch whatever was thrown our way. But this? This wasnt a gas bill or a gazumped flat or even another miscarriage after the two we had already suffered.
This had the potential to ruin it all. To put an end to me and P. To cut short our flawless marriage to a mere 18 months. We howled loudly and messily, grasping onto each other as though letting go would mean admitting defeat.
I threw back the sheets and staggered into the living room, hanging my head out of the window for air as though suffocated by the grief that was swallowing up our bedroom.
I had been working myself up into a panic about the operation. Will he still fancy me after the mastectomy (I hate that word), when Im all stitched and swollen and unnatural-feeling? Will he still fancy me when Im pale and hairless, and bloated from the steroids?
So lovely is P that he offered to shave his head when my hair fell out. But I told him not to. Hes so darned handsome it would have ruined his looks, and I liked him the way he was.
At the hospital, while the nurses prepared me for the operation, I was in still tears, gripping Ps hand all the while.
Have you had a general anaesthetic before? the anaesthetist asked. I shook my head, still weeping. Well, theres nothing to worry about, he continued. Itll just be like having a few G&amp;Ts. My head answered, I could do with one of those! but I didnt have the energy to articulate the thought, so fixated was I on my husbands loving face as the needle entered the back of my hand.
And then, with one too many shots of Gordons gin, I was asleep.
When the surgeon came to see me the day after the operation, he was smiling.
So the operation went well, he explained, as we nodded along like two plastic dogs in a rear windscreen.
Battle: Lisa had a five-year battle with cancer and was given the all clear once before it spread to her bones
However, the sentinel node biopsy [to find out if the cancer has progressed beyond the breast] showed a spread to your lymph nodes, so I removed them immediately.
I gulped. So it did spread?
Yes, it did, Smiley Surgeon nodded.
But Im very optimistic. Remember, it has all gone now  it has all been removed. And the chemotherapy will mop up any rogue cells that are too small to operate on.
While we were at the hospital, we had a look round the chemo room. I decided not to be a cancer patient, but instead a mere guest whod booked herself in for a relaxing day in the Therapy Suite.
I wanted to turn up in huge sunglasses, comfy jeans, my sparkly new Converse trainers, with my Marc Jacobs tote in one hand and my iPhone in the other, and completely ignore the real reason I was there.
But it wasnt so easy.
The first night after having the chemo drugs was horrific. I was a mug for thinking I could bring some cheery charm to the proceedings by glamming up for the hospital.
Within hours of leaving the treatment room, the not-so-floral reality hit me. Cant-keep-anything-down sickness, shakes and shivers, wanting to rip out my veins, fainting, aching, heart palpitations, all-over bone pain, sweating, panicking, watching as my joints swelled and my skin developed itchy rashes.
When the cancer was first diagnosed, the doctors had hoped there would be time for a quick pre-chemo course of IVF as a means of ensuring that P and I had options when it came to having kids. But we just couldnt hang around and risk my cancer spreading.
Sheridan Smith talks about playing cancer patient Lisa Lynch
Coping: Lisa turned to writing a blog - Alright Tit - as a way of dealing with her cancer, and later a book called The C-Word
That wasnt all. Almost exactly a year ago, Id had the first of two miscarriages, so there was a chance that my getting pregnant could even have exacerbated the cancer.
There was no definite way of knowing whether or not either pregnancy was to blame for the cancer but we could not ignore the fact that they could have given it a leg-up.
Either way, it turned out that the hormone oestrogen  released in greater quantities during pregnancy  might just be my kryptonite.
I was baffled by the immediate way in which P and I reacted to the blow to our fertility. The thing was, there just wasnt space in our heads to squeeze in yet another stomach-punching blow, so we adopted a well thats that, then attitude.
The way we saw it, had we been told in the course of our post-miscarriage fertility checks that we wouldnt be able to have our own children, that would have been a genuinely gut-wrenching disappointment. Wed have cried and mourned for the kids wed already named (Maisy Jean for a girl, Cameron Thomas Arthur for a boy) and got our names on an adoption register.
But now, things were different. There were bigger issues at hand. Like staying alive.
A life that included just the two of us no longer seemed a distant second place to having a family. I loved the thought of that life with P. I loved the thought of any life with P.
And even during the bleakest moments of the cancer, P would tell me that he felt exactly the same about our alternative future.
In five years, I told one of my doctors, I just want still to be here.
So why is it that you wont blog about your fears of death? my doctor asked.
Well, because Im British, I retorted. And we just dont talk about death, do we?
Drama: Sheridan Smith, who was contacted by Lisa through Twitter when she was approached about playing the role, said she hopes the BBC drama will help people to be more open to discussing death and cancer
It is the ultimate unmentionable. Death is what you immediately think of on being told you have cancer (well, with me it was hair first, death second). And yet, as soon as the diagnosis is done with, nobody mentions it again.
But I hadnt spoken or blogged about death because I didnt want to upset my family or P.
I could never allow myself to forget that cancer doesnt only have an impact on one person. It wasnt just happening to me: it was happening to us.
P may not have been wired up to the drugs or experiencing the side-effects or seeing his hair come out in clumps, but it was clear that he was feeling every bit of it. And arguably more so, thanks to the added frustration of being forced to play spectator, unable to do a thing about it.
Though it may sound silly when your life is on the line, but the hair loss was what I had feared most. When the first hairs started to fall out and I told P the news, I burst into tears. And, to my surprise, so did he.
But a visit to my 86-year-old uncle cheered us both up. When he saw me, his eyes (and mine) filled with delighted tears as he gave me the loveliest cuddle and said: Ive been trying so hard to think what youd look like  but its you! Its still you!
He, too, had more than enough to occupy his mind, aside from what I looked like. His wife, my amazing auntie, was also in the middle of cancer treatment, and yet was still as magnificent and matriarchal as ever.
As she made me a brew and showed off her new wig, my uncle leaned over to me and said: You know what? I still fancy her more than ever.
I couldnt help hoping that P would say the same. And he did. Although I bought wigs and headscarves and headbands, P was only interested in me in wig-off mode. The moment wed get home, hed whip off the wig.
In many ways, the hair loss was easier to cope with than the tiredness. During the chemo, I felt like a frail old woman.
One evening, P ran me a lovely bath with posh Molton Brown bubbles and candles all around the tub, but all I found myself craving was one of those baths with a door in the side that fills up around you and saves you collapsing on your husband when you climb out of it.
The thing P and I particularly loved about our doctors and nurses was that theyd got the pair of us sussed from the very beginning. We came as a team, P and I, and Smiley Surgeon and Always-Right Nurse were quick to recognise it.
They always asked how we were. The you in how did you find the last chemo? was collective. When there was a decision to be made, they asked what both of us thought about it.
Heartbreaking: Lisa died peacefully on Monday March 11, 2013, with her husband and parents by her side
After one mastectomy, five months of chemotherapy and six weeks of radiotherapy, we went back to the hospital.
So, can we say Im in remission now? I asked the doctor, while tearing holes in a tissue with one hand and gripping P with the other.
Im sorry, I cant say that, she said, sympathetic to my disappointment. The discourse around cancer is really problematic.
The media doesnt help, of course. All this Kylie Minogue gets the all-clear stuff. In truth, Im afraid, with this kind of cancer, there simply is no all clear.
Its just never ending, said P, taking the words out of my mouth. We hoped thered be some closure from today.
She explained then that they could manage the cancer, and hopefully slow its progress  but never cure it.
If only cancer were just a disease that you discover, get upset about, treat, then get over.
Someone once told me that, upon her diagnosis, her consultant said: I dont want to frighten you, but you need to understand that your life will never be the same again.
For my 29th birthday, which had fallen during the chemotherapy, P had bought me a bag of lovely Jo Malone beauty treats. He also handed me a tiny parcel.
Its just something daft, he explained. But I want this to become your mantra.
I tore off the wrapping and pulled out a fridge magnet, upon which was a Winston Churchill quote: Never, never, never give up.
Promise me? asked P.
I promise, I said. Of course I promise.
In September, 2011, Lisas cancer returned. On her blog she wrote: The spread is to my bones: not just in my back, as was first my suspicion, but everywhere, in the form of dot-like tumours (worst in my spine, hips, shoulders, ribs, clavicles, sternum).
All of which explains the increasing pain Ive been in recently, whose severity I have, for longer than I care to admit, been denying to those around me  most of all me.
Her doctors told her that the cancer was not curable  only that the pain could be managed.
She died peacefully on Monday March 11, 2013, with P and her parents at her side.

But there were no groupies or hangers-on as there had been when she married Clapton in 1979 or Harrison in 1966  just a handful of close friends and family who threw confetti as Pattie and Rod, who have been together almost 25 years, emerged from the cream-painted Rossetti Room arm in arm.
And in a nod to the tradition of the bride wearing something borrowed, Patti wore a hat owned by her late friend Pat Booth, the model turned best-selling author who died of cancer in 2009.
Friends of the couple, who live in Kensington, feared they would never tie the knot. Its almost our silver anniversary so we thought we had better get on with it, said Weston, 61.
George Harrison (who died in November 2001) and Pattie Boyd, 21, leave Epsom Registrar Office after their marriage in January 1966
Eric Clapton married Pattie Boyd, the ex-wife of his friend George Harrison, in 1979
Newly-married George Harrison and Pattie Boyd in 1966
Since settling down with Weston, Pattie, a former Vogue cover girl, has turned herself into an accomplished photographer and her pictures have been exhibited all over the world.
With the death of John Lennons ex-wife Cynthia last month, convent-educated Pattie is now the sole surviving first wife of a Beatle.
Born in Somerset, she met Harrison on the set of A Hard Days Night in 1964, when she was cast as a schoolgirl in The Beatles first film.
They were married two years later when she was 21 and Harrison, 22. He later wrote the song Something for her.
It was by no means the only famous song composed for the bewitching beauty.
The 70-year-old model, photographer and author, has found love for the third time with Weston
Pattie showcased her age-defying good looks and sartorial prowess in a chic silver and blue coat jacket and silver dress
She accessorised her look with silver sandals and an oversized hat, and carried a posy of flowers as her guests showered her and her new husband with confetti
Eric Clapton, who pursued her passionately, rhapsodised about her refusal to abandon Harrison for him with his anguished and electrifying hit Layla. He also wrote his most famous ballad, Wonderful Tonight, for her.
In her 2007 memoir, Wonderful Today, Pattie broke 35 years of silence to describe how after years of mutual anguish which pushed Clapton to the brink of a drug-induced breakdown, she eventually left Harrison to marry Clapton.
Her affair with the guitarist started in 1970 after he played Layla to her for the first time.
She said: He played it to me two or three times, all the while watching my face intently for my reaction. My first thought was, Oh God, everyones going to know this is about me.
Pattie, now 71, met property developer Rod back in 1991 and he became her long-term partner
Pattie with her mother and Diana and sister Jenny at her wedding on Thursday
Pattie, who has graced the cover of Vogue numerous times, and had three of arguably the greatest love songs ever written for her, has had some of the most high-profile relationships of all time
The first time that Pattie tied the knot was to George Harrison in January 1966 and legend Paul McCartney was best man
I was married to Erics close friend George Harrison, but Eric had been making his desire for me clear for months.
But with the realisation that I had inspired such passion and creativity, the song got the better of me. I could resist no longer.
Later that day, Clapton confronted Harrison and said: I have to tell you, man, that Im in love with your wife. They finally got together in 1974, marrying five years later.
But while the songs have gone into rock history the marriage did not last and they split up in 1984.
For Pattie, life these days is a lot less complicated and the bridge-playing former rock chick is happy to start a new chapter in her extraordinary life.

	Brace yourself for heatwaves: Man-made climate change will lead to more record-breaking temperatures across Europe

	Last year was the hottest since records began for central England and new research has found the country is going to get even warmer.

Published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the discovery is all the more remarkable given it is such a small area of the world.
Dr Andrew King, of the University of Melbourne, said: 'When you look at average annual temperatures over larger regions of the world, such as the whole of Europe, there is a lower variability in temperatures from year to year compared with smaller areas.
A study found that there was 'significant and substantial increase' in likelihood that the UK will experience another record-breaking year for good weather, pictured are shoppers soaking up rays at Manchester City Centre
Scenes such as this, city workers enjoying the sunshine on their lunch break in Leeds, West Yorkshire, could become common as the country warms up
'As a result of this low variability, it is easier to spot anomalies.
'This is why larger regions tend to produce stronger attribution statements, so it is remarkable that we get such a clear anthropogenic influence on temperatures in a relatively small area across central England.'
His team used climate simulations to calculate the likelihood of very warm years when there is just natural forces on the climate and no human influence, such as burning fossil fuels, and then when there is both these and human influence.
The change in the likelihood of warm years due to human influences on the climate was then calculated.
The researchers then observed the CET and picked out the warmest years from the record since 1900, plotting these onto a graph to calculate the odds of warm years happening now and a hundred years ago.
The model based method suggested at least a 13 fold increase due to human influences on the climate, whilst this rose to 22 times using the observation approach.
The change in the likelihood of warm years is down to human influences on the climate, according to new research (runners enjoy asunny start to the day in Cambridge
Detailed analyses of the Central England Temperature (CET) charts, the world's longest instrumental temperature record dating back to 1659, showed human activities have a large influence on heatwaves across the country, scientists have found
Dr King said: 'Both of our approaches showed that there is a significant and substantial increase in the likelihood of very warm years occurring in central England.'
According to the CET, 2014 was the warmest year on record in central England.
It has been reported during the last 60 years there has been rapid warming in the CET in line with the anthropogenic, or human caused, influence on the climate with the highest average annual temperature of 10.93 C (51.6F) recorded last year.
The CET is designed to represent the climate of the English Midlands, which is approximated by a triangular area enclosed by Lancashire in the north, Bristol in the south-west and London in the south-east.
The CET has undergone thorough and extensive quality control, making it an ideal resource for studying long-term temperature trends across the region.
As to whether these results can be seen to be representative of areas outside of central England, Dr King said: 'I would expect that other areas near the UK would produce similar results.
The Met Office said they had produced similar research late last year showing how climate change had made UK record breaking temperatures about 10 times more likely
Findings suggest there summers today are 22 times more likely to be hot than compared to the climate of a century ago
'For larger regions, stronger attribution statements can often be made.
'For example, we performed a similar attribution study for Europe as a whole and found a 35-fold increase in the likelihood of extremely warm years using model simulations.'
Commenting on the research, Dr Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: 'This new research adds another piece of evidence that human-induced climate change is increasing the chances of record-breaking temperatures around the world including in the UK.
'At the Met Office we produced similar research late last year showing how climate change had made UK record breaking temperatures about 10 times more likely.'
The Central England Temperature series has records of average daily temperatures dating back to 1772 and monthly records of average temperatures dating back to 1659.
It represents a roughly triangular area stretching from Lancashire in the north to Bristol in the south west and London in the south east of England.
According to the CET, 2014 was the warmest year on record for central England, while Met Office data also showed last year was the hottest for the UK in records dating back to 1910, with temperatures 1.1C (2F) above the long-term average.

        <MainBody>Women who feel chronically isolated are hungrier and find a big meal less satisfying, a new study has found
Putting on weight could be a hidden side-effect of loneliness, research suggests.
Women who feel chronically isolated are hungrier and find a big meal less satisfying, a study found.
The US researchers says this could be the bodys way of telling them to seek out company as eating has been a sociable activity throughout human evolution.
The Ohio State University psychologists asked 42 women to fast overnight, then gave them a large breakfast.
The women rated their hunger before and after their meal and blood samples revealed their levels of ghrelin, the hunger hormone.
They had also answered a loneliness questionnaire, which included questions on how often they felt lonely when alone and whether other people thought of them as lonely.
As expected, levels of ghrelin fell after eating and then started to rise.
However, the rise was much quicker in the lonely women and they made much more of the hormone.
They also said they felt hungrier. Writing in the journal Hormones and Behavior, the researchers said being extra-hungry could be natures way of making us seek out company.
They said: The need for social connection is fundamental to human nature. Consequently, people may feel hungrier when they feel socially disconnected.
Interestingly, loneliness only made thin women hungrier. It had no effect on the appetite of those who were overweight.

Davies admits he wasn't a lifelong fan of the novel, reckoned by many to be the best ever written: 'I came to it for the first time rather late in life,' he admits. 'I was struck by how fresh and modern the characters felt  it's a story of the hopes and dreams of youth, set against the titanic background of the Napoleonic wars.'
Lust behind the garden shed
LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER, BBC
Game Of Thrones meets The Borgias in a once-banned classic  it's a formula guaranteed to generate headlines so steamy your glasses will fog up when it is released later this year.
Richard Madden  doomed hero Robb Stark in Game Of Thrones  is earthy gamekeeper Mellors in this adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's novel.
Holliday Grainger (best known as Lucrezia Borgia) is the upper-class bride whose husband (James Norton again) returns from World War I with a wound that has left him impotent.
Period delight: Joely Richardson and Sean Bean in Lady Chatterley's Lover - that will appear on the BBC
This most sexually charged novel was outlawed by the censors on its appearance in 1928 and could not legally be published until after a landmark obscenity trial in 1960.
This 90-minute version is condensed for TV by Jed Mercurio, known for police corruption drama, Line Of Duty.
This is not the first time Lady C has caused a stir on TV. In 1993 it made a star of Sean Bean, who was later cast in Napoleonic war series Sharpe and as a Bond villain in Goldeneye.
It was a breakthrough role for a 28-year-old Joely Richardson, too, though she was distressed at the amount of full-frontal nudity demanded by director Ken Russell.
In one scene, she was seen having sex in a boat house. 'I thought it could have been played differently,' she fumed.
Russell wasn't happy either  he had wanted Liz Hurley for the role of Lady Chatterley.
A comedy version was adapted in the Fifties by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson for an episode of Hancock's Half Hour, sadly now lost. Hattie Jacques played Lady Chatterley . . .
Pipe-smoking Paris sleuth
MAIGRET, ITV
No ONE was expecting to hear Rowan Atkinson announce that he plans to play tough Parisian sleuth Inspector Maigret.
The Blackadder star will follow Sir Michael Gambon, who played Maigret in the Nineties, in a dozen episodes on ITV. More than a dozen actors played the pipe-smoking inspector before that, including Richard Harris and Charles Laughton.
SECRETS AT DINNER TIME
An Inspector Calls, BBC
J.B. Priestley's spooky thriller An Inspector Calls, first staged in 1946, was made into a movie in 1954.
It starred Alastair Sim as the policeman who interrupts a wealthy familys dinner party with the grim news that a young woman has killed herself  and everyone is implicated.
The BBC made the tale into a mini-series in 1982, with Bernard Hepton as the inspector, and a cast including Nigel Davenport and Simon Ward.
Now a new version is to be directed by Aisling Walsh.
David Thewlis is the mysterious Inspector Goole, who upsets the snobby householders Ken Stott and Miranda Richardson, and discovers they have secrets of their own to conceal.
Jean Richard portrayed him on French TV until 1990, with Bruno Cremer taking over for the following 15 years, but to Maigret's creator, novelist Georges Simenon, the best of all was British actor Rupert Davies. The survivor of the wartime German prison camp Stalag Luft III made more than 50 appearances as Maigret at the start of the Sixties. Tall and imposing, he was ideal for the part of the sturdy detective.
At first, it's hard to imagine Atkinson in the role. His rubber face will be a disadvantage: Maigret is imperturbable.
But the Mr Bean star is a fan: 'I have been a devourer of the Maigret novels for many years,' he says. 'I'm very much looking forward to playing such an intriguing character, at work in Paris during a fascinating period in its history.'
The Atkinson remakes will be set in Fifties France. ITV says it was inspired to revive the character because of the success of modern European TV crime-busters, such as Sweden's Wallander and The Killing from Denmark.
A pair of two-hour specials are being filmed: Maigret Sets A Trap and Maigret's Dead Man.
They are direct adaptations of Simenon novels  the Belgian-born writer used to pen a complete book in a burst of white-hot creativity, barely sleeping for eight nights.
He would then take the following three weeks off to pursue women obsessively.
He claimed to have bedded more than ten thousand by the time he was 70.
First love in the haystack
CIDER WITH ROSIE, BBC
Laurie LEE'S memoir of his Twenties' Cotswolds boyhood comes to our screens later this year. Director Philippa Lowthorpe has a strong track record with Call The Midwife, and Cider With Rosie is set to appeal to that same audience.
Samantha Morton, who found fame almost 20 years ago in a TV version of Jane Eyre, plays the writer's mother.
Laurie is played by 14-year-old Archie Cox, while sitcom veterans Annette Crosbie and June Whitfield are his grandmothers. Jessica Hynes is teacher Miss Crabby.
Juliet Stevenson and Joe Robertson star in the upcoming BBC drama series, Cider with Rosie
The daughter of Lord Of The Rings' Andy Serkis, Ruby Ashbourne Serkis, plays Laurie's cousin  the Rosie of the title.
The real Rosie, Rosalind Buckland, died last year aged 99. She always said the book's famous love scene, involving a haystack and a flagon of cider, had only ever happened in Laurie's fevered imagination.
She admitted, though, that she thought the novel was 'a lovely book'.
It's only 15 years since ITV made a critically acclaimed version that was written by Rumpole Of The Bailey author John Mortimer and starred Juliet Stevenson.
Forbidden passion
THE GO-BETWEEN, BBC
Another bookish choice for the Corporation later this year is The Go-Between from the novel by L. P. Hartley  famous for its opening line: 'The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.'
Adrian Hodges, known for Sunday night swashbuckler The Musketeers, has adapted the tale of forbidden passion.
'It's been a real labour of love,' he says. 'It is a book I have admired ever since I read it many years ago, and its subtle power and devastating emotional impact remains undiminished.'
A story of lost innocence, it centres on Leo, an elderly man who recalls his childhood after he discovers the diary he kept when he was 13 years old.
A 1971 movie, directed by Joseph Losey with a screenplay by Harold Pinter, starred Alan Bates and Julie Christie. This version is regarded as one of the highpoints of romantic yet intellectual film-making  and so an ambitious choice for a remake by the BBC.
Joanna Vanderham and Stephen Campbell Moore are the stars this time around, though the production will have special significance for one actor, Jim Broadbent, who plays Leo in old age.
He appeared in the 1971 version as a spectator at a cricket match  his first film acting role. The part was too small to earn a credit, but this time, his name will be at the top of the cast list.
Crime Queen's lost tales
PARTNERS IN CRIME, BBC 1
David WALLIAMS and Jessica Raine will play Agatha Christie's married sleuths Tommy and Tuppence Beresford in a six-part series out this summer.
It marks the crime queen's 125th anniversary, and is based on two of her stories, The Secret Adversary and N Or M.
The characters have never really caught the public imagination like Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple  they always lacked that classic touch of the Christie macabre.
James Warwick and Francesca Annis as Agatha Christie's married sleuths in 1983
Despite this, their adventures have been filmed before, with James Warwick and Francesca Annis in the Eighties. A radio adaptation was broadcast recently.
Walliams believes the stories are under-rated.
'I was first drawn to the delicious notion of a married couple solving crimes together,' he says. 'Tommy and Tuppence are iconic Christie characters, among her very best work.'
Another ambitious remake will be And Then There Were None, based on Christie's most successful book.
It will be screened at Christmas.
AND AMERICA'S GETTING IN ON THE ACT AS WELL
TWIN PEAKS
The boom in high-quality cable TV serials in the U.S. has prompted a flood of remakes. Most high profile is Twin Peaks, the quirky early Nineties crime drama.
Creator David Lynch was lured back to direct nine episodes of a remake, but quit earlier this month, claiming the budgets were too low. But the Twin Peaks relaunch will still go ahead, and Kyle MacLachlan will return as FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper.
THE X-FILES
Another Nineties classic, The X Files, is also being reinvented for Fox, with six new episodes starring original alien-hunters, Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny. It's 13 years since the series ended  but creator Chris Carter says, 'The good news is that the world has become much stranger since then, it's a perfect time to tell these six stories.'
THE ODD COUPLE
Friends star Matthew Perry is in the critically acclaimed remake of the Broadway classic, Neil Simon's play The Odd Couple, that is also one of cinema's best-loved comedies. The 1968 Hollywood version starred Walter Matthau as slovenly Oscar and Jack Lemmon as his neurotic flatmate, Felix.
Television got in on the act two years later, with Tony Randall as Oscar and Jack Klugman as Felix. Now Perry and co-star Thomas Lennon have revived the story as a sitcom. 'We have the dynamic of two guys living together, driving each other crazy, but this is more of an ensemble show,' says Perry.

	After a remarkably sunny April, May will get off to a cold and soggy start, with showers setting in for the whole of the long weekend.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
Sunday will be even wetter  particularly in the far south  with blustery winds.
By Monday the worst of the wet weather may have passed, but there is still a risk of sharp showers.
Yesterday, the top temperature was 16.1C in St James's Park, London and the coldest was 0.4C in Otterbourne, Hampshire. The wettest weather was in Shap, Cumbria, while people on the Isle of Tiree enjoyed 14.6 hours of sunshine.
Despite the dismal forecast, more than 14.5million of us are expected to get in our cars over the weekend, according to the RAC.
Travellers face lengthy traffic jams on three of the biggest motorways in the country  the M6 in Birmingham, the M1 in Bedfordshire and the M40 in Oxfordshire  as lane closures are brought in and speed restrictions are dropped to just 30mph.
Today was expected to be the busiest day, with four million people taking to the roads in a desperate bid to visit family and friends for the three-day weekend and commuters returning home.
Experts are urging drivers to avoid travelling today if possible, with 800 miles of roadworks already in place on motorways and the major A roads before Bank Holiday work even begins.
Tomorrow morning, before 10am, is being deemed the best time to travel.
Train passengers also face disruption with three major London stations  Charing Cross, London Bridge and Waterloo East  closed over the long weekend and severe delays expected on West Coast services between Birmingham and Wolverhampton and Crewe and Wigan.
Pete Williams from the organisation said: As is typically the case, today looks set to be the most hectic day, so were advising motorists who can set off early to do so. And when you are on the road, watch out for those snap springtime showers that can quickly reduce both your view of the road and the grip of your tyres.
It's going to be a wet and windy bank holiday weekend in the UK
By Monday the worst of the wet weather may have passed, but there is still a risk of sharp showers. Pictured: Cumbria today
Travelling by train will not be much better, with passengers facing inconvenience caused by engineering works. But Network Rail insisted that the work had been timed to minimise disruption to passengers.
The wet and grey weekend follows one of the sunniest Aprils on record. Just over 199 hours of sunshine were recorded, 35 per cent more than average and the fifth highest in Met Office records which date back to 1910.
April was also a dry month, with only 57 per cent of the expected rainfall.

Harmless flattery? Unforgivable sexism? The great wolf whistle debate rages on.
It centres on Poppy Smart, who got so fed up of the whistles and comments every time she passed a Worcester building site that she reported the matter to the police.
Many felt that the 23-year-old marketing co-ordinator had over-reacted. Shouldnt women regard such unwanted attentions as a compliment? It was flattering, not soul shattering. A harmless bit of fun!
Give us a smile, luv, it might never happen.

But just when one might have been tempted to give the anonymous dopes on the building site the benefit of the doubt, one of them stepped from the shadows to give his side of the story  and we can see exactly what girls like Poppy are up against.
Builder Ian Merrett was quick to dismiss her complaints.
Its not worth getting into trouble over some silly little girl, he said. I dont know why she complained. She must be thinking things above her station.
He added that he would wolf whistle again if she walked past and anyway, whassup? Hed picked up lots of girls by whistling at them, it was no big deal.

SEXISM SAVED YOUR CAREER
Kristen Stewart
Twilight star Kristen Stewart says Hollywood is disgustingly sexist and that fame is simply the worst thing in the world.
Yes, we must presume that includes cancer, child abuse, pestilence, air crashes, famine, bankruptcy, earthquakes and the last Rolo in the packet.
In an interview in Harpers Bazaar, the whiny 25-year-old said she did not like being famous and thought it was crazy that women had to work harder than men to be heard.
Hollywood is disgustingly sexist. Its so offensive its crazy, she said.
This from a young woman who had an affair with her married boss, the British director and father-of-two Rupert Sanders.
They met when working together on the 2012 film Snow White And The Huntsman and carried out a clandestine romance.
Sanderss marriage to model Liberty Ross ended over the affair, as did Stewarts relationship with her boyfriend Robert Pattinson.
Saddled with a newly minted toxic reputation, Sanders has barely worked in Hollywood again. Meanwhile, Kristen has sailed on unscathed. Shes since appeared in five top films and made another five.
I would call this career arc discrepancy disgustingly sexist Hollywood behaviour, too. Only you wont catch Kristen complaining about that.
What a brute! Honestly, Merrett is wasted on a building site.
He should work on an allotment, where gardeners could plant potato tubers in the troughs made by his knuckles, for he is clearly the kind of bloke who scrapes them along the ground as he walks.
Merretts disdain and belligerence reveal the awful truth. He doesnt respect females. And if they do not respond favourably to his orangutan advances, he reacts with contempt.
This is a scenario that many women are familiar with. Hey, Blondie. You a lesbian or what?
If Ian Merrett was a good man, he would have apologised to Poppy Smart.
He might have said: I didnt realise I was upsetting her. I wont do it again. It was only a harmless bit of fun. But it wasnt, so he couldnt.
The local police decided not to pursue the case, but left matters in the hands of the construction firm to sort out  which seemed the most sensible thing to do.
However, the odd thing is that the construction industry has tried very hard over the past few years to stamp out on-site sexism.
On many sites today, builders are not even allowed to chat to the public, while wolf-whistling is regarded as a case for instant dismissal.
Thats perhaps more to do with health and safety issues than a seismic shift in the sex war, but it was still a welcome step forward.
There is a nostalgic tendency to think of a wolf whistle as something cheeky and adorable that Reg Varney did while driving a bus. Or Sid James was prone to do when Barbara Windsor popped a bikini strap.
The cheery sexism of an innocent age has long gone, replaced with something darker and unapologetic. Something that no one should have to put up with in an evolved society.
You cant ever legislate against male interest in comely females, but a young woman has the right to walk to her place of work in a British town without being ill-treated or feeling threatened and harassed.
So more power to you, Poppy Smart. You did a great thing.

Post traumatic stress disorder: Amanda Holden
Amanda Holden claims she suffered from post traumatic stress disorder after having her second child.
We all know she had a very difficult time during the birth. However, this is a serious condition with life-changing implications for those who suffer from it.
Particularly men and women in the Armed Forces or emergency services, whove borne witness to terrible trauma in the line of duty.
Considering Amanda was back at work on Britains Got Talent two weeks after the birth, her diagnosis seems rather dramatic, not to say tasteless.
Ditto her pronouncement: Id be dead if I had another baby.
Perhaps its not PTSD but BOOLAX (Being Out Of Limelight Anxiety) that is her real problem.

Spanx for the memories
Just a few years ago, millions of us happily wore our Spanx to smooth out lumps and bumps.
An entire generation of women used good ol Spanx to squeeze into even tinier dresses, all the while grappling with a new range of complicated underthings that gripped like a cobra and sounded like American football team positions: the performance tank, the short shaper, the open bust body, the tight end tights and the super high sheers.
Spanx: The U.S. shapewear giant is struggling to stay viable as women argue that the entire concept of having a perfect body shape is offensive
My first Spanx were a revelation; imagine (or not!) a pair of knickerbockers made like a wetsuit and then welded together with steel and you are almost there.
Spanx were once beloved of red carpet stars, too, but now the U.S. shapewear giant is struggling to stay viable.
They have fallen victim to the new political femscape, one in which women argue that the entire concept of having a perfect body shape is offensive and we should be embracing our curves and not trying to pour them into gut-busting big pants.
Compression is just so 15 years ago, a fashion expert told the New York Times this week, adding that fat shaming was over.
The hot new thing is athleisure clothes: garments that are a cross between sports gear and leisure-wear, but which grip so tightly you wont need Spanx anyway. I can hardly wait.

Twitter be damned, let's write royal nursery rhymes
Prince William wants the birth of his new child to be announced on Twitter. How very modern of him. Is it too early for babys first no-make-up selfie?
I can just see the barrage of hashtags: #royalbaby #blessed #cute #cherub #soprecious #followme #lookslikeWills #justsayin. Many of us prefer a more traditional welcome.
So, in honour of the new baby and in a bid to bring back a bit of class, here are some old-fashioned nursery rhymes that have been repurposed for the royals:
Prince William wants the birth of his new child to be announced on Twitter

Prince Georgie Porgie pudding and pie
Hes my bro, Im going to cry.
For hes the heir and Im the spare
Sometimes lifes so darned unfair.

Oh, the Grand Old Duke of York
He had ten thousand girls.
He marched them up to the top of the house
Then he marched them down again.
And when they were up, they were up
And when they were down, they sued.
That party night with J. Epstein?
Its been awfully misconstrued.

Baa Baa black sheep, have you seen the fool?
Yes sir, yes sir, hes lounging by the pool.
His name is Uncle Gary, hes anything but tame.
He gives the clan of Middleton a most unhelpful name.

Oooh, how the worm has turned. I guess Danny Alexander feels he has executed a killer blow by revealing Conservative plans that were sketched on the back of a fag packet and sort of never were.
David Cameron is distraught, terrified people might think he really is a  gasp!  Tory. But consider the electorate, Dave. We are not appalled.
There are millions of us who actually think that cutting child benefits to the first three children is perfectly reasonable. Actually, why not go even further? Well all help to pay for the first two, but after that, youre on your own.
Do parents really feel state-funded benefits are an automatic right? And if so, why so? A large family is a luxury, not an entitlement. If you cant afford children, dont have them.

Bridesmaids star Chris O'Dowd wasn't best pleased
Fame's first class fool
Bridesmaids actor Chris ODowd wasnt best pleased when Gatwick airport security staff frisked his three-month-old baby and binned the tots milky bottle.
He sent out a typically passive-aggressive smarty-pants tweet and fumed all the way to America.
Yes, sometimes it is a shock to celebrities when the same rules apply to them as they do to the common herd.
Most travelling parents make themselves familiar with the rules  no open bottles, for a start. They understand that if something triggers an alarm, then staff are obliged to search you and your family, no matter how many Hollywood films you might have made.
Honestly! If other passengers have the manners and good grace to put up with selfish parents who take screaming babies on long-haul flights, then he can put up and shut up with a light frisk now and again.
CHECK OUT THE CHEEK: HOTEL CHAIN WANTS VILLAGE TO CHANGE NAME
The Copthorne Hotel group wants the West Sussex village of Copthorne to change its name  because its their trademark.
The village has existed for hundreds of years, the hotel chain since 1972. Why doesnt the hotel sort itself out, before bullying an innocent village?
Ordering room service in the Sheffield Copthorne last year, I was told there was a 5 charge for the tray. But I dont want to keep the tray, I told the receptionist, I just want my club sandwich served on it.
Theres an extra charge for room service, she said. Look, I persisted. I am ordering a room service dish from the room service menu in my room  how can there be an extra charge on top of the room service charge?
I didnt go full Clarkson. Instead, I cancelled the order, walked across the road and bought a sandwich in a shop for a fraction of the price. It wasnt the cost, it was the principle.
Some hotel chains are always thinking of new ways to rip off customers. But in the crockery cupboard of life, you dont always have to be the mug.

The Queen had intended to mark her sons tenth wedding anniversary by amending the state prayers of the Church of England to include Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.
But when the moment came, HM was not ready. At present, they mention only the Queen, Prince Philip and Charles, Prince of Wales.
My source says: The Queen is waiting for the right moment.
Scroll down for video
Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who looks set to be included in the state prayers in the Church of England
Next month, Camilla entertains the Womens Institute at a Palace garden party. If that all goes well, it might help her get on the state prayers list.

Hollywood star Alan Cumming, 50, born in Aberfeldy, Perthshire, the son of a Highland forester, says: I chopped all my hair off last week. It was a euphoric gesture, one Id been looking forward to for a very long time.
My hair is a symbol of being free  free to do with it what I will as an adult, independent, non-conformist man, but also free of the days long ago when my father held me down and cut it off with sheep shears.
Should Cumming Snr have gone to Specsavers?

Model Georgia May Jagger, 23, says her father, rouged rocker Sir Mick Jagger, attempted to prevent her from wearing make-up when she was younger.
She resorted to mentioning his own 1970s tarting-up regime, telling Glamour magazine: There was this picture of him with all this eye shadow on.
Whenever hed be like, You cant wear make-up!, Id be like, Well, you wore some once! Im like, thats telling the old slapper! She might also mention the picture of him singing in Hyde Park wearing a frock.

The new literary director of the Man Booker prize, after the death of highly respected Ion Trewin, is belletrist Gaby Wood.
She is the daughter of Michael Wood, critic and emeritus professor of English at Princeton University, New Jersey. Who happens to be this years chairman of the Man Booker judges!
Nice to keep it in the family, snipes a literary source. Surely strong-minded Ms Wood, 43, is a plausible choice.
Four years ago, I mentioned how she confronted a male admirer in Victoria Station whom she suspected of disloyalty. He knocked her down with his rucksack and railway police were called, I reported.

Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexanders naughty indiscretion  claiming the Tories would cut welfare by 8billion  might backfire on him.
If Beaker, as hes known  after the hapless character in The Muppets, pictured  loses his Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey seat, David Cameron could decline to sign off a peerage for the pesky, 42-year-old Highlander.

'I am told that the soldiers are from some 100 different Aboriginal language groups, yet are united in their love of country as well as in their extraordinary hunting and tracking skills.'
Prince Harry or Captain Wales as he is known in the British Army (pictured in Australia visiting the Australian War Memorial) is ending his military career with a month long secondment to the Australian Defence Force in barracks in Sydney, Perth and Darwin
Prince Charles and Harry pay tribute to Gallipoli fallen
Prince Charles said his son was prepared for his placement with the Australian army as he already is a fan of Aussie favourites - Vegemite and Lamingtons
The comedian prince then added: ' I suspect my old Harry is pretty well acclimatised by now and will probably be eating Lamingtons, Vegemite [ similar to Marmite] sandwiches, iced Vo-vos [a biscuit topped with jam, fondant and coconut] and violet crumble bars  and may even be threatening to buy a pair of budgie smugglers!
Prince William famously donned a pair of 'budgie smugglers' whilst playing water polo at university
'Whatever the case Ladies and Gentlemen, I am sure hell be happy down under because of the Aussies fondness for rangas!" '
Harry, with his fondness for scruffy jeans and t-shirts, is unlikely to have worn a pair of 'budgie smugglers'.
But his elder brother, Prince William, was pictured in a pair once whilst playing water polo at university.
The prince - known as Captain Wales - is currently on a month -long placement with the Australian Army before he quits the military for good.
The exhibition his father was at is the first major one of its kind in the UK to present a history of Indigenous Australia through objects.
It celebrates the cultural strength and resilience of both Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders.
This culture has continued for over 60,000 years in diverse environments ranging from lush rainforest and arid landscapes to inland rivers, islands, seas and urban areas today.
Hundreds of different Indigenous groups live across the vast continent of Australia, each with their own defined areas, languages and traditions.
It runs at the British Museum until the summer.

	Researchers at Salk Institute in California and the Chinese Academy of Sciences identified a genetic fault involved in premature ageing, which they hope to study to see if they can slow the process.

The researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, and the Chinese Academy of Science now hope to investigate to see whether there may be ways of slowing or reversing the process and see if this can have an impact on human health in old age.
GARLIC SLOWS AGING
It may be handy for killing vampires, but garlic can keep humans alive in more ways than one, researchers have found.
They say a nutrient in garlic offers the brain protection against ageing and disease.
It could even prevent age-related neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
Missouri researchers found a carbohydrate in garlic appears to play a key role.
'Garlic is one of the most widely consumed dietary supplements,' said
Zezong
Gu, associate professor of pathology and anatomical sciences at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study.
'Our research focused on a carbohydrate derivative of garlic known as FruArg and the role this nutrient plays in protective responses.'
Gu's team looked at the nutrient's ability to inhibit - and even possibly reverse - brain cell damage caused by environmental stress.
Environmental stress could include the
aging
process, smoking, pollution, traumatic brain injury or excessive alcohol consumption.
They claim it is also possible that disruption of the heterochromatin may play a role in age-related diseases like some cancers, diabetes and Alzheimer's
Disease,
although they have not expanded on these claims.
The study, published in the journal Science, used cells taken from patients suffering from Werner syndrome, also known as adult progeria.
Professor Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a geneticist at the Salk Institute who was one of the lead authors of the study, said: 'Our findings show that the gene mutation that causes Werner syndrome results in the disorganisation of heterochromatin, and that this disruption of normal DNA packaging is a key driver of aging.
'More broadly, it suggests that accumulated alterations in the structure of heterochromatin may be a major underlying cause of cellular ageing.
'This begs the question of whether we can reverse these alterations - like remodelling an old house or car - to
prevent,
or even reverse, age-related declines and diseases.'
Werner syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs in one in every 100,000 births and tends to appear once people reach puberty.
Sufferers show growth retardation, wrinkling, premature greying of hair, cardiovascular problems, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis and some rare cancers.
Professor Belmonte, together with colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, used cloning techniques to produce embryonic stem cells with DNA from people with Werner syndrome.
The images above show the difference between healthy human cells (left) and those that have been genetically modified to stimulate Werner syndrome (right). Their larger size indicates a sign of ageing
The researchers claim their discovery may allow the cellular processes that cause people to get old (stock image) to be slowed down or even reversed, although they emphasise that more research needs to be done
This allowed them to grow cells in the lab so they could study the underlying genetic and cellular processes involved in the disease.
Faults in a gene, known as the Werner syndrome RecQ helicase-like gene or WRN gene, are known to be involved in the disorder.
Previous research has shown that this gene is involved in repairing DNA, but the latest study showed it also plays a role in keeping the DNA packaged correctly.
This is thought to be important as it can affect how genes are switched on and off within a cell  known as epigenetics.
It is possible that as a cell ages, the heterochromatin becomes less tightly packaged allowing environmental factors to influence how genes are turned on and off.
Professor Belmonte said: 'This has implications beyond Werner syndrome, as it identifies a central mechanism of aging - heterochromatin disorganisation - which has been shown to be reversible.'
Dr Tamir Chandra, an epigeneticist at the Babraham Institute and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: 'Premature ageing is often attributed to more or less random damage to DNA and the genome.
'This new study reinforces that the organisation of chromatin- the packaging of DNA in the cell nucleus with proteins - can also lead to accelerated ageing of cells.'
Professor Ilaria Bellantuono, who studies musculoskeletal ageing at University of Sheffield, added: 'While in future it may be possible to use the knowledge developed to devise new interventions to slow or reverse human ageing, this is far away in time.
'We need to remember that this study is conducted in a single cell type whereas ageing is a complex multifactorial process which affects several systems.'

In desperation, they want to distance themselves from their erstwhile Tory partners and pretend none of the hard decisions taken in coalition had anything to do with them.
Predictably, following yesterdays dual assault on the Tories by his most senior colleagues, Nick Madame Fifi Clegg hinted that he might be willing to join Labour in coalition after the election.
Is there anything these double-dealing hypocrites wouldnt do to keep their ministerial cars?
Toxic legacy of RBS
Another huge annual loss for RBS  including a staggering 856million for fines and legal bills  is a damning indictment of what was once Labours favourite bank.
In his heyday, RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin was so feted by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown that he was more familiar with Number 10 than most of the Cabinet.
But greed and recklessness led to Sir Freds disgrace, the banks collapse  and a 46billion bail-out by the taxpayer.
Since then RBS has lost another 50billion and our chances of getting our money back are vanishingly small.
Could anything better illustrate Labours economic incompetence than their love-in with RBS?
In his heyday, RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin (above) was so feted by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown that he was more familiar with Number 10 than most of the Cabinet
Medical negligence
A poll of a million patients showing the vast majority are dissatisfied with the out-of-hours locum service they get from their local surgery is hardly a surprise.
Since Labours botched 2004 contracts allowed GPs to opt out of evening and weekend work yet be paid much more, confidence in the system has collapsed  with patients cramming into overstretched A&amp;E units rather than waiting to see a locum they dont know or trust.
It remains a mystery and a huge disappointment that in five years the Tories never once tried to get to grips with a problem that in the real world causes so many people so much distress.

LABOUR has finally admitted it was wrong to bring in 24-hour drinking  in the teeth of opposition from doctors and police and a tireless Mail campaign.So perhaps theyll also apologise for some other egregious mistakes  unfettered migration, wrecking the economy, encouraging a gambling explosion, presiding over a massive rise in red tape, selling off our gold reserves for a song, the 700million Millennium Dome and, oh yes, almost destroying the pensions industry  to name just a few.

	Researchers at California State University, Northridge, say that people who put on formal clothing are more likely to be abstract thinkers, good at financial decisions and better at handling criticism.

While the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs may have made it acceptable to wear jeans at work, the new study argues formal wear is better suited for the office environment.
Thinking abstractly can help in situations such as getting negative feedback on a piece of work, allowing the person to take a step back from the criticism.
While the likes of Mark Zuckerberg (right) and Steve Jobs may have made it acceptable to wear jeans to work, the new study argues formal wear, such as the suit worn by Benedict Cumberbatch (left) can have psychological benefits in the workplace
Michael Slepian, another of the paper's authors and a professor at Columbia Business School, said it could also help deal with financial situations by preventing impulse purchases.
The researchers performed a series of experiments in which students had to rate the formality of the clothes they had on.
They then answered a questionnaire designed to understand the way in which they think.
The researchers then asked the casually dressed participants to wear formal clothing, such as a suit, and found those who did began looking at the bigger picture when solving problems.
'No matter how often you wear formal clothing, if you are wearing formal clothing, then you are likely in a context that's not the intimate, comfortable, and more socially close setting with no dress code,' says Slepian.
'Thus, whether you wear formal clothing every workday, or only every wedding, my prediction is that we would find a similar influence because the clothing still feels formal in both situations.'
BRIGHTER CLOTHES CAN MAKE YOU FEEL HAPPIER, CLAIMS STUDY
Many of us spend our lives in black, brown, navy, white and grey, but by choosing safe shades instead of a brighter wardrobe, we could be missing out on the health benefits implicit in colour.
Jules Standish, author of How Not To Wear Black, is a style and colour consultant for women afraid of standing out, and she believes that changing your shopping habits can boost your well-being and self-esteem.
'Research shows that colours can have a psychological effect,' she says. 'When we look at certain colours it triggers neurological responses in the brain, and causes the hypothalamus gland to release hormones.
'Looking at warm, bright colours, such as red or pink, releases dopamine - known as the 'feel-good hormone' - which can improve our mood, heighten attention span and boost our sex drive.
'Cool blues, on the other hand, have been linked to the release of oxytocin, making you feel of calm.' Here, Jules gives her verdict on the clashing colours that couldn't be more suited.

	The study of more than 1,000 Britons with two or more brothers or sisters conducted for the Skoda Octavia, shows that 90 per cent of people in ‘director’ level positions sat in the middle.

And eight out of ten respondents attributed their work-life success to the fact they had to endure the third-best seat in the family car.
'Fascinating': The findings interested consultant child psychologist Laverne Antrobus (pictured)
The study of more than 1,000 Britons with two or more brothers or sisters was conducted for Skoda Octavia.
It said: Sitting in the middle seat means siblings and family members pin you in on both sides, youre robbed of a window seat and theres limited leg room.
The report goes on to state that such hardships could help children develop personality traits beneficial for a career in business.
For example, researchers found 44 per cent of middle-seat children described themselves as easy-going adults, a quarter said they were patient, and 21 per cent level-headed and adaptable.
Consultant child psychologist and mother-of-three Laverne Antrobus said: Cars are a unique environment and a lot can be revealed when everyone is sitting together in a confined space.
Its fascinating to see how a seating position in the back of the car, often over many years, can directly reflect or influence our personalities.

	Former police officer, Darren Stanton, is the UK's leading human lie detector and body expert and says contrary to the old adage  a liar CAN look you in the eye - but watch out for lots of blinking.

        <MainBody>Share
Philip Schofield was also caught fibbing, which Darren said he detected by a raised eyebrow.
The full-time human lie detector, who recently sat in on the phone hacking trial, then shared his secrets on the This Morning website.
How do you tell if someone is telling porkies?
'People might clutch a clipboard, file or coffee cup to their chest, creating a subconscious barrier if they're lying,' he says. 'Or hold it in two hands.
Busted! Amanda Holden caught fibbing by human lie detector
Darren knew presenter Amanda Holden was fibbing due to a slight flick on one side of the mouth, much to the presenters amazement.
'Statistically it's a myth that a liar can't look you in the eye. Three to five seconds of eye contact is normal. Any longer and they are either in love with you or fibbing.
He also said that brief answers and hesitation are also signs of lying.
'Liars don't like being asked for details. If they're not prepared, they'll either mirror your language or stutter for an answer,' he explains.
'The greater the consequences, the more signals a liar gives off,' adds, giving the example that a person who has committed a serious fraud would give more signals than someone who has stolen a cream cake.

	According to figures from the National Association of Estate Agents, just 22 per cent of homes were bought by first time buyers the lowest levels since last July due to a lack of suitable properties.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

The Mortgage Market Review, which introduced tougher affordability rules, is also thought to have played a part in reduced first-time buyer numbers.
Brought in last April, it requires lenders to carry out more thorough checks on borrowers income and spending habits to ensure they can afford the loan.
Yesterday, one of Britains leading academics said Britain must build more homes and tackle objections from complaining locals for the sake of our children.
Dame Kate Barker called for radical reforms to avert a major housing crisis and enable younger generations to buy a home.
The former Bank of England policymaker said more public land should be used for new housing, while local opposition to planning applications must be tackled where it has no substance.
Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Cambridge University Land Society, Dame Kate said: The housing system today is unfairly weighted towards those already owning a home, or lucky enough to inherit funds from property ownership.
House price rises varied wildly across the country, with an annual hike of 11 per cent in London, but a fall of 3 per cent in the North-East (file pic)
Existing home-owners should recognise the stark truth that if they insist on keeping new development away from them, and on keeping all the profits from higher prices, we will not be able to house our children in a fair manner, and in some cases perhaps they will not be housed at all.
The next Government needs to act radically and coherently.
She said the political parties housing manifestos were not fully convincing and said politicians were afraid to take tougher action and name areas which should be developed for fear of being unpopular.
The Conservatives have pledged to build 200,000 starter homes for first-time buyers in England by 2020, while Labour has pledged to abolish stamp duty for those buying their first home for under 300,000.
The Centre for Economic Performance echoed Dame Kates sentiments yesterday, claiming Britains planning system allows Nimbies  Not in My Back Yard  to employ endless ways to block new developments.
Academics at the CEP, part of the London School of Economics, said house prices had grown faster in the UK than almost any developed nations in the last 40 years.
Estate agents say there are a lack of new homes which is catching up the property market
The price of property per square mile in central London is one second to the tiny city-state and tax haven, and more expensive than New York, Paris and Geneva.
Academic Christian Hilber, at the CEP, said Government schemes such as Help to Buy, which allow people to buy a home with a small deposit, had further pushed up demand and driven up prices rather than helping the supply problem.
He said: These policies may thus be an ineffective waste of taxpayer money at best, and counterproductive at worst.
He said areas with the worst housing crisis, in London and the south-east, often had more rigid planning restrictions.
By contrast, it was often easier to gain planning permission in the north, where unemployment was higher, because developments were deemed palatable if it brought in jobs.
Mr Hilber said: If the South East, the most tightly regulated English region, had the regulatory restrictiveness of the North East of England, house prices in the South East would have been roughly 30 per cent lower in 2015.
He said planning laws could be altered to allow developers (potential winners) to compensate NIMBYs (potential losers) in an attempt to gain planning permission.
Estimates released today suggest a fall of 20,000 first-time buyers between the first quarter of the year and the last quarter of 2014.
Estate agents Your Move suggested sales to first-time buyers in the first three months of the year were about 61,000, the lowest quarter for two years.
They said a lack of new homes is catching up with the property market, meaning suitable affordable homes were in short supply.
Separate Land Registry figures showed house prices across England and Wales rose by 9,000 in March compared to a year earlier.
Price rises varied wildly across the country, with an annual hike of 11 per cent in London, but a fall of 3 per cent in the North-East.
Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief executive, said: Yet again, we see in black and white the huge hurdles aspiring homeowners are facing thanks to our housing shortage.
There might be talk of a cooling market, but the millions of people saving hard for a stable future will know a very different reality: their dream of a home has jumped another 9,000 out of reach.

Walking, sitting or sleeping, the one thing in common in all these shots, is that Igor is inseparable from his canine companions.
In a few of the pictures, the young boy is sat in front of a windowsill, his legs splayed comfortably in front of him, embracing one of his furry friends.

The two-year-old toddler appears to just enjoy being in the presence of his furry friends, who sit on either side of him
In this image, the pair play in a hay field as the sun sets in the background
In other snaps, he slumbers peacefully in front of a log-burning fire, with multiple dogs comfortably clasped under his arms.
Other images see the young boy with his arms wrapped around the obliging canines, and some of the heartwarming pics just see the boy enjoying the company of his best friends, as they play or sit together.
Three years ago, Igor's mother Gulczyska took up photography as a way to photograph the movement of horses.

After Igor was born, they moved from the bustling city of Warsaw to countryside village, Kampinos, where the two-year-old boy became the ultimate subject of her photography.
Alongside the adorable photos posted on Facebook the mother adds captions, with one reading: 'He is Your Friend, Your partner, Your defender, Your dog. You are his life, his love, his leader. He will be Yours, faithful and true, to the last beat of his heart. You owe it to him to be worthy of such devotion.'
Another image, where Igor and one of the dogs are sat on a dock with their backs to the camera, is posted with the caption: 'True friendship is sitting together in silence and feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had...'

	In Monday's interview, Brand hinted his support for Labour, saying he 'agreed' with Miliband several times. But he has now urged Brighton voters to 'definitely vote' for Green candidate Caroline Lucas.

Earlier this week, he posted an interview with Miliband, which had been carried out covertly in the comedian's kitchen at his home in trendy Hoxton, East London.
During the 15-minute interview, in which the pair heavily complimented one another,Brand had said: 'We want a bloke who says I'm in this for the right reasons, who says "I'm prepared to take on Murdoch, I'm prepared to take on HSBC  I'm prepared to take on the powerful elites who have got control of the Tory party".'
He claimed that if the Tories win the election on May 7 they will drive the country 'into the ground'.
Brand speaks to Lucas and comments on meeting the Greens
Days earlier, Russell Brand appeared to give his support to the Labour party during an interview for his YouTube channel, saying he 'agreed' with many points Miliband made
And, at the end of the interview, Brand said: I found it an interesting experience. It says a lot about Ed Miliband that he understands how the media works in this country now, the way the country feels at the moment, he was prepared to come round here and talk to us.
But in the latest interview, he tells viewers that the Green candidates are 'the very kind of people you want involved in administration and organisation'.
He said they were 'obviously decent people' adding: 'It's like the opposite of what I imagine it's like to meet David Cameron and what I know it is like to meet Nigel Farage.
'But, by their own admission, with a first past the post electoral system you're never going to have a significant Green representation.'
Brand locks horns with Miliband over tackling big corporations
The Labour leader had travelled to Brand's home in trendy Hoxton, East London, on Monday night to be questioned in his kitchen. Miliband said he thought the interview would make the campaign 'more interesting'
Brand has repeatedly said he does not vote because he believes the influence of corporate companies on the political landscape makes it futile.
The recovering heroin addict, who has also been treated for sex addiction, styles himself as a radical Left-wing activist.
He has faced severe criticism, including from senior Labour figures, for refusing to vote and revealing he has 'never' cast a ballot in an election.
He is also seen as a controversial figure for a senior politician to deal with, after a series of foul-mouthed outbursts, including his involvement in the Sachsgate scandal in which he left lewd messages on the phone of Fawlty Towers Actor Andrew Sachs.
Defending the interview, Mr Miliband  claimed earlier this week that he thought the tete-a-tete would make the campaign 'more interesting'. He added that he wanted to engage with people who are 'not listening to the election'.
But David Cameron ridiculed the decision, calling Brand a 'joke' and saying Mr Miliband was a joke for 'hanging out' with him.
He said: 'He [Brand] says don't vote, that's his whole view, don't vote, it would only encourage them or something. That's funny, it's funny. Politics and life and election and jobs and the economy is not a joke.'
Tory candidate Andrew Percy said: 'This is pathetic and desperate stuff from Ed Miliband but it won't be the first time he's sat down for a cup of tea with a hypocritical Leftie millionaire.
'This is a man who tells people not to take part in the democratic system. He should merit no mention at all because his views are anti-democratic.'

	Ms Sturgeon, grilled on a special BBC Scotland programme tonight, said Mr Miliband 'won't get his Budget through unless he compromises.' It comes after he insisted he wouldn't make any deals.

Two-thirds of MPs now have to back an earlier election, and governments can lose votes on Budgets, Queen's Speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election.
'[Mr Miliband] will not be able to get policies through without winning support from other parties,' she said last night in a Question Time-style programme on BBC Scotland.
'He won't get his Budget through unless he compromises.'
The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament
Ms Sturgeon's remarks come after the former home secretary David Blunkett admitted that Labour could not win a majority because of the SNP surge in Scotland.
He said: 'We have a situation where Labour could win literally scores of seats in England and Wales and see themselves unable to offer a majority Labour government because of what's happened in just one part of the United Kingdom.'
Mr Miliband tonight insisted he would not do any deals with the SNP - and claimed he would rather not form a government than team up with Ms Sturgeon's party.
The Labour leader's hopes of outright victory on May 7 have been shattered by an extraordinary surge in support for the SNP since the referendum in September saw Scots reject independence.
Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking in tonight's special BBC Question Time, said he would rather not be Prime Minister than make a deal with the SNP
David Cameron, appearing on the special BBC programme first, said he only needed 23 seats to win a majority
'How can we trust you?': Miliband grilled by audience member
Ms Sturgeon, who replaced Alex Salmond after the No vote, has vowed to use her gains in the election to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour administration.
An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News found support for the nationalists at 54 per cent while Scottish Labour had slipped to 20
per cent
Mr Miliband sought to dismiss the idea that he would be propped up by the
SNP: '
We are not going to do a deal with the Scottish National Party.
'If it meant we would not be in government. then so be it. I'm not going to give in to SNP demands - whether that is on Trident or on the deficit. We do want to put forward a Labour Queen's speech.'
But Ms Sturgeon said: 'If we have a big team of SNP MPs we can exercise real clout on behalf of Scotland, but we can also build alliances with others in other parts of the UK to get more progressive policies because I think Westminster
needs shaken
She
added: '
In the House of Commons now you can defeat governments, you can change the direction of governments without bringing governments down.
'That gives the opposition parties enormous clout.
'Now I know that David Cameron and Ed Miliband are clinging to the pretence that one of the other of them is going to get a majority, but all the polls say  and everybody else knows  they're not.
'And after the votes are counted, they're frankly going to have to wake up and smell the coffee and respect the outcome of the election.'

        <MainBody>Lead scientist Professor Srinivasan Beddhu

It was fascinating to see the results because the current national focus is on moderate or vigorous activity.
'To see that light activity had an association with lower mortality is intriguing.

adding two minutes of walking each hour in combination with normal activities, which should include two-and-a-half hours of moderate exercise each week.'
Researchers used statistical techniques to examine the effect of 'trading off' sedentary behaviour for different levels of activity
Professor
Beddhu
also explained that moderate exercise strengthened the heart, muscles and bones and conferred health benefits that cannot be obtained by walking alone.
The researchers analysed data from 3,243 participants in a U.S. health and lifestyle study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, who wore movement-sensing devices to measure their activity levels.
Co-author Dr Tom Greene, also from the University of Utah,
said: '
Exercise is great, but the reality is that the practical amount of vigorous exercise that can be achieved is limited.
'Our study suggests that even small changes can have a big impact.'
The findings are published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

	Messenger is expected to slam into Mercury today at speeds of 8,750 mph (14,081 kph), creating a crater an estimated 52 feet (16 meters) across.

Since then, it's circled the solar system's innermost planet 4,104 times and collected more than 270,000 images.
After four years orbiting the closest planet to our sun, the Messenger spacecraft will this week make a
death-dive
into Mercury.
But the probe hasn't finished its mission yet, with new, detailed views emerging of the planet as Messenger spirals closer to its surface.
Now Nasa has released an image taken by the probe's Visual and Infrared Spectrometer (
Virs
) revealing distinct features such as volcanic vents and fresh craters.
To highlight the geological features, the images have been overlain on a black and white mosaic from the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS).

This is an instrument with wide- and narrow-angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on Mercury's surface.
The spacecraft is expected to smash into the planet's surface at 2.4 miles per second (3.9km/s). The event will take place on Thursday 30 April at 3:30pm Eastern Time (7.30pm GMT).
However, when it does, Messenger will be behind Mercury, and hidden from Earth.
The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) is an instrument with wide- and narrow-angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on Mercury's surface. It was used to helped create these images of Mercury
'The last couple of hours will probably be pretty quiet,' Mercury mission head Sean Solomon told Nature .
'There will be a final orbit when the spacecraft passes behind the planet and we won't hear
from
it again.
'I have worked on the mission for 19 years. It's like losing a member of the family. Even pre-knowledge doesn't prepare you completely for the loss.'
Among the
Messenger has revealed to scientists in the past month are patterns of distinctive
hollows
- each around a couple of hundred metres wide - in the bottom of a huge impact basin.
It has also sent back detailed images of huge 1.2 mile (2km) high cliffs that cut across a crater named Duccio on the surface.
Another image shows a 621 miles (1,000km) long cliff that rises 1.8 miles (3km) above the surface, called Enterprise Rupes.
MERCURY: THE PAINTED PLANET
Researchers have uncovered the mystery of Mercury's 'stealth' colour scheme.
The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury black over billions of years.
It solves the mystery of Mercury's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists.
On average, Mercury is much darker than its closest airless neighbour, our Moon.
Airless bodies are known to be darkened by micrometeorite impacts and bombardment of solar wind, processes that create a thin coating of dark iron nanoparticles on the surface.
But spectral data from Mercury suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron, certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance.
As comets approach Mercury's neighborhood near the sun, they often start to break apart.
Cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight, so Mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets.
Scientists have calculated that after billions of years of bombardment, Mercury's surface should be anywhere from three to six percent carbon.
Data sent back by Mercury suggests these cliffs, or lobate scarps as they are called, have formed as Mercury has cooled and contracted over time, creating dramatic tectonic faults on the surface.
Another image shows a meteorite crater that has almost completely filled with lava on Mercury's northern volcanic plains, leaving just the hint of a rim behind.
It also shows how the contracting surface of the planet has also created strange formations where ridges and cliffs have hit other lava filled craters.
Among the images sent back by Messenger as its mission draws to an end is this picture of 1.2 mile-high (2km) cliffs cutting through the Carnegie crater. They are thought to have formed as Mercury cooled

Andy Calloway, Messenger Mission operatoins manager at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, said: 'The Messenger spacecraft operates in one of the most challenging and demanding space environments in our solar system.
'We have met that challenge directly through innovation and hard work, as exemplified by the stunning discoveries and data return achievements.
'Our only regret is that we have insufficient propellant to operate another 10 years, but we look forward to the incredible science returns planned for the final eight months of the mission.'
Launched in August 2004, Messenger has traveled more than 4.9 billion miles (7.9 billion kilometers) during its mission to Mercury.
Its journey included 15 trips around the sun before it entered orbit around Mercury in 2011 - the first spacecraft to ever do so.
During its mission is has acquired more than 250,000 images and collected more than 10 terabytes of data with its suite of seven instruments.
It has helped reveal volcanic vents that measure up to 15 miles (24km) across that were once sources for the large volumes of lava that have covered the surface and carved out valleys.
It has also revealed Mercury's complex internal structure and that the planet has an unusually large core that is still partially liquid.
On 6 April engineers used the last of the Messenger spacecraft's hydrazine fuel to try to push it into a higher orbit.
However, the tanks ran dry before they could raise it to more than 11 miles (18km) above the surface.

The above artist's impression shows Messenger as it orbits above the surface of Mercury. It is due to impact on the surface at the end of April as the planet's gravity slowly pulls it down out of its current orbit
Messenger has also revealed the temperature of Mercury's surface. This image of the planet's north pole shows the extreme heat it is subjected to with red indicating temperatures greater than 126c and blue -220c

Germans now think of themselves as the victims of Hitler and his Nazi Regime
Germans no longer see the Second World War as a defeatand now think of themselves as victims of the Nazis, it has been claimed.
Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation.
Research carried out by the
Forsa
Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade.
Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported.
The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin.
Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared.
'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper.
'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.'
Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other
tomes

	From signs that are meant to help tourists, but actually make them targets, to top tips from a professional pickpocket, this is what you need to know to avoid being targeted on your holiday.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>When travellers go on holiday, all they see are the exciting attractions and the prospect of exploring a new city.
All pickpockets see when these tourists arrive, however, is a gold mine, just waiting to be exploited.
But professional con artists do work in predictable ways and, with a few tips, you can understand how and where they operate, avoid areas where you are most vulnerable, and hopefully hold on to your valuables. 
Scammers are drawn to holiday goers and travellers but if you know what to look out for you can avoid cons
What they do
The methods thieves use to plunder valuables are varied and constantly evolving.
In a bid to crackdown on crime the British Transport Police revealed the most common techniques pickpockets use, which includes the 'concealed hand', the 'helpful stranger' and 'the stall.'
Thieves operating in pairs work by one member stalling the target, by getting stuck at the underground ticket barrier for example.
The other member will take advantage of the victim being stalled, and smuggle their valuables quickly away.
When taking the possession, thieves will often cover their hands with a newspaper or coat, so others are not aware of their movements.
Sometimes a stranger will offer to help you out the blue, with brushing something off your coat, or helping you with directions, and while you are caught off guard this is the perfect opportunity for someone else to take your belongings.
Published in Paris Match magazine, photos show Romanian and Bulgarian gangs operating in Paris
Where they strike
The biggest feat a pickpocket must overcome is entering the personal space of an individual.
This is not easy as people tend to be on their guard if they are in a new environment and out in public.
Crowded places such as busy attractions are the perfect places for overcoming this personal barrier.
Professional pickpocket and entertainer James Freedman, who has been consulted for his expertise by the Metropolitan Police, said high tourist attractions where people are looking up are popular, such as Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower.
Ironically places which have signs warning of pickpockets are common hunting grounds too, as people will instinctively check their pockets, which alerts thieves to exactly where their valuables are located.
Thieves operate on misdirection, and any time you are distracted from your valuables, you are a target
How to beat the pickpockets
1. Place your wallet in your front pocket instead of the back. Using an elastic band around the wallet will prevent it from smoothly sliding out your pocket as well.
Consider taking a dummy wallet with you, as most thieves will not look for another once they have found the first one.This can also work with a dummy old phone. 
2. Spread your valuables instead of keeping them in once place.
If you are unlucky enough to be a victim of pickpocketing, and your ID, passport, cards and important documents are spread out, you will not lose everything in one go.
3. Do not accept food or drink from strangers who you've just met in hotels or on buses or trains.
4. Before travelling, research whether the destination is notorious for any particular scams. Embassy websites and online travel forums are particular good sources.
TIPS FROM A PROFESSIONAL PICKPOCKET: WHAT THIEVES TRY TO STEAL
Pickpocket James Freedman , who instructs on how to avoid thieving criminals, told MailOnline Travel: 'The number one target item today is a smart phone, not so much for the device but for the data it contains.
'Today's 'Internet of Things' means our phones hold a treasure trove of personal information that can be used for social engineering, bank fraud, identity theft and other crimes.'
These tips will minimise your loss in the event of theft:
1. Smartphones are valuable but not nearly as valuable as the information they contain. Make sure your phone and its SIM card are both protected with a PIN.
2. Don't use the same PIN for all your bank cards and your phone.
3. Make a note of your phone's IMEI number (dial *#06# to see it) so you can block it if it's stolen.
4. Register your gadgets &amp; other valuables with the UK National Property Register at immobilise.com
5. Install a phone tracking app.
6. Keep a secure copy of your passport, insurance details, phone IMEI number and emergency telephone numbers online, just in case.
7. Don't keep your driving licence with your credit cards. Losing your cards is bad enough without giving the thief your address, full name and date of birth too.
8. The details on contactless bank cards and passports can be stolen electronically. Get yourself a RFID blocking purse or wallet.
9. Don't carry your home address with your house keys  and if your home and car keys are together, make sure your satnav doesn't accurately identify your home.
10. Only carry what you need. If you don't need all your cards or cash, leave them at home.
5. Carry a backup ATM or credit card in case you lose your main card.
6. Females should consider sewing a pocket into their bras for valuables, as thieves are well aware of money belts, and know how to target them.
7. When sat down keep your bag looped through your leg, or under a chair leg, to avoid someone making off with the whole bag.
8. Consider a slash free bag, to avoid pickpockets cutting into your belongings to extract valuables.
9. Don't draw attention to your belongings by letting pickpockets know where you are keeping each valuable.
10. Remain aware; pickpockets succeed by successfully misdirecting your attention, so be suspicious if someone tries to distract you during your day.

Never give your card details out to the front desk of a hotel, contact the police and hotel staff immediately if you get a late night call asking for this
Other scams to be aware of
1) Fake wake up call
According to Cheapflights.co.uk, one of the most popular travel scams is when guests are woken up by someone claiming to be from the front desk.
The person on the phone will often claim the internal computer system has crashed and they require your credit card information again.
Sleep addled guests have been known to provide their bank details, resulting in the scammer draining their accounts.
The scam has been known in places such as Georgia, US.
How to avoid it: Never give out bank details or any information over the phone and notify hotel staff and police immediately. 
Beggars' injuries are often genuine and the stories behind them sobering. Give children food instead
2) Injured beggars
Peter John, author of Around the World in 80 Scams: An Essential Travel Guide, warned in his book that many beggars fake injuries to get greater donations.
'Gangs of panhandlers prey on travellers' generosity,' wrote Peter.
'This is especially common in India, South America and south east Asia.'
Sometimes the injuries are real, with some horrific stories behind how they were received.
In 2008, Pakistani police arrested a begging gang. An eight-year-old boy told them that one of the gang masters had broken his arm.
In such gangs, begging children would be forced to collect money, and then hand it over to gang masters, who would keep them alive in return for the cash. 
How to avoid it: Instead of giving money, why not give the children food as a donation.
Keep an eye on all your valuables when going through security, and beware of other pushing in front of you
3) Airport security
Be aware in the airport of people stealing your valuables as you go through airport security.
Once you have placed your laptop, phone and wallet on the conveyor belt, someone will dash through in front of you with keys in their pocket.
During the delay, your belongings will have gone through the X-ray machine, and will be quickly taken by an accomplice on the other side.
The Kenyan police posted warnings about this scam on their website and the US Federal Aviation Administration also mentions it.
How to avoid it: Keeping your belongings with you until just before you walk through security and keep an eye on them after they are processed by the machine.
Order official hotel room service and do not be tempted to opt for takeaway menus pushed under the door
4) Phony takeaway menu
No matter how hungry you are or late it is watch out for fake menus. Once you've settled into your hotel room a takeaway menu might be  slipped under your door.
If you order from it there's a strong chance you won't see any food but the person on the other end of the phone now has your card details and will be making a large withdrawal.
How to avoid it: Eat in local restaurants or order from room service.
5) Corrupt policemen
'Policemen pretend that tourists have broken the law and demand thinly-disguised bribes,' says Peter. 'Unfortunately, this can happen anywhere with badly paid and corrupt cops.'
It happened to him in northern Mexico. On the way to the American border a policemen stopped them and engaged in conversation.
He spotted a pocket penknife and demanded what he called a 'quick fine' of $30 (19). The fine was negotiated to $10 (6.50) and the penknife was confiscated.
There are thousands of stories like this but unfortunately there's little you can do to prevent it, save stay at home.
How to avoid it: Being amenable, keeping your temper and try to talk your way out or around the situation.
6) Airline ticket refund ruse
It is important to beware of cheap tickets and refundable schemes.
'Scammers advertise refundable airline tickets free on sites like gumtree.com,' says Peter John.
'They sell them for cash (to you) and then get the money they paid for the tickets refunded to their credit cards.'
The result is you end up with no ticket and an airfare down; the scammer has your money as well as the cash they originally paid for the ticket refunded.
How to avoid it: Buy tickets directly from airlines or first-hand through trusted websites.
Beware the lovely woman offering you a sprig of rosemary, which is said to be a sign of friendship
7) Rosemary or bracelet seller
Beware the lovely woman offering you a sprig of rosemary or a bracelet which can symbolise good luck or friendship.
Next thing you know she will be holding your hand and reading your fortune.
Once you accept the goods or allow her to begin the fortune telling spiel she'll demand money in return; more and more loudly, until you are embarrassed into paying and fleeing.
Watch out in Madrid and New Delhi for this.
How to avoid it: Walk swiftly in the opposite direction and do not show an interest in the products.

	Samantha Jenkins, 19, collapsed and died suddenly after complaining of a headache at home in Llanelli, South Wales in June 2011.

'She went upstairs that night and suddenly shouted down to me, "Is this what it feels like to die? I feel paralysed."
'The next thing we knew, there was a thud and she was on the floor. It all happened so quickly, it was absolutely horrible.'
The teenage shop worker was rushed to hospital, but doctors were unable to save her and she died in her mother's arms three days later.
Mystery: Samantha's sudden death might have been linked to chewing gum, according to a pathologist
After a pathologist carried out a post-mortem investigation, it was concluded that Samantha died of natural causes and there was therefore no need for a full inquest.
In a report, the pathologist suggest that Samantha had suffered a swelling in her brain due to a lack of salt in her system.
The pathologist added that low salt levels can be caused by severe diarrhoea, and excessive consumption of chewing gum 'may have played a role' in making Samantha ill.
One sweetener often used in chewing gum is sorbitol, which is also used as a laxative, while aspartame, another common sweetener, has previously been linked to serious health problems.
Mrs Morgan said: 'The pathologist said a bout of diarrhoea could have caused her salt levels to dip so low it caused her brain to swell.
'His report said chewing gum may have played a role in inducing the diarrhoea.
'It seems absolutely ridiculous that Sam could have died from chewing gum. But I want to find out the truth - I want to solve the mystery of my daughter's death.'
Inquest: A hearing next week is set to investigate why Samantha collapsed and died
Sorbitol is used to sweeten a variety of sugar-free snacks, including diet drinks and many types of chewing gum, but in a more concentrated form doctors also use it as a laxative.
A study in 2008 warned that consuming too much sugar-free chewing gum can lead to excessive weight loss and diarrhoea thanks to an overdose of sorbitol.
The report in the British Medical Journal gave details of two patients, a man and a woman who each ate around 20 sticks of gum and ended up becoming underweight and suffering severe stomach pains.
In 2012, an Italian woman died after being given sorbitol by her doctor which appeared to have come from a contaminated batch supplied by a UK-based firm.
Aspartame, one of the most common types of sweetener, has been the focus of massive controversy despite doctors' insistence that it is perfectly safe.
Pepsi announced this week that it would no longer use the chemical in its diet drinks after customers shunned the product over allegations it might be linked to cancer.

	The image, which has yet to be verified, was re-posted on Twitter by an anti-ISIS activist in Syria with the message: 'What will happen with this child?'

It was uploaded by Abu Ward Al-Raqqawi, a self-proclaimed 'founder of the Syrian revolution', with the warning: 'This child will be risk to you not just to us'.
The images bear strong similarities to earlier ISIS propaganda which attempt to radicalise the next generation of jihadis.
Terror experts revealed to Daily Mail Australia earlier this week that such images attempt to showcase the group's supposed longevity.
Sickening: This image of a newborn baby pictured next to a handgun, grenade and Islamic State birth certificate was posted last week by another anti-ISIS activist based in Raqqa in Syria
Disturbing: The images bear a strong resemblance to earlier ISIS propaganda, like this one of a baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by weapons
Shocking footage shows young Jihadist 'cub cub' in training
The post says the newborn child is called 'Jrah', while its mother's name is 'Om' and its father's name is 'Abu.' It claims the certificate next to the baby is an 'ISIS issued ID for a child.'
The image was believed to be posted by Al-Raqqawi in the hope of garnering attention to the international threat posed by ISIS.
Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones told Daily Mail Australia the image appears to be authentic.
'By showing the birth certificate, and the fact that the group are indoctrinating babies, I think ISIS are indicating they will be around for a long time.'
'It's an interesting signal of life within the caliphate. Obviously by posting opposition to the Islamic State from within their borders the activist is operating with great risk.'
In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf released this image of his seven-year-old son  holding a severed head
Jones said the post could be an international plea for military intervention on account of the rapid deterioration of life in Raqqa, the stronghold of the Islamic State.
Last September, a harrowing image was released by the group of a baby dressed as a fighter lying on an Islamic state flag next to grenades and automatic firearms.
In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf posted a Twitter image of his seven-year-old son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier with the caption: 'That's my boy!'
ISIS has made it a policy to groom children to take part in jihad, brainwashing them from a very young age.
Online propaganda is an integral part of this process, with the group using scores of social media accounts to disseminate their messages to youths around the world.

In the background stand bloodthirsty armed jihadists and a baying crowd.
Images of two men being behead by Isis in a Syrian village called Jarnyah, west of Raqqa, also appeared on social media this week.
It's thought that they were executed after being accused of practicing sorcery.
The blindfolded men are seen resting their heads on a wooden block, with a huge machete resting on their necks as a crowd looks on.
Last week pictures emerged of depraved Islamic State militants in Syria brutally stoning two gay men to death only seconds after they were photographed embracing and 'forgiving' them.
The shocking images were taken in ISIS-held territory in the province of Homs and show the two accused men being savagely executed by up to four jihadis.

Huge, bloodthirsty crowds were seen in the desert clearing where the group of executioners made a display of hugging the blindfolded couple and telling them they were forgiven of their 'sins', before pummeling them to death with hundreds of fist-sized rocks.
Meanwhile,Iraq is poised to deploy Shi'ite paramilitaries backed by Iran to Sunni tribal areas west of Baghdad, a move supporters say is needed to defeat Islamic State militants but opponents say could inflame more sectarian violence.
Shi'ite paramilitaries have already played a central, if controversial, role alongside regular army units in recent months in the Iraqi government's first major successful campaign against Islamic State fighters, helping to capture Saddam Hussein's home town Tikrit on the Tigris River north of Baghdad.

So far, however, the government has avoided deploying the militia in the Euphrates River valley province of Anbar west of the capital, a vast Sunni tribal homeland that strides the main routes to Jordan and Syria. Baghdad considers Anbar the next target in its campaign to retake territory from the militants.
But with the army advance having faltered, officials are now speaking openly about dispatching the militia, organised under the umbrella of 'Hashid Shaabi' - 'Popular Mobilisation'.
This could alarm the United States, which is supporting the Iraqi government from the air against Islamic State fighters but is wary of Baghdad's alliance with Shi'ite militiamen who openly receive arms, funds and strategic direction from Iran.
Some Anbar tribal figures fighting on the government side against Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, have issued calls in recent days for Baghdad to send the militia to their aid.

        <MainBody>Mark McElligott, 35 (left), said his 18-month-old daughter Lilly (right) died in a 'tragic accident' after her buggy rolled
on to
train tracks in Austria
A father has described his heartbreak after his baby daughter was killed when her pram was sucked off the platform at an Austrian station and into the path of a heavy goods train.
MarkMcElligott, 35, originally fromSouthport, Merseyside, said 18-month-old Lilly died after her buggy rolled towards the tracks at Linz
Ebelsberg
station on April 9 and was hit by a freight car.
Describing the incident as a 'tragic accident', he said the girl had been at the station with her 33-year-old mother who left the pram with the brakes on while she went to the ticket office.
While she was gone a train passed through the station at speed, and the movement of air was enough to suck the buggy off the platform.
He
said: '
It was basically a load of chance incidents which led to it happening.
'I had just bought a new car which was automatic instead of manual and my wife didn't feel comfortable driving it so she decided to take the train into town.
'She only had a 20-euro note and she had tried to put it in the
machine
but they had no change. She made the decision to leave Lilly for a few seconds to get a ticket.
'She put the brakes on but in those few seconds a heavy goods train came past and sucked the buggy and Lilly into the side of the train where she hit one of the wagons. It killed her instantly.
'
A police spokesman confirmed that trains regularly travel through stations at 100kmh (62mph).

'Foreign employees established contact with officials in DPR ministries and agencies, showing interest in obtaining information about the situation in the republic,' said a source.
The agency was accused of 'hiring DPR citizens for work without signing agreements with them, evading the payment of taxes into the DPR budget'.
Footage showed mobile phones and money - valued at around 15,600 - apparently confiscated in the office.
The move comes amid fears Russia is preparing to back new military action in eastern Ukraine to grab further territory for rebels opposed to the Kiev government.
'They claimed that they aid women and girls who have

'However, this assistance is purely emotional - conducting group sessions, individual consultations, and meetings of interest, workshops.'
In fact they 'stirred up opposition' to the Donetsk authorities.
'They also took down personal details from people's passports' and sought to 'weasel out information' from rebel officials.
'Our specialists detected these people trying to eavesdrop,' said the source.
The LifeNews correspondent said: 'Special bugging devices [were] found at the

The International Rescue Committee provided humanitarian assistance to women and girls in the battle-worn region
'Money confiscated, [was] the equivalent of 500,000 Hryvnia. All the employees suspected of espionage were taken to the hotel where they were staying and had a chance to pack their belongings before being deported from the DPR's territory to Kiev.'
The workers were operating 'illegally' under the aegis of the US Agency for International Development, it was claimed.
One of those sent by coach to Kiev was named as humanitarian operations manager Bruce Perry, who was quoted denying any allegations of improper conduct.
'We were supposed to begin our work and start our programme of assistance,' he said.
'The local administration gave us lists of the neediest residents of the local administration, so, we started working in the area. We also talked to people to find out which areas most needed our help.
'
The security source said: 'Our troops issued them the formal order of deportation, along with subsequent prohibition of re-entry to the Republic, took them to a checkpoint on the Zaporozhe motorway, and put them on an autobus bound for Kiev.'
The West sees Moscow as pulling the strings in eastern Ukraine, where an uneasy ceasefire is in increasing jeopardy.
David Miliband became the President and CEO of the IRC on 1 September 2013 on a reported salary of 300,000.
The IRC declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.

A police spokesman said: 'We have examined CCTV footage and can confirm that the door was already bricked up when the train left the depot to begin work.
'The depot was not guarded and the security fences are easy to climb over.
Art or vandalism? It took some 12 stops before authorities were alerted to the well-executed prank as commuters assumed it was a new feature
The unknown men are believed to have sneaked into an S-Bahn depot overnight and bricked up the doorway in one of the cars, causing 7,200 of damage
'We are continuing to look at the tapes to try and see who did this. At the moment we have no idea why this was done.
'There was no message or communication explaining motive.'
Bewildered commuter Uwe Ebersbacher, 43, said: 'I was on my way home from work and waiting for the train to come as usual.
'When it pulled into the station everything seemed normal until it stopped and the door in front of me was cemented up.
'No one seemed to be paying any attention to it though and I just assumed it was a new feature or something.'

	There was no VIP treatment for Prince Harry who opted for a low-key night out at The Stables Bar on Wednesday in Perth.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
2.2k shares
He then indulged in a AU$24 (12.40) dessert plate, as he dined with around eight other soldiers from the barracks.
Harry sat among the 60 or 70 other customers at the bar for more than two hours, but was not approached by fellow diners and was able to enjoy his meal uninterrupted by fans.
'No one hassled him for photos despite saying patrons were well aware of who was in their midst,'McLernon said.
'Not one person approached him. They treated him like any other person.'
Harry who? The bar owner told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday that 'no one hassled the Prince for photos' despite saying that patrons were well aware of who was in their midst
I'll find my own! A private area with barriers was set up for the royal, but the 30-year-old said 'no' and instead chose a seat in the middle of the room for himself and around eight others
Harry flew out to Western Australia earlier this month for a four-week placement with the Australian Defence Force, but broke off his trip to spend Anzac Day in Gallipoli, Turkey, with his father, Prince Charles and to hand out medals at the London Marathon.
He returned to Australia on Monday to complete the placement, which will be followed by a week-long tour of New Zealand.
When it came to paying the bill, Prince Harry's table split it between them equally.
'I don't know if he offered to pay or not but I reckon the guys that he was with wouldn't have let him pay,' Mr McLernon explained.
The bar owner disputed other media reports that the royal left a 'sizable tip', explaining an 'average tip' was left by all.
'The whole table left a tip, it wasn't a personal tip from him,' Mr McLernon said.
Paying his respects: Prince Harry attended the New Zealand Memorial Service marking the centenary of the World War One Gallipoli campaign at Chunuk Bair last week in Eceabat, Turkey
Prince Charles and Harry pay tribute to Gallipoli fallen
Any day now! Harry is awaiting the arrival of his next niece or nephew with his sister-in-law, Duchess of Cambridge Catherine Middleton, now several days overdue with the fourth in line for the throne. Pictured here with Prince William and Prince George in 2013

Mr McLernon thought that Harry could have passed as a young Aussie guy, wearing a cap and a blue shirt while he chatted and laughed with those at his table.
He was said to have looked calm and relaxed as he awaits the arrival of his next niece or nephew with his sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, now at least five days overdue with her second child.
Harry had stretched out his stay in London as long as possible, but with the baby, who will bump Harry down to fifth in line to the throne, not making an appearance, the prince was forced to return to Australia.
Instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew, Prince George, who turns two in July, at the Cambridge's apartment at Kensington Palace.
Kate and William, had been told to expect their new son or daughter  who will be fourth in line to the throne  by Saturday, according to sources.
The Duchess  whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April'.
'He looked like he was just really just enjoying the company of the guys he will be with for a few days,' Mr McLernon said of Harry's trip to his bar.
Back in Oz: Harry is back in Western Australia to complete the second part of his stint with the Australian Defence Force after spending Anzac Day in Gallipoli alongside his father, Prince Charles
Star of the show! He also spent the weekend in London for the marathon
Meanwhile, Harry's minders sat at another table also enjoying some dinner, all the while keeping a close eye on the popular prince.
Known for his impeccable manners, just like his late mother Princess Diana, he made sure to thank those at the end of the night for their service and food.
'He spoke to our staff and he shook the manager's hand and said, "Thank you for having me, I loved the food",' said Mr McLernon.
Harry then headed back to spend the night at Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne with his fellow soldiers.
After spending time earlier this month with NORFORCE, an infantry regiment of the Army Reserve, the Prince attended Anzac Day commemorations in Gallipoli before returning to Western Australia for the final two weeks of his month-long ADF secondment.
He is currently training with the Special Air Service Regiment at Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne and will also go to Sydney before leaving for an official tour of New Zealand on May 9.
Treated just like everyone else! Despite sitting with 60 or 70 other customers for over two hours, not one person approached him upstairs in The Stables Bar on Hay Street
All equal: When it came to paying the bill, Prince Harry's table split it between them evenly
Wholesome: Harry sipped on sparkling water and tucked into a plate of smoked pork scotch with spiced bourbon, sweet potato pure and white cabbage slaw, worth AU$28, around 14.50

TV presenter Susanna Reid, who has been unable to boost ITV's disappointing breakfast TV ratings
She was the big money signing that was meant to turn around the ailing fortunes of ITVs early morning slot.
But it seems even Susanna Reid has been unable to boost the broadcasters disappointing breakfast ratings.
One year on from its launch, Good Morning Britain has been revealed to attract 40,000 fewer viewers than Daybreak, its axed predecessor.
These figures are an average from Daybreaks final twelve months and Good Morning Britains first year on screens.
However, since January, an increase in Good Morning Britains viewing figures means it is performing better than Daybreak did over the same period last year.
Miss Reid, 44, was poached from the BBC with a reported 1million contract to front the weekday morning programme but 12 months on, she does not seem to have brought her popularity with her.
The mother-of-three was in huge demand while a popular host of BBC1s daily Breakfast programme and after an impressive run to the final of Strictly Come Dancing.
While on the BBC she could expect a daily audience of 1.4million, the figure on Good Morning Britain stands at 559,000, even lower than the 597,000 drawn in by Daybreak in its final year.
Since Miss Reid left Breakfast, its ratings have dropped very slightly, by approximately 30,000 viewers.

TV watchdogs were inundated with complaints as senior Labour figures accused presenter Kay Burley of intervening 'aggressively' on the Labour leader as he took questions from the studio audience.
However, she used the interview to hit out at these claims.
Kay Burley hides wardrobe malfunction during election grilling
Faced criticism: The presenter came under fire following the interviews with David Cameron and Ed Miliband as many felt she fawned over the Prime Minister while taking a harder line with the Labour leader
She said: Some people thought I was harder on [Miliband] than David Cameron [but] Ive been in TV for 28 years, Im used to the Communications Act. Im not in a position where I can let bias show.
No one would accused Paxman of being an over-tough interviewer. Being a woman, people are more openly critical if I take a tough stance on a politician.
During the show, the party leaders were interviewed by Paxman for 18 minutes each, and also took questions from a studio audience with Miss Burley acting as moderator on the show broadcast on Sky News and Channel 4.
Covering her ninth general election, she has picked out chairing the debate as a highlight.
She also said the inclusion of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in some of the television debates means women are better represented in this campaign than ever before.
Responds to backlash: Miss Burley has hit out at claims that she showed bias during the TV interview with the Prime Minister and Ed Miliband
Gender bias: The news anchor said: 'Being a woman, people are more openly critical if I take a tough stance on a politician
She said: I flipping hope so. Its about flipping time women were better represented. The other day, someone suggested that a woman who would be 50 at the next election would be too old [to be a candidate]. It makes my blood boil. Imagine someone saying that to a man. They wouldnt.
Fellow broadcaster Susanna Reid also came under fire following her interview with David Cameron as many claimed the  Good Morning Britain presenter flirted with the Prime Minister.
Responding to the claims, Ms Reid, 44, told ES Magazine that she wanted viewers to be able to relate to David Cameron as a person - as party manifestos were yet to be published.
She also said she has learned to take criticism 'on the chin' after years in the industry and always goes into interviews well prepared.
Also criticised: Susanna Reid provoked a storm of comments on Twitter as many viewers accused her of flirting with David Cameron during her interview last month on ITV's Good Morning Britain

	The militant group known as Jaysh Al-Islam, which opposes both ISIS and the Syrian government, has shown off its strength with a huge military parade in the embattled city of Damascus.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

The group operates in the embattled Syrian city of Damascus and their ongoing battle against President Bashar Al-Assad is reportedly funded by the wealthy nation of Saudi Arabia.
The Arab kingdom has sent millions of dollars to arm and train their fighters so they can defeat the Syrian regime and 'increasingly powerful Jihadi organisations', according to the Guardian.
Known as the Army of Islam, the insurgent group was created in 2011 when Saudi Arabia allegedly engineered the merger of over 50 rebel factions after growing alarmed at the rise if Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
It is a fierce enemy of both those Islamist groups as well as Jabhat Al-Nusra, but embraces independent rebel forces and 'non-Jihadi' units.
Their graduation ceremony for  trainee soldiers in the Ghouta suburb of Damascus was attended by the militants' leadership who watch proudly as their troops march in perfect unison across the expanse.
Jaysh Al-Islam is led by Sheikh Zahran Aloush who addresses the thousands of armed soldiers and tanks once they have assembled on the vast concrete ground below.
Joining forces: Jaysh Al-Islam was formed when up to 60 rebel factions in Syria merged to fight the Syrian regime
Armed: Soldiers rested on the Army of Islam's many tanks (pictured) as their leaders commanded them to 'continue to wage Jihad'
Commander: The group is led bySheikh Zahran Aloush (pictured), who is considered one of the most powerful leaders in rebel-held Syria
Fierce: His fighters, who marched in perfect unison in Damascus, are waging a battle against ISIS in Syria and have reportedly attacked their headquarters in the Lebanese city of Arsal
The Salafist leader is considered one of the most power military chiefs in rebel-held Syria and called for the 'cleansing' of all Alawite and Shiites in Damascus.
Know paradise is waiting for us since we either achieve victory or die in honour... So take your strength from Allah and wage Jihad in the cause of your Lord
Sheikh Zahran Aloush, leader of Jaysh Al-Islam
He says to his soldiers: 'Today, legions of Mujahadin, stand in readiness to raise the banner of Allah, uphold his words, move forward to fight and defend his religion.
'Know paradise is waiting for us since we either achieve victory or die in honour... So take your strength from Allah and wage Jihad in the cause of your Lord.
'We will leave these fields in which we finished our course and preparation and we will continue waging Jihad.'
He refers to their enemies, which include Islamic State and Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's troops, as the 'dirtiest and most despicable enemies of Allah'.
In February, Aloush tweeted that his insurgents had ambushed Islamic State's fighters at their headquarters in the Lebanese city of Arsal, according to reports by AL Monitor .
Might: Their incredible show of strength in their Damascus stronghold of Ghouta included a fleet of armoured tanks
Deadly: That was followed by a series of choreographed drills from its masked special forces units who - unlike their comrades - dressed entirely in black
Force: The graduation ceremony was held for Jaysh Al-Islam's trainee soldiers who stood to attention as fleets of armoured vehicles drove past
They allegedly 'killed and wounded three and took out the eye of a fourth person' in what was reportedly their first act of aggression outside of Syrian territory.
His tweets also indicated the group - which is widely known for its links to Saudi Arabia - was prepared to carry out military attacks outside Syria.
AL Monitor claimed his tweets referenced ISIS's expansion in the Ghouta and Qalamoun suburbs of Damascus which it controls.
He said the attack in Arsal was retaliation for the bombing Islamic State carried out on its headquarters in the Ghouta suburb.

	St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, has reportedly launched an investigation after traces of cocaine were found in toilets near the private ward where the Duchess of Cambridge is set to give birth.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Traces of cocaine were reportedly found in toilets at the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth, it has been claimed.
Evidence of the Class A drug was said to have been found in a public area of the Cambridge Wing at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington.
The reported discovery, behind a toilet cistern, comes as the overdue royal mother-to-be is set to give birth at the nearby Lindo Wing.
The Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth at the hospital's private Lindo Wing (pictured). Traces of cocaine were reportedly found in a toilet in another wing of St Mary's hospital
The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured on her last public engagement at the Stephen Lawrence Centre, is due to give birth any day now
The hospital has said it will investigate the finding, according to the Daily Mirror , who carried out the investigation using drug testing wipes.
A spokesman for Imperial College Health Care NHS Trust told the MailOnline: 'We take the safety of our patients and staff extremely seriously.
'We have 24/7 security cover at all our hospitals with regular patrols and CCTV covering key areas both outside and inside buildings, constantly monitored by our security teams.
'We work closely with police to investigate reports thoroughly and take action to ensure the safety of our colleagues, patients and there families,' they told the newspaper.
'If there is any sign that a person is abusing substances on one of our sites we will take immediate action to address this.'
The Lindo Wing is in a separate building from the Cambridge Wing, where the discovery was reportedly made by the newspaper.
Kate, who is thought to be at least six days overdue with her second child, gave birth to George at the wing in July 2013.
Parking restrictions outside the hospital were lengthened for a further five days by Westminster City Council this week.
The extension to the restrictions, which had begun on April 15  now run into May.

	Aberdyfi public toilet set to be converted to three-storey holiday home

	The toilet block in Aberdyfi, north Wales, could hardly be described as picturesque, but its owners are confident that the view from the building makes the site a perfect place for a new holiday home.

Architects George &amp; Tomos hope to put up a three-story house with two bedrooms - one on the ground floor and another on the first - as well as a sitting and dining room on the top floor which will take full advantage of the view.
The new home, to be called 'Ty Bach' which means 'little house' in Welsh, will be clad in slate and timber.
Plan: This architects' drawing shows how the home is designed to blend in to the cliffs behind
Resort: Aberdyfi is popular with visitors from the West Midlands and other parts of Britain
The architects insist that the 'neutral, natural materials' will enable the building to 'blend in with the cliff face behind'.
It will be a tall and narrow property, with vast windows showing that the main attraction of the house is expected to be its view over the river Dyfi.
The planning application states: 'The current building is incongruous with its surroundings and the site provides potential for a better development.
'The applicants have a strong association with Aberdyfi and saw the opportunity to enhance the site to provide a modest sized high quality accommodation in the village to make the best use of the redundant site and location.'
Ugly: The toilet block has been disused for several years despite its potential for development
Gwynedd Council sold off the toilet block in 2013 after the facilities had fallen out of use.
However, Aberdyfi Community Council has lodged a formal objection to the plans, saying the development is 'inappropriate' and 'not in keeping with the rest of Aberdyfi'.
It is not yet known whether the house will be sold to a buyer to use as a holiday home, and rented out for short-term lets.
Aberdyfi, also known as Aberdovey, is 30 miles north of Aberystwyth, and is one of a number of Welsh resorts which have historically been popular with residents of Birmingham and other parts of the Midlands.

After one raid in September 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, the Queen Mother wrote of the 'horrible' bombing of her home by the German Luftwaffe.
Referring to Buckingham Palace as 'dear old BP', the Queen Mother wrote: 'We heard the unmistakable whirr-whirr of a German plane.
'We said 'ah a German', and before anything else could be said, there was the noise of aircraft diving at great speed, and then the scream of a bomb.
'It all happened so quickly, that we had only time to look foolishly at each other, when the scream hurtled past us, and exploded with a tremendous crash in the quadrangle.'
The Queen Mother went on to describe how she and the King had to duck down 'like lightening' [sic] into a corridor, keeping away from the windows through fear of flying broken glass, before calmly going to an air-raid shelter.
On her way to safety, she recounted to her mother-in-law - whom she fondly addresses as 'darling Mama' - she saw housemaids giving first aid to three workmen injured in the Luftwaffe attack.
The letter ends with a PS saying: 'Dear old B.P is still standing and that is the main thing.'
When victory in Europe was announced by Sir Winston Churchill on the 8th May 1945, Mrs Rhodes took to the streets to celebrate with the Queen, then 19, and Princess Margaret, who was 14.
'The whole thing was so exciting,' she remembers. 'We were all so excited that the war was over so just being part of this huge celebration - you imbibed the excitement of it all.'
'It was like a wonderful escape for the girls,' she continues. 'I don't think they'd ever been out and walked among millions of people like that. It was just freedom to be an ordinary person.

The killing field where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran spent their last moments alive looks like amakeshift parade ground being readied for a school sports carnival or fete.
Sheets of purple tenting material are stretched over a series of four metre high open frames which have been hammered into a patchy stretch of grass in front of a low bank.
The area is known as Limus Buntu which roughly translates as Limus 'deadlocked' or dead end.
The killing field: This pathcy stretch of grass with a makeshift purple tarpaulined structure is where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed on Wednesday, just metres apart from each other with the crosses already in place for each of the doomed drug traffickers
A close up of one of the crosses erected in the daylight hours of Tuesday on the field in front of a small rise in a clearing on Nusakambangan Island, the scene of the executions which shows the spot where the two Australians sang 'Amazing Grace' as they waited for the firing squads to end their lives
Crosses for each of the eight prisoners who were to be executed in the early hours of Wednesday morning are in place and a shirtless man is seen working alongside at least five other people on the site.
'You can also see nine piles of wood that have been installed at the location.The nine piles were laid for nine death row [prisoners] to be executed at midnight tonight,' one witness said.
The photographs of the kill site emerged on the Indonesian news outlet detik.com , which has claimed that the area was a firing range and that Indonesian authorities had arrested people trying to get there.
The photographs reveal the close range - just a few metres apart from each other - in which the condemned drug traffickers found themselves when they were transported to the spot just after midnight on Tuesday, Indonesian time.
Chan and Sukumaran executed by firing squad in Indonesia
Last birthday on earth: Myruan Sukumaran (centre), pictured with Andrew Chan (left) inside Besi Prison on April 17, his 34th and last birthday and the anniversary of his arrest with the Bali Nine. Twelve days later he and Chan were shot dead
Two black forest cakes a birthday banner and a handful of friends appear to have made Myuran Sukumaran smile on the day he turned 34, a bittersweet occasion as it marked ten years since his arrest and the last time he would celebrate a birthday
Reports following the executions said that between Chan and Sukumaran and the other six men, including one Indonesian and five Nigerians, there was around five metres.
Waiting for a row of eight wooden 'death seats' for each condemned man to be put in and secured with cable ties, the scene made for a grisly place of death, with no prisoner able to escape the horror of what was about to happen.
Irish priest Father Charlie Burrows of the Cilacap Catholic church St Stephens was present during the executions and has described how the nine men were tied to the execution chairs with their arms outstretched, in a crucifix formations, while they sang Amazing Grace.
Ambulances carrying bodies of Bali nine duo arrive at Cilacap
A coffin containing one of the eight men executed on Wednesday including Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran is drive from a police ferry onto the mainland for the remains to be returned back home
'They were singing on the crosses and we were in a tent not too far away from the execution place trying to support them,' Father Burrows said. 'The Australians seemed to be more or less leading the singing'.
Images have also emerged of a smiling Myuran Sukumaran celebrating his last birthday inside Batu prison, twelve days before his execution.
Sukumaran turned 34 on April 17, the tenth anniversary of hi arrest along with the other members of the Bali Nine heroin syndicate in Denpasar.
Taken from footage filmed by Indonesia's TV one station, the pictures show an apparently happy Sukumaran in the last known pictures taken of him.
The impromptu party includes Andrew Chan, a makeshift banner which says 'Happy 34th Birthday Myuran' and four other people, one holding a iced chocolate cake.
Myuran's brother, Chinthu, had delivered two black forest cakes into Besi Prison two days earlier.
A photographer was provided by the Indonesian Attorney-Generals office to document the pairs final weeks in isolation, capturing Sukumarans birthday party and Andrew Chans last minute wedding to his fiancee Feby.
In the pictures, Sukumaran is wearing a black patterned t-shirt and blue jeans, with Chan in a pair of blue shorts and a grey t-shirt.

	Britain faces a life expectancy timebomb as average man to live to 85 in 2030

	By 2030, many women in England and Wales will live to nearly 90 on average, while men will survive to their mid-80s. In some parts of the country’s a woman’s life expectancy could be as high as 92.

It said average life expectancy for women will rise from 83.3 in 2012 to 87.6 in 2030. For men, it is predicted to increase from 79.5 to 85.7 over the same period. These forecasts are higher than those issued by the ONS  by 2.4 years for men and one year for women.
In a few areas of the
country
life expectancy was likely to approach or pass 90 years for men and 92 years for women, according to the study.
The historic gap between men and womens life expectancy will also continue closing, the study said, partly because of the legacy from smoking in middle-aged and older women.
Lead scientist Professor Majid Ezzati, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said: The bigger gains in life expectancy we predict will mean pensions will have larger payouts, and health and social services will have to serve an older population than currently planned.
The wealthy should be prepared to pay higher taxes to fund better health and social care, researchers have warned (file picture)
However, the study also found that the difference in life expectancy between the
best-
and worst-off communities was likely to increase to a level that mirrored the divide between Western and developing countries.
In the some affluent areas, people could be living as much as eight years longer than those in deprived ones.
Professor Ezzati
added: 
We also forecast rising inequalities, with bigger increases in lifespan for people in affluent areas than those in disadvantaged areas. This means wealthy people will benefit more from health and social services than poor people,
and therefore
should be prepared to pay its costs through higher taxes.

Wealthy people will benefit more from health and social services than poor people,
and therefore
should be prepared to pay its costs through higher taxes
Professor Majid Ezzati
By 2030, people in affluent southern England and well-off districts of London are expected to be living more than eight years longer than those in northern urban centres such as Blackpool, Liverpool and Manchester, as well as South Wales. That is equivalent to the difference in life expectancy between the UK and Sri Lanka or Vietnam.
The research drew on
death
rate and population data for 375 local authority districts in England and Wales dating back to the 1980s. Five mathematical models were constructed whose accuracy was tested by seeing how well they predicted actual life expectancy trends from 2002 to 2012. The best model was then used to make forecasts to 2030.
Our methods better reflect how longevity is changing than those currently used, and our forecasts are more accurate, said Professor Ezzati.
Campaigners warned that unless Britain radically improved its social care system, the country would face a continual crisis of poor care for the elderly.
Dot Gibson, National Pensioners Convention general secretary, said: Whilst it might be true to say that some sections of the population are living longer, we must also be aware that many are spending more years living with a long-term illness or disability.
Just because some wealthier people are adding extra years to their lives doesnt mean that everyone can keep working till they drop.
Professor Sir Michael Marmot, director of the Institute of Health Equity at University College London, said: A key question that the research did not address is healthy life expectancy. Will people have longer healthy

	German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a new quota system to be introduced that would administer migrants more equally among the European Union and its 28 members nations.

But while Germany dealt with around 200,000 asylum claims last year, Croatia had just 450 and the Czech Republic around 1,000.
Merkel's policy was backed by EUCommission President Jean-Claude Juncker
Merkel's proposal was back byEU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who called for a legal migration system to be introduced.
Mr Juncker said that the EU needed to be more 'ambitious' to 'stop human lives ending on the high seas'.
He said: 'We have to be sure that the deal with the tricky questions of legal migration.
'We have to leave the door partly ajar.
'If we don't open the door to legal migration then the unfortunate people of the world will be climbing in through our windows.'
Around 280,000 illegal border crossings were detected in Europe last year, a new record.
More than 170,000 came through the Mediterranean, mostly Syrians and Eritreans leaving via strife-torn Libya to find better lives in the rich EU.
Around 1,700 are feared to have died in the last few weeks, yet the high-season for sea migration does not start till June.
At the EU summit, leaders pledged to double the number of ships and aircraft in the Triton border operation in the Mediterranean and to triple its budget to 9 million euros a month.
But some of the assets for the expanded operation, which include border and migration experts, will not be available for several months, and many are only being offered for a month or two.

	The Conservatives have got some things wrong during this election campaign, but their stance on Scotland is definitely not one of them, according to STEPHEN GLOVER.

And rather than face this fact  rather than confront the terrible truth that it has been the author of its own prospective annihilation in Scotland  Labour implausibly tries to pin the responsibility for what is happening on the Conservative Party.
The fatal seeds, of course, were sown by the Blair government, whose devolution settlement in 1998 was  ironically enough  intended to neutralise the nationalists. George Robertson, who had been Shadow Scottish Secretary before 1997, declared that devolution will kill nationalism stone dead.
It had the opposite effect. Indeed, it has put a rocket under it. Labour believed a Proportional Representation system north of the border would ensure that the three Unionist parties would collectively always be able to out-vote the SNP in the new Scottish Parliament. But by 2007 the SNP had formed a minority government, and by 2011 they were in sole charge.
According to Ed Miliband, the Prime Minister is demeaning himself and his office by endangering the Union
Ed Miliband insists Labour will not do any deals with the SNP
The Scots who were so powerful in the Labour Party  Gordon Brown, Donald Dewar, Robin Cook, Alistair Darling and George Robertson  had brushed aside the concerns of Tories and others. In 1994, the Prime Minister John Major presciently described their devolution proposals as one of the most dangerous propositions put before the British people.
Nor did the Labour hierarchy bother to take notice of the few in their own ranks, such as Tam Dalyell, who also prophesied disaster. Mr Dalyell said that devolution is a motorway, without exits, to independence. And so it is proving to be.
Misguided Labour figures were not just guilty of overconfidence. They arrogantly presumed Scotland was theirs to rule. Needless to say, they gloried in the rapid decline of the Tories in Scotland, who as recently as the 1955 general election had won over half the popular vote.
A 1989 document called The Claim Of Right, largely crafted by Scottish Labour MPs and signed, among others, by Mr Brown and Mr Darling, asserted the sovereignty of the Scottish people. Although the intention was to restrict self-determination merely to a limited devolution of power from Westminster to Edinburgh, Labour had, in fact, set a course to independence.
The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, has said that the partys MPs will vote on English-only laws
And now the nationalist behemoth which Labour has nurtured is destroying it as comprehensively as the Tories in Scotland have been demolished. The Ipsos MORI poll I mentioned gives the Conservatives 17 per cent of the Scottish vote and Labour only 20 per cent. The party that thought it virtually owned Scotland has become as irrelevant as the Tories.
I dont say this with any relish. In fact, I regard the rise of the SNP as a national disaster because it is now almost impossible to see how Scottish independence, and the break-up of Britain, can be avoided.
The truth is that the Labour Party is in a state of denial. Facing the strong possibility of complete extinction north of the border, it cant admit that what has happened is the consequence of its own foolish handiwork. And so it deludedly blames Mr Cameron.
But the Tory leader played little or no part in this catastrophe. Given that after 2011 the SNP were the majority party of government in Scotland, he could hardly have denied them the referendum for which they clamoured.
The worst that can be said about him is that he allowed too much time before last Septembers referendum, so that the SNP were able, like an army preparing for battle, to become an even more effective fighting force.
While Mr Cameron had a dozen other things on his mind, Alex Salmond, then SNP leader, and Nicola Sturgeon could spend every working hour plotting their campaign. As the weeks and months went by, so the SNP gradually increased their support.
Then, on the basis of one rogue poll in the final days of the campaign which suggested that the nationalists could win the referendum, the Saltire was flown above Downing Street and home rule was hurriedly promised in a desperate and ill-thought attempt to buy off the Scots.
But the Prime Ministers errors pale into insignificance by the side of Labours over the past quarter of a century. He is not responsible for its coming rout in Scotland, and the impending triumph of the SNP.
Why shouldnt he now point out the dangers of Labour governing with the support of a party whose central belief is the destruction of Britain? Hes only speaking the truth. Moreover, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that the partys MPs will vote on English-only laws, using the specious argument that these might theoretically have a knock-on effect on the Scots.
The normally sensible Alistair Darling  a Unionist Scot as well as a former Labour Chancellor  has spoken in bizarre terms of the Tories
I can think of nothing more certain to lead to the break-up of the Union than the prospect of a minority government, led by Labour and shored up by the SNP, pushing through legislation on the NHS and tax that only affected England. How can anyone attempt to argue that this is fair? It would be profoundly undemocratic.
Admittedly, Labours collapse in Scotland is an unlooked-for electoral boon for Mr Cameron. Without it, he would not even have a chance of leading the largest party in a hung Parliament. But I dont see why he should be blamed for Labours kamikaze behaviour north of the border.
What a mess this is. Scotland is apparently lost to the Unionist parties, and its very hard to see how it can remain part of Britain for long. Whoever wins, huge constitutional wrangles lie ahead at Westminster.
Maybe Scottish independence would have happened one day even without devolution. There is no way of knowing. All we can say with certainty is that the historic error of devolution has accelerated a process which is leading ineluctably towards political strife and, almost certainly, final separation.
And this needless tragedy the end of our United Kingdom  is almost all Labours work.

	Senior Tories have been increasingly frustrated by what they claim is a Left-leaning slant to much of the BBC’s coverage, which Mr Javid said sometimes left him thinking: ‘What was that?

Sajid Javid (pictured) has complained of bias in the BBCs election coverage
Culture and Media Secretary Sajid Javid has complained of bias in the BBCs election coverage and threatened a review of how the Corporation is governed.
Senior Tories have been increasingly frustrated by what they claim is a Left-leaning slant to much of the BBCs coverage, which Mr Javid said sometimes left him thinking: What was that? Im sure they could have done a more balanced job.
He cited a debate on BBC Radio 4s flagship news show, saying: Last week, listening to the Today programme, there was a debatethey were all anti-Tory. It came across as very, very anti-Tory.
The shows three guests all savaged David Cameron and his party with Scottish comedienne Rhona Cameron calling the Tories a cancer.
On Sunday, BBC presenter Andrew Marr was forced to apologise after falsely accusing the Prime Minister of saying fox hunting is his favourite sport, admitting: We should have checked harder.
Mr Javid suggested a review of the BBCs charter, due to start this summer, would have to consider balance in coverage, required by law in election campaigns. He said: The BBC Trust has a role and theres a role for Ofcom. During elections in broadcasting theres a requirement to give a fair share to all of the main parties.
The Culture Secretary also said the Tories would take no further steps to seek to impose a system of state-sponsored supervision of regulation of the Press that critics warn would end 300 years of freedom.
Labours manifesto said it would implement the recommendations of the Leveson report into media standards through the controversial Royal Charter, as well as introducing new rules on media plurality.
Publishers that refuse to join a regulator approved under the Royal Charter will be hit with exemplary damages in libel and privacy cases. The charter appears dead in the water, as publishers refused to sign up.

Mr Farage thinks his party could still get more than ten MPs if he manages to cause a big shock in the eight days before polling day.
A senior Ukip aide said: He needs to make a special intervention. This is a big moment in the campaign.
Cameron and Miliband do not want to talk about this because they know the whole issue hinges on EU membership.
Nigel is going to highlight how jihadis are entering Europe, getting EU passports, and then are able to easily come to Britain because of the open-borders policy.
'If there is going to be one country where these guys are going to head to, it is going to be us because of the Iraq war and our involvement in Afghanistan and against Islamic State.
Mr Farage said yesterday he opposed EU action to tackle migrant deaths in the Mediterranean because it could lead to a common migration policy and let millions of people into Britain. He added that the problem had the potential to be more damaging than the eurozone crisis.
Nigel Farage gives his take on the Mediterranean migrant crisis
Mr Farage will warn that if the EU agrees to give refuge to migrants from North Africa, it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to Britain
I think what is happening in Strasbourg is far more significant than anything that has been said by any of the party leaders about immigration  during this campaign, he said.
They utterly refuse to accept that we are no longer in control of our borders  Im quite certain Miliband and Cameron will try and ignore this, so I am going there [Strasbourg] to engage in that debate and make sure they cannot ignore it.
He added: Are we about to see one of the great Brussels dreams come true  a common EU immigration policy? We currently have a net migration figure of 300,000. Goodness knows what it could be if this happens.
'Potentially EU passports are about to be given to a very large number of people and the British political class in Westminster is powerless.
Mr Farages speech could be his last in the European Parliament if he is elected MP for Thanet South. On a campaign visit to Hartlepool yesterday, he accused the SNP of being openly racist, adding: The anti-English hostility  is totally extraordinary.

	Everything about SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured) says makes my blood boil, and yet there is something about the woman that I find utterly compelling, writes SARAH VINE.

But the similarities dont stop there. There are even parallels in their personal lives. Thatchers husband, Denis, was often portrayed as a bit of a downtrodden drunk. In fact, he exerted a sobering influence on his wife, both politically and strategically.
Peter Murrell, Sturgeons husband, is also hugely involved in his wifes career. Not only is he chief executive of the SNP, he is also widely credited for masterminding his wifes recent  and very successful  makeover.
Despite that, he, too, is largely derided. His nickname is Penfold, after the meek sidekick of TV cartoon hero Dangermouse.
Sturgeons tactics, too, are reminiscent of the Thatcherite era. She gives the lie to almost every fashionable modern political theory: that you must only appear at carefully stage-managed events; that you must not stray off-message; that you must show a calm grasp of the facts rather than passion and emotion.
Unlike every mainstream senior politician on the campaign trail, she also has a genuine connection with the grass roots of her party, whom she treats with respect rather than a faint whiff of revulsion. You sense that she really gets the dreams and frustrations of ordinary people.
She also shares Mrs Thatchers legendary disregard for political etiquette. Maggie never quite mastered the Sir Humphrey-like nuances of a well-oiled, intellectually slick network of ex-public schoolboys. And neither can Sturgeon.
Not that she cares. She couldnt give a stuff whose nose she puts out of joint: what matters is getting her message across.
And that, really, is the heart of the matter. They stand out as the kind of women who just roll up their sleeves and get on with it.
Sturgeon also illustrates one of the basic truths of successful women in politics: that for all the appeal of a Cameron Cutie, what voters really respect is someone who mirrors the qualities of the most important female figure in their lives: their mother. Its no coincidence that the Germans call Chancellor Angela Merkel Mutti, or mummy.
Thatcher was the ultimate political matriarch. Sturgeon is more of a Nanny McPhee figure, the sort of unprepossessing woman who may lack initial appeal, but who ultimately turns out to be wise and canny.
Her policies may be swivel-eyed, but if the Tories had a woman with one-tenth of her talent, I for one would be breaking out the bunting on May 8.

Former Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan
If she's the world's sexiest...
Former Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan (right) is, there can be no doubt, a very pretty woman indeed.
But youd be hard pushed to call her the sexiest woman in the world, surely?
And yet, according to lads mag FHM, that is exactly what she is  ranking higher than model Kate Upton or actress Scarlett Johansson.
Ill wager most women would consider either of those two sexier by far.
Perhaps this explains it.
Because often what women think of as sexy (smouldering Hollywood glamour) is not at all what men actually like.
If this poll is anything to go by, men just like a perkier, much glossier version of your average girl next door.
Wholesome, smiley and, above all, non-threatening.
According to new research, a glass of wine gives us an attractive glow.
I find that two or three actually turns me into Elle Macpherson.
Michelle Keegan looks sensational in behind the scenes shoot
THE CONTROLLER OF BBC2 AND BBC4 WHO'S JUST BEYOND PARODY
What Ill never understand about the BBC is how it can make shows as brilliantly sophisticated and funny as W1A  the parody starring Hugh Bonneville about corporate life at the BBC  and yet still appoint women such as Kim Shillinglaw to senior positions.
At first, I thought she might actually be a new character in the show. But no, shes a real person  the Controller of BBC2 and BBC4.
And she really says things such as BBC2 brings you the universe and BBC4 brings you the atom; and The reason why Mary Beard can crack a joke about Roman sex lives and, you know, penises, is because, you know what? She bloody knows her stuff. She also said BBC2s audience  average age 60  has a punk mindset.
The final straw was when, asked what shows she admires, she cited Channel 4s Benefits Street.
A cynic might say that shes been appointed to drive the channel into the ground so the Beeb can justify axing it. In which case, shes the perfect woman for the job.
Heres a very modern dilemma. I was having my nails done at our local beauty salon when a crimson-haired young girl in a black biker jacket, laser-cut micro mini and black tights walked in.
A few minutes later, she emerged from the waxing room minus the tights. Just one problem: because of the laser-cut pattern in her skirt, her entire bottom was visible through the fabric.
And I do mean her entire bottom, which was not inconsiderable.
Should I have said something? Or should I, as I did, have let her head off down the street, apparently oblivious to her predicament?

Lord Brand of Bonkers
Turns out that self-styled revolutionary Russell Brand  a man who claims to loathe all politicians equally  is, like the majority of showbiz personalities who make a handsome living overcharging TV licence-payers for their services, a Labour supporter, granting Ed Miliband an audience at his 2 million flat (or mansion, as it will be known if Labour gets in).
No mystery as to why an endorsement from Brand (above), who has nine million Twitter followers, would boost Labours standing with the yoof. The only question remains is what hell get in return. Lord Brand of Hoxton?
In a world so bonkers that Red Ed could really be PM, dont rule it out.
Russel Brand welcomed Labour leader Ed Miliband to his east London home for an interview on Monday night

I hate to break it to Kate, but if she thinks George is looking forward to his new sibling, she should think again.
Little usurpers are never entirely welcome in the nest.
I have a friend whose second baby arrived with a gift for his elder brother: a much coveted Tonka truck. It wasnt long before his parents heard a deafening crash from outside.
They raced to find out what had happened . . . and there was the truck, smashed to smithereens, after falling  or was it pushed?  from a second-floor window.

Vets are the fat cats
According to a group of leading vets, owning a pet can expose humans to a number of serious diseases, from scabies to tuberculosis.
Luckily, theres a solution: frequent expensive check-ups and vaccinations to ensure your furry friend isnt harbouring anything nasty that you might catch.
No wonder so many pet owners complain that vets these days seem to operate their own money-printing presses.

Unwanted male attention can be very intimidating, as poor Poppy Smart, 23, found when subjected to such a daily barrage of wolf whistles that she had to call the police.
Its one of lifes ironies that by the time a woman is confident enough to see off a wolf whistler, shes often too old to attract one.

This picture of Aldi employee Christian Touesdale, 18, helping an elderly customer with his shopping went viral
If only all 18-year-olds were like Christian Trouesdale, the Aldi employee whose picture helping an elderly customer home with his shopping went viral.
But isnt there something a little sad about the fact that such a basic act of human kindness should cause such a sensation?

An expert in the science of ageing called Dr Alex Zhavoronkov has announced hes planning to live to the age of 150.
To achieve this goal, he says, he will have to turn his back on getting married and having children.
Such things, he claims, cause irreversible ageing.
No doubt. But theyre also what make life worth living.

I know Poldark actor Aidan Turners awfully handsome and everything, but does he really have to spend quite so much time with his hair in his eyes? I was getting heartily sick of it by Sunday nights finale.
Perhaps hell get a decent haircut in prison. Or, at the very least, an elastic band.

	Labour and immigration truths as 90% of households headed by a migrant

	Between 1997 and last year, 65 per cent of the country’s 2.7million extra housing units were headed by a foreigner. And in the peak period – 2005 to 2009 – the figure rose to a staggering 89 per cent.

A household is classed as one person living alone, or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room or sitting room or dining area.
The striking figures for 2005-09 reflect the huge numbers of people arriving here from Eastern Europe.
It is not possible to draw a precise link between the number of households and the number of homes taken by migrants because more than one household may live under the same roof.
But the report, based on data from the Office for National Statistics, said immigration must have contributed to driving up both house prices and rents.
Between 2005 and 2014, an annual average of 133,000 additional households were headed by a person born overseas.
In the past five years  during which the Tories brought immigration under control, only for numbers to spike again  the average was 115,000.
The MigrationWatch report says: If each additional immigrant household over the last ten years had been provided with a new dwelling we would have had to build the equivalent of 133,000 homes a year  that is over 360 a day or one every four minutes.
Ed Miliband yesterday claimed he would get a grip on immigration and said Labour would implement a clear, credible and concrete plan within 100 days of taking power
In a speech yesterday, Mr Miliband claimed: We will deal with peoples concerns because we have listened, we have learned and we have changed.
But his words were immediately undermined by a refusal to put any upper limit on the numbers to be allowed in.
Later, Labours immigration spokesman, floundered when confronted with his partys record in office and the belated attempt to appear tough.
On BBC TVs Daily Politics show, David Hanson dodged questions about Labours performance and insisted he was interested in the future.
Contrasting Labours record with its new position, host Andrew Neil told him: Every single thing youve said to me today flies in the face of everything you did in power.
He was also quizzed by Mr Neil over his partys proposal to continue with the Governments cap on non-EU migrants.
And he was asked why Labours plans to limit benefits for EU migrants for two years do not cover an array of tax credits and other in-work benefits.
Mr Hanson, a Home Office minister under Gordon Brown, was also asked about Labours failure to bring any prosecutions for not paying the minimum wage between 1998 and 2007.
He replied: Im interested in the future. I dont know the answer to the question from ten years ago. Whatever a Labour government did in the past were looking at the next five years.
Between 1997 and last year, 65 per cent of the countrys 2.7million extra housing units were headed by a foreigner.And in the peak period  2005 to 2009  the figure rose to a staggering 89 per cent
Labour would restrict child benefit, child tax credit and jobseekers allowance for migrants, he said.
But that would leave untouched a vast array of benefits paid through the tax system that experts say act as a huge draw for migrants.
The Tories have pledged to block access to all in-work benefits for four years. Mr Milibands speech was roundly dismissed by election rivals. Ukip said Labour could not be trusted on the issue, given the partys record in office.
Deputy chairman Suzanne Evans said: They opened the doors to millions of migrants in 1998, deliberately.
They shamelessly used race and religion as incitements to get people to vote for the Labour Party. Any pledges they make on immigration are frankly laughable. I simply dont believe that they want to control immigration.
A Conservative spokesman said: This is a desperate attempt by Ed Miliband to distract from his refusal to say what deals he is prepared to do with Nicola Sturgeons SNP to prop him up in Downing Street.
The Conservatives have a plan to control immigration and build a system that puts the British people first. We will regain control of EU migration by reforming welfare rules, tackle criminality and abuse of free movement and cut immigration from outside the EU.
Warning: Writing in the Daily Mail last week, PM David Cameron attacked Labours stance on immigration
Writing in the Daily Mail last week, David Cameron attacked Labours stance on immigration  warning voters considering backing Ukip that they would increase the chances of Mr Miliband securing the keys to Number 10.
The Prime Minister set out very clear and hard-headed plans to bring down numbers of incomers.
He insisted he understood peoples fears and worries about immigration and promised to negotiate a new deal with Europe that will address the most powerful draw for EU workers, with a four-year ban on them claiming benefits.
Mr Cameron said: Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased fivefold.
If youre someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win  then you will get no referendum, and a return to uncontrolled immigration.
His intervention last week came after a major survey revealed voters wanted the Tories to be far tougher on mass immigration.
Barely one in ten Britons said they were satisfied with the Prime Ministers border policies.
The poll by Ipsos MORI suggested it was this unhappiness that might explain why large numbers of Conservatives have been switching to Ukip.
It found that of those who supported Mr Cameron in 2010, but now intend to vote for Nigel Farages party, 94 per cent are dissatisfied with immigration policy.

	Ed Miliband's climate change law in the Brown years will cost £50k per home

	In 2008, it was Miliband who was responsible for pushing through the final version of the Climate Change Act — easily the most costly law passed by Parliament, writes CHRISTOPHER BOOKER.

What seems barely credible, if one reads through the lengthy debates in Parliament on this Bill, is that scarcely a single MP showed the slightest interest in how the new target could in practice be met  any more than did Mr Miliband himself.
The CO2 emitted by fossil fuels, such as coal, gas, oil and petrol, is inseparable from pretty well every activity which keeps our economy functioning, from the way we make 70 per cent of our electricity to virtually our entire transport system.
As for electricity alone, we no longer use this just for lighting, heating and refrigeration, as we did in those far-off three-day week days of the Seventies.
In the age of the computer, we are now dependent on it for everything from our work and mobile phones to shop and supermarket tills, the cashpoints where we collect our money and the signalling and traffic lights which keep our trains and roads running.
Yet thanks to Mr Miliband, and those MPs who mindlessly voted for his Bill, we are committed to cutting back on what currently makes this possible by such a colossal amount, it is impossible to see how it could be realistically achieved without closing down virtually all our economy.
It was Ed Miliband who decided, following pressure from green lobby groups, to up the emissions reduction target from 60 per cent to an even more mind-boggling 80 per cent
Ed Miliband gives his take on carbon emissions in 2008
What our ministers and officials fondly imagine  as we can see from their speeches and policy papers  is that we can somehow meet Mr Milibands target by closing down all those old CO2 polluting coal and gas-fired power stations, to replace them with tens of thousands of wind turbines and a fleet of zero carbon new nuclear reactors (though it looks increasingly unlikely we will get even one of those in the next decade).
The fossil fuel plants we still rely on for more than two-thirds of the electricity we need will be allowed to survive only if they are fitted with carbon capture and storage, to pipe away their carbon emissions to be buried in holes under the sea  a hugely expensive technology which is pure wishful thinking, since it has never yet been made to work commercially, and would treble the cost of electricity even if it was viable.
Lesson
The drive to decarbonise our economy by piling on green taxes and building ever more hugely subsidised windfarms has already added hundreds of pounds a year to individual electricity bills, helping to drive millions more households into fuel poverty. But even now we are scarcely scratching the surface of meeting our legal commitments.
Miliband was also the most intimate Treasury advisers of Gordon Brown when he took the reckless gamble of doubling Britain's spending
The one lesson above all we might have learned from Ed Milibands brief spell in charge of our energy and climate change policy is that he is quite astonishingly out of touch with any practical reality.
So lost was he in his green fantasy world that his only concern was the climate change part of his job title. He showed no interest in the other half of the job he was paid for, the energy bit, i.e. how to keep our lights on.
Informed observers at the time noted how the only people Secretary Miliband seemed to want to talk to were green lobby groups, such as Friends Of The Earth, Greenpeace and the canny chancers making millions out of windfarms and the renewables subsidy bonanza.
The Big Six energy giants  who, whatever we think of them, were actually keeping the lights on  he treated with disdain or outright hostility, as polluting capitalists, interested only in making obscene profits (unlike those green, clean developers of the wind farms which were increasingly disfiguring our countryside).
Many may recall their shock in September 2013 when Mr Miliband, by then Labour leader, announced one of his first acts on becoming PM would be to freeze energy prices for three years (instantly knocking 3 billion off the share value of the big energy companies).
But what made this even more ludicrous was that no one had done more to push up Britains fast-rising energy bills than Mr Miliband himself.
Lacklustre
It was he who had set in train the policy which made this inevitable, with his Climate Change Act.
And it was this same policy which was then so enthusiastically carried on after 2010 by his Lib Dem successors at DECC: first Chris Huhne (until he had to resign before being jailed for lying), and now that lacklustre green zealot Ed Davey, so dim that he has shown no more practical grasp of the technicalities of electricity production than Mr Miliband himself.
All this alone should raise a huge black question mark over the man now aspiring to become leader of our country next week. It shows he is so obsessively blinkered by woolly ideology that he has no practical judgment at all  about money or anything else.
We should remember that, in an earlier time, he and Ed Balls were the most intimate Treasury advisers of Gordon Brown when, in 1998, our formerly prudent Chancellor took the reckless gamble of announcing he intended to double Britains public spending in ten years.
This was what happened, leading of course to the most disastrous public spending deficit our country has ever known: a catastrophe from which we shall be struggling to recover for years to come.
Ed Miliband was right behind that gamble. It should show us it is not only his stupidity over the Climate Change Act which made him our most expensive politician in history. Worse still, his lack of judgment also marks him out as easily the most dangerous man who has ever come within touching distance of becoming our Prime Minister.
