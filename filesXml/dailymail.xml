	Tiny Amir was born on Father's Day, but passed away at just 20 weeks. He was placed in a special cold cot at University Hospital of Wales to allow Amy McDonald and Domonic Reshad precious time with him.

The couple were given a special 'teardrop room' at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, designed for grieving new parents.
Miss McDonald, said: 'He was just perfect - I could see him like his dad but he had my turned up nose.
I got to know my beautiful little boy in those few hours. It meant I could kiss and cuddle him, I even got to know his smell. The cold cot has given me precious memories I wouldn't have had otherwise
Amy McDonald, Amir's mother
'The cold cot kept him that way so we could have him for almost a day before we knew we had to say goodbye.
'I don't know who came up with the idea but I'd like to give them a hug.'
Miss McDonald and hairdresser Mr Reshad took more than 300 photographs  of their baby son.
Relatives were allowed to visit and he met his grandparents, aunts and uncles during the 21 hours he was in the cold cot.
Amy had a normal pregnancy until 20 weeks when a scan showed her baby was seriously ill and she was told to prepare to give birth.
She went into labour on Father's Day and six hours later Amir was born.
Amy said: 'He took a few breaths and then died in my arms - it was the worst moment of my life.
'But I gained so much comfort from him being able to spend just that little bit of time with us in the cold cot.
'I can close my eyes and see him, I have images of him laying on the bed next to Domonic, I know how it feels to hold him in my arms.'
Miss McDonald said:'I got to know my beautiful little boy in those few hours. It meant I could kiss and cuddle him, I even got to know his smell. The cold cot has given me precious memories I wouldn't have had otherwise'
At her 20-week scan Miss McDonald was told her unborn son was seriously ill, and was told to prepare to give birth. After their traumatic ordeal, the couple are now raising money to buy more cold cots to help others
The couple discovered that three other mothers gave birth to stillborn babies at the same time but there was only one cold cot to go around.
The pair, of St Mellons, Cardiff, raised 1,500 to buy another in less than a day but the fund is still growing and they hope to give the hospital two of the special cots.
They will have a little plaque on the side saying: 'In memory of Amir Reshad.'
Miss McDonald, who has two sons Taio, five and Kobi, one, said: 'Some good will come out of my little's boy's brief time in the world.
'It is important to us that parents have the opportunity to spend some time with their stillborn babies to help them grieve.
'We received the most amazing care at the hospital - it wasn't just care it was love and I can't do enough to thank them.'
A hospital spokeswoman said: 'The cold cot has become part of the grieving process for parents who lose a baby in this way.
'We are pleased this couple have gained so much comfort from it.'
Miss McDonald and Mr Rashad are now preparing for their baby son's funeral next Thursday.

	Adolf Hitler's holiday retreat for Nazis Prora opening as a luxury resort

	Prora was built by Hitler between 1936 and 1939 to be a 'Baltic Butlins,' but plans halted as attention went on the war effort. Over 57 luxury flats have been sold ahead of the October opening.

Metropole's Manfred Hartwig, said: 'The past is the past. Prora may have been built by the Nazis , but it was never used by them or their soldiers.
'Now the place is so lovely, visitors want to get back to nature and enjoy its beauty.'
The construction was part of a programme introduced by Hitler, called Kraft durch Freude - meaning 'strength through joy'.
As part of this, Hitler arranged for there to be activities such as skiing and cruises - and intended to build a collection of seaside resorts on Rgen.
It was  planned to be the biggest holiday camp in the world, occupying over three miles of beach front, and the aim was to provide a bucket-and-spade resort for 20,000 families from Hitlers master race.
Condos can be bought for between 125,000 and 900,000, for those who want a permanent plot of Prora
57 flats of the transformed apartments have already been snapped up by buyers
Berlin firm Metropole has exclusive rights to the unusual holiday destination and hope to stress that the past is the past

There were eight identical buildings erected, offering entertainment, catered meals and organised fun based around Nazi propaganda, and it even won an award in 1937 for its Bauhaus design.
With the onset of war, the intended holiday haven held an entirely different function.
Nazis used the buildings to house workers and to provide accommodation to refugees.
Over time the giant resort fell into disrepair, and was only saved from demolition by being given landmark status.

The Soviets considered blowing it up, but it was discovered they didn't have enough dynamite for the job, so it became a massive tank-and-artillery base for the People's Army of East Germany and it vanished from all maps.
It is hoped that despite its history, the holiday homes will be sought after, and 57 flats have already been snapped up.
The grand opening is scheduled for October with the first full-time tenants already moving in to the  Colossus of Ruegen.
Estate agent Kathrin Lange, told German press, the buildings are for 'risk-tolerant investors'.

	Princess Eugenie's 11-hour 25th birthday bash at Royal Lodge revealed

	This is how Princess Eugenie (photoshopped) may have looked for her glamorous and bizarre Disney-themed 25th birthday party at Royal Lodge at Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Prince Andrew sings 'Happy Birthday' to Princess Eugenie
MODEL GUEST
Guests  there were around 200  started to arrive at 6.30pm. Jet-setting model Cara Delevingne, while failing to fully embrace the dress code  by the end of the party her only nod to fancy dress was a pair of mouse ears and a mask  was on particularly exuberant form.
According to a guest, she chatted, danced and mingled with other party-goers and was to be heard 'saying how she wants to be seen as Meryl Streep rather than a model '
News that she is dating a woman  American singer/songwriter St Vincent, whose real name is Annie Clarke  didn't deter prospective male suitors who tried to chat her up.
Stars: The host of celebrities to attend the glamorous and bizarre event at Royal Lodge included Melinda Messenger
Mad hatters: British actress Donna Air (left) and the Duchess of Cambridge's brother James Middleton (right) shared an Alice in Wonderland-themed selfie
IT'S A ROYAL DRESS UP...
Contrary to reports, Fergie was not dressed as Jessica Rabbit but came as Dorothy from The Wizard Of Oz.
At 55, Prince Andrew squeezed himself into costume as Prince Charming, while Prince Harry revealed his ignorance of the Disney oeuvre, opting to go as Nintendo character Super Mario instead.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, flame-haired Princess Beatrice chose The Little Mermaid, her favourite Disney character. No one else went as Snow White, because strict instructions had been sent out that the role was reserved for Eugenie.
...PLUS FRIENDS OLD AND NEW
Not all the guests were royal. Former Page Three girl Melinda Messenger, whose boyfriend Warren Smith taught Beatrice to ski, was dressed as a sexy Tinker Bell  and posted a picture on social media of the night.
Also there was Guy Pelly (in furry animal onesie) and his wife, the Texan Holiday Inn heiress Lizzie.
Assorted Bransons, including Holly and sister-in-law Isabella, were also present, as well as James Middleton and Donna Air, who posted a picture of themselves on picture-sharing website Instagram as Alice In Wonderland characters the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts.
George Frost, son of the late Sir David, came as the blue genie from Aladdin, while Chloe Delevingne, sister of Cara, dressed as the Angelina Jolie character Maleficent  as a picture posted on social media by a fellow party-goer proved.
Magical: George Frost (pictured), son of the late Sir David, came as the blue genie from Aladdin
Nor were old friendships forgotten, with chums from Eugenie's school days at St George's Ascot and Marlborough College, plus former students of Newcastle University.
A large contingent of her parents' friends  including Fergie's old flame Paddy McNally  made up the numbers. In Eugenie's eyes, though, the most VIP guest was her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, 29, who runs restaurants and nightclubs.
He now lives in Battersea, South London, and is popular with the Yorks, who, it is said, would love him to propose.
PASSPORT CONTROL
Guests were asked to bring their own passport to prove identity as well as the party invite   mocked up to look like the real thing  to gain admittance.
Exclusive: Guests were asked to bring their passports as well as a special invitation which looked like one (pictured)
FERGIE FOOD
At the last minute, it was decided that it should be a buffet rather than a sit-down dinner. There were salads, pasta, salmon, kedgeree  all with a nod to Fergie's healthy eating craze. There was an 'enormous' chocolate cake for the birthday girl  with 25 candles  and everyone belted out 'Happy Birthday'.
GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT
There was Champagne and wine aplenty, but most of the younger guests 'went for vodka, lime and soda or Jack Daniels and coke', just as they would in Mahiki, or Boujis, or Tonteria  or any of the other trendy London clubs this young royal set like to drink in.
The party was held in seven interlinked circus-style tents, inside which were cocktail bars and a cushion-filled chill-out zone.
EUGENIE AND HER CHEEKY DWARFS
Eugenie arrived with seven dwarfs in costume.
Hired from Cheeky Events, a Chigwell based agency, they charge from 100 each per hour.
The Princess made sure she danced with each of them, while friends who wanted to dance with them had to ask her permission because they were her retinue. Wherever Snow White went, her seven dwarfs dutifully followed.
Expensive: Eugenie arrived with seven dwarfs (pictured) who were hired from Cheeky Events and charge 100 each an hour
RAP VS MOTOWN
Entertainment took the form of a live act and a DJ in a booth.
The music was described as 'middle-of-the-road chart hits and lots of R&amp;B and rap' by one guest. Chart hits eventually gave way to Motown tunes to lure the older guests onto the dance floor  and it worked.
Many younger guests changed into clubbing gear at 1am.
NO SPEECHES
If there were any speeches, they were made in private beforehand and not at the actual party.
OH DEAR, DON'T TELL GRANNY
It was definitely crazy cartoon fun, and not entirely classy.
According to one attendee: 'Some guests threw up outside in the grounds. It became extremely raucous by about 2am, with people literally falling over drunk.
'One couple were caught heavy petting.'
Crazy: With 'some guests threw up outside in the grounds', it is probably a good thing that the Queen (pictured) was not present at the raucous affair
LOVESICK HARRY
Harry seemed smitten by Cressida Bonas, who was, says a guest, 'dressed possibly as Cinderella, in a frayed hem dress  but no broom or anything'.
According to onlookers, he ignored the attentions of other girls who approached him.
Fergie, meanwhile, was accompanied by Manuel Fernandez, the Spanish internet entrepreneur who is her new companion. Andrew  though dressed for love as Prince Charming  seemed quite alone, with no woman on his arm.
STAR NO-SHOWS
Some of Prince Andrew's social set apparently didn't make the cut, perhaps indicating that it was Fergie who was firmly in charge.
'The invitations were all sent out madly late, as in the last couple of weeks,' said one guest.
'Although in theory Ascot week was a good thought because the garden is at its best and so many people are in London anyway, many of those invited were already engaged.'
Those on the guest list who were already pre-booked turned out to be largely famous friends of Fergie's. Joan Collins, Kate Moss, Shirley Bassey, Naomi Campbell and Elton John were all asked but most didn't make it.
Elton forsook the delights of Disney at Windsor to play on tour in Aberdeen.
No show: Among the superstars who could not make the event was Sarah Ferguson's good friend Kate Moss (pictured)
Busy: Supermodel Naomi Campbell (pictured) was also asked to come but had prior engagements
FIREWORK FIZZLE
The party, according to one guest, was not quite what Fergie had first envisaged. 'Talk of fireworks was shelved after it was realised the ones they wanted  the go-on-for-hours, accompanied by music variety  were going to be way too expensive. They decided it was better to have none at all rather than a cheaper, quicker display.'
ON THE BUSES
Many of the guests were coached in from London  but at 2 am Fergie 'sent the coaches away so guests could stay until 5 am'.

Never having to check your available funds came top of the list of wealth indicators, followed by having a swimming pool in your house.
Owning a boat and having a housekeeper also featured high in the list - as did sending your children to private school and having a second property.
Being able to spend more than 500 on one item of clothing is another trait, while flying business class is also considered to make you rich.
The survey also found just six per cent described themselves as rich in terms of wealth, while 60 per cent consider themselves to be rich in non-material ways, such as having healthy children and a close loving family.
Cheers: Drinking champagne is another factor that on the Rich List - of 38 reasons - that make you wealthy
Holidays: Going skiing more than once a year was also said to be a sign that you are affluent, researchers said
Less than half of those asked said they aspired to one day be wealthy, while 56 per cent had no such ambition.
This was despite the 37 per cent of the panel claiming to have at least one friend they consider to be rich and 27 per cent being envious of those who are.
And asked whether they believed money would make them happy, just 17 per cent agreed and over half answered 'possibly'.
The study also found many of us feel more able to warm to someone who has worked hard to earn their money, than someone who was born with a silver spoon in their mouth.
Vix Leyton, for  Quidco which commissioned the research, said: 'It's great to see that the majority of us feel rich in non-material ways proving that the finer things in life aren't always the things you can buy.'

1. Never have to check your 'available funds'
2. Have a swimming pool in your house

Dr Bardsley told the inquest he believed Mr Porter would probably still be alive if he had looked at the scan on the day it was performed and called him back into hospital.
He admitted he would have acted immediately if he had looked at the scan, but said he was under pressure to perform ward rounds.
During the hearing Dr Bardsley accepted that looking at the scan was a 'two minute job' and could have been performed on virtually any computer.
'I've reflected on this so many times over the last few months,' Dr Bardsley told the hearing.
'There were opportunities, and I wasn't helped by circumstances, but certainly several opportunities fell at my door and I didn't take them. I feel I should have.'

Mr Porter was the player manager of Barnsley Sunday League teamCarlton Athletic. Pictured: Mr Porter is in the back row wearing the black jumper.

After Dr Bardsley looked at the scan he asked a secretary to contact Mr Porter and get him to hospital.
The medic assumed his patient had got this message, but after learning, the following day, Mr Porter had not been in touch, he had a a letter faxed to his GP.
But it was not marked 'urgent' and was treated as 'routine mail' by the surgery.
Mr Porter's GP did not read it until after his death.
Dr Bardsley said he had referred himself to the General Medical Council and was awaiting their verdict, saying it had completely devastated him.
'Will I return to work after this? I doubt it. It has affected me very deeply,' he said.
Recording a narrative verdict, assistant Sheffield coroner Louise Slater said 'there were a number of missed opportunities to recognise the urgency of the situation and the importance of contact with Mr Porter.'
She continued: 'On the balance of probabilities had Mr Porter been contacted and appropriate treatment commenced in a timely manner it is likely his death would have been avoided.'
After the verdict, Mr Porter's father, Norman, 57, said: 'I'm glad it's been officially recorded, what we already knew, that Mykal should still be here. I can't say it any plainer than that.'
Tracey McErlain-Burns, chief nurse at Rotherham Hospital said afterwards: 'On behalf of the Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust I apologise for the failures in care and express sincere condolences to Mr Porter's family.'

	EU referendum voters won't know if David Cameron's deal will be unpicked

	Critics said it meant the British people will have to accept a 'post-dated cheque' because any reforms Mr Cameron achieves could be reversed later before being written into a treaty.

Voters in Britain's referendum on leaving the European Union will not know for certain that David Cameron has got a better deal, it has emerged.
The Prime Minister claimed he was 'delighted' after raising his reforms at a dinner last night but he has been told he will not be able to change the EU's complex treaties before his planned in-out vote by the end of 2017.
Critics said it meant the British people will have to accept a 'post-dated cheque' because any reforms Mr Cameron achieves could be unpicked by other countries before being written into a new treaty.
David Cameron, pictured arriving at the summit in Brussels today, has declared himself 'delighted' to have kicked off the formal renegotiation process which will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union
Mr Cameron was seen deep in conversation withLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on the second day of the EU summit today
WHAT ARE CAMERON'S KEY DEMANDS FOR EU REFORM?
FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:
No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years
No social housing for four years
No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK
FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:
No support from the UK taxpayer
Deportation if they do not get a job for six months
OTHER IMMIGRATION MEASURES:
Restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU
Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK
Tougher rules on deporting foreign criminals
Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels
PROTECTIONS FROM EU INTERFERENCE:
A special 'opt-out' from the principle of 'ever closer union' between EU states
Measures to strengthen national parliaments to club together to block Brussels diktats
Rules to protect the influence of countries outside the Eurozone
The Conservative government has pledged to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum on whether to accept the new deal or go it alone.
Mr Cameron had demanded 'proper, full-on treaty change' to ensure his promised reforms could not be reversed.
But with some EU leaders it could take 10 years to negotiate a new treaty which some countries would have to put to a referendum, Downing Street now accepts it will not happen before 2017.
The Prime Minister is now saying he would accept an 'irreversible lock' or a 'legally binding' guarantee that EU law will be changed at some future point to accommodate Britain's renegotiation.
Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland are all expected to hold their own referendums to approve any change to the EU's treaties.
Labour accused the Prime Minister of retreating in the face of opposition from other EU states.
Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said: 'All year the Prime Minister has been saying that change to the treaty was a definite requirement and yet now, faced with entirely predictable opposition from other member states, he is signalling retreat while pretending that all he ever wanted was a post-dated cheque.'
Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'It sounds like a post-dated cheque. There are so many big things happening that a promissory note of some kind to Britain may well finish up not being honoured.
'Post-dated cheques can bounce and one suspects that any post-dated cheque that was given to the Brits would be given by presidents and prime ministers in office now.
'By the time it came to be honoured there would be different prime ministers and presidents elected on a ticket saying we won't honour this note. It doesn't work any way you look at it.'
Key demands include curbing access to benefits for migrants, ending the concept of 'ever closer union', giving national governments the power to veto Brussels diktats and securing protection for the interests of EU members, like the UK, which do not use the euro.
After defying the polls to secure an overall Conservative majority in May's election, Mr Cameron believes he has a mandate to deliver serious reform.
In a boost for his plans, the issue was on the EU agenda for the first time last night.
But Mr Cameron spoke for around 10 minutes during a working dinner dominated by bitter rows over which EU countries would take thousands of migrants from north Africa.

	The United Nations called on Britain to accept its share of thousands of people from North Africa, after a Brussels dinner was dominated by arguments over where the migrants should settle.

Peter Sutherland, special representative of the UN secretary-general for international migration and development, said it was wrong for some countries to turn their back on the plan.
Hetold BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'All member states should participate in the voluntary settlement, including Britain, Ireland and Denmark.
'This is a question basically of European solidarity. Why should Greece and particularly Italy take this unfair burden of responsibility for people who are refugees escaping from persecution?'

Peter Sutherland, United Nations
He said providing ships to rescue migrants found at sea was 'not enough'.
Leaders have agreed to relocate 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece to other EU countries over the next two years, in an effort to share the burden of a growing crisis.
They also agreed to resettle another 20,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq.
Italy wanted a quota system to be created to fix numbers of migrants to be sent to each country, but after facing criticism from other countries plan will now be voluntary.
A working dinner in Brussels continued into the small hours of this morning as leaders failed to agree on how to tackle the crisis.
Mr Renzi turned onHungary, Poland and Lithuania, whose leaders say they won't be forced to take any.
He told them: 'If you don't agree on 40,000, you aren't worthy of calling yourselves Europe'.
In what was described by diplomatic sources as an 'emotional' outburst, he then said pointedly: 'If that's your idea of Europe, you can keep it'.
David Cameron, pictured arriving at the Brussels summit today, has vowed to use a British veto to opt out of any EU-wide plan to spread 40,000 migrants across the continent
Mr Renzi has urged other EU countries to sign up to a plan to relocate migrants, but Mr Cameron has refused to accept any in the UK
Mr Cameron was seen deep in conversation withLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on the second day of the EU summit today
Now member states will have to agree on how many asylum seekers they are willing to take by mid-July, but it will be voluntary not mandatory, much to the anger of Italy, who receive the bulk of the migrants.
Mr Renzi said afterwards the outcome of the meeting fell short of what Italy needed. 'Relocation is a first step but for us this is not the solution to our problems.'
Britain has already said it will use its veto to avoid taking any of the migrants, and around 12 other states, many from eastern Europe, are also opposed to taking a set number.
Last weekTheresa May  called for the migrants crossing the Mediterranean to be forcibly sent back to Africa as a deterrent and to show there was 'no merit' in coming to Europe.
Figures released last week revealed that 100,000 migrants have made the crossing from North Africa to southern Europe since January alone, with 57,000 landing in Italy.
European council President Donald Tusk (left) and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker denied being at odds over how to tackle the migrant crisis
An estimated 170,000 migrants reached Italy by sea last year. But only a third of them claimed asylum there, with the rest likely to have headed for northern Europe, including Britain.
EU officials last night tried to diffuse the row and claimed that the talks were a success because a total of 60,000 migrants in Italy and Greece - 40,000 who came by boat and 20,000 from Syria - would be resettled.
A European source said the EU's two top figures, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, had clashed at the meeting but the two rejected the suggestion.
'Don't believe those who are tweeting, leaking info. Whenever we have difficulties, we discuss these things between ourselves,' Mr Juncker said at a press conference.
Britain has used its veto avoid taking migrants directly andTheresa May has demanded that they be forcibly sent back to Africa
Around 60,000 people have arrived in Europe from north Africa so far this year, while 2,000 are estimated to have died while making the dangerous journey
Royal Navy rescue 369 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea
Mr Juncker insisted that what really mattered was that EU leaders had approved the numbers of asylum seekers to be resettled as proposed by the Commission.
'I don't care if it is to be done voluntarily or not because the most important thing was that we agreed on the 60,000,' he said.
MrTusk, a former Polish premier whose country opposes the quota system, said 'migrants with no legal right to enter the EU will be returned' and negotiations with countries of origin would be speeded up to take them.
He has insisted that with 'no consensus' on quotas, EU member states should instead make realistic voluntary offers of refuge to deal with the upsurge in migrants.
'The voluntary scheme cannot be an excuse to do nothing. I can understand those who want this voluntary mechanism but they will only be credible if they give precise and significant pledges by the end of July at the latest,' he said.
'Solidarity without sacrifice is pure hypocrisy. Now we don't need empty declarations on solidarity, only deeds and numbers,' Mr Tusk added.
Stand-off: David Cameron speaks to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last night, one of the men that Matteo Menzi, front right, became irate with last night
Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz and Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite were also said to have been rebuked by the Italians
Last night David Cameron declared himself 'delighted' after he used the dinner to kick off the formal renegotiation process which will pave the way for an in/out referendum.
Mr Cameron secured agreement for 'technical' talks between UK and EU officials over the next six months on British concerns including restricting welfare for EU migrants, an opt-out from the goal of 'ever-closer union' in Europe, greater powers for national parliaments and protections for countries - like the UK - which are not members of the single currency.
Speaking as he left the talks at around 2.45am, Mr Cameron said: 'I am delighted that the process of British reform and renegotiation and the referendum we are going to hold - that process is now properly under way.
'People always say to me these things aren't possible, we will never get them done. Once again, we have proved we will get them done. We have started that process and it's under way.'

'I never remember her having a bad day. She was a beautiful-looking girl and so full of joy.
'It didn't matter what time of day I'd see her, first thing in the morning or last thing at night, she was so glam  and I'd turn up in T-shirts and scruffy jeans and old trainers.'
Media personality Clarke - who remains good friends with Michelle's husband Paul added: 'I'm devastated. I'm actually still shaking. My heart goes out to the family and her friends.

'It's a really sad day and not having her smile around is a loss.
Make-up expert Craig Alexander Wilson said: 'To hear this is devastating.
'Michelle was easy to work with and a real professional who had a zest for life.
'She loved her industry, was very committed to her family and husband, and I know she was the apple of her father's eye.'
Michelle carved a successful media career after presenting a number of TV programmes, including ITV's interior design hit, 60 Minute Makeover
She was also a regular newspaper columnist, with her bubbly nature and sense of humour said to be purely contagious to those around her
It was in 2008 that Michelle finally got her big break after a decade of smaller television appearances, landing her dream job co-hosting ITV1 show 60 Minute Makeover with Terri Dwyer.
Speaking at the time, she admitted that the role brought together her two passions - TV and interior design, having become qualified following a successful stint studying at the National Design Academy.
It is believed that in recent years, while caring for her young daughter, Michelle helped out with her parents' bridal-car business, often chauffeuring. She also accepted offers to host corporate events around Scotland, and was a guest host on STV magazine series The Hour between 2009 and 2010.
Michelle's father Jim Watt became world lightweight boxing champion in April 1979 after beating Colombian Alfredo Pitalua.
Tributes have poured in for the popular TV presenter, with her showbiz friends left 'devastated' by the news
Lorraine Kelly was previously described by Michelle as her 'inspiration'. The TV favourite this morning Tweeted her shock, describing the 38-year-old as a 'lovely woman and a fantastic mum'

After hanging up his gloves in 1981, he became a sports commentator for ITV.
He moved to join Sky Sports in 1996, where he continues to broadcast as both a pundit and co-commentator, commenting recently on the $200million fight between Flloyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2.

His daughter's death comes just months before the 20th anniversary of son Jim junior's passing.
The 17-year-old died after being involved in a sickening smash in which one other man was killed on October 30, 1995.
Opening up about Jim junior's death on Radio Scotland show 'Stuff of Legends' five years ago, the Southpaw fighter described the horror his demise had brought to his and wife Margaret's lives.
He said: 'It was the lowest point of my life. You shouldn't bury your children - your children should bury you.
'That was horrendous. My wife has been left in a terrible state. She'll never get her head around it. The way I get my head around it was the way I've pretty much dealt with my whole life.
'When I was boxing there were things I had to do and things I couldn't do in order to get fit.
'I could channel my mind in a certain way. And I think the way I dealt with the death of young Jim was I tried to keep it out of my head, I didn't let it in.
'It was a horrendous time, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. It was just terrible and tragic.
'He was 17 and it was a car accident. I'd just got him the car a couple of months before.'
Tragically, Jim also suffered the loss of his father when he was just a child.
In a 2006 interview with the Sun, Michelle admitted that she was still then living haunted by her younger brother's death, confessing that even after a decade her heart-wrenching loss was still 'very raw and painful.'
Aged 28 at the time, she said: 'Sometimes I think I spot him in a crowd of people and I find myself doing a double take.
'You think you are alright and then suddenly 'wham!' - it just gets you right in the heart.
'Losing him was very hard on my family. But I think that's one of the reasons my parents' marriage is so strong today.

'If they can survive that they can survive anything.'

They only recently moved into their dream home following Jaymi's birth, who Michelle conceded would be her only child.
She made the decision after her morning sickness during pregnancy became so unbearable that she had to routinely attend hospital - affecting her ability to present live television.
Police Scotland confirmed Michelle's death.
A spokesman said: 'Police in Forth Valley were called to an address around 6.15pm on Wednesday June 24 where the body of a 38-year-old woman was found.
'There are no suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.'

'Their propensity to commit crimes where the risk appears to me to outweigh the gain has most surprised me. I mean, would you climb on to the front of a moving vehicle for as little as 150?'.
Romanians have the highest per capita population in British jails of any foreign nationality, with 674 of the 128,000-strong population in jail or on remand.
Last year a gang of 11 men were jailed for two years each after admitting a 'Romanian Rollover' theft on the M6 in Staffordshire.

Exit: A hatch is then installed to allow the gangsters in and out of the vehicle, which is hidden from other motorists unless they can see on to the roof
Space: Adapting a van like this one allows the thieves to store large, high value items sent make using a human chain
Their Citroen Relay was followed by police at it travelled north on the M6 through Birmingham and was eventually stopped at Keele Services in Staffordshire. The men were arrested by Central Motorway Police officers.

'We are unable to have any sort of justice - even though police know one of them killed my son. I want justice for Sam and for anyone that comes into contact with them in the future.'
Buffham and Bate were arrested on suspicion of murder the day after Sam's death in April 2013 but were released last November without charge.
Tests revealed he had suffered the injuries in the 11 hours before an ambulance was called and he was taken for emergency surgery to relieve the swelling on his brain.
But his condition deteriorated and Sam died four days later on April 24, with his father at his side.
The little boy had been in the care of his mother Deanna Buffham and her boyfriend Ryan Bate at the time
Sam's mother and partner were arrested on suspicion of his murder but released without charge after police failed to prove which of them was responsible
In the days leading up to his death, while he was in intensive care at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, Mr Harry was only told the incident had been a 'trauma'.
'I thought it was standard that police would be in hospital for a case like this. At no point did I know it was because it was being treated as a murder investigation,' he said.
'When they told me they were treating it as murder and said who their main suspects were I just couldn't believe it. It turned my whole world upside down - it still has to this day.'
He added: 'I think it was best I didn't know what had happened at that point because I was just there entirely for Sam at his bedside.'
Mr Harry demanded a review of the CPS decision and was told that it would not be possible to charge both of them 'simply because we know one of them must be guilty of the offence'.
A letter from the CPS read: 'Neither suspect accepts that they caused Sams injuries... each now asserts that the other must have been responsible given the medical findings.
'Although each blames the other, they are unable to give any material evidence to substantiate their belief.'
Sam at Addenbrooke's Hospital, where he had emergency surgery to relieve swelling on his brain
Mr Harry kept a bedside vigil and was shocked when police told him his son's death was being treated as a murder investigation and that the main suspects were his ex-girlfriend and her new partner
Chief prosecutors say because both parties left the house on the day of the incident, they cannot prosecute under a 'joint enterprise' basis
Mr Harry with his son before his death in April 2013. Initially he was not told the details of what had happened
Buffham and Bate were arrested on suspicion of murder the day after Sam's death in April 2013 but were released last November without charge
He has now launched an online petition named Justice for Sam in a bid to overturn the Crown's decision, which needs 100,000 signatures before it can be handed over to Parliament.
'At the moment these two are walking around scot-free. It's inconceivable that they could get a job working with children in the future as they have no criminal record.
'I want the Government to investigate this loophole that allowed both suspects to lie to protect each other and evade prosecution.'
A CPS spokesperson said: 'This case was reviewed as part of the Victims Right to Review Scheme. A specialist prosecutor undertook an independent and comprehensive examination of the evidence.
'This review determined that the original decision to take no further action still stands because there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against either suspect.
'The charges of murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child were considered, however, there is insufficient evidence to prove that either one of the suspects caused the little boys injuries, or to prosecute them both on a joint enterprise basis.'
Bedfordshire Police said it is 'not looking at anyone else' in connection with Sam's death, but added that ever murder investigation is subject to reviews including this one.
His father is campaigning to have the decision overturned and is fighting for justice for his little boy
In a letter from the CPS to Mr Harry, they said that they could not prosecute because each party is blaming the other

He adds: 'We're not moving as fast as we need to and part of what I know from watching your programmes, and all the great work you've done, is that these ecosystems are all interconnected.
'If just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not then we're not going to solve the problem, we're going to have to have a global solution to this.'
Sir David, who was sent an air ticket out of the blue to visit the White House, explained that he believes people must be educated that caring for the planet is our responsibility.
He said: 'I think what's required is an understanding and a gut feeling that the natural world is part of your inheritance.
Barack Obama interviews Sir David Attenborough at the White House
Sir David Attenborough said: 'On my 89th birthday it was to my considerable surprise to find myself in a place that I've never been to before ... to visit the White House with the President of the United States'
'This is the only planet we've got and we've got to protect it. And people do feel that, deeply and instinctively - it is, after all, where you go in moments of celebration and in moments of grief.'
The interview might also be a pointer towards what Obama is considering for his next career.
Earlier this month, Sir David claimed following the pair's meeting that the US President could follow in the footsteps of former Vice President turned environmentalist Al Gore when he leaves office.
Obama is currently in his second and final term, which will come to an end in January 2017.
This is the only planet we've got and we've got to protect it
Sir David Attenborough
Sir David said he had come away from the interview feeling that Obama was 'very much in favour of dealing with climate change' but got the sense he was 'wondering what he's going to do next'.
It is the latest in a series of unusual media appearances for Obama, who has tried to tap any avenue that reaches as many eyeballs as possible to get his message out.
To reach young people he wanted to sign up for Obamacare, his signature health care insurance program, he talked to comedian Zach Galifianakis for the web series 'Between Two Ferns.'
Obama, a Democrat, has also joked with other comedians on late night television and exploited every possible social media tool, even doing his own jousting in the political arena of Twitter.
Sir David has been making television documentaries for 60 years and has been called 'the godfather of natural history TV' by the BBC.
Big fan: During the interview, Obama tells The Living Planet presenter: 'I have been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time ... you've been a great educator as well as a great naturalist'
Sir David: 'What animal would I be? Probably the leopard slug!'
Obama's interview with Sir David comes as the US President's administration finalises rules to curb carbon emissions from power plants. He has pushed world leaders to agree to new targets at a summit later this year in Paris.
Obama told Sir David that children are 'much more environmentally aware' than adults, citing his daughters Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, as examples.
'They do not dispute, for example, the science around climate change,' Obama said in the clip.
Sir David agreed that adults lose the fascination with nature that is common among children.
He said: 'A five-year-old, turning over a stone and seeing a slug, says, "What a treasure!" Kids understand the natural world.'

	BBC drama Poldark premieres in US and sparks Aidan Turner tweets

	Poldark made its US TV debut earlier this week - and the response to leading man Aidan Turner, 32, was just as lustful. Many viewers took to Twitter to share their love for the Irish star, 32.

'Damn, this Poldark guy is HAWT,' read one exuberant missive, while another, sent by Twitter user Jenn Nimthiriel read: '#Poldark was... amazing. #AidanTurner was beautiful, I don't get how he gets to be so perfect.'
One particularly enthusiastic fan even created a montage of the ways in which they found Poldark attractive, tweeting the result alongside a caption that read: 'Let us count the ways we found Ross Poldark hot on #PoldarkPBS... In a Tricorn, in a cloak, on a cliff, in a church!'
Another, Karla Nichelle, wrote: 'Omg finally sitting down and watching #Poldark... This man is SO fine. I'm sweating.'
Others found it difficult to choose between the Cornish countryside and Mr Turner for beauty, with one writing:
Counting the ways: One fan created a montage of moments in which they found Mr Turner attractive
Favourite show: Viewers also appeared to enjoy the romantic storyline
Who's more lovely? Some viewers couldn't decide whether they liked Cornwall or Mr Turner more
Sold! Others were clearly fans of the concept before they'd even seen the show
Hit! Mr Turner  clearly made an impression on Twitter user Erin Ruberry
'The #PoldarkPBS credits elegantly, economically establish the show's primary conflict: Which is prettier - Aidan Turner or Cornwall?'
Another came down firmly on the side of the landscape, tweeting: 'The scenery is beyond beautiful in this show. And yes, I did mean the landscape ;) #PoldarkPBS.'
Most, however, opted for Mr Turner. Social media user Erin Ruberry, clearly already a fan of a British drama, said:
'You had me at "British soldier", "Cornwall" and "true love" #PoldarkPBS. I am so in.'
Later, perhaps in response to the famous shirtless scything scene, she added: 'I'll just be here googling Aidan Turner GIFS if you need me. #PoldarkPBS'
Poldark has now proved a hit on both sides of the Atlantic and became the BBC's most popular drama of 2015 so far thanks to viewing figures that regularly topped seven million.
Smouldering: The famous scything scene worked its magic for the second time in the US
Popular: Irishman Mr Turner was once again the viewers' favourite
Local boy: Kyle Soller (Francis Poldark) hails fromConnecticut but wasn't as popular as Mr Turner
The finale, which aired on the 26th April, achieved 5.9 million viewers and an audience share of 25.4 per cent.
As a result, the show was swiftly recommissioned with filming for the second series due to commence at the end of August.
The series, based on Winston Grahams novels, follows Ross Poldark after he returns from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fiance, Elizabeth, has married another man.
There are 12 Poldark books in total, seven of which are set in the 18th century. The other five then follow Poldarks children through the 19th century.
The first series of Poldark, written by Debbie Horsfield, covers the first of Mr Grahams two novels, named after Ross Poldark and Demelza.
The second series will move on to the third and fourth books, named after their child, Jeremy, and scheming banker George Warleggan.

	Rwandan spy chief Karenzi Karake freed from jail with help from Cherie Blair

	General Karenzi Karake, director-general of Rwanda's national intelligence agency, is accused of ordering massacres in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

Asked by Judge Purdy whether he would comply with the extradition proceedings, the general replied: 'I will co-operate.'
Prosecutor Aaron Watkins said the arrest warrant related to five alleged offences which carry a maximum prison sentence of 30 years.
'This is a defendant who has no ties in the UK,' Mr Watkins said.
'He is a Rwandan national whose presence in the UK was intended to be short term.'
Mrs Blair was seen arriving with the rest of Karake's legal team at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday
Mr Watkins said it was clear the Rwandan government 'did not accept the legitimacy of these proceedings'.
'It's perfectly plain their feelings towards these proceedings are outrage,' he added.
Mark Summers QC, defending Karake, said his client was 'a man of impeccable character' with a title in Rwanda comparable to the director of the CIA in America.
'He's not a rogue army officer,' he said. 'He's a senior member of a respected and democratic government.
'The context of these allegations is the government's battle to end the 1994 genocide.
Karake (pictured) was detained at Heathrow on Saturday on behalf of the Spanish authorities
'This is a private prosecution in Spain by private interest groups with links to those responsible for the underlying genocide.'
Mr Summers said Rwanda was not alone in its outrage about the indictment as the US had labelled it a 'bloated political tract'.
Karake's supporters began singing in the public gallery as he left the dock, while Rwanda's High Commissioner, Attorney General and the country's ambassador to Spain also sat in the well of the court.
Mrs Blair confirmed yesterday that Karake would not be immediately released from custody.
Speaking outside the courtroom, Johnston Busingye, Rwanda's minister for justice and attorney general, said: 'We did not expect General Karake would be arrested in the UK. When it happened we trusted we would make our case when the day comes in the court of law.'
Asked whether the arrest would affect Rwanda's relationship with the UK, he replied: 'Our relationship with the UK is bigger and longer and I would not want to narrow it.'
Karake's arrest on Saturday was condemned by Rwanda's High Commissioner in London, Williams Nkurunziza, as 'an insult', and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell claimed it was 'politically motivated'.
Mr Mitchell, who worked closely with the Rwandan government while a Cabinet minister, said the European arrest warrant system was being 'abused', with the allegations pursued by supporters of the old regime in Rwanda.
More than a dozen protesters waving placards in support of General Karake - who is nicknamed KK - gathered outside the court ahead of the hearing.
The placards included the messages 'Stop humiliating Africa,' 'freekarake' and 'UK, USA stand up against the Spanish indictment'.
Another placard read: 'Rwandan Community in the UK stand by our hero Lt Gen Karenzi Karake'.
One protester, who gave his name only as Peter, said: 'The embassy has its own official duties but we as Rwandans and compatriots of General KK are here to support him.'
A case management hearing will take place at the court on September 26 before a full extradition hearing on October 29 and 30.

	Campaigners called on the government to do more to stop families 'from falling into crisis', as a quarter of parents fear their children with have a worse life than them.
      </Description>

Parents aged 35-44 have the biggest money problems, with 51 per cent struggling financially.
Some 58 per cent of parents in both Wales and Northern Ireland report struggling to make ends meet, the highest in the UK, compared to 38 per cent in London and the East Midlands.
While more than a third of families are 'struggling' or just about 'surviving', only one in ten (12 per cent) would describe themselves as 'thriving' or 'doing really well'.
Parents of older children also seem to fare worse than those with younger families, and are more likely to be struggling.
Among parents with younger children, a quarter said childcare was one of the 'major challenges' in their daily lives.
Two in five parents say they have nothing left over at the end of the month after paying for essentials including food and bills.
It leaves many having to resort to credit cards, overdrafts and borrowing from friends and family to make ends meet.
Parents aged 35-44 have the biggest money problems, with 51 per cent struggling financially, the poll showed
The survey found that 24 per cent of parents think their children's standard of living will be worse than their own, rising to 40 per cent among the over-75s
It found that 24 per cent of parents think their children's standard of living will be worse than their own, rising to 40 per cent among the over-75s.
The poll comes as 4Children launches a new inquiry into family life in modern Britain today 'Britain's Families: Thriving or Surviving'- uncovering the challenges and opportunities facing families across the country.
Families across the country are on the edge, struggling financially and are finding it difficult to be optimistic about their children's futures
Imelda Redmond,4Children
Chief executive Imelda Redmond said: 'These results issue a triple warning  families across the country are on the edge, struggling financially and are finding it difficult to be optimistic about their children's futures.
'Government should listen to this warning and take action, because preventing families from falling into crisis is not only better for them, but far cheaper in the long run for the taxpayer too.'
It comes ahead of the Budget on July 8 when George Osborne is expected to impose deep cuts on tax credits, paid to people whose income from work is judged not enough to live on.
Ministers have demanded that firms pay their staff properly instead of relying on the benefit system to top up their workers' wages through tax credits.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the government wanted companies to 'take a fuller share of paying people a reasonable and decent salary' instead of relying on tax credits to top up their workers' wages. He said: 'We want companies to pay better salaries, which means less tax credits from us.'
One option being considered is said to be the idea of cutting child tax credit back to levels last seen in 2003, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates would save 5billion but would cost 3.7million low-income families an average of 1,400-a-year.

Critically-acclaimed American civil war movie Gone with the Wind is facing a backlash as the pressure mounts against symbols of the Confederacy.
The New York Post film critic Lou Lumenick has called for the movie to be banned from cinemas, while an artist who is tweeting the entire book has been uninvited to a number of literary events.
Gone with the Wind, first published by author Margaret Mitchell in 1936 before it was made into a film that won 10 Academy Awards, tells the story of the daughter of a plantation owner Scarlett O'Hara and her romantic entanglements.

Across the US politicians and activists have urged for the Confederate flag - which appears in the film - to be removed from public life, while memorials of historical figures from that period have been defaced following the Charleton shootings that left nine black people dead.
Now respected critic Mr Lumenick said Gone with the Wind, still the most successful film at the box office in US cinema, should be consigned to the history books as a racist depiction of the civil war.
'The more subtle racism of 'Gone with the Wind' is in some ways more insidious, going to great lengths to enshrine the myth that the Civil War wasn't fought over slavery - an institution the film unabashedly romanticizes', he wrote .
'But what does it say about us as a nation if we continue to embrace a movie that, in the final analysis, stands for many of the things as the Confederate flag that flutters so dramatically over the dead and wounded soldiers at the Atlanta train station just before the 'GWTW' intermission?'

	Alison Pinnock, 47, believes it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed after 60 horrific accidents outside her home in Wickford, Essex, in the last five years.

'We've had cars in our garden, we've had trees falling down and it's almost like there's no point in having a fence.
'I can't go to sleep at night because I'm worried sick about what might happen. There are accidents on the road so often it's become normal.'
Alison, who has taken pictures of the most serious accidents, lives with husband Brian, 62, and her children Ryan, 21, Tyler, 18, Carley, 15 and Ellie, 12.
Mr Pinnock, who works as a maintenance driver for a hygiene company, bought the property 32 years ago but it's only in the past five years that the Pinnocks have had to deal with such a horrific string of car crashes.
A Ford KA and a motorbike were involved in a head-on collision outside the family home at 8.45am on May 25, this year
This Dairy lorry slewed off the road right outside the Pinnock's family home at 6am on February 13, 2013
At 5.15am on January 7 this year, a car slammed into the Pinnock's garden fence
The silver car spun off the road into the Pinnock's driveway at 7.30am on December 28, 2014
Mrs Pinnock told how she struggles to sleep at night due to the high number of accidents
'The authorities have told me that the speed on this stretch of road is appropriate but after logging so many accidents I have to disagree,' said Mrs Pinnock.
'Only a couple of weeks ago, Brian had just finished cleaning the windows to our living room when a car smashed through the fence right by him.
'He could have been seriously hurt or my children could have been out there playing - it's terrifying to think how close this accident was to hurting my loved ones.
'Something must be done about the speed now - we need protection.'
Tyler's room is on the ground floor of Mrs Pinnock's home and she lives in constant fear of a car veering off into the property while he is sleeping.
'I can't sleep at night - It's terrifying.
'I remember the head-on collision last year that happened in the middle of the night. We were woken up at midnight with a car and a taxi smashed up on our drive.
'There were police everywhere, two ambulances and a fire engine - they kept us up all night.
'It was absolutely horrible but it could have been so much worse, someone could have died.
'We have written to the council a number of times about the problems here because we want to see the speed limit reduced from 60mph to 40mph or even 30mph. There's absolutely no way that stretch of road should be a national speed limit.
'People are just driving along here too quickly - we are frightened it's a matter of time before someone is killed.'
At 3.20am on February 3, 2013 a car careered through the Pinnock's wooden fence,left. On May 25 this year, a motorcyclist was taken to hospital by air ambulance, right
Adam Pipe, casualty reduction manager for Essex Police, said: 'I spoke with Mrs Pinnock last week and we have offered to carry out a speed data survey over four days.
'The information can then be presented to Essex County Council, which is the highways authority, to determine the next course of action.
'Mrs Pinnock's home is beside a road within a 60mph national speed limit and at the bottom of a dip.
'A number of the historic collisions in which people have been seriously injured, took place during extremely cold winter weather, when water ran onto the road from nearby fields and froze.'

	Samuel Price and Elizabeth Sandlin weren't exactly a couple. They were a pair of attractive twentysomethings who, over the course of a year, met up now and again for sex with each other.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
In this modern age, a purely physical and non-emotional relationship like this is supposed to be a sophisticated answer to servicing basic needs.
Yet after a night together went wrong on Valentines Day last year, the failings in the practice defeated the advantages of the theory.
Price, 24, has been landed with a criminal conviction for assault after Sandlin, 20, complained to police about the roughness of the sex they had together.
On the night in question, they met up late in the evening after both had been drinking at separate functions: he at a wedding, she at a nightclub.
During sex in his bedroom at his familys luxury farmhouse outside Chester, Price had pulled Sandlins hair and bit her on the thigh and bottom, leaving bruises.
In his court defence, he said that rough and playful sex had always been part of their relationship.
He has apologised and was horrified when he saw photographs of her two bruises  but Sandlin was not to be placated.
I trusted someone I should not have trusted. He was very drunk, blind drunk. He completely overstepped the mark. I was shocked, she said.
Today, however, the one who is truly shocked is Samuel Price, who cannot believe he now has a conviction.
And, to be honest, neither can I.
Yet this case is part of a growing trend, just another unhappy statistic in a week when it was revealed that convictions for violence against women have reached a record high.
Domestic abuse cases account for 14 per cent of all prosecutions going through the courts.
Nearly 100,000 criminal cases were launched against abusive partners last year, with a record 68,601 successful convictions.
Of course, much of this is to be hugely welcomed. A broadening of the definition of domestic abuse to include offences such as revenge porn and coercive control is a step in the right direction.
Record numbers of men being prosecuted for violent crimes against women, including rape and so-called honour-based violence, can only be viewed as a positive step.
Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has urged police and prosecutors to take crimes against women more seriously, while changes in the law have made it easier to prosecute men for domestic abuse.
New guidelines encourage the system to be more open-minded and consider that victims of domestic abuse are not just the stereotypical battered wife.
They are women, perhaps, like Elizabeth Sandlin. Aggrieved after a night out went wrong and not ashamed to push for her partner to be punished.
Domestic abuse was once a dirty secret, a shame that had to be borne in private by a battered wife or a violated girlfriend.
Im glad those days have gone, but I worry that the mania for feminising the law  for whittling and shaping it to suit the concerns of noisy pressure groups  is resulting in skewing justice too far in the other direction.
In the Price/Sandlin case, if rough sex was an integral part of their relationship, then it must have been consensual.
Clearly on this particular night, matters went beyond what she expected or felt comfortable with, but he was in her words, blind drunk.
Perhaps she might have asked herself why she went to bed with someone who was so clearly out of control?
Prices judgment was blurred  but so was hers. However, while she can use drink as an excuse, he cannot, because drunkenness can never be a defence for violence, even if it was unintended.
Jan Moir says in the Price/Sandlin case, if rough sex was an integral part of their relationship, then it must have been consensual (pictured: Miss Sandlin's bruises)
Yet from the unpromising beginnings of an alcohol-fuelled tryst that went awry, Elizabeth Sandlin wasted no time in going on to try to criminalise her sex-pal and claim victim status for herself. My worry is that the DPP, while encouraging justice officials to look for victims in the unlikeliest places, is going to make it too easy for an aggrieved partner to take to the courts on a whim.
Meanwhile, pornography is readily available and books such as the Fifty Shades Of Grey quartet normalise sadistic sex to the extent that housewives hold S&amp;M-themed tea parties, complete with whip-shaped eclairs.
All this is confusing for young men and women  but especially for men.
Elizabeth Sandlin may have received justice for her bruises, but should this case ever have been brought?
Sensible women dont jump into bed with men for a sex assignation, then complain if they dont behave like Prince Charming.
Sensible women would develop a trusting relationship with a man before taking it to a more intimate level. But sense and perspective never seem to have a place in the sex wars.
Where are we going from here? Perhaps women will start to bring criminal charges if they dont get full sexual satisfaction on demand.

DECENCY IS DYING JUST A LITTLE MORE EVERY DAY
Sometimes the world seems to take two steps forward and then six steps back. It is the casual lack of humanity and common decency that is so killing. Like the heroin addict travellers who were invited for tea by a couple in their 90s, then proceeded to rob them as the wife was baking them scones.
In West London, a woman and her 16-year-old daughter committed suicide by holding hands and jumping in front of a train.
Horror in the rush-hour? Not quite. Some on the platform viewed the tragedy as not much more than an interesting distraction on their commute. Train staff had to broadcast repeated requests for passengers to stop photographing the bodies. Selfies, too? I dont doubt it.
Meanwhile, a former Sunday school teacher stole an antique toast rack from an Alzheimers sufferer and a coat from a partially blind lady while working as a carer.
Then two British schoolboys, supposedly on an educational trip to understand the horrors of World War II, were accused of stealing artefacts from Auschwitz. Perhaps they thought they could flog em on the internet?
What has happened to our morals? Pity we cant buy them on eBay, too.

Poor The Queen! On her tour of Germany, HM was presented with a painting that looked as if it had been produced by a ham-fisted mass murderer in a high-security art class.
HM was presented with a painting that looked as if it had been produced by a ham-fisted mass murderer
The Queen left bewildered by stylised German painting
Is that supposed to be my father? she asked, peering at the picture titled Horse In Royal Blue.
No wonder she was confused, considering he had no ankles and appeared to be wearing a pair of plus-fours that had been blown up by bellows. No, I dont think its going to be hanging in the drawing room at Windsor any time soon.

BRADBY IS TV'S MR SMUG
In a U.S.-style shake-up of its flagship nightly news programme, ITV is turning the News At Ten into a star vehicle for smoothie-chops Tom Bradby.
The TV station bosses are labouring under the delusion that Bradby is incredibly popular with viewers, when perhaps the truth is that he is only incredibly popular with himself.
To be honest, I suspect most viewers find TB too glossy and self-satisfied in the brisk news environment.

In addition, he always looks as if he secretly dresses like Prince George when no one is looking. On the professional front, he is not as good a political editor as the BBCs Nick Robinson and hes not as good an anchorman as Mark Austin, whom he is replacing.
Meanwhile, ITV can expect stiff resistance to throwing showbiz razzmatazz at their news bulletins.
As far as British audiences are concerned, its all about the swirling currents, the stricken ship and what is looming on the horizon. It is never, ever about the anchor.

If you think eating bowls of cereal while driving in the middle lane is fine, dont move to Spain. A driver in Salamanca has been fined 60 for biting his nails. The man was caught by the Guardia Civil mid-morning and his fine notice states he was driving without maintaining proper freedom of movement because he was biting his nails while at the wheel.It is not known whether the driver intends to appeal  but who will be attracted to him, with his chewed fingernails, air of distraction and police record?

PUT HER IN QUARANTINE, JOHNNY
What is it with Amber Heard, the poor mans Scarlett Johansson? She is one of those annoying wives who take on the mantle of their husbands professional status, even when richly undeserved.
Indeed, marriage to Hollywood royalty Johnny Depp has made Amber behave like a preening queen of the screen, with a sense of entitlement way beyond her standing as the star of Drop Dead Sexy, Machete Kills and the new male stripper movie, Magic Mike XXL.
Le Grande Empress Amber has proclaimed that she and her husband will boycott Australia after a government minister threatened to have their dogs Pistol and Boo put down for flouting quarantine regulations.
I have a feeling were going to avoid the land Down Under from now on, just as much as we can, thanks to certain politicians there, simmered Amber.
What is it with Amber Heard, the poor mans Scarlett Johansson? She is one of those annoying wives who take on the mantle of their husbands professional status, even when richly undeserved
Poor Australia! An entire nation reels.
The couple were accused of unlawfully smuggling the dogs into Oz on a private plane last month, while Depp was filming the latest Pirates Of The Caribbean movie there.
Barnaby Joyce, an outspoken government minister, threatened to have the dogs killed, and declared there could not be another law for movie stars and their pets.
Australia has some of the strictest quarantine rules in the world  for a very good reason obvious to everyone except pampered movie stars. But Amber can only see the world in terms of the effect she is having on others.
Never mind the danger to the Australian ecosystem from her potentially germ-bomb teacup dogs, she blamed Mr Joyce for being a brute and trying to claim his 15 minutes of fame at her expense.
Johnny is saying nothing. Maybe he never even wanted to go back to Australia. But knowing the Aussies as we do, I doubt that either of them will be very welcome.

'It was so scary they were sitting by a tree and the other one legged it out the school gates. It's really bad not feeling safe in your on school. He could have been anywhere. Glad to hear he's been caught'.
Police said today they had arrested the men on suspicion of illegal entry to the UK and they are currently in custody before being handed over to the Home Office.
Response: News of the incident, and the arrests, spread across social media locally, which led to eyewitness accounts from students and parents
Presdales is a girls secondary school and sixth form college, which was once attended by pop star Kim Wilde, Paul Gascoigne's daughter Bianca and former Eastenders' actress Kacey Ainsworth, who played Little Mo.
A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to Presdales School to reports three men were seen to emerge from a bus which had returned from France.
One of the men ran off whilst two others were detained by members of the public.
'Officers attended and searched the area and located the third man, all were arrested on suspicion of illegal entry to the UK.
'The men, who are 19, 23 and 28 years old, are believed to be from Sudan. The men remain in custody and the matter has been passed to immigration enforcement officials'.
It came just two days after two illegal migrants snuck into another  luggage compartment of a coach full of young children coming home from a school trip.
The pair were spotted crawling out from among suitcases as shocked parents came to collect their kids.

The MoD said it backed the soldier and that members of the public should show respect towards guardsmen.
Clad in their distinctive red tunics and bearskins hats, the soldiers of the Queens Guard are charged with protecting official royal residences.
'Get back'! The guard yells at the man as he touches him, immediately wiping the grin off his face
Armed: The soldier - charged with protecting royal residencies - points his rifle at the man, who has already scarpered
Back to work: Ever the professional, the guardsman places his gun back on his shoulder and continues his march
The units, manned by fully-trained, serving soldiers, have more than 350 years of history and have defended monarchs since Charles II took the throne after the English Restoration in 1660.
There are thought to be guidelines in place for guardsmen to deal with nuisances, which begins with stamping their feet and shouting.
Raising a rifle is considered a 'final warning', after which the guardsmen is allowed to detain the person in question.
Earlier this month, another tourist was left embarrassed after a confrontation with the Queen's Guard.
Gerry Weatherhead, 58, a retired RAF engineer from Haverhill in Suffolk, was barged out of the path of a troop of marching guardsmen outside Buckingham Palace.

Hilarious moment Queen's Guards push 'stupid' tourist out the way
Oblivious to the soldiers, Mr Weatherhead was caught on video chatting to his wife as the men approached him at speed, shoving him out of the way as they marched through.
Following the collision the video shows the unconcerned soldier continuing to march while a loud military voice bellowed at Mr Weatherhead: 'Make way!'
A woman's voice can then be heard jeering: 'Stupid man!'
The video was shot during Trooping the Colour in central London to mark the Queen's official birthday.

	The pair were estranged for years after Jade's mother walked out on the 49-year-old when Jade was a baby.

'Jade's a lovely girl and she seems really happy with the house,' one neighbour, who did not want to be named, told The Sun .
Evans has described 'not being around enough' for Jade when she was a baby, claiming he was too focused on his career at the time to devote enough attention to his child and her mother.
Happy families: The BBC Radio host walked Jade down the aisle in 2013 after reuniting with his firstborn
Chequered past: Evans labelled himself 'selfish' in his treatment of Alison Ward, Jade's mother and his former fiancee (left). He moved on from the pair to marry Carole McGiffin in 1991 (right)
Alison Ward, Jade's mother and the DJ's former fiance, left him when she was still an infant.
Describing their parting in his autobiography, Evans said: 'Alison was totally selfless when it came to my ambition but I simply wasn't around enough to be supportive of her in the far more important task of bringing up a young child - in short, I was a selfish p****'.
'I came back to the house one day and Alison had had enough  she had gone back to her mums with the baby.
'What did I feel at the time? Im ashamed to say relief. I saw Alison going back home as leaving me free to carry on chasing my dreams, but thats where my head was at the time.'
The presenter and his former fiance became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute which was resolved in 1998, when Jade was 11, with Evans agreeing to a financial settlement.
Many loves: Evans went on to marry Billie Piper in a 200 Las Vegas ceremony. The pair divorced in 2007
He had, up until then, been paying maintenance to Ward, it was reported at the time.
Evans went on to marry former Loose Women star CaroleMcGiffin (they divorced in 1998, four years after separating and after seven years of marriage) before tying the knot with Billie Piper in a 200 Las Vegas ceremony in 2001.They divorced in 2007.
He married his third wife, Natasha Shishmanian, the same year. The pair have two sons together.
Third time lucky: Evans married Natasha Shishmanian in 2007. The couple (above in 2012) have two children together
Chris Evans to film secret Top Gear sequence
Earlier this year Evans gushed over becoming a grandfather to Jade's son, Teddy.
Announcing the happy news to his millions of Twitter followers, he said in January: ''Teddy Rupert is here!!! Everyone doing brilliantly. Congrats to Ma &amp; Pa, Alison and Wardy, Sandra and Gavin ! (sic)'.
MailOnline has contacted a representative for the star in relation to this article.

He also gave her four Oyster travel passes worth 10 each and a London 2012 badge. She later remarked: He definitely wasnt very romantic when it came to gifts.
She was left heartbroken when Sir Peter dumped her after his wife Sue, 60, found out about their fling.
Sir Peter declined to comment about the affair, except to deny spending any public money on Miss Grundy.
He recently famously branded Britains commuter trains awful and like the Wild West. Yesterday, as he was put in charge of Britains rail network, there were plenty of long-suffering commuters hoping he may hold the ticket to making their daily journeys more comfortable.
Sir Peter, pictured, refused to comment on the affair, only to confirm that no public money was used
Sir Peter wore a silk kimono while on the London underground in order to raise money for Comic Relief
Sir Peter, pictured, earns a taxpayer-funded salary of more than 650,000 and has a house in Bath
He has run Londons complex transport system since 2006. As Transport for Londons commissioner, he is credited with overseeing many improvements and his efforts resulted in a knighthood in 2013.
Sir Peter is familiar with the rail network outside the capital, too, having spent the past ten years travelling regularly between London and the 1.5million Georgian villa in Bath he shares with his wife, an HR consultant and the mother of his two children.
Unlike the squashed-in masses, however, the multi-millionaire enjoys free first class travel  a generous perk earned as a result of an earlier job as a London Transport manager. A colourful character, Sir Peter once took the Tube to work wearing slippers and an elaborate oriental silk dressing gown to help raise money for Comic Relief.
Sir Peter, whose taxpayer-funded salary and bonuses at TfL total more than 650,000, is happy to emphasise his working-class credentials. He sometimes turned up to London Assembly meetings in a bus workers high-visibility jacket and loves to speak in a gravelly Cockney accent  to the amusement of his former classmates at a top public school, Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. And even though his father was a communist firebrand, his mother was the daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford.
The Honourable Mary Best ran away from her familys ancestral home in Dorset and married electrician Jack Hendy. A Communist Party activist and leading member of the Electrical Trades Union, he was caught up in a ballot-rigging scandal and, although cleared by the courts, was banned for life from the union. He studied for a law degree at night school and became a barrister.
Sir Peter has been keen to portray his career as a rags-to-riches rise from lowly London bus conductor to self-made millionaire and transport supremo.
But, having studied economics at Leeds University, he actually began in 1975 as a fast-track graduate trainee with London Transport, which involved a few weeks work experience as a conductor as well as learning how to drive a bus.
He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a 34million management buyout in 1995  and his stake was worth 4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for 54million.
Although appointed as commissioner by Red Ken Livingstone, a close ally, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson. At one point he concluded: Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken. He also noted: I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, Im not sure Im more Left-leaning than he is.
Did Tories cover up the rail crisis? Big projects halted weeks after party's election promises to spend billions on the network
By RAY MASSEY and DANIEL MARTIN
Ministers were accused of a pre-election cover-up last night after they announced bombshell plans to scale back rail improvements worth billions of pounds.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that rising costs and missed targets meant that the 38.5billion Network Rail modernisation plan  a centrepiece of the Tory manifesto only two months ago  was now untenable.
Two major electrification schemes in the North and the Midlands would be halted, he said, while wider spending plans would be amended after running out of control.
Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that the Network Rail modernisation plan was 'untenable'
Labour questioned why the chaotic climbdown had been unveiled now  just seven weeks after the election  when the pledge to spend billions improving the transport network had been a key part of the Conservative offer.
MPs also accused the Government of shelving bad news until after the election, even though they had known for months that the plans were at risk. One said Tory MPs across the North had been elected under false pretences. Conservative backbenchers were also angry that projects were being scaled back while the controversial 50billion HS2 high-speed rail scheme linking London and Birmingham  which they decry as a white elephant  survives unscathed.
The climbdown is a disaster for the Government and its pledge to deliver a northern powerhouse. The idea  championed by George Osborne  was for improved transport links to bind together the cities of the North, which would be granted devolved power to allow them to boost their economies.
The Conservatives election manifesto had pledged: We will transform our railway network. We will invest 38billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme.
The decision to pull the plug on rail schemes in the North and the Midlands, while keeping HS2 and London projects such as Crossrail untouched, puts the Tories rhetoric in doubt. Mr McLoughlin told the Commons that the five-year rail improvement plan needed to be reset because it was now costing more and taking longer. He said electrification work was being paused on the Midland main line between London and Sheffield  where hundreds of millions has already been spent on preparatory work  and on the trans-Pennine Leeds-Manchester route.
The aim is to keep Network Rails spending within its funding allowance, so that electrification of the Great Western line can be prioritised. Mr McLoughlin announced a shake-up of Network Rail management with the chairman  and former Ford boss  Richard Parry-Jones stepping down.
He will be replaced next month by Londons colourful transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy.
The 38.5bn plan is being shelved, while the proposed 50bn HS2, artists impression, will continue
It is understood that the London Crossrail project will also remain unscathed from the planned review
None of Network Rails executive directors will receive a bonus for the past year, Mr McLoughlin said. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne  who will keep his job  admitted they had been overly optimistic about meeting targets.
Labour said the Government knew the scale of the crisis before the election but sought to keep a lid on it to avoid damaging headlines.
In the Commons, Labour transport spokesman Michael Dugher told Mr McLoughlin: You spent the election campaign repeating promises you knew you would break. Ministers may try to shift all the blame to Network Rail, but this happened on the Governments watch.
MP Clive Betts told Radio 4s PM programme: It has been becoming apparent over the past year that costs were going up and timescales were slipping, yet the Government kept this under wraps until after the election.
John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: This has been covered up for some time. There is a lot of anger that so many people have been misled by all this rubbish about the northern powerhouse. A lot of Tory MPs have been elected under false pretences.
Fly through the 42KM of Crossrail tunnels in this incredible...
Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said: There have been clear signs since Christmas that Government is losing patience. And had it not been for a desire to avoid controversial headlines in the run-up to a General Election, the odds are that Network Rail would have been reformed by now in ways it may not have welcomed. There was suppressed Government fury at New Year, following the engineering embarrassments at Kings Cross and Paddington. But pre-election politics ensured a calm face.
Asked whether ministers knew before the election that the scheme was under threat, David Camerons official spokesman did not deny that this was the case. However, a Department of Transport spokesman said: Its not something the Secretary of State has kept hidden.
Tory backbenchers were angry that HS2 was not being cut. Former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan said: I have always been worried that major projects such as HS2 would suck the life out of other areas.
If these projects are undeliverable now, what does that mean to the HS2 in a few years time. Will that become undeliverable too?
Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: We have been promised time and time again that the money being pumped into HS2 would not affect the delivery of other infrastructure projects, but its clear that it is now cannibalising the rest of the railway budget and other upgrades with far more robust business plans are being shelved.
ALEX BRUMMER: After this shambles HS2 can now be no more than a dream
During the General Election campaign, we heard much from Chancellor George Osborne about building a Northern Powerhouse, and plans for exciting investment in Britains Victorian infrastructure  but little about how it would be delivered.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Greens were mocked for commitments to renationalise all or parts of Britains creaking rail network.
Now, the truth has been revealed. The running of Network Rail  which owns and operates our railways  has been a shambles, electrification of key routes is way behind schedule and is having to be postponed or even cancelled, and the Tory government is being forced to take direct control of the network.
Former Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, pictured, created Network Rail on a not-for-profit basis in 2001 and created an ungainly board including unions, passengers and green groups with weak governance

Passengers were left stranded last Christmas when engineering works overran causing chaos
The largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times was at the heart of the Conservatives long-term plan to secure Britains economic future, to improve productivity and growth. That part of the plan now looks to be in serious trouble, and it is difficult to see how it can easily be rescued at a time when state spending is under pressure.
The real scandal is that the slide into chaos of the Governments promised 38.5billion investment programme must have been known to civil servants and the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin before the country went to the polls on May 7, but not a word crossed anyones lips.
Instead, the nation was treated to a naively optimistic view of a nation determined to revitalise rail travel. Plans included electrification of the TransPennine Express running between Manchester, Leeds and York; improvements of the Midland mainline linking London and Sheffield, and most significantly of all, the vanity HS2 project  estimated to cost up to 42.5billion.
As a result of the new announcements by McLoughlin, several of the key projects are being paused and mothballed, and there must be real questions as to whether the highly contentious HS2 should be, or will be, undertaken.
The immediate trigger for the Governments shake-up of Network Rail is the mayhem that has been endured by passengers. This was symbolised by the engineering works at Kings Cross station that overran during the last Christmas break, forcing passengers of the East Coast, Thameslink &amp; Great Northern lines to use inadequate Finsbury Park station in North London, which became dangerously over-crowded.

There have to be real questions over whether the HS2, artists impression, will ever go ahead
The holiday season pandemonium is just a microcosm of what many rail travellers have to suffer every day, with standing room only, unexplained delays and replacement bus services, and fares that rise inexorably despite the big taxpayer subsidies.
At the root of these problems was the then Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers decision in 2001 to place Railtrack into administration and replace it with a not-for-profit new firm Network Rail, run by an ungainly board of members drawn from all sections of society, from the trades unions to passengers and green groups.
The bizarre structure made for weak governance, which saw rail chieftains rewarding themselves like captains of industry but failing miserably to deliver the services the public craved. Labour eventually had to pay compensation to the Railtrack shareholders.
The impossible governance structure allowed the top brass at Network Rail to enjoy riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Chief executive Mark Carne has a base salary of 675,000 and was forced to forgo a bonus of 135,000 for 2014 (a sum almost equal to the Prime Ministers pay of 142,500) after the Christmas chaos. He is just one of a bunch of Network Rail executives whose pay, bonuses and pensions hover around the 1million mark.
This is nothing compared to the pay of some of the operating companies, with David Brown of Go-Ahead group which runs London-Midland, Southern and South-Eastern, earning a shade under 2million.
One of the immediate results of the changes just unveiled is that finally, after years of dissatisfaction with the way in which Network Rail has been governed, the byzantine structure is being abolished forthwith.
Instead, there is to be rule from Whitehall, with the former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown being parachuted in as Special Director of Network Rail and reporting directly to the Transport Secretary. Brown will work alongside the colourful Sir Peter Hendy, the new Network Rail chairman, who is credited with running the London Underground on time during the Olympics.
What is absolutely clear from the changes and the review that has been unveiled is that under the chairmanship of Richard Parry-Jones, who is to step down, Network Rail lost control of the costs of one of the governments most high-profile infrastructure projects.
As chief executive, Mark Carne admits the projects which Network Rails been charged with delivering are going to take longer and cost more than we originally thought.
The Governments promise to spend 38.5 billion on railways over five years does not seem to be at risk. What will be affected is the ambition to create a 21st-century electrified rail system to empower the North of England and improve the links with the capital.
Whatever the outcome of the Governments review  it is promising decisions by the autumn  the imbroglio raises huge questions over the future of the HS2 project, connecting London to Manchester and running through some of Britains most unspoiled landscaped in the Chilterns; and HS3, designed to go East-West across the North of England connecting Manchester to Hull.
If the relatively simple task of modernising and electrifying some of the busiest rail links in the country cannot be achieved  despite a generous infrastructure budget  then the high-speed projects can be no more than a pipedream.
As for long-suffering commuters and business travellers, the pain of rail travel will continue.
Direct control from Whitehall may be an improvement on the old Network Rail, but it cannot be the right long-term solution. Until the private enterprise disciplines of cost controls, efficient engineering and delivery of projects on time are brought to the rail network, the taxpayer will not get value for money.

Just four days after Russell Brand was told to F*** off back to Miliband as he prepared to address Left-wing protesters on an anti-austerity march, the self-styled revolutionary has upset Bob Geldofs daughter Fifi.
Fifi, whose sister Peaches died of a heroin overdose last year at the age of 25, was a guest at a fundraising event this week for a charity that specialises in treatment for alcohol and drug addiction.
But Fifi was horrified when former addict Brand gave a speech in which he made jokes about drug abuse.

From what Ive experienced, a lot of people here tonight are on drugs right now, Brand told guests, who included recently knighted singer Sir Van Morrison, actress Sadie Frost and Madness frontman Suggs.
It was like an avalanche on the back of my toilet.
Peaches Geldof (pictured) died of a heroin overdose last year at the age of 25
Referring to the charity Focus 12s founder Chip Somers, he told guests at the event at Londons Porchester Hall: Chip said, If you dont stop taking drugs in the next six months youll be dead, in a lunatic asylum or in prison. So I thought: Well, Ive got five months, three weeks and six days before I have to do anything, f*** that.
Fifi  whose mother, TV presenter Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose aged 41  was disgusted by the comments from the so-called comedian, saying: Less of a Russell Brand fan than ever after his offensive and highly inappropriate speech at the addiction charity event.
The 32-year-old PR executive, who was sporting a new upper-arm tattoo of a peach in honour of her sister, also pointed to a magazine article comparing Brand to the pompous would-be anarchist character Rick, played by the late Rik Mayall, in the Eighties sitcom The Young Ones.
Fifi added of Brand: Silly try- hard ****.
She also called him an 'unfunny b*****d' and an 'uber-douche extraordinaire'.
Last weekend Brand had to be held back in the VIP area of a rally against Government cuts as a group in Parliament Square screamed abuse at him because of his backing for Red Ed Milibands Labour Party at the General Election.
The hecklers called him a turncoat for telling fans to vote Labour while demanding an anti-capitalist revolution in Britain.
End of the affair for Google pair
It was the love affair that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley.
But two years after Google founder Sergey Brin sensationally left his wife for his young British lover, Amanda Rosenberg, the pair have now split.

After moving to the U.S. after graduating from Leeds University, the Marlborough College-educated Rosenberg, 28  she was two years below Pippa Middleton  rose quickly through the ranks at Google: she was later accused online of sleeping her way to the top. She became close to Brin, 41, after working on the Google Glass project.
Their affair came to light when Brins wife of six years, Anne, discovered incriminating emails.
Rosenberg appears to have left Google and, according to her LinkedIn profile, now works for a software design company.
Meanwhile, it emerges Brin and Anne have quietly divorced. Their prenuptial agreement rules out any possibility of a fight over his 20 billion fortune.

The Queens starring role at London 2012s opening ceremony, in which a stunt double parachuted into the Olympic Stadium, has left a lasting impression. At a recent garden party at Buckingham Palace, the military band near the tea pavilion played a tune by Adele. The Rev John Wall, a guest, reports: I was tickled to note the theme from the Bond film, Skyfall.

Culture Secretary gets groovy thanks to his music buff son
John Whittingdales love of heavy metal is well known, but he also has an inside track on contemporary music trends.
John Whittingdale claims his son Henry keeps him in touch with all the latest music trends
The new Culture Secretarys son Henry is rising up the music industry ladder and holds a marketing position at Island Records, home to Glastonbury headliners Florence + The Machine as well as Mumford &amp; Sons and U.S. rapper Nicki Minaj.
Henry keeps me in touch with the latest music, admits Whittingdale, who hopes to attend Glastonbury next year after a diary clash prevented him attending this weekend.
Henry stays out of the political arena, but he did tweet after the May poll: Incredible result and one Im more than happy with, surely FPTP [first past the post] has to go now though . . .
Whittingdale senior, who will headbang to AC/DC at Wembley next weekend, might argue theres a little life left in the current voting system once the Tories secure boundary changes that would make their electoral position even more secure.
Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes has created a showbusiness dynasty. The Oscar-winners success has inspired his son Peregrine, 23, to follow him into the industry. He is now pursuing a career in film production, says Lord Fellowes, 65, who will give a talk at the Chalke Valley History Festival on Sunday about the world of Downton. I am proud of him, yes, and quite surprised  he hasnt had a day out of work since he left university. Thats quite extraordinary in our business.

Novak's keen fan showed off her immaculately curled hair and designer dress as she stood to receive the T-shirt as he flung it in to the crowd.
And despite her pristine appearance she didn't hesitate to pull it on before grabbing Djokovic's face between two perfectly manicured hands and giving him a smacker.
The lucky spectator looked thrilled  to catch the world number one's t-shirt despite the fact it was soaked in sweat
Thrilled with her accomplishment, the brunette threw her hands up in delight as Djokovic moved away to carry on with the match
The fan is clasps the Serbian's face with her perfectly manicured talons and brings him in for a kiss
Of course, the player is happily married to model Jelena and the duo are enjoying their first year of marriage. 
But no doubt thoughts of being a domestic god are far from his mind in the run-up to the Grand Slam which kicks off on Monday.
The world No 1 has opted not to play in any of the official grass-court tournaments in the lead up to Wimbledon.
And as the favourite to triumph at the All-England club following the conclusion of The Boodles event, as he looks to retain his Wimbledon title and win for the third time in his career.
The 28-year-old has already won the Australian Open this year, but missed out on French Open glory, losing to Stan Wawrinka in four sets in the final.
Meanwhile, Richard Gasquet also gave fans a thrill by handing his sweaty shirt over to a well-dressed blonde sitting courtside.
He was also pulled into an intimate embrace by her.

	Zack Davies was found guilty of trying to kill Dr Sarandev Bhambra in front of shoppers at the Tesco supermarket in Mold, North Wales while shouting 'White Power' and 'I did it for Lee Rigby'.

'Dr Bhamdra sustained the most dreadful life-changing injuries during a sustained racist attack on an innocent man, a member of a caring profession here in Mold carrying out work for the benefit of the community, who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.'
He also said many in the store and the emergency services had acted with courage that day but he singled out the actions of Mr Fuller for his 'quite astounding courage' and said he was considering how it should be best recognised.
Davies, pictured, was said to have been obsessed with Nazi ideology, with various associated literature found in a later police search of his home
He added: 'If it had not been for Peter Fuller there is every chance that Dr Bhandra would not be with us today, he would have been killed by this man. Mr Fullers courage is truly exceptional.
A knife, which was found by police belonging to Davies.Witnesses reported seeing a white man chasing an Asian man through the store with a knife and hammer
'It was a desperately sad and sorry case and the way Dr Bhandra coped and Mr Fuller behaved are just two rays of hope and light in an otherwise dreadful case.'
The jury heard how Davies would sit in his flat playing violent video games such as Call Of Duty on his XBox, sometimes for six or seven hours a day and watch online videos of ISIS beheadings.
Expelled from Mold Alun High School at 11 for taking a knife to school to attack a classmate, Davies became a loner and admitted carrying a knife with him every day since he was 15 because of his growing paranoia.
He harboured a hatred for his mothers boyfriend who he blamed for having to leave his mothers home and on January 14 he packed a machete, hammer and knife into his rucksack and went to attack Sion Williams, who worked at the towns post office in Earl Road.
When he failed to find him he sat for while before making his way through town where he caught site of Dr Bhambra near the bus station.
Prosecutor Sion ap Mihangel said Davies then followed Dr Bhambra to Tesco where he put down his rucksack, took out the hammer and machete and attacked him from behind with a hammer blow to the head shouting 'white power' and 'remember Lee Rigby'.
Terrified shoppers told how Davies then pursued the bleeding Dr Bhambra who fell several times as he slashed his skull to the bone and gashed his back with the machete and cut the nerves and tendons to his left hand as he tried to defend himself.
The court heard Dr Bhambra, of Leeds, told police: He would have hacked me to bits. I have no doubt in my mind that he was trying to kill me. I was singled out, I was attacked on the basis of my colour  I thought I was going to die.
Davies was described as a racist with a fascination for Far Right ideologies after police found Nazi-linked literature at his home. He also described Jihadi John as an inspiration
During a search of his home, police found various right wing literature and Davies was also said to be fascinated by ISIS
His ordeal ended when ex-soldier Mr Fuller bravely stepped into the path of Davies and told him he was ex-forces and to stop, because he was not solving anything.
He said 'we are under attack' but Mr Fuller said what he was doing was madness and Dr Bhandra was not guilty of anything.
As he was handcuffed and taken away by police, Davies told the gathered crowd that he had done it for murdered guardsman Lee Rigby.
Mr ap Mihangel described Davies as a racist with a fascination for Far Right ideologies and read everything from Koran passages, stickers for neo-Nazi group Combat 18to Hitlers Mein Kampf. In interview he had told police that may be the 'wrong' side had won the Second World War.
The attack happened at a Tesco store in North Wales, where Dr Bhambra had been shopping on his lunch break
He even said he had considered at one point converting to Islam because he was tired of his new flatmates and their drug-taking.
Davies, who Mr ap Mihangel said was intelligent and 'well read in his field', added he was interested in both extreme left and right wing ideologies and had been fascinated by ISIS and its 'no compromise' philosophy.
BRAVERY OF EX-SOLDIER WHO STOPPED ATTACK
The astounding courage of ex-soldier Peter Fuller almost certainly saved Dr Bhambras life, a judge said.
Mr Fuller told the court that he initially watched in shock as Davies rained multiple blows on the victim.
But as the dentist fled, Mr Fuller stood in Daviess way and shouted: Stop, this is madness. I am ex-forces.
He said Davies told him we are under attack. But the fact I said I was an ex-soldier, that I stood in his way, took the wind out of his sails, Mr Fuller added.
He persuaded the attacker to place his weapons on the floor and kept him talking until police arrived.
Judge Rowlands said: If it had not been for Peter Fuller there is every chance that Dr Bhambra would not be with us  Mr Fullers courage is truly exceptional.
The family of the victim said that they would be forever grateful to the ex-soldier.
He had taken a mask to wear during an attack on his mothers boyfriend and was planning to shout 'God Is Great' is Arabic while he did it.
He admitted he had selected Dr Bhambra solely because of the colour of his skin and Asian appearance.
In court Davies apologised to the family of Lee Rigby for dragging his name into the case and also to Dr Bhambra who he agreed was simply an innocent victim.
Just before he had left his flat, Mr ap Mihangel said Davies had looked at a website on the Koran and beheadings. But a search of his computer history also found extreme violent websites such as Best Gore and All the Gore.
Dr Bhambras brother, Dr Tarlochan Singh Bhambra made a statement outside Mold Crown Court following the guilty verdict against Davies.
He said: 'Sarandev was singled out because of the colour of his skin. We are in no doubt that had the racial disposition of this case been reversed this would be reported as an act of terror with a wider media coverage.
'We as a family have listened intently to the evidence and are in no doubt given the racial and political motivation that this should be rightly defined as an act of terrorism.
'By his own admission Zack Davies had extreme neo nazi views and is a member of a white supremacist organisation.
'Ethnic minorities have and continue to contribute positively to the multicultural Britain of 2015. Sikhs have sacrificed their lives in both world wars to facilitate the freedom that Britain enjoys today.'
After the verdict today, Dr Bhambra's brother Dr Tarlochan Bhambra made a statement on behalf of the family outside Mold Crown Court
Gareth Preston, senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, added: 'Zackery Davies is a dangerous young man whose distorted and racist views led him to commit a terrifying act of violence.
'This was an attack against a complete stranger, singled out for no other reason than his ethnicity.
'Such was the level of violence involved that were it not for the extremely courageous actions of ex-serviceman Peter Fuller, this offence could have become an act of murder.
'As it is, Davies's actions have left Dr Bhambra with life-changing injuries. We hope that today's conviction will be of some comfort to him as he seeks to move forward with his life.'
One of his flatmates, who asked not to be named, told the Daily Mail Davies believed Muslims should go back where they came from.

EXCLUSIVE: Are these bits of metal proof that Amelia Earhart died after being captured by the Japanese on remote Pacific atoll  and the U.S. government KNEW but covered it up?
Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan have not been heard of since July 1937 when they took off from New Guinea on 30th leg of round the world flight
But two investigators hope the mystery could be at an end within weeks
They believe they have two vital bits of evidence proving they landed in the Marshall Islands that day
If correct, it could prove they died while in the hands of the Japanese military - and that the U.S. government decided hero pilot was 'expendable'

Germany's central bank yesterday criticised the way Greek lenders are being propped up by emergency funds from Europe, in a sign that patience with Athens is wearing thin.
Greek banks have become increasingly dependent on a lifeline from the European Central Bank for survival as savers withdraw billions of euros from accounts.
But Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and an influential figure at the ECB, said this emergency help may breach EU law.

He followed that up saying that if there was no water available, they should consume their own urine.
The comments sparked outrage among parents who filed complaints against the teacher at the primary school in Sungai Petani, Malaysia.
The school was also attacked with a Molotov Cocktail which damaged the security booth.
Malaysian Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan (pictured greeting supporters at a by-election in 2010) reprimanded the teacher, but insisted that the remark was a joke
Two men have been arrested over the attack.
Malaysian Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan reprimanded the teacher, but insisted that the remark was a joke.
Deputy education minister, Mary Yap, a non-Muslim, has previously urged non-Muslim students to avoid eating and drinking in front of Muslim schoolmates during Ramadan, it was reported by PRI .
The education authority faced a backlash during Ramadan last year when a parent posted pictures online of her daughter and other non-Muslims being forced to eat in a shower room because thecanteen wasclosed.
Many canteens in Malaysian public institutions, including some public schools and universities, are shut during Ramadan despite there being large numbers of non-Muslim pupils.

ASYLUM!
Only this week 140 members of the Taliban family from Afghanistan were flown Goat Class from Kabul to our international gateway at Stansted. They join tens of thousands of other lucky winners already in Britain.
Our most popular destinations include the world-famous Toddington Services Area in historic Bedfordshire . . .

Hundreds of lawyers, social workers and counsellors are waiting to help. It wont cost you a penny. So play today. It could change your life for ever.

COME ON DOWN!
Get along to the airport. Get along to the lorry park. Get along to the ferry terminal. Dont stop in Germany or France. Go straight to Britain.
You are guaranteed to be one of tens of thousands of lucky winners in the softest game on Earth. Roll up, roll up my friends, for the game that never ends. Everyones a winner, when they play:
ASYLUM!
We keep being told that the current refugee crisis is a direct result of our involvement in the American-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and Britains meddling in foreign civil wars, such as the bombing of Libya.
But I wrote Asylum! in February 2000, a full 18 months before 9/11. In the U.S., George W. Bush wasnt even the official Republican candidate, let alone President. The Afghan and Iraq wars werent so much as a twinkle on the Pentagons radar. Back then, Tony Blair was too busy bombing the Balkans.
The Sangatte departure lounge opened as long ago as 1999, to accommodate immigrants trying to enter Britain illegally. There were riots at the camp in 2001 and 2002, before it was closed.
So please dont try to kid us that the mayhem at Calais is a new phenomenon. This all dates back to what Peter Mandelson called Labours deliberate decision to scour the world for migrants, so they could rub the Rights noses in diversity.
Once the Blair government made it plain that everyone was welcome, however they entered this country  and thanks to the newly-adopted Yuman Rites Act would never be sent home  its hardly surprising the world beat a path to our door.
Who can forget the sight of the then Home Secretary, Jolly Jack Straw, scuttling down to Dover to welcome in person a lorry load of immigrants from Sangatte, like an obsequious package holiday rep? He should have worn a red coat and a pair of white strides.
This madness was compounded by our membership of the EU, which meant that anyone who managed to set foot in Europe could make straight for the French coast bound for England.
Our island location and our opt-out from the Schengen open-borders treaty was never going to protect us. When our politicians were so keen to expand the EU to embrace former Communist countries in Eastern Europe, did they envisage that, say, Hungary, would become the first port of call for London-bound immigrants from Africa and the Middle East?
Of course they didnt. No one ever thinks anything through. Plenty of British politicians, including Winston Churchill wannabe Boris Johnson, are lobbying for Turkey to be admitted to the EU.
That would be Turkey, gateway to Islamic State. And, as we all know, gates swing both ways.
Already, known Islamist terrorists, hell-bent on attacking infidel targets in Europe, are stowing away among the migrants being picked up in the Mediterranean and deposited in Italy.
If Turkey gets full EU membership, the terrorists wont need to resort to subterfuge. Once theyve slipped over the porous Turkish/Syrian border, theyll be free to head for London.
Even after some Isis-sponsored nut-job has blown himself to Kingdom Come on the Underground, taking goodness knows how many innocents with him, the usual conga-line of hand-wringing Guardianistas will still be insisting that we have a humanitarian duty to take in all-comers, regardless of the consequences.
Sorry, but weve got enough home-grown head-cases ready to commit mass murder in the name of the religion of peace, without importing them from hell-holes in North Africa and beyond. And we know next to nothing about the people heading our way.
I dont dispute that some of these migrants are fleeing poverty and pretty grim living conditions at home. But that doesnt necessarily make them refugees. Most are economic migrants.
Earlier, I almost wrote about the world and his wife beating a path to our door. But his wife is conspicuous by her absence. So is his mother, his sister, his daughter.
At least 90 per cent of these 'asylum seekers' are young, able-bodied men in their late teens or early 20s
Dramatic moment migrant climbs into lorry cabin
At least 90 per cent of these asylum seekers are young, able-bodied men in their late teens/early 20s, wearing the latest designer sportswear. If they were genuinely in fear of their lives and fleeing real persecution, wouldnt they have brought their female relatives with them?
But no, its women and children last when it comes to crossing the Med. Were not talking the dance band on the Titanic here.
Of course, its racist to point any of this out. Which is why broadcasters and Left-wing journalists seize on any unfortunate woman with a child they manage to find among the overwhelmingly male multitude.
European leaders met yesterday to agree a common response to the crisis. Fat hope of that. Frances idea of a solution is shovelling all the migrants massed at Calais across the Channel.
And forget about international law, which demands that refugees apply for asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. Europes open borders have made a nonsense of that requirement.
Typically, Britains response has been pathetic. Fining lorry drivers and sending a few more sniffer dogs isnt going to work.
Britain's response of sending a few sniffer dogs and fining lorry drivers has been quite pathetic
But what else should we expect? The Tories promised to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands, knowing full well that wasnt possible while we remain in the EU. Inevitably, immigration has gone not so much through the roof as through the ozone layer over the past few years.
Call Me Daves vainglorious interference in the Arab Spring didnt help. Remember him bombing Libya, without worrying what might come next, and doing a ridiculous lap of honour round Tahrir Square in Egypt? I told you at the time it would end in tears. The fall-out has landed on our doorstep.
Thats why immigration may well prove to be the trump card in the forthcoming EU referendum.
The only proper course of action to halt the invasion of Southern Europe  and by extension Britain  would be to close the EUs borders, which have as many holes as a string vest, and stage a full-scale Nato blockade of the North African coast to prevent any more boats leaving.
But that aint gonna happen, either. All weve done is send HMS Bulwark to act as a free cross-Med ferry. If thats the plan, why not get Bulwark  and that useless new aircraft-free aircraft carrier commissioned by Gordon Brown (HMS Prudence?)  to pick up migrants in Tripoli, bring them straight to Southampton and charge them for the privilege?
David Cameron lays out border control plans at PMQs
Toddington is one of the most popular drop-off points for migrants recently arrived from the continent
Theyre desperate enough to hand over a small fortune to people smugglers. So why dont we cut out the middle man? Theyre going to end up here anyway and the money might help offset the savage cuts in the defence budget.
Looking back on my Asylum! spoof, I notice that I mentioned the world-famous Toddington Service Area, in Bedfordshire.
Toddington is still one of the most popular drop-off points today. A local farmer this week revealed that he spends as much time rounding up illegal immigrants as tending his turnips.
You couldnt make it up.
Fifteen years ago, Asylum! was the worlds fastest-growing game show. Fifteen years from now itll be the longest-running. And those Afghan hijackers are still here, just as I predicted.
Roll up, roll up my friends, for the game that never ends . . .
COME ON DOWN!

	The BBC's current charter will expire next year and negotiations for a new one put almost all aspects of the corporation up for debate according to green paper due to be published next week.

While negotiations for the new charter have not yet formally begun, a source close to the Governments plans told the newspaper that the abolition of the Trust in favour of Ofcom was more than likely, saying: You can put your mortgage on it.
The job of regulating the Corporation includes overseeing its editorial standards, reviewing value for money and monitoring its market impact.
The plans are thought to have the support of Chancellor George Osborne who has previously praised Ofcom for its work regulating commercial broadcasters.
Long battle ahead: Rona Fairhead will have a hard job fighting the plans which are believed to be backed by Chancellor George Osborne who previously praised Ofcom for its work regulating commercial broadcasters
The Green Paper will provide the starting point for discussions rather than concrete plans but it has been reported than a licence fee freeze is the best financial deal the BBC can hope for in the new charter. The idea has also been floated of reducing the length of each charter from ten years to five to allow the BBCs governing system to be more flexible and better able to cope with the shifting nature of the modern media landscape.
OSBORNE 'TO MAKE BBC PAY FOR FREE TV LICENCE FOR OVER-75S'
Chancellor George Osborne is considering making the BBC pay the 600m-a-year cost of free television licences for the over-75s, The Independent reports.
The newspaper claims that making the licence-fee payer rather than the taxpayer foot the bilkl for free tv for the elderly may be part of the Chancellor's new Budget.
Osborne is under pressure to make further cuts when he delivers the budget on July 8th, in order to fulfill the Tory election promise to cut the welfare budget by 12bn per year.
There are also alleged plans to scrap the law around the TV licence fee, which would stop it being a criminal offence not to pay it.
The BBC currently makes 200million-a-year by taking non-payers to court.
The BBC Trust had endured a rocky history since is was established less than a decade ago. It has come under fire for its role in excessive pay-offs to departing executives and the investigation into the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Its trustees have also been criticised for holding other senior jobs at the same time.
Mrs Fairhead faced calls to resign because of her role at HSBC after allegations of tax evasion at the bank came to light. Equally, the Trusts vice chairman Roger Carr faced pressure to leave because he was also chairman of arms firm BAE Systems.
A spokesman for the BBC Trust said last night: We fully expect regulation to be one of the issues debated as part of Charter Review.
The Trust is on the record as saying that the frontrunner would be to transfer the Trusts responsibilities for regulation and accountability to an external (bespoke) regulator.
It was revealed earlier this month that the BBC spends less than half of its money on programmes for licence fee payers.
Only 2.4billion of its 5.1billion annual budget went on public service content in the year to April 2014.
A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: All aspects of the BBC are up for debate as part of the Charter Review.

	Ebola detected within MINUTES with new test device

	The device, which requires just a pinprick of blood, can be used at the bedside of patients and is as accurate as traditional lab tests that can take days, The Lancet reports.

A field trial of the test, developed by the US company Corgenix, took place at two treatment centres run by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Sierra Leone.
A total of 106 patients suspected of having Ebola were given the fingerprick test and also had their blood analysed the normal way.
Every case of Ebola confirmed in the laboratory using the standard procedure was detected by the bedside test, with very few non-infected people wrongly testing positive.
However both tests failed to pick up a small number of Ebola cases that were identified by an alternative ultra-sensitive lab test which is not widely available.
The device works similarly to a home pregnancy test, with the sample applied to a treated strip. If the sample is positive for Ebola, a coloured line appears on the strip at a specific location
Dr Nira Pollock, from Boston Children's Hospital in the US, who led a trial of the test reported in The Lancet medical journal, said: 'Simplifying the process and speeding up diagnosis could have a major impact.'
The device was the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test developed by Corgenix.
The Public Health England lab at Port Loko in Sierra Leone, where clinical samples were routinely sent for standard molecular diagnostic testing, confirmed diagnosis.
Ebola epidemic 'lead to surge in malaria deaths'
Malaria likely killed many more people than usual in the West African nation of Guinea during last year's Ebola outbreak, a new study suggests.
This is because tens of thousands of people with potential signs of the mosquito-spread disease probably shunned health clinics.
The early symptoms of malaria - a fever and body aches - are similar to Ebola.
Health workers said many people with malaria were afraid of catching Ebola at a medical facility or being mistakenly sent to an Ebola clinic.
Experts based their conclusions in part on data such as how many people with malaria symptoms were seen at health clinics in four regions hardest hit by Ebola - and how many malaria medicines were given out.
They compared that to regions without Ebola and concluded there were about 74,000 probable malaria cases that went untreated.
Malaria is the leading killer of children in Guinea.
Malaria likely killed many more people than usual in the West African nation of Guinea during last year's Ebola outbreak, a new study suggests. Health workers said many people with malaria were afraid of catching Ebola at a medical facility or being mistakenly sent to an Ebola clinic
Since the Ebola outbreak was first identified in the forests of Guinea in March 2014, officials estimate the virus has killed more than 2,400 people in the country.
In 2013, about 15,000 people in Guinea were killed by malaria, according to Nets for Life Africa, a U.S. charity.
Mateusz Plucinski of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study, said it was difficult to say how many people among the 74,000 suspected cases might have died of malaria.
But he added it was probably 'substantially higher' than the number of Ebola deaths.
The research was paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative. It was published online Tuesday in the journal, Lancet Infectious Diseases.
In an email, Franco Pagnoni, of the World Health Organisation, said it was possible Ebola could have also caused spikes in malaria cases in the other countries heavily affected by Ebola - and this, in turn could have undermined previous efforts to curb malaria.
Health officials also worry the stress of the Ebola outbreak on Guinea's weak health system also resulted in a drop in vaccination coverage, putting the country at risk of a resurgence of diseases such as measles and polio.

	The new guidance has been introduced due to fears that filming could infringe Wimbledon’s broadcasting rights and aims to prevent sideline behaviour that may distract players.

But the introduction of apps such as Periscope, which allow mobile phone users to effectively broadcast live over the internet, has huge ramifications for sporting events  especially those that rely on striking lucrative broadcasting deals for exclusive coverage.
The US PGA Tour stripped golf blogger Stephanie Wei of her media credentials in May after she streamed live video of Masters tournament winner Jordan Spieth during a practice round at the World Golf Championship Match Play event.
STRAWBERRY RIPE FOR HEN-MAN!
Strawberries are a quintessential ingredient of Wimbledon  but this particular one might just fall fowl of the usual standards
The berry is shaped like a chicken, appearing to have a head, tail and even a nest when turned upside down. But Reuben and April Welch, who found the fruit at their farm in Bonnyrigg, Edinburgh, added a beak to complete the effect.
Surely its a dessert fit for former British tennis ace Tim Henman?
Alex Willis, head of digital and content at the All England Club, said tournament organisers would be using live video streaming in a very targeted way, to capture unique moments and give a unique insight into Wimbledon.
The club, in south-west London, has also banned selfie sticks  the metal rods that allow camera phones to be extended up to 3ft for group shots and panoramic images. They are listed under the prohibited items list on the Wimbledon website.
William Hanson, author of The Bluffers Guide To Etiquette, told the Daily Telegraph : Selfie sticks are ridiculous and are probably more a health and safety issue rather than a good taste issue, although you could argue the latter as well.
With any event of the social season there are certain rules and it puts some peoples backs up but if you dont like the rules then dont go to the event.
Meanwhile, Twitter has made a bespoke strawberry emoji  a tiny picture used to illustrate social messaging  for Wimbledon in tribute to the traditional strawberries and cream on sale.
Former tennis star Greg Rusedski has attacked the BBC over its decision to sideline John Inverdale during this years Wimbledon coverage. The 41-year-old branded it a mistake for the corporation to axe Inverdale, 57, from his 14-year run fronting the nightly round-up of the tournaments action.

	Aides have warned that the Queen may have to move out of her London home so builders can carry out £150 million worth of refurbishment.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
This week aides warned the Queen may have to move out of her London home so builders can carry out 150 million worth of refurbishment. It was said the Palace, which has not been redecorated for more than 60 years, has fallen into such a state of disrepair that the wiring and plumbing will have to be replaced and the works could take up to ten years.
Against the reported 3.5 billion refurbishment estimate for the House of Commons and Palace of Westminster, the cost looks almost modest. Even so it has soared from a quote only two years ago, when officials predicted 50 million was needed to cover the maintenance for all the royal palaces.
At a time when many are still suffering the hardship of years of economic restraint it may not have been the best moment to ask for more taxpayers money. Certainly, the Queen was not amused that her state visit to Germany has been overshadowed by squabbling between her bean counters and the Scottish government over future funding for the monarchy north of the border.
She was particularly dismayed that Sir Alan Reid, her treasurer and keeper of the privy purse, of whom she is especially fond, found himself in the firing line over the matter.
Maintaining Buckingham Palace has always been a political hot potato. Only two years ago, MPs accused Sir Alan of shocking complacency over repairs to royal buildings when he appeared before a Commons committee. This was why Reid set out the 150 million refurbishment plan this week.
So is the Palace falling down? And if so, can the Queen possibly live there while refurbishment is taking place? There is no doubt work needs to be done. Staff have had to catch rainwater in buckets to protect works of art in the Queens Gallery and the Picture Gallery.
A chunk of masonry the size of a shoebox fell perilously close to Princess Annes car some years ago, forcing emergency repairs to re-face the interior of the quadrangle.
Work has been carried out to the clock face and pediment. Now, I am told, the balcony adjoining the Green Drawing Room, is structurally unsound and out of bounds.
Over the past year, the Palace has had to spend 300,000 on the removal of asbestos in the basement floor ducts, 700,000 on the resurfacing of roadways and paths in the garden, 800,000 on the renewal of slate and lead coverings and 300,000 on the refurbishment of the State Glass Pantry.
Five chandeliers in the Ball Supper Room have been taken down and cleaned by hand, a task that took an incredible two months. On a fact-finding visit, MPs reported cracked plasterwork and discoloured gilding on the staircase. The paintwork in the Blue Room was so faded it was more like a smoky grey room.
In a months time, the Queen will put the bickering behind her when she leaves the Palace for Scotland, where she will spend the summer and early autumn first at Craigowan Lodge and then Balmoral Castle.
After her departure the gates of the palace will be opened to the public at 35.50 a head. For two months visitors will tour the gilded state rooms where investitures, audiences and receptions are held.
A highlight will be the dining table in the ballroom, which will be set for 170 guests, with 2,000 pieces of cutlery, silver-gilt candelabra and tableware, and the Grand Service on which food is presented.
Dresses and jewellery worn by the Queen at state banquets over the years and gifts presented by some of the 110 visiting heads of state she has welcomed to the Palace will be on display. Visitors will also have a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the 12 months of preparation that goes into each state visit to Britain, including the selection of food and wine and Her Majestys outfits.
Ever since the doors were first opened to paying guests in 1993  in response to public outrage that the taxpayer alone should meet the cost of the devastating Windsor Castle fire  it has been one of Londons most popular attractions.
The Queen has been told that she may have to move out of Buckingham Palace for ten years
Members of the public can get the chance to tour Buckingham Palace while the queen is away for the summer
The public opening is also one of the reasons why the repairs have stacked up. In the old days before the Palace was opened for the summer, an annual maintenance programme was carried out, says a courtier. Now that cant be done in anything like the same way.
Few of the visitors will see anything but perfection on show. But behind the polished veneer of the official tour, all is not well.
All theyve been doing in recent times is papering over the cracks, says a courtier. The place is awash with asbestos, which is enormously costly to remove. The 150 million is just an estimate. After the Windsor fire we budgeted for 40 million and it came in at 37 million so you hope the estimate will come down.
This week, aides have talked about the Queen having to quit the Palace while renovations are carried out. This would mean having to find somewhere to hold state banquets, investitures and garden parties.
Other members of the Royal Family, including Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who operate from the Palace, would also have to find another royal base.
The disruption means the Queen would be reluctant to move. There is also, I understand, a more emotional reason behind this reluctance. She is concerned that if she does leave she has no way of knowing when or whether she will ever return, says the courtier.
In particular, she is concerned Prince Philip might never return. She is not spelling it out but she is mindful of her own and Philips great age.
Another factor is the Queens attitude to money. Careful by nature, her first reaction to learning of damage or the need for repairs is to say: How much?
Buckingham Palace has been the Queen's home since she was ten - apart from three years after getting wed
Now 89, her habit of switching off electric lights in empty Palace rooms is well known. Apart from three years as a newlywed when she and Philip lived in Clarence House, Buckingham Palace has been her home since the age of ten.
While Edward VII called it a mausoleum and the Duke of Windsor likened it to a prison, Elizabeth happily took over the old rooms where she had seen her father at work. Many things have remained unchanged ever since.
After artist Michael Noakes was commissioned to paint the Queen, one of the first things she said to him when he arrived in the Yellow Drawing Room was that she really must do something about the curtains. Fabric swatches were ordered and the next time he came the samples were lying on the sofa.
Four years later when I went back to paint her again the samples were still there, he recalled.
And servants still talk, possibly apocryphally, of the story of the torn tapestry. The Queen is said to have noticed some damage to a wall covering and reported it to a footman. The servant took a pair of scissors to the tapestry, slicing off a strip to remove the offending tear. The Queen, I am told, never mentioned it again.
But while her bonds with Buckingham Palace are strong, it is not her favourite home. That is Windsor Castle where, as she gets older, she spends more time.
It is feared that the repairs to Buckingham Palace, pictured, could take at least ten years
Take a look inside Buckingham Palace with the Queen (related)
Her regular routine is to arrive at the Palace at 3pm on Monday and leave on Thursday afternoon. Usually it is for Windsor, but she and Philip also like the solitude of Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk for their weekend breaks. Because of the rhythm of the royal year  in which the Queen is at Sandringham for Christmas and the New Year, at Windsor for Easter, the horse show in May and Royal Ascot in June, and Balmoral in the summer  she spends less than six months at the Palace.
Not long ago some royal advisers were debating whether in these straitened times there was a case for mothballing one or two royal homes. Their thoughts were shaped by Prince Charles, who has let it be known that he thought Buckingham Palace should not be the home of the monarch.
Instead it should house royal offices and also be used as a magnificent venue for official entertaining.
But former royal aide Dickie Arbiter is firmly opposed to such an idea. Buckingham Palace is the symbolic head of monarchy, he says. You wouldnt expect the Pope to move out of the Vatican for a church round the corner. People come to the Palace for garden parties and investitures, and it is a great occasion which no other royal address quite possesses.
As for spending on the repairs, he says: Buckingham Palace is a building of historic importance, so the money has to be spent. Would you let the Tower of London fall down? Or the Palace of Westminster? Of course not.
The Duke of Windsor mournfully noted: One never tinkers with palaces; like museums they seem to resist change. A maxim that could not be more appropriate when applied to Buckingham Palace during the Queens reign.

	Hedgefunder Gregg Hymowitz has been slapped with a temporary restraining order by Manhattan Supreme Court halting work on the  bowling alley he had planned for his home.

The Manhattan Supreme Court has reportedly slapped Gregg Hymowitz, pictured, with a temporary restraining order
A wealthy hedgefunder is at the centre of a  row with his neighbour over plans for a bowling alley in his $23 million townhouse.
Gregg Hymowitz had been excavating the basement of his  Upper East Side home to make way for the new facility.
But Hemant and Varsha Shah claim the digging has damaging their neighbouring property, and say they are now facing a $5million bill for repairs.
A judge has reportedly slapped Hymowitz with a temporary restraining order, according to the Daily Post .
The ruling has stopped all work on the bowling alley until a full hearing can take place at Manhattan Supreme Court.
The Shah's $42 million home was built in 1903 for stockbroker Henry Goldschmid
In court papers they claim the work to Hymowitz's basement has caused the foundations of their 22 room home to shift.
They also alleged that it has caused their basement to fill with water and cracks to appear in the walls and floor of their home.
As a result the Shah's were said to have called in their own structural engineer to their 64th Street home.
It is alleged that the engineer noticed that the excavation of Hymowitz's basement appeared different to the plans submitted in 2013.
The Shah's had been planning to sell their century-old home, which features 10 fireplaces, but have now been forced to pull it off the market, according to the Daily Post.

Former British number one tennis player Greg Rusedski, who has attacked the BBC for sidelining John Inverdale in its Wimbledon coverage
Tennis ace Greg Rusedski has launched a surprise attack on the BBC over its decision to sideline John Inverdale during this years Wimbledon coverage.
The former BBC pundit, 41, branded it a mistake for the corporation to axe Inverdale, 57, from his 14-year run fronting the nightly round-up of the tournaments action.
Once ranked number one in Britain and number four in the world, Rusedski said the highlights programme wont be the same without Inverdales expertise and experience.
And he is reserving judgment on whether the BBCs new highlights show  with Clare Balding, 44, at the helm  will be a success.
Rusedski, who was speaking at the BNP Paribas Tennis Classic at the Hurlingham Club, said: I think John did a great job anchoring the BBCs nightly Wimbledon coverage and now that he has been removed from his role, it wont be the same without him.
Its unfortunate but I guess the people at the BBC want a different formula and Clare Balding is going to be doing her show.
It will be interesting to see how it goes and I just dont know until I see it  to see if it will work. But Clare did a fabulous job at Wimbledon and the rowing.
Once one of the most prominent figures at Wimbledon for the BBC, Inverdale has found himself increasingly sidelined following the furore over his sexist comments about Marion Bartoli during the 2013 tournament, when he told an interviewer: I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker.You are never going to be somebody like a Sharapova.

Happy campers: Margaret Biggs, 77, and Joanne Croxford, 32, who are serving up tea and cake at Glastonbury
They make an unlikely pair of festival-goers  and an even more unlikely advertisement for the Womens Institute.
But great-grandmother Margaret Biggs and tattooed former drug addict Joanne Croxford are sharing a tent at Glastonbury as they attempt to shake off the WIs fusty image by serving tea and homemade cake to hungry revellers.
The organisation, traditionally better known for knitting, jam and Jerusalem, has set up a stall at the Somerset festival for the first time in a bid to recruit younger members.
For 77-year-old Mrs Biggs, who has been a WI member for 40 years, its an opportunity to sleep in a tent for the first time and sample her first Pot Noodle.
And for Miss Croxford, 32, its a chance to give something back to the organisation she says helped her recover from an addiction to drugs such as ecstasy  as well as inspiring some of her inkings.
She now has a number of tattoos based on the core values of the WI, including a teapot, gardening motifs and the wartime slogan of the institute, For home and country.
Miss Croxford, from Cambridge, said: This organisation really has been fundamental to my recovery. For the first time in my life I feel like I belong somewhere.
I fell into drugs when I moved to London aged 18. I took a lot of party drugs to fit in. Then I started working in the fashion industry and used drugs to lose weight.
Now Ive been clean for five years. A big part of that has been the WI. I joined when I lost both of my nans in quite quick succession and wanted to reconnect with that generation.
Now I would say 98 per cent of my friends are other members. Its a fantastic support network. Im friends with a 92-year-old and we have things in common.

	WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Chanttelle Ward, 19, from South Shields is trying to rebuild her life after being attacked by ex-boyfriend Rhys Culley, 24, at her home in February 2014.

'I was physically and mentally abused by my ex. He wouldn't let me wear certain clothes or speak to certain people, I couldn't wear make-up, it was silly things like that which I didn't realise were classed as domestic violence.'
Chanttelle (pictured left) when she was in a relationship withRhys Culley (right). He would control what she wore  and eventually physically attacked her
The teenager was left covered in blood after Culley bit her upper lip. He was found guilty of wounding with intent
In November jurors atNewcastle Crown Court heard how shopfitter Culley attacked Chanttelle in a jealous rage when she tried to leave him last year.
He bit down on her lip with the same force that would be needed to bite through a 1cm-thick piece of rubber.
Shocking pictures of Chantelle's blood splattered face and the stitches she needed helped jurors find Culley guilty ofwounding with intent after he pleaded his innocence.
Chanttelle said she needed counselling to recover and she remains self-conscious about the scars she has been left with.

Chanttelle now wishes she had left Culley earlier, but she didn't realise she was a victim of domestic abuse despite the mental abuse she received
She told presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid this morning: 'He tried to bite my top lip off and it knocked my confidence. I have been left with two scars on my top lip and had to go to counselling for a year to get over the depression. I am trying to rebuild my life now.'
Chanttelle said she wishes she had recognised his behaviour was unacceptable before it was 'too late'.
Chanttelle said the scars have made her self-conscious and she was surprised when she was selected to take part in a beauty pageant
She spoke out on the breakfast TV show as figures released today show that a record number of people in England and Wales are being convicted of violent crimes against women.
There have been increases in the number of successful prosecutions for sexual offences and domestic violence cases, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) figures for 2014-15.
In total, some 107,104 defenders who committed violence against women and girls were prosecuted during this time-frame, a rise of 18.3% on the previous year.
Sarah Green, acting director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'The increase in prosecutions shows that more women are seeking justice with big increases, for example, in the number of rape prosecutions.
'If as a society we really care about ensuring justice for survivors, we should do everything in our power to try to prevent abuse in the first place. This has to start in schools, with compulsory sex and relationships education to give young people the chance to talk about respectful relationships.
'The CPS report includes figures on the alarmingly young age of many defendants in rape prosecutions. This is a call to urgent action.'
The report showed  the highest ever conviction rates for domestic abuse (68,601), rape (2,581), sexual offences (7,591), honour-based violence (129) and child abuse (7,469), with more than 10,000 additional defendants convicted for domestic abuse.
There was a 15 per cent rise in stalking and harassment prosecutions to over 12,000, and of these 1,103 prosecutions were commenced under the new stalking offences.
Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, believed today's report was 'really good news for the victims of these dreadful crimes'.
She said: 'Where cases meet the Code for Crown Prosecutors, we will not shy away from taking cases forward, even when they are difficult and complex.
Chanttelle (pictured before the attack) is feeling like her old, confident self thanks to being selected to represent Sunderland in the Miss North East beauty pageant
Culley of South Shields (pictured during his trial) was jailed for eight years last November
'Of course, this additional volume of violence against women and girls work brings challenges for prosecutors not only in terms of numbers, but the type of cases we are seeing - prosecutors across England and Wales are telling me that we are seeing more non-recent child sexual abuse cases and more of the particularly complex rape cases coming forward.
'Anyone who is a victim of these crimes should feel encouraged by this news and confident that they will be believed when reporting these crimes.'
Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid, said: 'Today's report demonstrates that significant progress has been made in taking more cases of domestic violence through the criminal justice system. This is positive.
'This progress must continue until we have a system where women who experience domestic violence have exactly the same level of confidence as victims of other crimes, that they are heard and believed, the system works for them and protects their human right to live free from violence.'

During the 5.4million eight-month long inquiry, which examined the relationship between the Press and the public, police and politicians, Lord Justice Leveson heard evidence from 224 witnesses.
Part one of the inquiry examined the culture, practices and ethics of the press and the relationship between the press and the public, police and politicians.
Lord Leveson's report (pictured) into Press standards -ore than 250,000 of taxpayers' money spent on lawyers during the inquiry
Part two cannot begin until current police investigations and any criminal proceedings have been completed.
Last night Andy Silvester, campaign director from the Taxpayers Alliance, said: Taxpayers will be left wondering what this expensive inquiry actually achieved, other than lining the pockets of lawyers and putting plenty of innocent journalists in the dock.
The Cabinet Office has refused to name the individuals in receipt of the taxpayer-funded advice.
It raised questions over whether former ministers including Tony Blair - who had his legal advice paid for on the Chilcot Inquiry - received the financial support for their legal advice.

	Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin yesterday announced a major u-tun on a major part of the Tories election manifesto admitting that they will not be able to go through with a £38bn Network Rail modernisation plan.
      </Description>

The Conservatives election manifesto had pledged: We will transform our railway network. We will invest 38billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme.
The decision to pull the plug on rail schemes in the North and the Midlands, while keeping HS2 and London projects such as Crossrail untouched, puts the Tories rhetoric in doubt. Mr McLoughlin told the Commons that the five-year rail improvement plan needed to be reset because it was now costing more and taking longer. He said electrification work was being paused on the Midland main line between London and Sheffield  where hundreds of millions has already been spent on preparatory work  and on the trans-Pennine Leeds-Manchester route.
The 38.5bn plan is being shelved, while the proposed 50bn HS2, artists impression, will continue
It is understood that the London Crossrail project will also remain unscathed from the planned review

The aim is to keep Network Rails spending within its funding allowance, so that electrification of the Great Western line can be prioritised. Mr McLoughlin announced a shake-up of Network Rail management with the chairman  and former Ford boss  Richard Parry-Jones stepping down.
He will be replaced next month by Londons colourful transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy.
None of Network Rails executive directors will receive a bonus for the past year, Mr McLoughlin said. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne  who will keep his job  admitted they had been overly optimistic about meeting targets.
Labour said the Government knew the scale of the crisis before the election but sought to keep a lid on it to avoid damaging headlines.
In the Commons, Labour transport spokesman Michael Dugher told Mr McLoughlin: You spent the election campaign repeating promises you knew you would break. Ministers may try to shift all the blame to Network Rail, but this happened on the Governments watch.
MP Clive Betts told Radio 4s PM programme: It has been becoming apparent over the past year that costs were going up and timescales were slipping, yet the Government kept this under wraps until after the election.
John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: This has been covered up for some time. There is a lot of anger that so many people have been misled by all this rubbish about the northern powerhouse. A lot of Tory MPs have been elected under false pretences.
Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said: There have been clear signs since Christmas that Government is losing patience. And had it not been for a desire to avoid controversial headlines in the run-up to a General Election, the odds are that Network Rail would have been reformed by now in ways it may not have welcomed. There was suppressed Government fury at New Year, following the engineering embarrassments at Kings Cross and Paddington. But pre-election politics ensured a calm face.
Asked whether ministers knew before the election that the scheme was under threat, David Camerons official spokesman did not deny that this was the case. However, a Department of Transport spokesman said: Its not something the Secretary of State has kept hidden.
Tory backbenchers were angry that HS2 was not being cut. Former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan said: I have always been worried that major projects such as HS2 would suck the life out of other areas.
If these projects are undeliverable now, what does that mean to the HS2 in a few years time. Will that become undeliverable too?
Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: We have been promised time and time again that the money being pumped into HS2 would not affect the delivery of other infrastructure projects, but its clear that it is now cannibalising the rest of the railway budget and other upgrades with far more robust business plans are being shelved.
The 650,000 boss with a taste for kimonos and call girls: Colourful past of London transport chief tasked with rescuing Britain's rail network
By SAM GREENHILL
He has been credited with keeping Londons transport moving over the past decade.
But Sir Peter Hendy has also been caught up in a scandal that threatened to derail his private life.
Two years ago a 140-an-hour prostitute claimed she had a torrid affair with the 62-year-old transport supremo.
Rachael Grundy said she had a nine-month relationship with Sir Peter, a close ally of London Mayor Boris Johnson, while he masterminded the travel strategy for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Rachael Grundy, right, who is a 140-an-hour prostitute, claims she had an affair with Peter Hendy, left
Sir Peter, left, is a close associate of Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is also now a Tory MP
Miss Grundy, 42, claimed he contacted her in November 2011 through an escort website. We hit it off immediately, she said.
According to Miss Grundy, he began booking her every week and she regularly stayed the night at Sir Peters London pied-a-terre in Pimlico while his wife was in the West Country.
Before long, they fell in love and she stopped charging him by the hour, but he still gave her money, she said.
He also gave her four Oyster travel passes worth 10 each and a London 2012 badge. She later remarked: He definitely wasnt very romantic when it came to gifts.
She was left heartbroken when Sir Peter dumped her after his wife Sue, 60, found out about their fling.
Sir Peter declined to comment about the affair, except to deny spending any public money on Miss Grundy.
He recently famously branded Britains commuter trains awful and like the Wild West. Yesterday, as he was put in charge of Britains rail network, there were plenty of long-suffering commuters hoping he may hold the ticket to making their daily journeys more comfortable.
Sir Peter, pictured, refused to comment on the affair, only to confirm that no public money was used

Sir Peter, pictured, earns a taxpayer-funded salary of more than 650,000 and has a house in Bath
He has run Londons complex transport system since 2006. As Transport for Londons commissioner, he is credited with overseeing many improvements and his efforts resulted in a knighthood in 2013.
Sir Peter is familiar with the rail network outside the capital, too, having spent the past ten years travelling regularly between London and the 1.5million Georgian villa in Bath he shares with his wife, an HR consultant and the mother of his two children.
Unlike the squashed-in masses, however, the multi-millionaire enjoys free first class travel  a generous perk earned as a result of an earlier job as a London Transport manager. A colourful character, Sir Peter once took the Tube to work wearing slippers and an elaborate oriental silk dressing gown to help raise money for Comic Relief.
Sir Peter, whose taxpayer-funded salary and bonuses at TfL total more than 650,000, is happy to emphasise his working-class credentials. He sometimes turned up to London Assembly meetings in a bus workers high-visibility jacket and loves to speak in a gravelly Cockney accent  to the amusement of his former classmates at a top public school, Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. And even though his father was a communist firebrand, his mother was the daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford.
The Honourable Mary Best ran away from her familys ancestral home in Dorset and married electrician Jack Hendy. A Communist Party activist and leading member of the Electrical Trades Union, he was caught up in a ballot-rigging scandal and, although cleared by the courts, was banned for life from the union. He studied for a law degree at night school and became a barrister.
Sir Peter has been keen to portray his career as a rags-to-riches rise from lowly London bus conductor to self-made millionaire and transport supremo.
But, having studied economics at Leeds University, he actually began in 1975 as a fast-track graduate trainee with London Transport, which involved a few weeks work experience as a conductor as well as learning how to drive a bus.
He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a 34million management buyout in 1995  and his stake was worth 4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for 54million.
Although appointed as commissioner by Red Ken Livingstone, a close ally, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson. At one point he concluded: Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken. He also noted: I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, Im not sure Im more Left-leaning than he is.
ALEX BRUMMER: After this shambles HS2 can now be no more than a dream
During the General Election campaign, we heard much from Chancellor George Osborne about building a Northern Powerhouse, and plans for exciting investment in Britains Victorian infrastructure  but little about how it would be delivered.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Greens were mocked for commitments to renationalise all or parts of Britains creaking rail network.
Now, the truth has been revealed. The running of Network Rail  which owns and operates our railways  has been a shambles, electrification of key routes is way behind schedule and is having to be postponed or even cancelled, and the Tory government is being forced to take direct control of the network.
Former Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, pictured, created Network Rail on a not-for-profit basis in 2001 and created an ungainly board including unions, passengers and green groups with weak governance
The Government has been forced to abandon the electrification of the TransPennine Express, pictured
Passengers were left stranded last Christmas when engineering works overran causing chaos
The largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times was at the heart of the Conservatives long-term plan to secure Britains economic future, to improve productivity and growth. That part of the plan now looks to be in serious trouble, and it is difficult to see how it can easily be rescued at a time when state spending is under pressure.
The real scandal is that the slide into chaos of the Governments promised 38.5billion investment programme must have been known to civil servants and the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin before the country went to the polls on May 7, but not a word crossed anyones lips.
Instead, the nation was treated to a naively optimistic view of a nation determined to revitalise rail travel. Plans included electrification of the TransPennine Express running between Manchester, Leeds and York; improvements of the Midland mainline linking London and Sheffield, and most significantly of all, the vanity HS2 project  estimated to cost up to 42.5billion.
As a result of the new announcements by McLoughlin, several of the key projects are being paused and mothballed, and there must be real questions as to whether the highly contentious HS2 should be, or will be, undertaken.
The immediate trigger for the Governments shake-up of Network Rail is the mayhem that has been endured by passengers. This was symbolised by the engineering works at Kings Cross station that overran during the last Christmas break, forcing passengers of the East Coast, Thameslink &amp; Great Northern lines to use inadequate Finsbury Park station in North London, which became dangerously over-crowded.

There have to be real questions over whether the HS2, artists impression, will ever go ahead
The holiday season pandemonium is just a microcosm of what many rail travellers have to suffer every day, with standing room only, unexplained delays and replacement bus services, and fares that rise inexorably despite the big taxpayer subsidies.
At the root of these problems was the then Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers decision in 2001 to place Railtrack into administration and replace it with a not-for-profit new firm Network Rail, run by an ungainly board of members drawn from all sections of society, from the trades unions to passengers and green groups.
The bizarre structure made for weak governance, which saw rail chieftains rewarding themselves like captains of industry but failing miserably to deliver the services the public craved. Labour eventually had to pay compensation to the Railtrack shareholders.
The impossible governance structure allowed the top brass at Network Rail to enjoy riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Chief executive Mark Carne has a base salary of 675,000 and was forced to forgo a bonus of 135,000 for 2014 (a sum almost equal to the Prime Ministers pay of 142,500) after the Christmas chaos. He is just one of a bunch of Network Rail executives whose pay, bonuses and pensions hover around the 1million mark.
This is nothing compared to the pay of some of the operating companies, with David Brown of Go-Ahead group which runs London-Midland, Southern and South-Eastern, earning a shade under 2million.
One of the immediate results of the changes just unveiled is that finally, after years of dissatisfaction with the way in which Network Rail has been governed, the byzantine structure is being abolished forthwith.
Instead, there is to be rule from Whitehall, with the former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown being parachuted in as Special Director of Network Rail and reporting directly to the Transport Secretary. Brown will work alongside the colourful Sir Peter Hendy, the new Network Rail chairman, who is credited with running the London Underground on time during the Olympics.
What is absolutely clear from the changes and the review that has been unveiled is that under the chairmanship of Richard Parry-Jones, who is to step down, Network Rail lost control of the costs of one of the governments most high-profile infrastructure projects.
As chief executive, Mark Carne admits the projects which Network Rails been charged with delivering are going to take longer and cost more than we originally thought.
The Governments promise to spend 38.5 billion on railways over five years does not seem to be at risk. What will be affected is the ambition to create a 21st-century electrified rail system to empower the North of England and improve the links with the capital.
Whatever the outcome of the Governments review  it is promising decisions by the autumn  the imbroglio raises huge questions over the future of the HS2 project, connecting London to Manchester and running through some of Britains most unspoiled landscaped in the Chilterns; and HS3, designed to go East-West across the North of England connecting Manchester to Hull.
If the relatively simple task of modernising and electrifying some of the busiest rail links in the country cannot be achieved  despite a generous infrastructure budget  then the high-speed projects can be no more than a pipedream.
As for long-suffering commuters and business travellers, the pain of rail travel will continue.
Direct control from Whitehall may be an improvement on the old Network Rail, but it cannot be the right long-term solution. Until the private enterprise disciplines of cost controls, efficient engineering and delivery of projects on time are brought to the rail network, the taxpayer will not get value for money.

	A petition calling for American Vogue's editor Anna Wintour to apologise for an article that suggests the supermodel's attraction to women could be a 'phase' has attracted more than 12,500 signatures.

Miss Delevingne also discussed the struggles she had faced while coming to terms with her bisexuality, something that many young men and women will be able to relate to.
In the interview she said: 'I think that being in love with my girlfriend is a big part of why I'm feeling so happy with who I am these days.
'It took me a long time to accept the idea [of being gay], until I first fell in love with a girl at 20 and recognized that I had to accept it.
'But I have erotic dreams only about men...The thing is 'if I ever found a guy I could fall in love with, I'd want to marry him and have his children.'
In the July 2015 issue, author of the piece, Rob Haskell, paraphrased the model claiming that her family believe the bisexuality is nothing more than a phase.
Haskell wrote for Vogue : 'Her parents seem to think girls are just a phase for Cara, and they may be correct.'
The interview appeared in the July issue of US Vogue, which featured Cara, 22, as its cover star
In the interview written by Rob Haskell, it was also suggested that Cara only formed relationships with women as a result of childhood trauma

He continued: 'When I suggest to Cara that to trust a man, she might have to revise an old and stubborn idea of hers - that women are perennially troubled and therefore only women will accept her - her smile says she concedes the point.'
Care2 petition author Julie Rodriguez says it's wrong of Haskell to equate same-sex relationships with childhood trauma or to characterise it as a phase.
Those signing the petition are hoping to catch the attention of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour
She said: 'The idea that queer women only form relationships with other women as a result of childhood trauma is a harmful (and false) stereotype that lesbian and bisexual women have been combating for decades.
'How could Vogue's editorial staff greenlight this article and publish it without anyone raising concerns about this dismissive and demeaning language?'
Many of those who have signed the Care2 petition added comments next to their signatures:
James Ferguson wrote: 'Dear Vogue, I have been in a queer 'phase' for the entire 50 years of my life. I think it is much more than a phase for millions of us.
'And I would have thought that you would know better than to perpetuate such dismissive, demeaning, and harmful stereotypes. I am deeply disappointed and believe a full, prominent apology is the very least that you can do for your readership.'
Robert Wallace added: 'My daughter is gay and it is NOT a phase; it is an integral part of who she is and I love and accept her, for who she is!'
Michelle Sorensen said: 'As a longtime subscriber to Vogue, I am very disappointed in the lack of empathy and care that Rob Haskell shows in his interview with Cara DeLevingne.
'Surely Mr. Haskell is a better listener, interviewer, and writer than this piece of his demonstrates. Vogue has made efforts to support the LGBT community; however, allowing this article to go to print makes me question how sincere this support is on their behalf.
'Vogue, please apologize for publishing such a careless and offensive piece in your pages. Thank you.'
A  Vogue spokesperson declined to comment.
MailOnline has also contacted MissDelevingne's representatives for comment.

We are happy to make clear that the judgment in fact weighed the childrens rights against the seriousness of Bishops offences and not against the victims rights.
A graphic accompanying a news item published in one edition yesterday wrongly stated that the cost of Prince Harrys 2014 visit to Brazil and Chile was 185,626. In fact, as the article itself stated, the trip cost 85,626.

	Mark Rouse, 48, of Southsea, Hampshire, who dodged paying for a permit for up to six months, has been jailed for 16 weeks for making the fake copy of a temporary permit he was given.

When it expired after six weeks he did not qualify for a free permanent permit as the Citroen C4 car he drove was not registered in his name.
Instead of buying 90p-a-day visitor permits which would have allowed him to continue to park on the street, Rouse made a fake permit on his computer using his expired temporary one as a template.
But the forgery was spotted by a parking officer and Rouse was confronted at his home by a council investigator, at which point he admitted using the counterfeit permit for up to six months.
Rouse admitted to one offence under the Fraud Act 2006, and one under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on June 17.
Councillor Ken Ellcome, cabinet member for traffic and transportation, said: 'Residents of many streets in Portsmouth value their permits because they mean it's possible to park near their homes.
'Forging a pass is an attempt to cheat the system and claim a parking space that is not yours - stopping other people using it. I hope the sentence will deter other potential fraudsters.'

AndCouncillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who has previously campaigned against charges being introduced for parking permits in the city, told MailOnline: 'Parking is a real problem in Portsmouth.
'Therefore if people are not playing by the rules, then people get really upset about that. If there are rules, people need to stick to them.'
But some local residents were angered by the length of the sentence.Gary Claus said: 'Is it just me or does anyone else think this is an unnecessarily harsh sentence considering much worse crimes often go with a lesser sentence?'
And Lloyd Chappell added: 'If you look at today's court round up with the crimes committed and sentences given, this is plainly ridiculous. I'm gobsmacked. This has to be overturned.'

However, RAC head of external affairs Pete Williams told MailOnline: 'Although on the face of it the sentence might appear harsh, the actions of this individual are classed as fraud which can carry very heavy sentences. Motorists, take note.'
Last night, neighbours of Rouse came to his defence. Stephen Ayub, 53, who runs a boat yard, said: 'I think it is a bit harsh to jail him.
'It is hardly the biggest crime in the world  we are talking about parking. There are plenty of people who do not get jailed for things like stealing and vandalism.'
Lloyd Chappell added: 'If you look at today's court round-up with the crimes committed and sentences given, this is plainly ridiculous.
'I'm gobsmacked. This has to be overturned.'
Trevor King, 53, an engineer, said: 'I have lived here for some time and I like being by the shops  but the parking is annoying.
'The shoppers will try all the side roads before they go to the supermarket's car park.
'Now the council are talking about making you pay for the permit for your first car, which is free at the moment, when you live in an area where you cannot guarantee a parking space.'

For a time he acted at The Windsor Repertory Theatre, in London's West End, and went on tours in Germany and the United States.
He also accepted some minor film roles, including that of Young Marley in Alastair Sim's classic version of A Christmas Carol.
Early in 1950 he was invited to travel to Canada by friend David Greene, a director friend at CBC in Toronto, and he left England within 48 hours to work overseas.
Despite his typically English exteriror, Macnee actually spent a large part of his adult life working in the U.S., taking minor roles on American TV shows.
He only returned to the UK in the 1960s in order to take on his defining role as John Steed as The Avengers began shooting in London.
Macnee's character appeared in all but two episodes, accompanied by a string of beautiful women who were his sidekicks.
Macnee was educated at Eton and served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, which turned out to be perfect preparation for the part of John Steed - who was also supposed to have studied at Eton, and fought against the Nazis
While Macnee's co-stars  (pictured here with Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt in The New Avengers) often used guns, John Steed never wielded a weapon and was known for his skill with an umbrella
Despite being a sex symbol, Macnee said he missed missed most of the Swinging Sixties due to being locked in a studio filming from 5.30am to 9.30pm five days a week
Patrick Macnee sits on international film festival jury
The most popular was likely Diana Rigg, who played sexy junior agent Emma Peel from 1965 to 1968. Honor Blackman played Catherine Gale from 1962 to 1964, and Linda Thorson was Tara King from 1968 to 1969.
In his final interview in The Lady magazine, he was asked which of the three he found the most appealing.
He replied: 'The very first thing you learn if you're a gentleman is that you never compare one woman to another. That's the way of all death.
'You get a big pointed high heel in your groin and you'll never walk again!'
However, in a follow-up interview in 2010 he was rather less discreet, saying:Honor was adorable. She was the most beautiful of them all.
'A gorgeous blonde with the biggest breasts youve ever seen and beneath them the beautiful athletic body of a runner.
Of Diane Rigg, he said: She was probably one of the best actresses.She made The Avengers the enormous success it was because she was in the first episodes made for American TV when they hadnt seen a woman in a skintight leather catsuit throwing men around.
Linda Thorson was a great actress with a great body but she arrived just as The Avengers was losing its appeal.
Macnee was married three times and first tied the knot aged 19 toBarbara Douglas, with whom he had two children. He went on to marryCatherine Woodville (pictured) andBaba Majos de Nagyzsenye
Sir Roger Moore has led tributes to Macnee, saying:'So very sad to hear Pat MacNee has left us. We were mates from the 1950s and I have so many happy memories of working with him. A true gent'
Speaking about his role as a surprise Sixties sex symbol, he added:  I missed so much of the Swinging Sixties by working.
From 1961 to 1969 I got up at 4.30am, a car came for me at 5.30am and I was taken to our studio at Teddington or Elstree and we filmed until I got home at 9.30pm, five days a week.
'I spent most of the Sixties in a giant shed filming even though I lived around the corner from the Kings Road in Chelsea.
After the original show finished in 1969, Macnee became a frequent guest on television talk shows around the world, famed for his traditional British humour and intelligence.
He went on to star in Bond film A View To A Kill alongside Roger Moore, as well as The Howling and The Sea Wolves, which Moore also starred in.
Author and playwright Bonnie Greer added: 'When I was a kid, some folks were 'one of us' - Leonard Nimoy and Patrick Macnee. Dude of dudes. RIP Patrick Macnee.'
Goodness Gracious Me actor Sanjeev Bhaskar paid a warm tribute to Macnee on Twitter, saying: 'RIP Patrick Macnee. The Avengers also warm and wonderful foil to Sir Roger Moore in several films and Spinal Tap. Epitome of the British Gent.'
After The Avengers, Macnee continued to appear on stage and screen, starring opposite Roger Moore in James Bond movie A View To A Kill
Raised in Lambourn, Berkshire, Macnee spent the last 40 years of his life at his home in Coachella Valley in California, where he died today with his family by his bedside
He took a turn on stage in Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth, which saw him take off on an international tour, and also penned two books based on The Avengers, alongside an autobiography.
In the 70s he returned to television in order to reprise the character of John Steed in The New Avengers, alongside Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt.
He guest-starred and played continuing roles in numerous American, British and Australian television productions.
He recorded numerous audio books, including thirteen Jack Higgins titles, and voice-over narrations for the four hour mini-series 'America at War in Color' and many others.
Musing on life during an interview five years ago, aged 88, Macnee said: Im not afraid of death. Whats to fear? Once youre dead, thats it. Nothing.
'I dont believe in heaven or hell. Thats baloney. What matters is the here and now. Yes, Im 88 and there are things I cant do: I cant run a race or climb Everest. But isnt life magnificent?
He was married three times but pre-deceased by all his wives. He is survived by two children and one grandchild.

By contrast, only 5,460 or four per cent of students had ended up in these menial elementary occupations six months after graduating in 2007.
In 2013/14, 68 per cent of employed graduates were in professional jobs such as working as managers, directors, senor officials and in technical occupations.
Graduates are also faced with earning an average salary of just 21,500 after leaving university, despite courses now costing 9,000-per-year (file image)
The average salary six months after graduation was 21,500.
Frances OGrady, general secretary of the TUC, yesterday attacked the poor job prospects for some graduates.
He said: For many university leavers, the prospect of finding a job that matches their talents is gloomy.
Despite paying huge amounts to get a higher education, many are being forced to take on lower-skilled jobs, which is in turn pushing those who dont have a degree out of the labour market altogether.
Young people are simply not getting the opportunities they deserve. If we don t create better jobs for graduates we wont be able to build the higher-skilled workforce the UK desperately needs to boost productivity and compete with other countries.
The governments economic plan is failing to solve this career gridlock, but action is urgently needed. Bemoaning the lack of decent graduate jobs is becoming an annual event.
A report warned last year that the growing number of workers who are over-qualified for their role is largely the result of a huge expansion in univeunrsity education.
The centre-left think-tank the Institute for Public Policy research (IPPR) said the number of high-skilled jobs has not kept pace with the rate at which workers are becoming more highly qualified.
School-leavers would be better prepared for the job market by doing an apprenticeship instead of racking up huge debts at university, the report claimed.

	Two-thirds of hay fever sufferers also battle symptoms at NIGHT

	As pollen levels peak this weekend, experts warn people who suffer from what pharmacists have labelled ‘insneezia’ to close their windows at night.

Whilst its impossible to avoid grass and other pollens, if you are taking the right preventer medicines  you should be able to manage day-to-day without getting any asthma symptoms.
But she added: If you are wheezing, coughing, waking at night or feel tightness in your chest now then you need to speak to your GP or asthma nurse.
Some 18million people in Britain have hayfever.
Research by Boots suggests 64 per cent find their symptoms affect their sleep.
When pollen levels peak, experts warn people who suffer from what pharmacists have labelled insneezia to close their windows at night
In a poll of 2,080 sufferers, the average sleep loss was 72 minutes of sleep each night when pollen levels are high.
Boots pharmacist Angela Chalmers said: Falling pollen at night doesnt have to get in the way of a good nights sleep if you take steps to keep your hayfever symptoms in check before your head hits the pillow.
Most one-a-day anti-histamines are usually a 24-hour dose, so taking your daily dose at least three hours before you go to bed may help reduce symptoms throughout the night.
The NHS advises that people keep windows shut at night and first thing in the morning, and also suggests sufferers stay indoors as much as they can when the pollen count is high.
Despite the impending misery, Dr Emberlin, speaking on behalf of Opticrom Hayfever Eye Drops, said there are steps hayfever sufferers can take to ease their symptoms...
KNOW YOUR ALLERGY TRIGGERS
Dr Emberlin, said: 'It helps to know your allergy triggers.
'Keep a diary with notes about when and where your symptoms occur.
Experts advise trying to avoid going out when the pollen count is high if you suffer from hayfever
'Match it against a pollen calendar to see what is in the air.
'Most people who have hay fever in the summer months are allergic to grass pollen but you could be reacting to pollen from summer flowering trees, weeds or crops.
'Also you could be allergic to fungal spores that can be in the air on dry or damp days.'
AVOID GOING OUTSIDE WHEN THE POLLEN COUNT IS HIGH
Experts advise trying to avoid going out when the pollen count is high.
Dr Emberlin told MailOnline: 'On dry warm days grass pollen counts are highest from early to mid morning and from mid to late afternoon.
'This is when most grasses release their pollen. In the middle part of the day convection currents mix the air and dilute concentrations.'
DON'T CUT THE LAWN
Dr Emberlin, said a top tip is to avoid cutting the lawn, or failing that, get someone else to take on the chore for you.
'Although the short grass on lawns will probably not flower and release pollen, the sap from the cut grass will form aerosols containing grass allergens which could trigger your hay fever,' she said.
WEAR SUNGLASSES
'If you have problems with itchy and runny eyes, wear wrap round sunglasses to help keep pollen out of the eyes,' Dr Emberlin said.
'Wash eyes frequently especially after being outdoors, and use anti allergy eye drops to alleviate the symptoms.'
'Alcohol in excess will suppress the immune system and can make symptoms worse,' Dr Emberlin said.
PACK YOUR DIET WITH VITAMIN C
A healthy diet can help ease symptoms, Dr Emberlin told MailOnline.
She said: 'Aim to have a healthy diet with a high intake of vitamins especially C and D as these are thought to be beneficial for hay fever sufferers.
'Avoid drying washing outdoors on high pollen count days. The washing acts as an air filter collecting the pollen which will then be brought indoors.'
AVOID TOO MUCH ALCOHOL
'Alcohol in excess will suppress the immune system and can make symptoms worse,' Dr Emberlin said.
Other notable triggers, include dairy food, which increase mucus secretion.
And air pollution especially from vehicles and cigarette smoke is known to cause irritation to the airways and eyes and make the symptoms worse.
In addition, Dr Emberlin told MailOnline swimming in indoor pools can make symptoms worse because the chlorine in the water can irritate the airways and eyes.
Stress and dehydration can also make symptoms worse, she warned.

And one in ten dont bother with a honeymoon at all, according to the survey by LateRooms.com.
Almost half of the 2,000 couples surveyed either stayed in the UK or ventured no further than the Continent for their break.
Almost half of the 2,000 couples surveyed either stayed in the UK or ventured no further than the Continent for their break
One in five said the pressures of work meant they didnt have time to go away for two weeks.
Meanwhile, 30 per cent said the fact they had to pay for their wedding  or contribute heavily to the cost  meant they couldnt afford an extravagant trip.
Almost half of UK newlyweds (49%) now either stay in the UK or venture no further than Europe for their post-marital mini-moon, the LateRooms.com study revealed.
By contrast, in 2005 the top honeymoon destinations for Britons were Hawaii, Tahiti, Fiji, St Lucia, Mexico, Jamaica and Anguilla.
LateRooms.com spokeswoman Andrea Tarpey said: With newlyweds footing more of the bill for their big day than ever before, and having greater demands on their time at work, were seeing couples embrace the mini-moon and taking shorter, less costly getaways closer to home.
With such a fantastic range of destinations on our doorstep, 32% of couples choose to head to Europe, whilst a growing number (17%) opt to stay in the UK to enjoy their first week as Mr and Mrs.
'Growing in popularity, some 20% will opt for an American mini-moon.
We understand the pressures of modern couples striving to achieve the perfect wedding day as well as the perfect honeymoon, which is why we launched weddingguestrooms.com to help brides and grooms provide a personalised site with the very best accommodation options for their guests.

	Ty Rees saves choking sister Star Tyack after watching St John Ambulance’s Chokeables advert

	Confronted by a choking toddler, other children might have panicked. But 12-year-old Ty Rees, from Tuffley in Gloucester, saved his little sister’s life after he remembered watching a first aid advert.

Ty called for his mother and her boyfriend Kevin Blackburn, who gave Star another back slap. Three 5p coins shot out of her mouth.
Miss Tyack, 38, of Tuffley, Gloucester, said: 'Ty was absolutely fantastic. He's a complete hero. He was so quick and so calm.
Ty remembered a recent advert (pictured) on how to stop a baby choking - and saved his little sister's life
Star Tyack (pictured with Ty) had swallowed some 5p coins, leaving her unable to breathe or make a sound
'In instances like this every second counts and what Ty did saved his sister's life.'
The ordeal happened on Tuesday after Star took the coins from her brother's rucksack.
Miss Tyack added: 'He literally screamed for help. I've never heard anything like it  my boyfriend and I were there in seconds but the fact he had already dislodged the coins when we got there was amazing.
'In the time we were getting there he did exactly what he should have  he started hitting her back. Then she cried. He saved her life.'
Following the ordeal Marie and Kev, 27, took Star to hospital to get her checked over, but she was fine and scans showed she had swallowed no more foreign objects.
The offending 5p coins which Star choked on
Miss Tyack said she made Ty watch the St John Ambulance 'Chokeables' video after his sister began walking, adding: 'When I showed it to him he said, 'I'm never going to be on my own with Star, so I don't need it'.
'But I told him he needed to watch it in case. He said that as soon as he saw Star choking the video just started playing in his head and he knew exactly what to do.
'He was amazingly brave and I just want to thank St John Ambulance for making the film that showed him how to save my little girl's life.'
Jim Jones, a training manager for St John Ambulance, said: 'Our video campaign was aimed at showing people what to do if a baby aged under 12 months was choking.
'But, while the techniques are different for older children and adults, the principles of how to save someone's life in that situation are similar.
'In an emergency, it is better to do something than do nothing and Ty delivered first aid when it mattered most.
'Incidents like this show why it is absolutely vital that every child learns the skills to save lives and St John Ambulance is campaigning hard to get first aid taught in every school.'

He told the audience: Let me tell you about my trouble with girls... three things happen when they are in the lab... You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticise them, they cry.
Sir Tim, who won a Nobel Prize in 2001, later said his comments were light-hearted. But he quit his honorary professorship at University College London after allegedly being told to resign or be sacked, leading him to feel he had been hung out to dry.
Resigned: Sir Tim Hunt has now quit his professorship at University College London
A leaked European Commission source backed up his account of the speech, saying it was warm and funny and that he said now seriously after his controversial comments to show they were intended as a joke. But Mrs St Louis, who lectures at City University in London, said yesterday: Whatever he said after now seriously, its still outrageous. He talks about women as girls... you make them cry, they fall in love with you, is he seriously saying that? Is that his own personal story? Why is he calling them girls? And then he goes on to advocate single-sex laboratories. Now seriously, is he thinking there should be single-sex laboratories?
On his return to the UK, Sir Tim resigned from roles at UCL, the Royal Society and the European Research Council. His wife said she was told by a senior UCL figure understood to be Dean of Life Sciences Geraint Rees  that he should resign or be sacked.
But yesterday a UCL source denied this version of events. They said there was little chance of Sir Tim being given his honorary professorship back, adding: I dont think reinstatements on the agenda and I dont think Sir Tim wants it.
Rather than his reinstatement, the [universitys governing council] is likely to discuss the issues about women in science and the coverage in the media, and how its been handled by UCL management. But what a mess it all is.

	It's would be easy to believe it was seven months since Clegg was in Government - but it's only been seven weeks and already he's transformed himself back into a humble  backbencher.

Yesterdays programme was a valedictory affair. Much of it consisted of presenter Nick Ferrari interviewing Mr Clegg but there were a couple of contributions from callers, plus a clip from Ukips Nigel Farage (good grief, this column feels cobwebbed). Old Farage, who is in fact barely 51, felt rather sorry for Mr Clegg and suspected he would have been cheerful not to have retained his Sheffield Hallam constituency. Mr Clegg retorted: There speaks a man who didnt win his seat.
Mr Clegg had to settle a 50 wager with presenter Ferrari (they had bet on the election result, Mr Clegg insisting he would retain his position). He handed over some cash yesterday but it was not clear if that had entirely cleared the debt.
The Lib Dem leadership had realised about ten days before the election that voters were fleeing to the Tories. Yet no one in the Clegg camp had foreseen the size of the defeat. I was pretty blindsided by the exit poll, said Mr Clegg.
Call Clegg: The former Deputy Prime Minister made an appearance on radio with Nick ferrari, left, again this week on LBC where he used to answer questions every week on the show
Nick Clegg insists he has not destroyed his party
His words were peppered by checks and delay mechanisms, kindas and sort ofs and Californian uplifts. Sentences trailed away, left unfinished. Were these signs that he remains disorientated by the loss of high office? He could not remember whom he had first telephoned after the exit poll. And no, he had not reached for a strong drink. I dont sort of go for the bottle at moments like that.
For all this aw-shucks mateyness, the maddening Clegg, the Clegg who so often seemed hypocritical, was not far below the surface. He hoped the Tories would not govern to suit their own party advantage  this from a man who frequently blocked Whitehall reforms to suit the Lib Dems.
I miss taking decisions, said the ex-deputy PM who was a byword for inertia. In reference to child poverty targets, he said it is not acceptable to suddenly change the goalposts to suit yourself. This same Clegg tried to engineer electoral reform for personal advantage and then, in a tantrum, stopped the Tories reducing the number of seats and making constituencies fairer. Oh well.
He said he did not want to sound funereal and he was able to claim  as he always will be  that he helped to create a surprisingly stable government at a time of economic peril.
There was a human interest in this interview. It told us something about the personality of Mr Clegg, proud but tinged by sourness. Finally, did he still play tennis with David Cameron? No! he snapped, the answer coming as fast as an Andy Murray return of service.

However, the practice of gifting outfits to close friends can result in extremely mutually-agreeable publicity, such as when Amal wore another bespoke Stella McCartney outfit during her Venice wedding celebrations last year.
The all-white ensemble of wide-legged trousers, floppy hat, top and bag made headlines.

And there are times, such as at the 2014 Met Ball in New York, when the association is evidently commercial. Stella took a table at the event  costing 16,000 a plate  and her invited guests, including Rihanna, Reese Witherspoon and Cara Delevingne, acted as ambassadors for her fashion house.
Cara, nice shy girl that she is, posted an Instagram picture of her perfect rear in a pair of rather exclusive skin-tight white pants which had been monogrammed with her name by Stella.
Maccas daughter is a Met Ball aficionado. In previous years, shes invited the likes of actresses Cameron Diaz, Liv Tyler and Salma Hayek to the fundraiser. All turned up in her outfits.

In a role reversal, Stella dresses as a rock star and puts Madonna in a ladylike cream coat (1,220) at the VH1 Fashion awards in 1999
Close friend Gwyneth Paltrow also attended (in guess what?) in 2011. The actress went through a phase of wearing a lot of Stella McCartney when she was living in Belsize Park with Chris Martin.
For several years she and Stella hung out in London with Madonna. Theyd work out in Madonnas home gym with trainer Tracey Anderson every day and Stella even designed the singers stage costumes for a 2004 tour.
But the trio fell out over Madonnas parsimonious insistence that Gwyneth and Stella should pay to use her gym. The Material Girl hasnt been seen in a Stella McCartney dress since.
Another old friend is Kate Moss, who is a face of the Stella McCartney brand and star of its current advertising campaign.

As you might expect, shes quite often seen wearing Stella McCartney clothes  such as the Illusion bodysculpting dress which she wore in 2012.
Theres another designer with a musical past whos never been a friend: Victoria Beckham. In fact, theres talk of a bitchy rivalry.
Not that Stella will care too much  shes well known for a take-no-prisoners briskness in personal dealings.
And of course, her privileged status as the daughter of a Beatle also gave her the ability to network in the celebrity milieu like an absolute pro.

	BBC rewriting Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons is bonkers, TOM UTLEY writes

In the 1930 book, the child heroine was called Titty. In the cleaned-up version made by BBC Films, shes called Tatty.
Now, we can only guess what persuaded the screenplay writers or the Corporations executives to make the change. Did they seriously believe that Titty was too obscene a word to broadcast to an audience of youngsters? Surely not.
More likely, given what we know about the BBC, they thought it might be interpreted as belittling women  and would thereby upset feminists of the sort who spend their lives looking for reasons to be offended.
Another possibility, of course, is that they feared it would prompt childish snickering, which might distract young viewers attention from Ransomes wholesome tale of the outdoor life and derring-do.
But whatever the reason, I was interested to read that the BBC had made the same decision to change Tittys name before. This was for its 1963 television adaptation of Swallows And Amazons  although on that occasion it called her Kitty instead. As it happens, Tatty seems a more academically respectable choice than Kitty, since Ransome apparently based his character on a girl he knew, Mavis Altounyan, who took her nickname Titty from the childrens story, Titty Mouse And Tatty Mouse.
The BBC revealed their plans this week to rename one of the Walker siblings in Swallows And Amazons for its forthcoming adaptation of Arthur Ransomes classic adventure story
But, really, why on earth change the name at all? Back in 1963, the decision may have been just about understandable  at a pinch.
After all, this was two years before the theatre critic Kenneth Tynan earned the dubious (and disputed) distinction of becoming the first person to utter the F-word on TV. And all hell broke loose when he did.
But today? What conceivable point can there be in shielding children from such an innocent little word as Titty, in an age when they are bombarded with genuine filth every day of their lives?
Indeed, it sometimes seems that the F-word, in its various formations, is the only verb, noun or adjective in the vocabulary of many television dramatists, chefs or chat-show hosts and interviewees  while catch-up TV has made the 9pm watershed even less of a safeguard than ever.
Meanwhile, the internet has given todays Swallows And Amazons generation ready access to hardcore porn at its vilest  words and images that belittle, insult and objectify women a thousand times more grievously than any imaginary offence Ransome may have given to the sisterhood.
Yet here is Auntie Beeb  herself the purveyor of her fair share of F-words and X-rated scenes  pursing her lips over the possibility that youngsters may draw some connection between young Miss Walkers nickname and the female breast.
Well, there was always that risk. But then if Auntie is seriously worried that sniggering schoolboys may see sexual references where they are unintended, why doesnt she go the whole hog?
In this spirit of tit for tat, she should perhaps take her blue pencil to Countryfile, instructing its presenters to talk about blue tats, coal tats and great tats.
And what about changing the name of Dick, hero of Enid Blytons Famous Five, to something less likely to raise a puerile chuckle?
Come to that, I notice that Tittys brother remains Roger in the Corporations latest adaptation. Scope for a double-entendre there, surely. As for the former Shadow Chancellor, the BBC could always rename him Ed Bills. (And dont lets even mention P.G. Wodehouses Stiffy Pinker  let alone Ian Flemings Pussy Galore.)
Of course, this was not the first occasion this week when Auntie attracted ridicule for getting her knickers in a twist over a rude-sounding word.
A couple of days before the Titty debate broke out, BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin made a similar fool of herself  insulting her guest into the bargain  when she apologised on air for Alan Titchmarshs use of the words bastard trenching.
As seasoned gardeners will know, this is the traditional term to describe digging a trench to the depth of two spades, to increase soil drainage and aeration.
But to Minchin (or perhaps her bosses, hissing into her earpiece) it was a disgraceful profanity.
We just have to apologise, she said at the end of the interview, for some of the language used in the last couple of minutes.
Affectionate
Poor Titchmarsh (Tatchmarsh) was clearly mortified. Oh no, no, no, no, its a term in a gardening book, he said. I shant repeat it, but its not offensive at all'
Poor Titchmarsh (Tatchmarsh) was clearly mortified. Oh no, no, no, no, its a term in a gardening book, he said. I shant repeat it, but its not offensive at all.
As it happens, people in my trade often use the term bastard measure to describe the width of a line of type when it differs from that of the newspapers standard column. You see it, for example, when type snakes its way round a photograph.
Similarly, I see from the dictionary that the word has many other technical uses, none of them in the least bit pejorative. Bricklayers speak of bastard pointing, botanists of bastard mahogany, toadflax and indigo, while a grey sea turtle is known to marine biologists as the bastard Ridley.
There is surely a simple rule, here, which seems to have escaped the BBC: a word is offensive only when its used in an offensive sense. Thus, bastard is a very rude word when its used to describe someone we dont like  and even more so, when applied deliberately to a person whose parents are unmarried.
In the same way, Titty would indeed be derogatory and offensive if it were applied maliciously to a large-breasted woman.
As an affectionate nickname for a young girl, derived from the name of a mouse in a childrens story, it is utterly inoffensive.
So when BBC executives apologise for Alan Titchmarshs correct use of a gardening term, or change the name of a much-loved character in Swallows And Amazons, theyre not making a stand for decency or the rights of women.
Theyre just proving that, like me, they have dirty minds.
Could we start thinking of ways to protect children from the myriad modern influences that genuinely harm them  and stop fussing about nothing?

	The London Academy of Excellence in Stratford, East London, had more pupils score highly in two or more ‘difficult’ A-levels than private schools, some of whom charge over £30,000 a year.

A flagship free school in a deprived area has outperformed leading private rivals in the toughest A-level subjects.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said the sixth form college  which sent five pupils to Oxbridge  showed that rigorous academic education needn't and shouldn't be the preserve of the rich or lucky.
The London Academy of Excellence in Stratford, East London, had more pupils score highly in two or more difficult A-levels  such as maths, biology, chemistry and history  than Roedean, Marlborough College and Wellington College, which all charge more than 30,000 a year.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) said the sixth form college  which sent five pupils to Oxbridge  showed that rigorous academic education needn't and shouldn't be the preserve of the rich or lucky
Nicky Morgan shares plan to improve 3,500 schools in England
In the schools first A-levels last summer, 39 per cent of pupils achieved two As and a B including at least two tough subjects while Wellington College in Berkshire and Roedean in Brighton had 38 per cent and Wiltshires Marlborough College had 30 per cent.
Seventy-two students from The London Academy, which is in the borough of Newham, went to top universities  compared with 46 in the rest of the boroughs schools combined.
Mrs Morgan said: With teachers and parents in the driving seats, free schools are leading the way in inspiring children from disadvantaged areas to break down barriers and achieve their full potential.
We are opening 500 more free schools this Parliament, underlining our commitment to giving children from all walks of life access to a world-class education.
About 70 per cent of pupils at the free school are from ethnic minorities, mainly Bengali and Pakistani. Languages spoken include Bengali, Urdu and Arabic
About 70 per cent of pupils at the free school are from ethnic minorities, mainly Bengali and Pakistani. Languages spoken include Bengali, Urdu and Arabic.
About 30 per cent of pupils are eligible for free school meals. The school, which opened in 2012, was the brainchild of Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, and is supported by seven independent schools including Eton College, Caterham and Highgate.
Mr Cairns said he had the idea when talking to pupils at Kingsford Community School in Newham, a comprehensive where he is a governor, and sporty children said they wanted to join a football academy.
He said: I thought how wrong it was that those with sporting aspirations had a focus for their ambitions but there was no academy of excellence for those with academic aspirations.

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs revealed last night it had been forced to divert 45million of taxpayers' cash to fix the call centre chaos, which was branded 'woeful' and 'unacceptable' by tax experts. This will pay for 3,000 extra staff, who have been hastily recruited in the past month.
At peak times  including the end of the tax year in March  the taxman missed a third of calls. In January alone, more than a million callers hung up after being forced to wait on the line, which costs up to 40p a minute from mobiles.
Even if calls were answered, some people had to wait 40 minutes to speak to an adviser, experts said last night.
Paul Aplin, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: 'Telephone response times have been getting steadily worse and have reached totally unacceptable levels.
'It took me 40 minutes to get through earlier this week. It's good that HMRC has acknowledged the scale of the problem and that it has allocated 3,000 extra people to the task.
'But it's essential that this resource remains in place long-term. Until we see things improve, customers should look to use the online services instead wherever possible.'
'Woeful': Even if calls were answered, some people had to wait 40 minutes to speak to an adviser, experts said last night (file photo)
Tax expert George Bull, at Baker Tilly, added: 'Anyone who has tried to get through to the HMRC helpline in recent months will be relieved to hear that the department is taking steps to improve its woeful record on call handling.
'However, the problem is not just about getting through, it's also about the quality of the service that's provided. Simply getting more people to man the phones will not necessarily solve this problem.'
Robin Williamson, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said: 'These figures will come as no surprise to the many people who have experienced their telephone performance in recent years.
'The phone lines are the only way you can contact HMRC after they closed most of their offices and with a digital system which is still in development. They remain a lifeline if you need to sort out your tax affairs, so the telephone system has to work.
'Waiting times are not uncommonly over half an hour. This can be very expensive for those on pay-as-you-go, which is typically people on lower incomes.' The '03000' number to call the taxman is typically 9p a minute from landlines and between 8p and 40p a minute from mobiles, unless the user has a free calls package, according to Ofcom estimates.
Between April 2014 and March this year, 64.7million calls were made to HMRC, of which 72 per cent (46.8million) were successfully answered. This fell short of the revenue body's target of 80 per cent.
The 45million allocation will come from the current spending budget and is not additional revenue from the Treasury, HMRC said.
Chief executive Lin Homer said: 'Despite our best efforts, our call performance hasn't been up to scratch and we apologise to all those customers who have struggled to get through to us.'
She added that staff numbers had been boosted from 15,000 to 18,000, and another 2,000 workers temporarily drafted in from other roles to deal with the crisis.
Patrick Stevens, at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said: 'The fact almost 18million taxpayers could not get through to HMRC last year is alarming.
'HMRC must prioritise customer service so taxpayers aren't disadvantaged by not being able to get through to an adviser.
'We have previously voiced concern that the closure of walk-in inquiry centres would increase the strain on HMRC's call centres.'

And a project to promote safe and responsible use of Facebook in Laos, south-east Asia, cost 970.
Humanitarian groups last night said it was important overseas aid spending was concentrated on alleviating poverty.
Diane Sheard, director of the ONE Campaign founded by U2 singer Bono, said: By law, UK aid must help to reduce global poverty. If money is being used to fund schemes that dont meet this goal, then it shouldnt be counted as aid.
Big bite budget:3,104.09 was spent on English lessons for young football players in Urugay, hoping to follow the nation's biting hero Luis Suarez
Shakespeare in love: The FCO spent 5,000 last year on Hamlet education workshops in Ecuador andgave 2,042-worth of free tickets to children for a Hamlet production in Haiti
The reports of Foreign Office aid spending raise legitimate questions.
More than 13,000 was budgeted for a Q&amp;A game show to be shown on Ethiopian television with a UK and Ethiopia theme. A further 5,000 was spent in the African country on a 10k run.
Hundreds of leaflets were printed in Russian and Romanian  at a cost of 2,300  to promote the EU in Moldova.
HEY BIG SPENDER: HOW FOREIGN OFFICE USED YOUR TAXES
Here are just some of the projects on which the Foreign Office spent tax payers' money from their 2013/14 budget.
3,400 was spent on finding female mates for the endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish, in Madagascar.
3,104.09 was spent on Englishlessonsfor youngfootball players inUruguay.
13,888 spent on a Q&amp;A game show on National Televisionin Ethiopia.
51,564 giving Serbians work experience in the UK.
5,000 last year on Hamlet education workshops in Ecuador, South America.
2,042-worth of free tickets given to children for a Hamlet production in Haiti.
And a scheme to find female mates for endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in Madagascar cost 3,400.
Only three of the species, known as gorgeously ugly, were thought to exist in the world in 2013 and all were male.
In Bolivia 13,500 was budgeted for measuring the carbon footprint of the Dakar off-road car rally.
Last night Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: Taxpayers will be outraged at these damning revelations. It is totally inappropriate to spend taxpayers cash on pointless projects and propaganda.
Foreign aid is supposed to help the worlds poorest, not subsidise game shows. Until the Foreign Office can prove value for money for these projects, and theyll struggle, this spending should stop.
The Foreign Office last year spent 343million on overseas aid, while the majority of the UKs 12billion annual aid budget is distributed by the Department for International Development. In March the Government passed a bill to enshrine in law its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of the countrys annual income on aid.
But it has failed to commit to its Nato obligation to spend 2 per cent of its GDP of defence.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: The Foreign Secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCOs aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money. Building closer relationships with growing economies is important.
The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show taxpayers cash is being spent wisely.
The Department for International Development said that it would not be launching a review into its own projects in light of the Foreign Office spending.

On Thursday, Collings, who is from Dorridge, in Solihull, West Midlands, said: 'The months following my return to the UK were absolutely terrifying as doctors only gave me a small chance of surviving my condition.
'When you go on holiday you are supposed to come back feeling refreshed but I ended up fighting for my life.
'I'm lucky really that I don't have to be on dialysis all my life but I shouldn't be in this situation at all.'
Upon returning home to the UK last summer, blood tests revealed that she had contracted e-coli and was also suffering from a rare kidney infection

Nicola was in Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital for two weeks and needed to take two months off from work to recover from her illness.
She has now instructed medical negligence lawyers to investigate the five-star hotel and travel company, Red Sea Holidays Ltd.
Nicola claims the pool area was dirty with murky water and that the food was  served lukewarm and with dirty cutlery.
She added: 'Although I'm now back at work I'm often shaking and tired and I still don't feel normal now ten months on.
'I also have to be careful about my health as my immune system is not that great and so I tend to get ill easily.
'I'm desperate to know what caused my illness as there could be other people affected who might not be as lucky as I was in surviving my condition.'
She has now hired lawyers to launch an investigation against the five-starSiva Sharm Resort &amp; Spa

Lawyers won a five-figure sum from the hotel in 2010, formally called the Savita Spa Resort, after a group of holidaymakers suffered severe gastric symptoms on holiday.
Amandeep Samra, an expert holiday illness lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are currently investigating the exact cause of Nicola's illness.
'It is extremely worrying to hear how severely ill Nicola became as a result of the illness she suffered.
'She has been through a traumatic experience and continues to suffer as a result of the illness she contracted.
'As we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the Siva Sharm Hotel and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible.'

	France is to pay almost 40 million pounds in compensation to foreign Holocaust victims. The US deal was rubber stamped by MPs on Wednesday night, paving the way for pay-outs around the world.

France has slowly owned up to the part it played in the atrocity, and has already paid out some 40 million pounds to its own nationals affected by it.
Now those who took on new nationalities in countries such as America and Israel will be eligible for money, as will their relatives.
But there was anger at the deal in some quarters, because it is reliant on the United States protecting Frances immunity in regard to Holocaust deportation claims filed in America.
The railway tracks which led to one of the Nazi's most notorious concentration camps, Auschwitz
Rail workers and police were among those who assisted occupying Third Reich forces in deporting some 76,000 Jews during the Second World War, and only around 3000 survived

France is to pay almost 40 million pounds in compensation to foreign victims of its wartime Holocaust. A vote on the bill will be held on July 9 where it is expected to pass.
Former French transport minister Thierry Mariani said: Compensation to victims of the Holocaust is a must but this deal with the USA is humiliating and unacceptable.
Patrick Balkany, an MP whose father was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp from Paris, said: My father would turn in his grave if he knew about this text.
Last month a new complaint was filed in Chicago by Holocaust victim descendants against SNCF.

Former French transport minister Thierry Mariani said: Compensation to victims of the Holocaust is a must but this deal with the USA is humiliating and unacceptable
Such actions have proved extremely problematic for SNCF, as they prevent them winning contracts in the USA. The new deal is ultimately aimed at ending this.
In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, a long time campaigner for the compensation deal, hailed the proposed deal as a 'breakthrough in a decades-long struggle for justice.'
The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, also welcomed the accord.
'There is no amount of money that could ever make up for the horrific injustice done to these victims and their families,' said Abraham Foxman, ADL's national director and a Holocaust survivor.
'But agreements like this provide some modest redress, an important recognition of their pain, and acknowledge the responsibility of governments and institutions to leave no stone unturned in seeking every possible measure of justice for Holocaust victims.'

	Clifford Collinge, 61, was found dead on the floor of his kitchen in Warsop in October 2011 having suffered a fractured skull and ribs after being battered with a guitar and metal joiner's sash clamp.

Former newsagent Mr Collinge died from a subarachnoid haemorrhage - bleeding on the brain caused by trauma - after the attack on October 8, 2011.
Nottingham Crown Court heard that Collinge had told her friend Jessica Dawkins earlier that day that she 'wanted her husband dead'.
Former newsagent Mr Collinge (pictured) died from a subarachnoid haemorrhage - bleeding on the brain caused by trauma - after the attack in 2011
Closing the prosecution case on Tuesday, prosecutor Peter Joyce QC said his wife stepped over Mr Collinge as he lay dying in a pool of blood.
He added: 'What happens after the killing? What does she [Mrs Collinge] do?
'One is someone with whom she had a sexual thing some years before, Stan Boardman, and the other, her husband, she loves to bits, and he is lying on the floor groaning in a pool of blood. He's dying.
'Does she help him? No. Does she speak to him? No. Does she hold him? No.
'What does she do? She steps over him to go upstairs and she comes back down and she steps over him again. She goes out and she rings her boyfriend.'
Mr Joyce QC said Collinge then went back into the house for a second time but still didn't try to help her dying husband.
He added: 'Does she talk to Cliff? No. Does she hold Cliff? No. Does she cradle him, does she touch him at all? No.
'She steps over him again and she steps over him again on the way outside. She wouldn't have done that to her dog.
'And if it had been her daughter who was attacked by an intruder? Would she have helped her? Yes. Why not Cliff?
'You know why not. She wanted him dead.'
Collinge, Shreeves and Dale, all from Warsop, deny murdering Mr Collinge.
Shreeves and Dale also deny assault causing actual bodily harm to Mr Boardman on the same day.
Giving evidence in the trial, pathologist Dr Guy Rutty said there were at least 46 separate blows or injuries to Mr Collinge.
Mr Joyce QC added: 'You will remember what he was saying about the bones to the head and the fractured skull and the air embolism that killed him.
Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) heard that Collinge had told friend Jessica Dawkins earlier that day that she 'wanted her husband dead'
'Every rib, pretty much, was multiply fractured. There was fracture after fracture consistent with stamping and jumping on him.'
Earlier in the trial, the jury heard Collinge confessed to killing her husband moments after he was bludgeoned to death.
Giving evidence, PCSO Georgina Fletcher told the jury that she arrived at the house shortly after 10pm and saw Mr Collinge lying on the floor in a pool of blood.
She said: 'Charlotte Collinge came from around the back of the house to the window.
'She stepped within a few feet of me and said 'oh my God, I think I've just killed him'.
'She came across as quite nervous. She was a bit jittery as she said it and was crying.
'She went from crying to all of a sudden very straight-faced and very calm.. She said 'I haven't killed him. I found him lying on the floor in blood'..'
But Michael Auty QC, defending Collinge, said under cross-examination that the words could have been 'I think they've killed him'.
He added: 'You made a mistake in what you heard.'
The trial continues.

	Alistair Leith, pictured, said he was 'alarmed' when he discovered his son had spent the money on 'gold coins' while playing on the family computer at their home in Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire.

'But the thing is children want to reach the end of these games and they won't understand that it costs lots of money.'
Mr Leith, from Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, initially registered his card details on Facebook so that he could occasionally buy apps or games.
After that, every time his son, Alexander, logged on to the account before school he was able to make charges to the card without any verification.
Certain levels of Juice Jam can only be reached if the player has enough 'gold coins' to reach them
These can be bought in packages which cost players between 60p and 63. In Alexander's case, he bought a number of the 63 packages.
Mr Leith said  he is 'furious' with the makers of 'Juice Jam' for making it so easy for children to make purchases.
'It's so easy to spend money on your credit card on Facebook,' he said. 'I've since taken my card details off my profile. You should have to enter a password or security code to make a purchase.'
Mr Leith, who said he had been planning to put the money towards setting up his own business, added that he didn't blame his son 'at all'.
He said: 'It's easily done and he's too young to understand. Because of his autism he gets a bit fixated with games. Very few things can hold his concentration.
'At first we just told him Facebook was broken but he got upset and kept asking to play the game.
'In the end I showed him the invoices and explained to him that the game cost money and daddy couldn't afford. He understood but he was very sad.
'He was only playing it briefly in the mornings before school, it wasn't long enough for me to get charged that extortionate amount.
'I know business is business, but there need to be better safeguards to protect children and the vulnerable.'
A spokeswoman for the game's software developer SGN, said: 'SGN makes games based on the parameters set by the platforms it publishes on including Facebook, iOS, Google Play and Amazon.
'Juice Jam is a free-to-play game, with optional in-app purchases that are not required in order to finish the game.
'The company also handles all customer service inquiries within 24 hours and refunds accidental purchases or unintended transactions when appropriate.
'This particular inquiry from the UK was handled by customer service within 12 hours of receiving, where they were given refund information and advised to increase their Facebook security options.
'SGN is also fully compliant with the Children's Online Protection Act.'
Following a complaint to Facebook, the social network has since offered Mr Leith a one-time only refund.
CAUGHT OUT BY IN-APP CHARGES: FAMILIES WHO FACED MASSIVE BILLS wH
Last August, a mother was left horrified after her son unwittingly racked up a 1,000 bill in just two weeks by playing online games.
Kay Flanders, 49, was stunned to discover that 11-year-old Liam's 10 a month phone bill had rocketed to 850.
He had signed up as a member of online game Small Worlds - where users create their own virtual universes - until 2020.
And, unknown to her, he had bought optional extras such as credits to buy special items and VIP membership which grants exclusive access to other parts of the game.

Meanwhile, in September 2012, a schoolboy unwittingly racked up a 2,000 credit card bill playing an online game on his grandfathers iPad.
Six-year-old Will Smith was innocently playing the popular childrens video game Tiny Monsters until his grandfather Barry Slatter, 55, was contacted by the fraud squad.
The family was unaware of little Wills huge spending spree until his grandmother tried to use the credit card at Tesco, only to have it declined.
Families have also been caught out by in-game charges on a number of mobile phone apps.
In March 2013,eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fryracked up an enormous 980 bill for his parents while playing a Simpsons game on the iPad.

Councillors have unanimously refused a planning application for fracking in Lancashire in a move which has been welcomed by environmental campaigners.
Lancashire County Council's development control committee turned down Cuadrilla's application to explore for shale gas by drilling, hydraulically fracking and testing the flow of gas at Roseacre Wood, Roseacre, between Preston and Blackpool.
The vote was in line with recommendations by planning officials who said it should be turned down because it would cause an increase in traffic which would result in 'an unacceptable impact' on rural roads and reduce road safety.

The committee has yet to reach a decision on a second proposal at Fylde, Lancashire, at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, which planning officers have recommended should go ahead.
The decision on Preston New Road has been deferred to Monday.

Marcus Johnstone, cabinet member for environment, planning and cultural services, and a member of the development control committee, said: 'The development control committee has listened very carefully to many hours of evidence both for and against the proposal, and considered the report of the council's planning officers.
'The decision to refuse this application has been reached by a vote of the committee and each member of the committee has ultimately cast their vote based on the evidence they have heard and whether they think the proposal is acceptable.'
Friends of the Earth welcomed the decision to block the proposed plant at Rosacre Wood
Friends of the Earth north west campaigner Furqan Naeem said: 'This is a tremendous victory for local people and everyone across Lancashire and the UK who have been tirelessly highlighting the risks fracking poses to their quality of life and the climate.
'But the fracking threat still hangs ominously over the community near Preston New Road.
'Poll after poll shows people want renewables, not fracking - and the clean energy and long-term jobs they would provide.
'Lancashire councillors must put local people and our environment first and reject Cuadrilla's controversial application when they meet next Monday.'
In a statement, shale company Cuadrilla said: 'We are disappointed but not surprised that Lancashire County Council's development control committee has denied planning consent for our application at Roseacre Wood as their decision follows a negative recommendation by the council's planning officers.
'We are committed to the responsible exploration and development of the huge quantity of natural gas locked up in the shale rock deep underneath Lancashire.
'We will now take time to consider our options, including our right to appeal.'
Cuadrilla said it was confident that its proposed route, road improvements and traffic management plan were safe and suitable for the modest level of HGV journeys associated with the Roseacre Wood site and met all necessary guidelines.
'If we can unlock this shale gas potential it will help create jobs, generate economic growth, help fuel and heat local businesses and homes, and boost local tax revenues for Lancashire,' the company said.
Footage captures moment massive flames erupt from tank
The Preston New Road planning application remains the focus of hot dispute, with legal advice published today warning that rejecting the application for fracking because of its visual and landscape impacts would be 'unreasonable' in planning terms.
Councillors have been under 'intolerable pressure' in making the final ruling on the controversial process of releasing gas.
The Government has said it is going 'all out for shale', claiming it would create jobs and growth, reduce energy prices and cut the country's reliance on gas imports.
But opponents have raised fears that the process causes earthquakes, can pollute water supplies, could lead to inappropriate development in the countryside and damage house prices.
Environmental campaigners and local opponents of fracking have been protesting outside the council's offices in Preston calling for councillors to reject the two proposals.
Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it.
Greenpeace UK energy and climate campaigner Daisy Sands said: 'Today's decision is a victory for local democracy over corporate arrogance and government meddling, and a shot across the bow of the fracking industry in Lancashire.
'Yesterday we saw local councillors paralysed by fears of a legal challenge from the frackers on a separate application.
'Today the people's elected representatives found their voice again and shouted a very clear 'no' to Cuadrilla's plans.
'Tens of thousands of Lancashire residents will now be hoping that, emboldened by today's decision, the councillors will ignore the enormous pressure from ministers and the fracking lobby, and stop fracking at the Preston New Road site too.'

Operation Purple Barracuda was a joint sting between South Wales Police and various partners including the National Crime Agency, Cardiff Council and British Transport Police.
It's part of a wider project - Operation Fulcrum - which is a crackdown on drugs trafficking, sex offenders and illegal drivers by police.
Chief Superintendent Belinda Davies said the operation had been a 'complex and sensitive' investigation.
She said: 'Yesterday's police action represents the latest phase of Operation Fulcrum  South Wales Police's commitment to keeping communities across Cardiff safe from organised crime.

'During the course of the operation, 20 people were arrested for an array of offences, including suspected forced labour, money laundering, theft and the large scale abstraction of electricity.
'Suspected proceeds of crime ranging from luxury cars, including a Ferrari and Range Rover, were seized along with a very substantial quantity of cash.
'One of the most critical elements of yesterday's operation, however, was our commitment to protecting British and foreign nationals from suspected forced labour and poor working conditions.'
She added that she hoped the operation would reassure members of the public that the police was committed to tackling organised crime and other forms of criminality in the Welsh capital.
Inspector James Dyson said the swoop was the result of several months of planning and research.
He added: 'To ensure the operation addressed all aspects of criminality, advice was sought from other law enforcement agencies - including the National Crime Agency.
The substantial amount of cash was seized, along with high-value cars from three sites across the city

'A police response such as this will no doubt have an impact on the traveller community within Cardiff and beyond.
'With a view to this, there is an ongoing engagement process with Cardiff Council and the traveller community.
'The policing response was designed to reassure (people) that South Wales Police are there to represent and serve all, and will address any criminality and anti-social behaviour that exists.'
The area's MP Stephen Doughty said: 'I've been in touch with South Wales Police over the past 24 hours regarding these raids.
'These allegations of human trafficking and forced labour are shocking revelations.

'It is vital that the police are able to gather relevant evidence and I would strongly encourage anyone with information to come forward and help the police.'
Mr Doughty, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, added: 'There have been a number of revelations of forced labour in Wales and throughout Britain and it is crucial that this barbaric form of modern slavery is dealt with severely.
'It is important that the unfortunate individuals involved are released from these conditions and brought to safety.'

Rather than help, his friends stood laughing as Mr Sayers spent 10 minutes struggling in vain to wrestle his head free.
They eventually took sympathy on the father-of-two and he was  rescued to cheers from the crowd after having his head greased in Vaseline.
Mr Sayers, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, told MailOnline: 'I'd had about 12 or 13 cans over about eight hours and was in a bit of a silly mood.
'Throughout the day I'd been throwing my clubs round, because that's what I often end up doing, and a couple of them were bent so at the end I said "right, these are going in the bin".

Stuck: Mr Sayers, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, said: 'Everybody was in hysterics. I've got my wife and kids there - and my mother - and they're all laughing their heads off at my stupid predicament'
'But when they wouldn't fit everybody started laughing so I thought, right, I'm going to stick my head in there instead, that'll get a laugh.
'So I shoved my head in the bin. It wouldn't go in at first and then as I gave it a big push and forced it I knew straight away I was in trouble. I tried to pull it out again but my ears got stuck.
'Well then everybody was in hysterics. I've got my wife and kids there - and my mother - and they're all laughing their heads off at my stupid predicament.' 
He added: 'I was stuck like that for about 10 minutes until someone who had been carrying Vaseline to avoid sores during the golf day helped get my head out.
The 49-year-old, who said he's 'a bit silly anyway', admitted to having had a few beers before he got stuck

Mr Sayers, who is married to Alison, 45, and has two children Daniel, 17, and Jake, 14, said he had been getting stick for the prank ever since
'He rubbed it on my temples and behind my ears and I was able to get one ear out then the rest of my head.
'It did hurt a bit, but I was OK. I had some bruises on my neck but the wasps left me alone, luckily.'

The 24-hour session, which ran from 6pm on June 4 until 6pm the following day was attended by around 200 spectators.
The group used flashing golf balls to keep the rounds going throughout the night.

	George Osborne urged to use first Tory budget to slash the 45p top rate of tax
      </title>

	Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said the 45p rate should be abolished altogether – claiming it would attract business to Britain and cost the Exchequer little in lost revenues.

In the run up to the election, the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to rule out scrapping the higher rate.
He said cutting the top rate of tax was not in his 'plan', but refused to rule it out.
According to the Financial Times, Mr Osborne has 'indicated in Treasury meetings that he might cut the 45p tax rate on earnings above 150,000'.
Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said the 45p rate should be abolished altogether
But Lord Lawson has urged Mr Osborne to make the move. The Tory peer said he would 'strongly support' any cut, adding that it would 'significantly enhance the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business, at no cost in terms of lost revenue'.
He told the Financial Times: 'That was the experience when I brought the top rate down to 40 per cent in 1988 and it is even more relevant today.'
The move would be welcomed in the City of London, where banks have complained about high taxes.
Labour increased the rate from 40p to 50p in 2009 after the financial crash, and Mr Osborne cut it to 45p in his 2012 Budget.
The Conservatives have already promised to cut pension tax relief for the highest earners and Mr Osborne is also expected to announce a 5billion crackdown on tax avoidance.
He will also use the Budget to raise the income tax threshold for those on low earnings and to make progress towards a 50,000 starting rate for the current 40p rate.
When the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling announced plans to introduce a 50p income tax rate on incomes above 150,000 from 2010-11, it was originally estimated to increase tax revenues by 2.7 billion a year.
But Mr Osborne commissioned HMRC to analyse the 2010-11 tax returns to assess how much extra tax had actually been raised. It estimated that the 50p rate brought in 1bn more than the 40p rate.
Cutting the rate back to 45p was estimated to cost 100m, suggesting that reducing it to 40p would cost at least 900,000.
The estimates of the cost of reducing the top tax rate are subject to large margins of errors.

	Iain Duncan Smith says he welcomes food banks

	The Work and Pensions Secretary said the rise in the number of charities handing out food parcels was evidence of 'decent' people helping those who have 'fallen into difficulty'.

The government boasted that poverty levels remained at the lowest level since the 1980s.
But in the Commons,Labour MP David Winnick said: 'If the situation has improved substantially why has there been such a large amount of food banks, far larger than previously?
'Isn't it quite clear that some Tory members have no idea at all of the amount of poverty which exists, in many cases in their own constituencies?'
Earlier the SNP's Ian Blackford said: 'Is it not a disgrace that in my own constituency the biggest increase in food bank use has come from those who are in work?'
I welcome decent people in society trying to help others who may, for various reasons, have fallen into difficulty
Iain Duncan Smith
Mr Duncan Smith said he had no problem with the increased use of food banks: 'Most of my colleagues are usually involved with food banks and actually help them.
'I welcome food banks. I welcome decent people in society trying to help others who may, for various reasons, have fallen into difficulty.
'I don't accept the single cause of that is to do with the welfare reforms, quite the contrary.
'Food bank usage has been rising over a period. It was never part of the British system, but in Germany where their welfare payments you can argue are higher, 1.5 million a week use food banks, much more than they do here.'
TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said:'It's small wonder that Iain Duncan Smith is a fan of food banks  his polices are keeping them in business.
'If he spent more time visiting food banks he would see for himself that many users are in work, as well those punished by his cruel sanctions regime. Slashing tax credits for the working poor will only make things worse.'
Senior Conservatives have repeatedly faced criticism for their attitude towards food banks.
But Lord Freud said the rise in demand for food banks was difficult to understand., adding 'it is very hard to know why people go to them'.
Ministers have previously argued that an increase in the number of food banks has been fuelled by Jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help
Two years ago Cabinet minister Michael Gove was branded an 'absolute disgrace' by Labour after claiming families who use food banks have only their own 'decisions' to blame.
He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.
He added: 'I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.
'Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances.
If the situation has improved substantially why has there been such a large amount of food banks, far larger than previously?
Labour MP David Winnick
'We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.'
Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit has also claimed that people who use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, blaming a 'near infinite demand' for anything free.
Last year the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Hunger in the UK found that, since the establishment of the Trussell Trust network in 2004, numbers of emergency food assistance providers have grown to at least 1,500, including 800 food banks - around half of them operated by the Trust.
Its major report, Feeding Britain, found there that 'demand for emergency food assistance is increasing, and sometimes increasing dramatically'.
But Tory peer Baroness Jenkin of Kennington faced criticised after she suggested that a lack of cookery skills was in part to blame for families going to food banks, and boasted she ate a bowl of porridge for 4p for breakfast.

        <MainBody>Toms founder Blake Mycoskie has called for all new fathers to receive three months paternity leave
Toms shoes founder Blake Mycoskie has called for all new fathers to receive three months paternity leave.
His comments come after he gave himself 12 weeks off following the birth of his six-month-old son, Summit.
The shoe company entrepreneur offers all new parents at his firm eight weeks paid leave and flexible schedules after they return to work.
Now he wants more businesses across America to support new fathers.
'It's an experience I wish every new dad could have, but I realize how lucky I am,' Mr Mycoskie told Glamour .
'In fact, when I announced I'd be taking leave, some of my CEO peers were mystified.
'Responses ranged from 'You're going to get real bored, real quick' to 'How are you supposed to lead a company while changing diapers?'
According to Mycoskie, just 12 per cent of all workers in America have access to formal paid parental leave and most men take just a week off after the birth of their children.
But the businessman says rather than being a burden on the workplace, bosses should think of it as an investment.
'What may look like a cost on the spread sheets, actually is an investment in higher productivity and more engagement,' he told the Today Show .

	Spearfisher Valentine Thomas reveals the abuse she receives for the sport she loves

	In her spare time, City worker Valentine Thomas (pictured), 28, who moved from Canada to London five years ago, swaps a suit for a snorkel and travels the world in search of another big catch.

'People call me a killer,' Miss Thomas told MailOnline. 'I face sexism, I face a lot of hate, but I have also had marriage proposals.'
In 2010, the French-speaking Canadian moved from Montreal to the UK, and was persuaded by a friend to complete a diving course in Egypt.
She then travelled to the remote Ascension Island in the south Atlantic for her first trip and soon fell in love with the sport.
'For me to be able to grab my own food is amazing,' the keen cook explained. 'I like everything - even cleaning the fish afterwards. We are really involved in sea preservation. We never kill anything we won't eat.'
Amazing: Valentine Thomas encounters huge whale shark
Backlash: Valentine is a successful sportswoman who became a record holder in 2013 on Ascension Island
Haul: The keen cook has been criticised for spearfishing but insists she never kills anything she doesn't eat
World record: Valentine pictured with the huge Atlantic Jack which made her a world record holder in 2013
Criticism: Valentine documents her travels on social media but has faced strong backlash with some calling her a killer
It was on her first fishing expedition that Miss Thomas almost died when she became separated from her partner in high waves.
'I started freaking out,' she said. 'I was trying to swim to the shore and I couldn't.
Sometimes you can be five miles from the shore. When you spear a fish and there is blood everywhere, the sharks are around
'Sometimes you can be five miles from the shore. When you spear a fish and there is blood everywhere, the sharks are around.'
Miss Thomas, who works in the City raising capital for a hedge fund, was lucky on this occasion and found a rope connected to her partner so she could pull herself to safety.
She has travelled to the island in the Atlantic on numerous occasions to indulge her passion, as well as to Durban in South Africa where she swam into a school of between 20 and 30 sharks, Corsica and Greece.
She has also fished off the Channel Islands, Dorset and Cornwall.
In 2013, she broke the  world record for catching the largest Atlantic Jack while diving off Ascension Island.
As a woman taking part in a male-dominated sport, Miss Thomas benefits from free equipment from sponsors and trip invites, but she is also bombarded with abuse.
Hobby: The 28-year-old went to Ascension Island for her first spearfishing trip four years ago but almost died
Deadly: Risks Valentine faces are strong currents and sharks, like this one spotted while she was fishing in South Africa
Future: The world-record holder, who works in the City, hopes to make spearfishing her full-time occupation
Next trip: The sportswoman will be travelling to Zanzibar for two weeks in the summer where she hopes to bag a new world record
Travel: Fishing has allowed her to travel to exotic locations around the world. This photo was taken in Corsica
One of her pictures was recently shared on an Instagram account called Spear Sluts - a page featuring beautiful, bikini-clad women fishing.
Some question whether she actually catches the fish she poses with, suggesting her boyfriend is responsible.
'It's extremely rare to see women, actually,' she said. 'It's really something quite different. It used to bother me - it definitely bothers my boyfriend. People don't believe I can do things like this.'
She concedes: 'It's the good and the bad publicity. I don't think I have ever bought any equipment.'
And Miss Thomas is often called a killer on social media, but she insists her way of fishing is far more humane that using a net.
Some pictures show her gutting her catches - prompting critics to call on her to stop. One  described her on Facebook as Jack the Ripper.
'I shoot them in the brain and they die immediately,' she said. 'I'm very respectful of everything I do.
'If you buy fish from a supermarket, why am I the bad guy? People see blood and they get squeamish.
'People get really angry, they get  upset because they are not used to seeing where their food comes from. Everyone turns a blind eye to what they are eating and I put the reality in front of them.'
Humane: Valentine, 28, insists the way she kills the fish is far more humane than catching them in a net
Getting her hands dirty: The 28-year-old not only kills fish but guts, cleans and cooks her catches before eating them
Doubt: Some question whether she catches the fish she poses with, suggesting her boyfriend is responsible
Miss Thomas believes she got her adventurous streak from her father, Alain, who sailed across the Atlantic when he was in his 20s.
He taught her to dive and fish when she was a child, but she had to overcome her fears to pursue her passion.
Now it's getting harder and harder to go back to the office on Monday and go on the computer
'It took me quite a while before being comfortable with shore diving,' Miss Thomas wrote on social media.
'I almost drowned in the south west of France when I was a teenager after being caught in an underwater current.
'Spearfishing allowed me to overcome my fear of the ocean which got replaced with passion, but it was a long road to get there.'
In July, she will visit Zanzibar off the east coast of Africa for two weeks where she hopes to bag a new world record.
She has already featured in two French television documentaries about fishing but has far bigger ambitions.
'My dream would be to make a TV show so I can fish for a living and I would like to get involved in protecting the ocean,' she said.'Now it's getting harder and harder to go back to the office on Monday and go on the computer.'

Looking forward: She hopes to leave her job in the City and make a television show so she can fish every day

	ITV's News At Ten to replace Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham with Tom Bradby

        <Description>
	Tom Bradby, currently the channel's political editor, was today revealed as the new presenter of the flagship primetime news programme.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
A source told The Sun there was 'mutiny in the ranks' over the changes, adding: 'Colleagues are either Team Mark or Team Tom. Some don't understand why a change is necessary.'
Earlier this month, another insider told the Guardian: 'If it ain't broke why fix it?'
Disgruntled: Current presenters Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham are said to be unhappy at the move
However, Mr Bradby has apparently been singled out as the 'future face of news' for ITV - a source recently told the Daily Mail he would be 'our new Trevor McDonald'.
The experienced journalist was the first person to interview Prince William and Kate Middleton after they got engaged in 2010, on the specific request of the Prince.
It was Mr Bradby who sparked the News of the World phone-hacking scandal in 2005, when he told police that a reporter had listened in on messages exchanged between him and William.
More recently, he became an unlikely hate figure in the US when American Twitter users confused him with top NFL quarterback Tom Brady, who has been suspended for misconduct.
Legacy: News at Ten was previously hosted by Sir Trevor MacDonald, pictured on screen in 2000
Mr Bradby said in a statement today: 'News at Ten is one of the best known and loved news brands in the country and I have hugely enjoyed working for it in 25 years on the road with ITV News.
'The chance to help lead it into a new era is a unique and incredibly exciting challenge - and, given the programme's heritage, a great honour, too.'
Michael Jermey, ITV's Director of News and Current Affairs, added: 'ITV News is fortunate to have an exceptionally talented line-up of experienced and knowledgeable newscasters. They bring vast reporting and presenting experience to our programmes and their journalism enhances all our news output.
'I'm delighted Tom is joining our very strong and well established presenting line-up. His expert knowledge of British politics and international affairs will be very valuable as we develop News at Ten.'
WAR REPORTER, ROYAL EXPERT, POLITICAL STAR... NOW THE FACE OF ITV
Tom Bradby is poised to become the public face of ITV after a storied career as a war correspondent, royal reporter and now political specialist.
The 48-year-old was born in Malta while his father was serving as an officer in the Royal Navy, and was educated at Sherborne School, alma mater to Coldplay's Chris Martin and actor Jeremy Irons.
After studying at Edinburgh University, he joined ITN as a graduate trainee 1990 - and 25 years later, he has still never worked anywhere else.
Mr Bradby spent three years as Ireland correspondent, then moved his young family to Hong Kong as ITV's Asia correspondent - almost costing him his leg when he was shot during a protest in Indonesia.
Friends: Mr Bradby was the first person to interview Prince William and Kate Middleton together
In 2001, he reluctantly accepted the job of royal correspondent because it was the only post available in London - but he soon developed a reputation as one of the closest confidants to the next generation of royals.
After accompanying Prince Harry on his gap year in Lesotho, he struck up a friendship with Prince William, and was the first person to interview William and Kate Middleton when they got engaged.
He also found himself dragged in to what would become the phone hacking scandal, when it emerged that a News of the World journalist had intercepted voicemail messages between him and the prince.
Mr Bradby was appointed political editor in 2005, despite not having a political background - which he claims is an advantage because neither side can accuse him of bias.
He is host of the political chat show The Agenda, and last month was the lead anchor on ITV's coverage of the General Election.
Now the presenter - who has three children with his wife Claudia - is likely to become one of the most prominent journalists in the country if, as predicted, he takes over News at Ten.

	A photo of three women in niqabs with the message ‘share if you find this offensive’ was seen on the Facebook page of a member of a Bradford's school’s support staff and reported.

The Facebook post originated from Britain First  the right wing political movement reportedly founded by a former member of the British Nationalist Party  and was allegedly shared by Angie Dunn, a non-teaching member of staff at the Bradford comprehensive.
However, police are also looking into a complaint from Ms Dunn that her Facebook account was maliciously hacked.
The secondary school has around 1,000 pupils aged from 11 to 18.
Response: The headteacher has maintained that calling the police in over the alleged anti-niqab post was the right thing to do
According to a recent Ofsted report the vast majority of students are from minority ethnic backgrounds and speak English as an additional language.
When news of the anti-Islamic social media photo spread through the school it clearly provoked anger amongst pupils and parents demanding action.
Mrs McIntosh, the headteacher, said: We have dealt with this matter swiftly and informed the police right away. It will now be investigated in the proper way and will be dealt with accordingly.
We will not allow any isolated incident to distract from our focus on delivering a high quality education to all our students, as a welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment for the whole community.
In a letter to parents, she added: You may be aware of the tasteless and offensive Facebook post regarding the hijab allegedly posted by a member of staff.
This appalling action in no way represents the thoughts, feelings or actions of Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College and the 207 other individuals who work here.
Prejudice and racism in any form is not acceptable in or out of our college and any such behaviour is taken very seriously. That is why the matter has been reported to the police for investigation as a hate crime.
A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said they were contacted on Wednesday morning by a member of staff at the school about an inappropriate picture which had been shared on their social media page. He said: Enquiries are continuing into this matter.
Councillor Mohammed Shafiq said he had ten calls in an hour from worried parents.
He said: Im pleased that the school has launched a full investigation to look into this matter and the priority remains the education of our children.
While Brian Morris, a local UKIP councillor, warned of an overreaction.
He said: It's the times we live in unfortunately. No matter how the post was meant to be seen, people will take it as offensive even if that wasn't the intention.
There are people out there looking for problems and the slightest little thing they can get hold of they will. People will twist things and make a bigger issue out of it.
Councillor Susan Hinchclifffe, Bradford Councils executive member for schools, said the authority would not tolerate any instance of prejudice, in any shape or form.
It is not known if any action has been taken against Ms Dunn, a member of the learning support staff.
Laisterdyke hit the headlines in April last year when the governors were removed following a critical Ofsted report and concerns raised by the council. They were accused of undermining the head and interfering in the day-to-day running of the school.
It was revealed how teachers had previously been suspended after clashing with governors who wanted to model the school on the academy in Birmingham at the centre of the 'Trojan Horse' allegations.

Defence:West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes says the force has come a long way since the report was written
Half of all victims, who were from Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall, lived with their parents, while 41 per cent were in care.
Police pin-pointed 75 grooming suspects - most with a history of sexual violence - with most being from a Muslim background from Birmingham.
The report stated: 'The vast majority of identified suspects (79 per cent) are Asian (59 of 75), 12 per cent are white and five per cent are African Caribbean. 62 per cent of Asian suspects are of Pakistani origin.
'Pakistani males account for half of all identified suspects in the force (37 of 75).
'Offenders are likely to have a history of previous sexual offences, as well as a wide range of other offences and convictions.
'A high level of organised criminality has now been evidenced both across the force area and regionally, with multiple offenders working together to identify, groom and abuse victims.
'In a number of organised groups victims are forced into prostitution and high levels of intimidation and force are used to keep the victims compliant.'
Concerns: The report speaks of an upcoming English Defence League march through Dudley a month later, which saw streets emptied and shops boarded up
The shocking document also highlighted fears of 'community tensions' if the police made the report's findings public.
HOW WEST MIDLANDS REPORT HAS SHADES OF ROTHERHAM SCANDAL
West Midlands Police's decision to withhold details of alleged child abuse amid fears of increasing racial tensions has shades of the scandal in Rotherham.
Police and social workers in the South Yorkshire town were accused of being too concerned about being labelled racist to speak out about the crimes involving 1,400 children.
Yesterday it emerged that the massive inquiry into the Rotherham sex abuse scandal could run until at least 2018 and has so far identified 300 suspects.
Investigators say the number of possible offenders is changing on a daily basis and they suspect thousands of offences have been committed.
The team has seized 92 boxes containing several thousand files and identified more than 3,300 lines of inquiry. The suspects are predominantly Asian men from the South Yorkshire town and include two who have worked for the council. Their victims are mainly white, British, underage and vulnerable girls.
Operation Stovewood is currently costing up to 5million every year, and is still likely to be ongoing in three years time  putting the total bill for the inquiry at around 15million.
So far the inquiry has backed an original estimate that 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham during a 16-year period from 1997 to 2013.
Last night childrens charities demanded that the men should be brought to justice.
Barnardos chief executive Javed Khan said: Because so many vulnerable children were ignored by the authorities, groomers got away with exploiting them for years.
Ensuring the cases against groomers go to trial is vital in giving sexually exploited children confidence that the justice system does work for them; that if they come forward, they will be believed and supported'.
It stated: 'The predominant offender profile of Pakistani Muslim males... combined with the predominant victim profile of white females has the potential to cause significant community tensions.
'There is a potential for a backlash against the vast majority of law abiding citizens from Asian/Pakistani communities from other members of the community believing their children have been exploited.
'These factors, combined with an EDL protest in Dudley in April and a General Election in May could notably increase community tension.
'Police will be criticised if it appears we have not safeguarded vulnerable children, investigated offences and prosecuted offenders.'
The lengthy report concluded authorities in the West Midlands needed to improve its care of missing care home children.
It stated: 'There is strong evidence in the vast majority of all cases that the victims are enticed, stupefied or controlled by alcohol and a mixture of controlled drugs.
'The victims are already suffering from health conditions relating to their chaotic lifestyle and exploitation (Pregnancy, termination, STDs, neglect, and physical and psychological problems).'
West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said: 'These reports, spanning six years, give a real insight into the journey we have undertaken along with our partners into investigating and tackling child sexual exploitation.
'There is no doubt that there has been a significant cultural change within the force in respect of this issue and it is now very clear that the responsibility of tackling CSE (child sexual exploitation) lies with every police officer, staff member, PCSO and special constable.
'The force has carried out extensive work to train officers across the force in how to identify and deal with CSE so we can gain as much intelligence as possible and thereby improving the outcomes for victims.
'We continue to take great steps and as a result of our efforts and without doubt the coverage within local and national media, we are seeing more victims coming forward to report abuse, knowing we will take their allegations seriously and treat them sensitively and respectfully.'

'We owe Vince a huge debt of gratitude, what he did was priceless and he did it without a second thought. We can't thank him enough.
'It might seem like only a small thing but people are reluctant to help strangers out now.'
Mr Lofus and Mr Bolam were driving their van back from a job in Liverpool when Mr Lofus began feeling ill.
'Usually Tom has his medication with him but we'd left in such a rush he had forgotten it,' said Mr Bolam. 'Then the heat of the day had taken its toll on him too and was making it worse.
We owe Vince a huge debt of gratitude, what he did was priceless and he did it without a second thought. We can't thank him enough. It might seem like only a small thing but people are reluctant to help strangers out now
'We thought if we got him home he would be fine but once we were stuck in traffic he really took a funny turn and we knew it was serious.'
Mr Brown had been stuck on the stretch of road for two hours when he spotted Mr Lofus in distress.
Since the traffic was at a standstill, he got out of his van to see if he could help.
He offered Mr Lofus two cereal bars and a Cadbury's Brunch chocolate bar that he had brought along for himself. Moments later, he returned and gave Mr Lofus three bottles of water.
Mr Bolam, who lives in Bury, Greater Manchester, said: 'What impressed us most is that Vince wasn't looking for praise or thanks, he just did it out of the goodness of his heart.
'He is obviously just the kind of guy who is happy to help out where he can - and we really needed it in this instance, or who knows what might have happened to Tom.'
In recognition of Mr Brown's kindness, Mr Bolam uploaded a post about his actions to Facebook. It has now been shared more than 21,000 times and has more than 45,000 'likes'.
Mr Brown said: 'I've been completely overwhelmed by the response. I don't consider it a big act of kindness, it's just something I would do for anyone really.

'I have stopped my van before when I've seen people broken down and offered them a drink or an apple and so on in case they have been stranded a while.
'I think it's important to offer help when you can.'
The driver, who recently celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary, has worked for DHL driving exclusively for Iceland for 15 years.
Nick Canning, Joint Managing Director at Iceland said: 'We pride ourselves on providing an excellent service - wherever we are!
'And this is exactly the kind of upstanding behaviour we encourage from any member of the Iceland family. We want to congratulate Vince for being such a hero.'
After seeing the post online, a number of social media users shared their memories of Mr Brown being kind and helping them.
Julie Williams said: 'Vince is a lovely man, l remember him from when l worked at Iceland, and this doesn't surprise me.'
Jody Bate said: 'He's a dude. Always make him a hot drink when he calls at our store and he's always ready to chat and willing to help. Good on ya Vince.'
Sirah Younis said: 'I've only met this driver a couple of times when he delivered to our store and he was really nice! Well done to him!'
Paul Bayliss said: 'Vince is a true hero, his act of kindness restorers our faith in todays society. He is a credit and shines as an exampled to all of us that there are kind people out there. Vince we salute you and wish you many years of happiness as you deserve the best in life.'
Gaynor Longmire said: 'Vince is a great fella, and it always a pleasure to see him when he delivers to our shop...a true gentleman with a heart of gold.'

Speaking at the palace on Thursday, James revealed that his ultimate royal appearance would come from Prince Harry, but then again any royal appearance would be a dream come true.
'I can absolutely say that any member of the royal family,' he joked. 'Should they wish to, the invitation will always be there to do a Carpool Karaoke.'
'I don't imagine they'll take me up on it, but should they ever wish they are all welcome, yes.'
Happy families: James, joined here by his mother and father, recently said that his mum was busily trying to decide what to wear to the ceremony

At the time that James' accolade was announced he joked that his mother was already fretting about her outfit, saying: 'My family are very proud. My mum is already fretting about what to wear.'
But it looked like faithful partner Julia didn't have any trouble picking out the right thing and looked elegant in black and white.
She wore black patent heels to set off an a-line dress with lily floral detail, a clutch bag in her hand just rested by her side.
Also being honoured on the day was television presenter Esther, bold in deep red, who was being made a Dame.
What an honour: Corden was delivered the honour by the Princess Royal, who he shook hands with

Matching manicure: She held up the honour with a matching manicure on her fingertips

	This group of migrants, many of them elderly, were photographed on Grosvenor Place - one of the exclusive roads that borders the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

        <MainBody>Groom's heartwarming reaction as bride walks down aisle
Curled up: Two women huddle together for warmth as they sleep in the doorway on Grosvenor Place in central London
Packing up: In a matter of minutes the migrants can fold away their entire lives, ready for another day on the streets of the capital
A new day: Two rough sleepers stand in a doorway. It is estimated that some 40 per cent of London's homeless population are migrants
Homeless: One man curls up in front of one of the luxury addresses on Grosvenor Place in central London
Belongings: A group of people sleep beneath colourful blankets in one of the doorways - scraps of food on the ledge next to them
A spokesperson for Westminster City Council said: 'As this is private land, the council has no power to move people on but we will work with the leaseholders to support and advise them on a suitable resolution.
'We take the issue very seriously and commission outreach teams in the area to ensure the welfare and safety of those in genuine need of help.
'We work hard with the Police and Immigration Services to address any area where groups are involved in anti-social behaviour.'
The most recent photographs of the migrants have emerged as European leaders gather in Belgium to discuss the growing crisis facing the continent.
The 28 member states have faced a recent influx of illegal immigrants so desperate to live in Europe that they are risking their lives on dangerous road journeys and crossings of the Mediterranean.
And it comes just weeks after another group of migrants was pictured sleeping rough at Marble Arch. More than 70 migrants are now said to be sleeping rough in the area - with some of them, believed to be Eastern Europeans.
Owners of nearby businesses have said not enough is being done to tackle the problem of migrants sleeping rough, some of whom have been living in the area for two years.
Westminster City Council has in the past campaigned to remove migrants from the area - at one point even buying them tickets home - but said earlier this month it needs tougher powers to enforce their removal.
TACKLING HOMELESSNESS ON THE STREET OF LONDON
All local authorities in the UK have been given a target to reduce people sleeping rough in the community.
Councils work alongside teams from outreach groups, the Metropolitan Police and, in the case of migrant rough sleepers, Home Office Immigration Enforcement, to assess the needs of rough sleepers and help provide them with accommodation.
Outreach teams and other services work to help rough sleepers into a range of accommodation types, most commonly hostels but also the private rented sector and residential treatment centres.
Services also help people to reconnect to their home area or country, where they are more likely to find a solution to their homelessness, for example through appropriate support networks, entitlement to accommodation or access to an alcohol treatment centre.
Last year, the Government pledged that arrested foreign nationals would face deportation under an EU law that states those wanting to remain here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient.
Westminster Council has previously held high-level talks with Home Office officials about the issue, after the number of Romanian rough sleepers in Central London jumping from 20 in January to 59 in May 2014.
Cramped: A man reaches out and stretches before packing up his belongings into the carrier bags strewn on the doorstep around him
Moving on: Hours before the morning commuters arrive on the street, two women drag their pull-along trolleys from their temporary shelter

The court heard that inspectors found the decaying animals in different parts of the house, with used tea bags stacked up against one of the decomposing dogs
Mr McCole said: 'He could smell something rotting when he got to the back door. He pushed the door open to be greeted by an horrific sight.
Horrific: Emma Clarke left ten animals to starve to death, telling the RSPCA that she had re-homed them
Sickening: Clark, 28, left three dogs, two cats, two rabbits, two snakes and a lizard locked in cages with no food or water
'There was no evidence of any water available for any of the severely emaciated animals.
'The defendant's parents were shocked and horrified when the RSPCA spoke to them.
'They had been led to believe the animals had been re-homed at an earlier stage but the evidence showed that wasn't the case.
These animals will have suffered, starving to death in cages, it would have been horrible
RSPCA inspector Sheona Morley
'The animals had died while in the defendant's care and control.
'She had just given up. She returned to the house from time to time but hadn't provided food, sustenance or water for the animals.'
In a police interview, Clark confirmed she was responsible for all the animals but said she'd been having serious family problems and that 'everything just went wrong'.
Addressing the magistrates herself, Clark said: 'I didn't want any of these things to happen.'
Clark, of no fixed abode, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the ten animals over a period of nearly four months. She was jailed for 18 weeks and banned from owning animals for life.
She was also ordered to pay 300 costs and an 80 victim surcharge.
Tragic: Shockingly, some of the pets were thought to have been dead for up to five months by the time they were finally found
Distressing footage played to the court showed RSPCA officers finding the decaying and mummified animals in Clark's former home
Clark was jailed for 18 weeks and banned from keeping animals before leaving the pets to starve to death
Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA inspector Sheona Morley said: 'In my 20 years, this is the most horrific case I've ever been to - it is also the saddest.
'This was a case of horrific cruelty which could have been easily avoided if she had asked for help from her friends and family or tried to re-home her animals.
'It was absolute horror to see all those animals had died from starvation, left in their cages with no access to food or water.
'This is an incredibly sad case, everyone involved is absolutely devastated - these animals will have suffered, starving to death in cages, it would have been horrible.
'Whatever sentence she got nothing is going to undo the suffering caused to those poor animals.
'Nothing can undo what happened to these poor animals. There's no excuse for that kind of cruelty.'

	Immigration and an ageing population have fuelled a boom in the number of people living in the UK, official figures released by the Office for National Statistics revealed this morning.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

The population increase over   was fuelled by growing numbers of births over deaths, caused by people living longer, and a surge in migration.
'Natural growth'  of 226,200 accounted for around half the population increase - with net migration of 259,700 making up the rest.
Between mid-2013 and mid-2014, 582,600 migrants arrived in the UK, compared with just 322,900 people leaving the country.
An ONS spokesman said the statistics meant the UK population had grown by almost half a million since mid-2013, up 0.77 per cent to 64,596,800.
Out of the wider UK population, England accounted for 54.3 million, up 0.84 per cent, with the Scottish population hitting 5.3 million - up 0.37 per cent.
Wales's population has grown 0.31 per cent to 3.1 million, with a further 1.8 million living in Northern Ireland.

Tower Hamlets had the largest population increase in the country - increasing 34.5 per cent over just 10 years.
This was because 56,300 people came to the area from overseas and 12,000 left the area to live elsewhere in the UK, giving a net migration gain of 44,400.A further 32,700 more people were born in the area than died, the figures showed.
Eight of the 10 local authorities with the biggest population growth between 2004 and 2014 were in London.The remaining two were Corby in the East Midlands and Slough in the South East.
There were 16 local authorities, meanwhile, which saw their population fall over the last decade. The greatest loss was seen in Kensington &amp; Chelsea in West London - which lost 5.8 per cent of its population.
The main driver of this decrease was net internal migration, a high number of people moving to live elsewhere in the UK.
However, the majority of local authorities suffering falling populations were in the North of England.
The populations of Barrow-in-Furness and Cleveland slumped as families moved to other areas of the country for work.

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Duncan Smith told MPs: 'I believe today's figures demonstrate that if you deal with the root causes of poverty - and I believe this Government is doing that - then even under a measure of poverty I have consistently over the last few years described as flawed, you can still have an impact.'
The Tory government is planning to scrap Labours controversial child poverty target within weeks.
The legally binding target to eradicate child poverty by 2020 is to be repealed.
In a speech this week, David Cameron said: 'Because of the way it is measured, we are in the absurd situation where if we increase the state pension, child poverty actually goes up.
Poverty levels remained level in the last year, but the proportion of people in absolute low income after hosuing costs has risen steadily in recent years
Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: 'Politicians might understand these measurements but the electorate certainly doesn't. What I hope would interest the electorate is action to prevent poor children becoming poor adults.
'We must therefore begin talking about, and measuring, poor children's life chances and how they can be improved. It is important that such measurements are accurate, but that they can also safely drive anti-poverty policy.'
However, charities warned that levels of poverty were still too high and warned further benefits cuts would make the problem worse.
Javed Khan, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, said:'Every child living in poverty is a child that's being let down. Child poverty is a direct reflection of a failure, as a society, to protect our most vulnerable families.
'Poverty is blighting the life chances of our children, making them more likely to fall sick, do less well at school and be unemployed in the future. Government plans to cut struggling families' incomes further by changing tax credits is deeply concerning.'
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said work remained the best root out of poverty, and called on companies to increase pay for their staff ahead of planned cuts to tax credits
Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: 'Moving the goalposts by changing the definition of child poverty will do nothing to help the millions of children who are suffering in real poverty.
'The Government needs to stop debating definitions and start doing more to help children.'
The 28billion budget for tax credits paid to working people is expected to suffer the biggest cuts in George Osborne's Budget on July 8.
Tax credits are paid to people whose income from work is judged not enough to live on.
Ministers have demanded that firms pay their staff properly instead of relying on the benefit system to top up their workers' wages through tax credits.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'The extreme cuts to tax credits the Government is planning for working families will do nothing to raise wages and will leave low-paid families even worse off. There's a big danger this will start poverty rates rising again.'

Another shot shows a massive crowd of children gathered at the flogging site, with young fathers holding theirs sons and elderly men struggling to view the atrocity from behind teenage boys.
Bizarrely, at least two of the boys wear football shirts belonging to Western clubs - Italy's AC Milan and France's Paris Saint-Germain - a chilling reminder of how their innocence is being corrupted by witnessing rape, massacre and unduly harsh public punishments on a near-daily basis.
Throughout the month of Ramadan, which began last Thursday, the majority of Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and having sex from dawn until sunset.
For most Muslims around the world, fasting is down to personal willpower, but under the brutal rule of ISIS, which regularly stages public beheading, stonings and crucifixions those accused if crimes, the punishments for not obeying religious law is unsurprisingly harsh.

ISIS MILITANTS RE-ENTER KOBANE: JIHADIS DETONATE SUICIDE BOMB AND LEAVE BODIES STREWN ACROSS SYRIAN TOWN'S STREETS
ISIS fighters have re-entered the key Syrian town of Kobane, detonating a suicide bomb and battling Kurdish forces in the streets.
At least 12 people have been killed and 70 wounded as the terror group attacked the town on three sides after reportedly coming across the border from Turkey.
ISIS battled for four months to seize the border town last year, but Kurdish fighters backed by US-led air strikes wrestled back control in January in a symbolic victory.
In the months since, forces of the Kurdish People's Protection Units have advanced from Kobane in Aleppo province into neighbouring Raqqa province, a stronghold of ISIS.
In recent days, they captured the strategic town of Tal Abyad, also on the border with Turkey, and pushed towards ISIS's de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa city in the Euphrates valley to the south.
The news comes just days after ISIS savages tied two young boys to a beam by their wrists and left them hanging in the air for several hours after accusing them of breaking the Ramadan fast.
The shocking incident took place in the village of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor province and involved boys 'aged under 18', according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights.
The Hisbah, seized the two boys at some point over the weekend and suspended them from a pole in a public square alongside a placard informing passers by that the pair were being punished for eating during daylight hours.
Residents of the village of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor province reported that IS suspended from a crossbar two boys aged under 18 near the HQ of the Hisbah', Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based human rights monitor revealed.
'The children have been suspended by ropes from a pole since noon, and they were still there in the late evening... Apparently, they were caught eating,' he added.
A placard was attached to the bodies reading 'They broke the fast with no religious justification'.

'Warsaw Modlin Airport received an anonymous call that there was an explosive device on a Ryanair aircraft due to take off from Modlin to Oslo at 8.40am local time,' the spokesman said.
'The airport security authorities ordered an immediate inspection of the aircraft (which hadn't yet boarded) and closed the airport to inbound arrivals as a security precaution.'

The spokesman went on: 'Warsaw Modlin believes this is a hoax call and expect the security sweep to confirm this fact. They expect to release the aircraft and reopen the airport shortly.
'Ryanair sincerely apologises to the customers of the outbound Oslo flight for any inconvenience caused by this hoax call.'
Earlier reports from the news agency Reuters had suggested that the plane was forced into an emergency landing at the airport and that the captain had radioed the airport requesting clearance.
