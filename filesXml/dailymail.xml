	The court handed famed photographer Francois-Marie Banier (pictured) a three-year prison sentence and a £250,000 fine for the scam, in which he was accused of manipulating her into giving him riches.

The judgement marks the end of the 'Bettencourt Affair,' as it has been dubbed in France, a politico-financial scandal that wound its way through French courts and newspapers for years, and only this year came to trial.
It began in 2007, when Bettencourt's daughter accused the photographer of manipulating her elderly mother into giving him artwork, cash and other favours worth hundreds of millions of euros.
Banier, godfather to Johny Depp's daughter, is said to have done all he could to make Mrs Bettencourt appoint him as her sole heir, the court heard.
The trial centred around a feud between billionaire heiress Mrs Bettencourt (pictured) and her daughter Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers
He met Mrs Bettencourt in 1987, and the heiress took him under her wing, lavishing him with life insurance funds and millions in cash.
Banier, who owns two flats in Paris, two properties in Marrakesh, Morocco, and another in the south of France, told the court he had assets and money 'well before knowing Liliane Bettencourt.'
'She found pleasure in giving the money,' he said, adding that Bettencourt was in no way diminished mentally when he knew her.
Banier, who owns two flats in Paris, two properties in Marrakesh, Morocco, and another in the south of France, told the court he had assets and money 'well before knowing Liliane Bettencourt.'
Judges ruled that Banier had exercised 'real psychological and moral control' over his elderly 'friend'.
The trial - which was rocked from the beginning when one of  the accused, Alain
Thurin
, had attempted to commit suicide the day before it started - centred around a feud between Mrs Bettencourt and her daughter Francoise
Bettencourt Meyers
that grew into a complex web of betrayal and dodgy dealings involving close to a dozen people.
It also involved a butler's betrayal, advancing dementia, unscrupulous friends and cash-filled envelopes for senior politicians.
The case eventually widened to include 10 defendants, including some of Mrs Bettencourt's closest advisers and staff who stood accused of taking advantage of the elderly widow.
Mrs Bettencourt was placed under the guardianship of one of her grandsons four years
ago,
after she was diagnosed with dementia.
Many expected former president  Sarkozy to have been dragged into proceedings, but he was cleared of any
wrong doing
last year.
Potential charges of tax evasion against Mrs Bettencourt were also dropped.
This was despite prosecutors accusing Mr Sarkozy's lieutenants of illegally accepting brown envelopes full of cash from Mrs Bettencourt in order to fund his election campaign in 2007.
French authorities also ordered Mrs Bettencourt to pay back some 86 million in unpaid taxes after allegedly trying to hush up her purchase of an entire island in the Seychelles.

	FSA finds three-quarters of supermarket chickens test positive for food poisoning bug campylobacter
      </title>

        <Description>
	A Food Standards Agency survey revealed 19 per cent of chickens in British supermarkets were found to contain the highest rate of the bug, which affects an estimated 280,000 people a year.

Around one in five birds, or 19 per cent, were contaminated at the highest and most risky level.
More than one in 20 carried the bug on the outside of packs, which means simply lifting them off the shelf could put shoppers at risk.
Asda had a higher-than-average incidence of chicken contaminated at the highest level, while Tesco was the only supermarket to fall below the industry average
Campylobacter is the most common cause of food poisoning in Britain, responsible for some 280,000 infections a year and 100 deaths. The cost is put at 900million in terms of NHS treatment and lost productivity caused by people being off work sick.
HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF
The FSA is advising consumers to protect themselves by storing raw chicken separately from other food.
Shoppers should keep it covered and chilled on the bottom shelf of the fridge, it said.
Consumers should also not wash raw chicken as this splashes the germs on to surfaces.
Everything that has touched raw chicken should be washed in soap and hot water, including hands and utensils.
Home cooks should also check chicken is cooked properly until it is steaming hot throughout with no pink meat and the juices run clear.
The FSA named Asda, Britains second biggest supermarket, as the worst offender with a contamination rate of 80.4 per cent across the 12 months. However, others were little better.
The watchdog has told all the supermarkets it expects them to deliver big cuts in contamination levels to protect public health.
It has set a target of no more than one in ten chickens being contaminated at the highest level. But its figures show that not one store has yet managed to meet this.
When the FSA began its survey in February last year, the proportion of birds that were contaminated was 53.1 per cent. This rose to 74.1 per cent in tests carried out in February this year, giving an average of 73 per cent for the year.
Experts believe the increase may have something to do with the relatively mild and wet weather this year, which encourages the spread of the bug. Professor Brendan Wren said the situation is so serious that radical action is needed to keep campylobacter out of the food chain, including the development of a vaccine to immunise the national flock.
Food Standards Agency: 'The truth about campylobacter'
The FSA estimates that 280,000 people fall ill with the UK's most common cause of food poisoning each year. Most recover after two or three days of stomach problems, however the bug can cause complications, including paralysis and even death with some 100 fatalities a year
Professor Wren, of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: It is a national scandal that we readily accept such a toxic food poisoning organism into our kitchens.
The FSA advises home cooks to avoid touching the skin of the chickens and to cook the birds thoroughly. However this is not a guarantee against catching the bug.
Paul Wigley, professor of avian infection and immunity at Liverpool University, said: The biology of this bug make its control extremely difficult.
Whilst a few hundred bacteria can make someone ill, chickens may carry many millions of the bug with relatively little disease.
He said that all types of chicken, including organic and free range, are just as likely to be infected.
The FSA has praised a number of retailers  particularly Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-op  for introducing regimes that are reducing contamination levels and said it expected other supermarkets to follow them.
The benefits of these changes came too late to be captured in the FSAs survey, which involved testing more than 4,000 chickens.
Last week Asda announced an action plan to tackle the bug. This involves blasting its chickens with steam and ultrasound.
Along with most other supermarkets, it is also moving to sell chicken in roast in the bag packs.
Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium, which speaks for the stores, said: Retailers continue to invest with suppliers in practical solutions that will make a real difference in tackling this issue. While it remains a challenge, we are determined to find a solution as quickly as possible.

	Rail strike next month as RMT rejects new deal for Network Rail staff

	Rail commuters face at least 72-hours of travel misery next month after the RMT union rejected a pay deal on offer from Network Rail and announced two walkouts for June 4  and June 9.

The latest offer has now been rejected following fresh anger at the money sloshing around for bonuses for senior managers. It followed news that 60million was handed out in bonuses by Network Rail across its 36,000 staff last year.
But while some of this went to senior executives, thousands of workers, including engineers, were also entitled to bonuses worth up to 50 per cent of their salaries. Even the most junior staff earned up to 1,500 a year in performance-related bonuses despite the company missing every single target on punctuality last year.

Hard-pressed commuters will struggle to get home on June 4 as rail staff plan to walk out at 5pm for 24 hours
RMT workers will walk out on June 9 at 5pm for 48 hours unless Network Rail improves its current pay offer
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said staff were angry at attacks on their standards of living.
He said: Our rail staff deserve a fair reward for the high pressure, safety-critical work that they undertake day and night.
The union said it expected rock-solid support for the strike action, and announced it had launched a new campaign to win over the public called Our Jobs  Your Safety.
Members of the RMT will walk out for 24 hours on Thursday, June 4, from 5pm and for 48 hours from Tuesday, June 9, at the same time.
Rail workers had planned a strike for Bank Holiday Monday
Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne, pictured, said the strike would 'massively disrupt' commuters
The workers, including signallers and maintenance staff, will also refuse to work overtime from June 6 to June 12.
Mr Cash said: The blunt truth is that this dispute could be settled for a fraction of the money being handed out in senior manager bonuses and to the train operators for not running services.
New rules laid out in the Queens Speech will soon require unions to achieve a turnout of at least 50 per cent for a strike to be valid.
In transport, health, fire and education sectors, 40 per cent of those entitled to vote must back the action.
But the new laws would not have stopped the planned strike action by the RMT.
The union said it achieved a 60 per cent turnout and that 80 per cent of these backed a strike, while 92 per cent voted for other forms of industrial action, which is well above the new thresholds.
Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: It is clearly unacceptable for the RMT to massively disrupt the travelling public with strike action when we are ready to continue talks.

The prisoner, whose face and upper body are covered in cuts and bruises, is first made to speak to the camera 'admitting' his wrongdoings.
Speaking in Arabic, he says he is fromAl-Qaryatayn, a town in central Syria, and describes his work as a spy.
He concludes: 'I killed Abu Hassan and the Islamic State came and captured me.'
The captive, who gives his name as Ziad Abdelal Abu Tarek, is filmed walking barefoot in an orange jumpsuit across barren land to a pick axe and shovel, before digging the grave.
A white truck pulls up behind him bearing the recognisable black ISIS flag, and the footage then cuts to a shot of him kneeling on the ground in front of his executioner. The video also shows the aftermath of the barbaric killing.
Last week, shocking images emerged showing decapitated bodies strewn across blood-filled streets in Palmyra, close to Al-Qaryatayn after ISIS stormed the ancient city.

Thereafter a clean dry towel with crushed ice was put round the leg of the alleged victim (Just in case the leg swelled up to the size of Saturn, resulting in a lunar explosion).
The alleged victim was offered a choice of plasters, however we were out of Does this plaster match my outfit variety, so it was either skin coloured plasters or those bright blue ones. The skin tone plasters seemed to do the job.
Mr Bothwell continued: I, yes, me made regular appearances at your table and made sure the leg wasnt going to drop off and there wasnt a sea of blood flooding down the middle of the restaurant and to check if you were enjoying your meal - and given that your collective faces were smiling from ear to ear, I took that as a yes.

All is well. I revisited your table about 15 minutes before you were going to leave and the vino had made its bed in your head. At which point you started feeling my backside. And that is how it went.

The restaurant - which charges 21.30 for a three-course evening meal - has received an average rating from TripAdvisor customers of four stars for its food, value, service and atmosphere.
It is ranked just outside the top 10 per cent of the 492 restaurants in Aberdeen, and has been awarded the TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence for 'consistently earning great reviews'.
Among its main course are mussels with white wine, cream, red peppers, organic chives and bacon; and pan-fried breast of chicken with courgette, green beans and shiitake mushroom sauce.
The restaurant - which is open from 12pm to midnight Monday to Saturday, and 12pm to 4pm on Sunday - is now in its 20th year having been launched in 1995 by MrBothwell.

TRIPADVISOR - BOTH A BLESSING AND CURSE FOR HOTELIERS?
In 2013 three British holidaymakers were escorted out of a Nashville hotel by an armed guard after they threatened to give the business a bad review on TripAdvisor.
In 2014 it was reported that an Oregon hotel was suing a TripAdvisor user who alleged in a review that its housekeeping staff were high or drunk and that the owner smokes weed.
The reviewer, who went by the username 12Kelly, also wrote that breakfast is nasty, the rooms are nasty and Jen front desk had phone sex with someone, the defamation suit said.
Last year MailOnline reported that hotels and restaurants are being targeted by 'blackmailers' who demand free meals and stays in exchange for not writing bad reviews on TripAdvisor, hospitality chiefs have warned.
The fraudsters are telling staff they will post bad comments on the review site if they don't get better service, free food or upgrades.
Restaurant, hotel and B&amp;B owners across the UK have reported a huge rise in the number of customers who use TripAdvisor as a threat.
The website can be used to review attractions as well.
It may be one of the most iconic shots in the musical history, but Abbey Road has left visitors to the scene somewhat disappointed.
Hilarious TripAdvisor reviews show how the world's most famous zebra crossing has even been slammed as 'just a street'.
The Abbey Road crossing became a must-see site for fans after The Beatles were snapped walking across it for the cover of their 11th studio album.
The hilarious reviews on TripAdvisor brand the crossing as 'Extremely Disappointing' and say it 'Could be a pedestrian crossing anywhere really.'

	Rabbis have also said that children dropped off at London schools by their mothers should be turned away because women drivers break 'the traditional rules of modesty in our camp' (file picture).

Women have been barred from driving in Saudi Arabia since the establishment of the state in 1932 and last year a woman reportedly received 150 lashes after being caught behind the wheel.
In December two women's rights campaigners who tried to drive into Saudi Arabia were told they would face a special 'terrorism' court for flouting the ban on women motorists.
In London Belz sect members run at least two large schools in north London, which educate hundreds of young Jews.
Talmud Torah Machzikei Hadass and Beis Malka are rated 'good' by Ofsted. 
Despite some rabbis backing the ban the Jewish Chronicle says that several of their wives do drive.
One woman, who asked not to be named, said the proposal 'disables women' because 'the more kids they have, the more they need to drive'.
And of the rabbis she said: 'They say one thing, they do another'.
Home: There are Belz synagogues in north London, pictured, and some of the group's rabbis have backed calls for women not to drive
Last year another sect caused anger in the Stamford Hill area when an orthodox Jewish group organised a religious parade but demanded men and women walk on different sides of the road.
Belz Rebbe is an ancient Polish-Jewish dynasty which has its roots in the 14th Century in the Polish town of the same name, and is one of the main Hasidic sects.
Hasidic Jews wear clothes similar to that worn by their ancestors in 18th and 19th century Europe - and this style of attire is also said to help them to focus on their sense of tradition and spirituality.
They set up their headquarters in Israel after the Second World War and in 2013 the wedding of the group's leader's grandson was attended by 25,00 guests.
The biggest communities outside Israel are found in the United States, England, Belgium and Australia.
Their lives revolve around religious study, prayer and family - and many live without television, films, the internet or secular publications.
The men generally have beards and sidelocks (peyot) and women tend to wear long skirts and shirts with long sleeves and high necklines as they adhere to strict guidelines of modesty.
After the women get married, they cover their heads with either scarves, hats or wigs, known as 'sheitels'.
THE ORTHODOX ARISTOCRACY: HOW THE BELZ DYNASTY WAS FOUNDED
The Belz orthodox sect has thousands of members worldwide
The founder of the dynasty was Rabbi Shalom Rokeach, also known as the Sar Shalom, who was inducted as the rabbi of Belz in Poland in 1817m and now
He personally helped build the city's large and imposing synagogue which stood until the Nazis invaded Belz in late 1939.
When Rabbi Shalom died in 1855, his youngest son, Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach, became the next Rebbe. The Belzer Hasidism sect grew in size during Rebbe Yehoshua's tenure and the tenure of his son and successor, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach.
Unlike other groups which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz maintained a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men who remained in the synagogue all day to study the Talmud, pray, and derive inspiration from their Rebbe.
With the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939, the town of Belz was thrown into turmoil. From 1939 to 1944 it was occupied by Nazi Germany as a part of the General Government.
Though the Germans attempted to destroy the Belz synagogue first by fire and then by dynamite, they were unsuccessful. Finally they conscripted Jewish men to take the building apart, brick by brick.
The Belz leader Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, known as the 'Wonder Rebbe' was at the top of the Gestapo's 'wanted list' of rabbis targeted for extradition and extermination during the Nazi occupation of Poland.
With cash inflow from Belzer Hasidim in Palestine, England and the United States, the Rebbe and his half-brother, Rabbi Mordechai of Bilgoray, managed to stay one step ahead of the Nazis in one miraculous escape attempt after another. The brothers were driven out of occupied Poland and into Hungary by a Hungarian counter-intelligence agent who was friendly to Jews.
Although he had lost his entire familyincluding his wife, children, grandchildren and in-laws and their familiesto the Nazis, Rebbe Aharon re-established his Hasidic court in Tel Aviv, where there was a small Hasidic community.
Both he and Rabbi Mordechai (who had lost his wife and daughter) remarried, but only Rabbi Mordechai had a child, Yissachar Dov Rokeach (II), in 1948. Rabbi Mordechai suddenly died a year later at the age of 47. Rebbe Aharon took his brother's son under his wing to groom him as the future successor to the Belz dynasty.
Like nearly all of the other groups originating in Poland, Belzer Hasdism was nearly wiped out by the Holocaust. Some Hasidic followers from other communities joined Belz after the war and following the deaths of their rebbes. Belz, like Ger and Satmar, was comparatively fortunate in that its leadership remained intact and survived the war, as opposed to many other Hasidic groups which suffered losses both in terms of rank-and-file supporters, as well as the physical decapitation of their leaders.
Rebbe Aharon became an acknowledged leader of Haredi Judaism in Israel. He laid the groundwork for the spread of Belzer Hasidism through the establishment of schools and yeshivas in Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak and Jerusalem.
Since 1966, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach has presided over both the expansion of Belz educational institutions and the growth of Hasidic populations in Israel, the United States, and Europe. Under the Rebbe's leadership, the Belz Hasidut has grown from a few hundred families at the time of his accession to leadership in 1966, to over 7,000 families as of 2011.

	British mother collapsed and died from allergic reaction from sorbet in Greece

	Amanda Thompson (pictured), from Rochdale, complained of 'a tingling sensation' in her tongue after eating the strawberry flavoured dessert while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Rhodes
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
Travel agent Thomson, with whom the family had booked their holiday, offered its 'deepest sympathies'.
However, her husband Ian and Mrs Thompson's two sons are planning on taking legal action against the holiday company for their role in their mum's passing.
Upon arriving at the Aegean Atlantica hotel in Rhodes in July 2012, Mrs Thompson made the hotel's management aware of her concerns.
The Thompson family - mum Amanda, dad Ian and their two sons - were staying here, at the four and a half star TripAdvisor rated Aegean Atlantica hotel in Rhodes (pictured) in July 2012
She is said to have made known to the holiday agent - as well as the hotel - that she needed food specially preparing as she had severe allergies particularly to dairy products.
On the second night of her holiday she collapsed and died after having eaten food specifically provided for her.
According to the BBC , her husband provided evidence at the hearing in which he detailed how his wife complained of feeling a 'tingling' feeling after she'd eaten the sorbet.
He said she then voiced concerns that she was experiencing an allergic reaction.
In the wake of the tragedy, a Greek pathologist concluded that Mrs Thompson died of natural causes.
He said it was probably due to heart failure.
But grieving Mr Thompson insisted he always attributed his wife's passing to anaphylactic shock - a belief later confirmed by a British pathologist, the hearing was told.

HOW NUMBER OF ALLERGY SUFFERERS IN UK HAS TREBLED IN 20 YEARS
EpiPen's contain a single dose of epinephrine, which is injected into a sufferers thigh muscle
The number of people in Britain affected by allergies has trebled in the past 20 years to around 21 million, according to Allergy UK.
Allergies can range from hayfever to reactions to food, medication and wasp stings and more than 20,000 people are admitted to hospital each year for allergic reactions.
Nearly all of those living with a severe allergy say their daily life is affected by the condition.
Around 90 per cent of food allergy problems are caused by cows' milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, nuts, fish and shellfish.
Classic symptoms range from rashes, swelling, eczema, diarrhoea, vomiting, asthma and headaches.
In severe cases, food allergies can cause an anaphylactic reaction - when the body goes into shock. Anaphylaxsis can be fatal if it is not treated.
An allergy is the sign the immune system has overreacted to a normally harmless substance, such as pollen, food and house dust mites. While allergies occur partly because of genetic predisposition, environment is important, too.
Many Britons are unaware of the seriousness of having allergies, with a poll of more than 2,000 adults revealing that over two thirds do not know how to help if they saw someone suffering a reaction.
While there is currently no cure for many allergies, sufferers can carry a pre-loaded adrenaline injection, known as an EpiPen. And antihistamines can be used for more minor reactions.
EpiPen's contain a single dose of epinephrine, which is injected into a sufferers thigh muscle.
An allergy to peanuts is the most severe of all the food allergies, with the symptoms of a reaction triggered by a tiny trace of peanut protein.
The inquest revealedthat neither the hotel's own management or Thomson had launched investigations into Mrs Thompson's death.
Mr Nelson said he found that 'astonishing'.
Louise Wilcox, partner at solicitors AST Hampsons, who were representing Mrs Thompson's family, said: 'The conclusions of the coroner have been welcomed by Mr Thompson and his family.
Mr Thompson has always believed that his wife's death was as a direct result of food eaten at the hotel, but not until the conclusion of the inquest was this acknowledged
Louise Wilcox, the Thompson family's legal representative
'Mr Thompson has always believed that his wife's death was as a direct result of food eaten at the hotel, but not until the conclusion of the inquest was this acknowledged.
'Whilst the family remain devastated for the loss there is some relief that they finally have the answers as to what actually happened to Amanda.
'We will now be taking legal action in the civil courts as the family believe that Amanda's death should have been avoidable.
'The family are extremely grateful to the coroner for the thorough nature of the Inquiry.'
Package holiday specialists Thomson released a statement, saying: 'We note the verdict of the inquest today and we'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the family at this extremely difficult time.'

	Two of the men, Shahsawar Baluch and Sabir Baluch were hanged in Hyderabad prison in southern Sindh province while the third, Shabir Rind, was hanged in Karachi, officials said.

But he instead flew to Hyderabad city, 100 miles north east of Karachi, tricking the hijackers into thinking that they were in India.
The following day Pakistani commandos overpowered all the three hijackers in a night operation.
Officials said the executed hijackers were Baluch nationalists who were demanding greater autonomy for they resource-rich but impoverished province.
At the time of the hijacking, officials said that one of the hijackers' demands was for Pakistan not to carry out the nuclear tests which were to due to be carried out in Baluchistan.
The trio were sentenced to death for hijacking a Pakistan International Airlines aircraft with 30 passengers on board on 24th May 1998 - four days before the country's first nuclear test
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a de facto moratorium on the death penalty for those convicted on terrorism charges on 17 December 2014 when Taliban gunmen killed 136 children at an army-run school
Pakistan went on to carry out five underground tests in the Baluchistan desert on 28 May 1998, in response to arch-rival India's second nuclear tests earlier in the month.
Separately on Thursday, a fourth hanging was also carried out, in Karachi jail, the prison official said.
The executed man, Mahmood Ali, had been awarded the death sentence for murdering a three-year-old child in 2003.
A moratorium on the death penalty had been in force in Pakistan since 2008, but executions resumed last December after Taliban militants gunned down 154 people, most of them children, at a school in the restive northwest.
The moratorium was initially lifted only for those convicted of terrorism offences, but in March was extended to cover all capital offences.
The number of people executed since the moratorium was lifted now stands at 131.

David Cameron kicked off a 48-hour whistlestop tour of European capitals today amid claims he could bring forward a vote on Britian's membership of the European Union by a year.
The Prime Minister arrived in the Netherlands this lunchtime for face-to-face talks with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte before a crunch meeting with French President Francois Hollande in Paris tonight.
Ahead of the talks the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that Britain would vote to leave the European Union if Mr Cameron's demands are blocked.

Mr Hammond insisted the Prime Minister was 'very confident' of winning sweeping reforms to Britain's relationship with Brussels before holding an in/out referendum - and revealed the vote could take place as early as next year.
But he said the PM was 'very clear' with other European leaders that Britain would walk away if they did not give way on his proposals to clamp down on benefit abuse and immigration rules.
Mr Cameron, who is starting a tour of European capitals today, has demanded changes to the EU's treaties to stop migrants fromreceivingwelfare -including government tax credits and childbenefit- for four years aftermovingtothe UK.
He also wants more protection for the UK against Eurozone stitch ups and an special opt out - making it clear Britain would not join an 'ever closer union' of European countries.

The Prime Minister held talks with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague this lunch time before travelling to Paris for a working dinner with President Hollande tonight.
A meeting will be held with Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz in Warsaw tomorrow before talks in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose backing will prove crucial if Mr Cameron is to secure serious reforms.
The whirlwind diplomatic push comes after the  question which will be put to the British people in the EU referendum was unveiled today.
Voters  will be asked to choose between saying 'Yes' to staying in and 'No' to sever ties with Brussels.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond fired a warning shot at European leaders today - claiming UK voters could opt to leave the EU
CAMERON'S KEY DEMANDS FOR EU REFORM BEFORE REFERENDUM
FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:
No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years
No social housing for four years
No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK
FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:
No support from the UK taxpayer
Deportation if they do not get a job for six months
Other measures include:
Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU
Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK
Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals
Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels
In an apparent attempt to ensure the campaign to remain in the EU has a more positive message, the question will be worded so the Yes campaign is in favour of staying in.
It means the negative No campaign led by Eurosceptics will be making the case for the UK to leave the 28-nation bloc.
But Mr Hammond, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, warned the Government would 'lose' the vote if the EU renegotiation failed.
He said: 'We're at the very beginning of a process here. The Prime Minister is starting his tour of European capitals today, talking to his counterparts across Europe.
'We have a clear set of requirements and the Prime Minister is very clear with dealing with European Union counterparts that if we are not able to deliver on these big areas of concern that the British people have then we will not win the referendum when it comes.
'We expect our European partners to engage with us on delivering a package that will enable the British people to decide that they think Britain's future is best delivered inside the European Union.'
Mr Hammond said the Government was prepared for a fight, but insisted it was confident of winning changes.
He said: 'We expect that some of our partners will adopt a hard line. But we are very confident that over the course of the summer and perhaps onwards through the winter we will be able to negotiate a substantial package of reform that will address the concerns that the British people have.'
The Foreign Secretary said he wanted the Government to speed up the negotiations.
He said: 'I would like us to get on with it. We've set December 31 2017 as the last possible date for a referendum.
'I would hope that we could get a substantial package of reform agreed much sooner than that. Then we can have a substantive referendum campaign where both sides of the argument can be properly aired and properly debated.'
Asked if it could be next year, Mr Hammond said: 'Possible.'
The Foreign Secretary played down suggestions that the renegotiation had already suffered a setback following reports that France and Germany had struck a deal to integrate the core eurozone group more closely without the need for fundamental treaty change.
Mr Hammond confirmed that the Government believed the reforms it was seeking - particularly on curbing migrants' access to benefits - would require changes to the EU treaties, potentially making it harder to get an agreement.
'The advice that we are getting is that we will need treaty change in order to underpin particularly the changes on migration and welfare benefits. That is the best legal advice that we are receiving,' he said.

Under the provisions of the EU Referendum Bill, being tabled in Parliament today, the referendum - which will determine whether the UK remains a member of the EU - has to be held before the end of 2017.
While Mr Hammond confirmed the Government had not ruled out the possibility that it could actually take place next year, he sought to play down the prospects of an early vote.
'I would urge people not to speculate on an early date. We are absolutely clear that we have to get this right. We are certainly not going to trade substantive reform just for getting it done quickly. We have to get it done properly,' he said.
The Conservatives' preferred wording for the in/out referendum question - 'Do you think that the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?' - has been dropped following concerns by the Electoral Commission that some people might think the country was not already a member.
Instead the watchdog's recommended choice for voters has been adopted in the EU Referendum Bill.
It reads: 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?'
Ukip leader Nigel Farage welcomed the wording. He said: 'It is a simple, straightforward, unambiguous question. That much is clear.'
But he added:'However, that Cameron is opting to give the pro-EU side the positive 'Yes' suggests strongly that his negotiations are so much fudge. He has already decided which way he wants the answer to be given, without a single power repatriated.'
EU REFERENDUM QUESTION REVEALED: 'SHOULD THE UNITED KINGDOM REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION':
Voters will be asked if the UK should 'remain a member' of the European Union when they go to the polls for the in/out referendum, Downing Street has confirmed.
The wording of the question that will appear on ballot papers means supporters of Britain retaining its ties to Brussels will form the 'Yes' campaign.
Details of the question and a commitment to staging the popular vote by the end of 2017 are contained in a Bill introduced into Parliament today.
Downing Street said the measures being published provide a 'concrete step' towards settling the row over Britain's links with Brussels.
The Conservatives' preferred wording for the in/out referendum question - ''Do you think that the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?'' - has been dropped following concerns by the Electoral Commission that some people might think the country was not already a member.

	ISIS 'destroys' lion god statue in captured Palmyra in Syria

	Following their capture of Palmyra last Thursday, ISIS militants are understood to have won the support of the local population by promising not to destroy the city's famous monuments.

The act of destroying the statue came just days after ISIS gathered Palmyra's citizens together and publicly promised not to bulldoze the city's ancient buildings, as they previously did in Nimrod.
'As for the historical monuments, we will not touch it with our bulldozers as some tend to believe,' ISIS commander Abu Leith was quoted as saying on a local radio broadcast.
However the promise did come with a get-out clause, as the depraved fighters insisted they would 'pulverise' any statues they discovered in the city that the believed citizens secretly prayed to.

Destroyed:This photograph shows rubble in Palmyra's streets caused by Syrian regime airstrikes on ISIS
Frontline of fighting: The buildings are said to have been reduced to rubble by Syrian regime warplanes
The lion statue in Palmyra dates from the first century AD and stood outside the city's famous Temple of Bel.
The statue was dedicated to the pre-Islamic Arabian goddess Al-Lat, who was one of the three chief goddesses of Mecca along with Manat and al-Uzza.
The Temple of Bel itself was built in 32 AD - six hundred years before the arrival of Islam in Syria - and was dedicated to the Semitic god Bel - who was worshiped by Palmyra citizens along withthe lunar god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol.
Since ISIS seized control of Palmyra, the temple and its surrounding area have been appropriated by ISIS militants, who are said to be using it as a military base.
Locals who preserved the site for the last 1,900 years are now said to be banned from entering the area unless the are willing to sign up to become ISIS jihadis.

ISIS is accused of executing hundreds of people in and around Palmyra since it swept into the oasis city last week after a lightning advance across the desert from its stronghold in the Euphrates Valley to the east.
But they have also released propaganda images showing the terrorists releasing prisoners from Tadmor Prison - with the convicts seen embracing one another in the streets after being freed.
Yesterday the extremists 'called people to watch' as they executed 20 local men in a Roman ampitheatre in the ancient Syrian city.
The men were shot dead in the restored ruin, which had been used for an annual festival in the city, in front of the crowd. The murdered locals were accused of being government supporters, according to a report from theSyrian Observatory for Human Rights.
'IS executed 20 men by firing on them in front of a crowd gathered in Palmyra's Roman theatre, after accusing them of fighting for the Syrian regime,' Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP.
He added: 'IS gathered a lot of people there on purpose, to show their force on the ground.'

Road to Palmyra deserted but inside the city people celebrate
This morning the European Union added a high-ranking Syrian military official to its sanctions list, as it extended measures against supporters of President Bashar al-Assad for another year.
The EU began imposing asset freezes and travel bans on Assad and his supporters in 2011 to protest a government crackdown on Assad's opponents. With Syria's civil war now in its fifth year, the sanctions list has grown to more than 200 people and 70 organisations.
EU governments decided to extend the sanctions another year and add one person to the list - a high-ranking military official the EU accused of being 'responsible for repression and violence against the civilian population in Damascus and Damascus countryside.'
The name of the official, who will be subject to an asset freeze and ban on travelling to the EU, will not be made public until details of the sanctions are published in the EU's Official Journal on Friday.
Other EU sanctions on Syria include restrictions on exporting equipment that might be used for internal repression and a ban on importing oil from Syria.
ISIS MILITANTS RELEASE CHILLING PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE HORRIFIC CONDITIONS INSIDE PALMYRA PRISON WHERE ASSAD'S SOLDIERS ONCE TORTURED THOUSANDS
Militants fighting for the Islamic State have released images of the horrific conditions in which those opposed to the Assad regime were kept at the notorious Tadmor Prison in Syria.
Following their capture of Palmyra last Thursday, ISIS jihadis released dozens of prisoners from the ancient city's jail, which is famous for the torture and summary execution of those held there.
Images of the now empty prison show tiny windowless jail cells where those accused of committing crimes were held in total darkness once the huge steel doors slammed shut.
Terrible conditions: Images of the now empty prison show tiny windowless jail cells where those accused of committing crimes were held in total darkness once the huge steel doors slammed shut
Horror: The new photographs reveal how conditions at the prison have hardly changed in decades - with prisoners held in disturbingly small cells with cold stone walls with no lighting or bedding
The only semblance of a toilet in the cells is a small hole in the floor, and even the corridors and communal areas are seen covered in mould - suggesting the building is riddled with damp and unlikely to have any sort of heating during Syria's long and bitterly cold winters.
Although the images of the now-deserted jail were released as part of a propaganda exercise by ISIS terrorists, they show a building notorious for the guards' brutal treatment of prisoners and even a state-sponsored massacre of those held there in the early 1980s.
Governor's office:Tadmor Prison was the scene of a horrific massacre on June 27, 1980 following an Islamist Muslim Brotherhood assassination attempt on the then president, Hafez al-Assad
Jail break: This picture shared on several pro-ISIS Twitter account claims to show prisoners celebrating with their liberators after being freed from the notorious Tadmur prison by ISIS fighters in Palmyra
Chilling footage shows conditions inside Palmyra prison
The new photographs reveal how conditions at the prison have hardly changed in decades - with prisoners held in disturbingly small cells with cold stone walls with no lighting or bedding.
The corridors of the prison are crumbling and the entire building looks as thought it was abandoned decades years ago.It is hard to believe the prison was crammed full of prisoners just last week.
Tadmor Prison was the scene of a horrific massacre on June 27, 1980 following an Islamist Muslim Brotherhood assassination attempt on the then president, Hafez al-Assad.
The day after the attempted attack, the president's brother Rifaat al-Assad ordered the country's Defence Brigades to enter the jail and butcher the prisoners. It is estimated that more than one thousand people were killed in the cells, dormitories and corridors of the prison.

She put Archie in a cold bath after the shock subsided but took him to hospital to have the burns looked at, where they learnt he had suffered immediate nerve damage.
Mrs Watkins and her husband Shaun, an electrician, were told Archie's injury was just shy of third degree burns - similar to suffered in severe fires and war zones.
Two years on from the incident, she is now urging other parents to beware of using straighteners of curling tongs near their children after learning that her son will be scarred for life.
The young mother is now using a stand to keeps straighteners irons and curling tongs out of the reach of toddlers.
She said: 'I can honestly say that had I had one at the time, Archie's accident would not have happened.'
His mother, Rebecca Watkins, 25, (pictured with her husband Shaun, left) rushed him to hospital where they found he had suffered immediate nerve damage
THE HAIR-RAISING TRUTH ABOUT STRAIGHTENERS: A THIRD OF WOMEN USE THEM AND THE NUMBER OF BURNS HAVE DOUBLED IN RECENT YEARS
It is claimed a third of all women  and even an astonishing one in five men  now own a pair of hair straighteners.
And while trichologists warn about the damage they directly cause to the actual hair follicles, little is known about their direct dangers.
Previously, straighteners had been steel-plated and took 20 minutes to reach an effective temperature, but now coated in ceramic they can take less than one minute to reach more than 200c.
Hair straighteners can get as hot as an iron. So hot, in fact, you could cook your breakfast on them.
The Child Accident Prevention Trust (CAPT) and the Electrical Safety Campaign have teamed up to raise awareness of what they can do.
There are concerns that hair straightener burns have doubled in recent years. Most injuries occur when crawling babies and toddlers grab at them, step on them, sit on them or pull them down.
Hair straighteners can stay hot enough to burn up to 15 minutes after they have been switched off. But most parents dont know just how dangerous they can be.
Over a third leave hair straighteners to cool down on the floor, on furniture or over a door handle.

	Top Gear number plate WASN'T a reference to Falklands War, rules BBC Trust

	The show sparked a diplomatic incident in Argentina when its crew drove through the country in a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL during its  Patagonia special.

Another complainant accused the BBC of a 'cover-up' and said they needed to see evidence of the purchase of the car to prove the 'amazing coincidence'.
But the Trust's complaints and appeals board said there was no evidence 'which demonstrated that the use of the number plate was a deliberate reference to the Falklands War'.
The complaint was originally rejected by the BBC Executive but was sent to the Trust on appeal.
Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack.
Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another.

The Falkland Islands were taken briefly by Argentina during its 1982 invasion which preceded a 74-day war with Britain.
The war claimed the lives of 649 Argentinians and 255 Britons.
Alicia Castro, the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, demanded an apology from BBC head of television Danny Cohen during a meeting in October last year - which the corporation refused to give.
In a letter to Ms Castro, Mr Cohen said the BBC would also go ahead and broadcast the programme - which aired over Christmas.
He said: 'We will ensure that these programmes are a fair representation of what took place throughout their stay.'
He added: 'I am very aware that some have questioned whether the number plates were in some way a prank.
'I would like to reassure you again that nothing we have seen or read since the team returned supports the view that this was a deliberate act.'
Cohen said 'the BBC was disturbed by the violence the team faced during their visit'.
Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman previously denied the number plate was a 'stunt' and presenter Jeremy Clarkson said he was 'shocked' when someone pointed out the link between the number plate and the Falklands War days into filming.
Clarkson was dropped from the BBC following a 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon over hot food.
In March, he was  suspended, then dropped, by the BBC following the incident at a hotel in which Tymon suffered swelling and a split lip, requiring him to visit a hospital A&amp;E department.
Following an internal investigation, the BBC announced on March 25 that Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed.

Owen Paterson, 5, was left behind after a school outing to Blair Drummond Safari Park
The furious family of a five-year-old boy have hit out at 'shambolic' teachers after he was accidentally left at a safari park on his own for two hours following a school trip.
Owen Paterson had been on a school outing to Blair Drummond Safari Park along with 300 other pupils from Pitcorthie Primary and Nursery, Fife.
But once the trip was over and the coaches returned to the school on Monday afternoon - the little boy was nowhere to be found.
After the school realised he was not on any of the vehicles, his frantic mother Amanda, 28, and a group of teachers rushed back to the park where Owen had luckily been found by a security guard still playing in the safari park's children's area.
Council chiefs have now launched an investigation into the blunder.
But Owen's grandmother, Sandra McQueen, 51, from Dunfermline, said her family demanded 'answers from the school'.
She said: 'There were about 300 kids from the school on the trip to the safari park and other mums have said it was a bit of a shambles.
'When Amanda went to pick him up from nursery at 3pm and she was told that she had to wait for the rest of the buses to arrive because Owen wasn't back yet.
'Then one of the teachers said to her "we don't know where Owen is". All the buses were in but they didn't have any clue where he was.'
Mrs McQueen said: 'I asked if they had phoned the police and they said 'No', so I told her that I wanted the police involved.
'Four of the teachers got into a car and Amanda got into another one with another teacher and her husband and they drove to the safari park.
'One of Amanda's friends phoned her on the way and said that she had spoken to the park but that no one else at that point had phoned about it.
'The safari park sent out their security to look for him and he was found about 3.30pm by the security guard.
'We're not sure where exactly he was found, but Owen said he was in a play park and the guard had come over to him and asked his name. After that he was taken to their restaurant.
'He'd been missing since the busses left at 1.15pm and no one had any idea where he was.
'Amanda was so relieved. My heart sunk when she first called. He's her five-year-old boy. Anything could've happened to him there, it's full of wild animals.'
Owen was left behind at Blair Drummond safari park by bungling school staff - who only noticed when they arrived back at the nursery an hour later (stock picture)
A group of 300 children - accompanied by 70 adults - enjoyed a day out at Blair Drummond, near Stirling, which houses lion and tiger enclosures among its attractions (stock picture)
Council officials visited the family on Tuesday to apologise, and promised an investigation would be launched.
Mrs McQueen added: 'They said they had contacted the Care Commission and there would be an inquiry in to it, but when we phoned the Care Commission on Wednesday, they said they'd not heard anything about it.
'We're very angry and we want answers about what happened and why the teachers never did a head count or took a register.

A woman has been left baffled after snapping what appears to be a fairy calmly following her dog as they walk through the woods.
Sarah Hembry was out on a stroll with her pet Stink - a 14-year-old Irish wolf hound mixed lurcher - when she took the image in Radstock, Somerset.
Ms Hembry said she was stunned when she looked back at the picture only for it to look like a magical sprite is floating behind the animal in the woodland.

	A herd of elephants invaded a busy road in the Kruger National Park in South Africa to rescue a young elephant who had collapsed in the middle of the tarmac, forcing the traffic to stop.

And thanks to their persistent efforts to encourage the baby, the animal eventually made it on to their feet and wandered off into the safety of the forest.
The video was posted to Youtube on the Kruger Sightings Channel yesterday, and has already received almost 90,000 views.
One commenter wrote: 'Absolutely fantastic how the herd protects and help this calf up to join them again. Luckily the cars kept their distance.'
The older elephants in the herd surrounded the youngster, and tried to coax him to his feet using their trunks
After several minutes of encouragement, the calf then manages to sit up and clambers up on to its feet
Eventually the herd walk off, leaving the road clear for the waiting traffic to pass through the national park
While another said: 'OMG that was so cute!!!! I wanted to help the poor little thing myself. Elephants are majestic animals, just fabulous in every way!'
It remains unclear what made the young elephant collapse, but some have suggested it may have simply been tired or stumbled over its own feet.
But one of the viewers commenting on the clip said: 'Reminds me of the time my toddler that decided to have a rest on the supermarket floor.'

	UK economy has officially slowed after ONS confirms GDP growth of 0.3 per cent

	Economists had hoped that the Office for National Statistics would raise its estimate of UK growth today from 0.3 per cent to 0.4 per cent, but there has been no change on last month's first estimate.

Also expenditure data showed net trade exerted the biggest drag on the economy as imports surged 2.3 per cent and exports fell by 0.3 per cent. The lacklustre performance reflected a rise in imports of oil, machinery and transport equipment, knocking a massive 0.9 percentage points off growth.
Today's figures have put a dampener on UK the economy ahead of Chancellor George Osborne's emergency budget on July 8, in which he is expected to spell out details of how the government plans to eliminate the budget deficit.
Sterling fell slightly against the dollar on the weaker than expected figures, hitting an intraday low of $1.5332 before recovering a little to $1.5358.

Howard Archer, at IHS, said: 'GDP growth in the first quarter was disappointingly and slightly unexpectedly unrevised at 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter, which was the weakest growth since the fourth quarter of 2013.'
Archer also said today's figures had put an end to speculation that the Bank of England could hike interest rates later on this year.
He added: 'We expect the Bank of England to start edging up interest rates in the first half of 2016 and believe it is currently borderline whether the bank first moves in the first or second quarter.'
However, Archer was more upbeat about the prospects for second quarter GDP growth.
Archer said: 'Despite the marked slowdown in the first quarter, we remain largely upbeat about growth prospects for 2015 - especially now that the risk of prolonged political instability has been removed by the election of a majority Conservative government.
'We believe robust consumer spending could push GDP growth up to 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Growth is seen holding up around this level through the second half of the year.'
This sentiment was also backed up by a latest survey from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, which revealed that a backdrop of deflation, improved employment levels and slight wage growth has boosted people's sense of 'economic optimism',
The confidence index reached 115.1 this month, the highest reading since May 2014.
Twelve per cent of people surveyed said their household finances had improved over the last month, while 16 per cent reported that they had worsened.
Confidence:a confidence index by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research reached 115.1 this month
Stephen Harmston of YouGov said: 'With the election now over, consumer confidence has strengthened and is now close to where it was before the financial crisis.
'Over the past month, six of the eight measures that make up the Index have improved with the most notable one being peoples current household financial situation.
'While more people still think their finances are getting worse than think they are getting better, the gap is the narrowest it has ever been and whats more, people are now increasingly optimistic about what will happen over the next year.
'It looks like the Chancellor will present his additional Budget in July to an increasingly confident public.
May's 115.1 index reading marks an increase of 1.5 points on April and, as well as being the strongest level recorded since May 2014, is also the second highest reading since April 2007, the report said.
One in eight people of around 7,000 surveyed said their household financial situations have improved in the last month, marking the highest percentage since this question was first posed in February 2009.

But, 16 per cent surveyed said their household finances had worsened over the last month. According to YouGov and Cebr, this is the lowest percentage on record.
Twenty-six per cent of people expect to see an improvement to their household finances in the year ahead, marking the most upbeat findings since March 2010. However, twenty-four per cent think their financial situation will deteriorate, the report said.
Scott Corfe of Cebr said the improvement in economic confidence comes against a backdrop of improving employment figures, 'good' deflation and increasing wages.
He added: 'However, it is clear that the economy still faces some notable problems - particularly the lack of business investment, a preponderance of low-paid, part-time jobs and large regional variations in growth.'
The YouGov/Cebr findings follow a string of recent reports published indicating steadily improving levels of consumer confidence across the UK.
Household financial situation from February 2009 to May 2015, according to YouGov/Cebr
Yesterday, Nielsen findings revealed that the number of UK consumers willing to spend money is at its highest level on record.
The proportion of consumers who believe the UK is in a recession is at its lowest point on record, while positivity about job prospects and personal finances are both at their highest level for seven and half years, Nielsen's findings suggest.
Meanwhile, according to separate research, UK households had 17 more disposable income to spend last month compared with a year earlier.
With the average household having around 187 a week of disposable income last month, there has been a 10 per cent increase in people's spending power since this time last year, Asda's findings state.
Earlier this month, official figures revealed that the UK fell into a period of deflation last month. Chancellor George Osborne said the figures were 'good news for family budgets.'

'Over the past month, six of the eight measures that make up the Index have improved with the most notable one being peoples current household financial situation.
'While more people still think their finances are getting worse than think they are getting better, the gap is the narrowest it has ever been and whats more, people are now increasingly optimistic about what will happen over the next year.
'It looks like the Chancellor will present his additional Budget in July to an increasingly confident public.
May's 115.1 index reading marks an increase of 1.5 points on April and, as well as being the strongest level recorded since May 2014, is also the second highest reading since April 2007, the report said.
One in eight people of around 7,000 surveyed said their household financial situations have improved in the last month, marking the highest percentage since this question was first posed in February 2009.
YouGov/Cebr Consumer Confidence Index from February 2007 to May 2015
But, 16 per cent surveyed said their household finances had worsened over the last month. According to YouGov and Cebr, this is the lowest percentage on record.
Twenty-six per cent of people expect to see an improvement to their household finances in the year ahead, marking the most upbeat findings since March 2010. However, twenty-four per cent think their financial situation will deteriorate, the report said.
Scott Corfe of Cebr said the improvement in economic confidence comes against a backdrop of improving employment figures, 'good' deflation and increasing wages.
He added: 'However, it is clear that the economy still faces some notable problems - particularly the lack of business investment, a preponderance of low-paid, part-time jobs and large regional variations in growth.'
The YouGov/Cebr findings follow a string of recent reports published indicating steadily improving levels of consumer confidence across the UK.
Household financial situation from February 2009 to May 2015, according to YouGov/Cebr
Yesterday, Nielsen findings revealed that the number of UK consumers willing to spend money is at its highest level on record.
The proportion of consumers who believe the UK is in a recession is at its lowest point on record, while positivity about job prospects and personal finances are both at their highest level for seven and half years, Nielsen's findings suggest.
Meanwhile, according to separate research, UK households had 17 more disposable income to spend last month compared with a year earlier.
With the average household having around 187 a week of disposable income last month, there has been a 10 per cent increase in people's spending power since this time last year, Asda's findings state.
Earlier this month, official figures revealed that the UK fell into a period of deflation last month. Chancellor George Osborne said the figures were 'good news for family budgets.'

	Ochaine Williams failed by social workers before killing Steven Grisales

	Ochaine Williams was jailed for 12 years for the murder of 21-year-old Steven Grisales in Edmonton, North London, in 2011.

He was murdered by a deeply troubled boy who lived in a home where criminality was routine and faced 'astonishing' levels of violence 'perpetrated within and against the household', which 'were normalised and tolerated unchallenged' by social services.
It meant they missed chances to remove him from the home.
When Williams and an older sibling finally revealed what was going on, they described 'a chaotic existence, severe physical punishment, unpredictability and the fear of violence', the report reveals.
Shockingly, the report also says some of the incidents in the home were downplayed by the authorities, as 'same sex intimate partner violence' appeared to not have been taken as seriously as violence between a man and a woman.
It all combined to create a teenager who was 'vulnerable, unstable, and rootless', who had convictions for burglary and assault, and was 'alleged to have subjected girls in school to aggressive, sexualised assaults'.
His upbringing, the report states, left him with 'little concept of the link between actions and consequences'.
Emotional damage: Williams, pictured in a YouTube video where he played a killer, was left with 'little concept of the link between actions and consequences' because of his upbringing, the report stated
New start: Williams arrived in the UK with his mother, an asylum seeker from Jamaica who claimed she was being persecuted in her home country for being a lesbian, in the early 2000s
MailOnline can reveal how Williams was brought to the UK from Jamaica by his mother Sandra Espeut in the early 2000s.
His mother, now 50, said she was a lesbian, and was claiming asylum as she was at risk of violence in her home country.
The truth of this claim has never been verified, and it was when the Home Office announced they were going to deport the family in 2004 that the first major upset began.
The Home Office, it was reported in GayLifeUK at the time, did not believe Espeut was a lesbian - although she was in relationships with women.
Sheffield's social services - informed by the UK Border Agency of the family's imminent departure - allowed them to disengage.
But the family never left the UK, instead moving south to London.
In fact, despite Espeut's repeated court appearances over the years, the family have remained in the UK - thanks in part to never receiving a custodial sentence, the report states.
It reveals how Espeut - described as having a 'dangerous lifestyle' and a 'problem with alcoholism' in the report - was known to use the stresses of her asylum battle in mitigation to avoid harsh sentences.
Had they been deported, Williams would never have been on that street in August.
Sentence: Mr Grisales' parents Andres and Jasmid outside of court following their son's kiler's trial in 2012
Scandal: The family were put under the care of Haringey social services, which was headed by Sharon Shoesmith, left, who was removed following the death of Baby Peter Connelly, right
The family ended up under the care of Haringey Council in late 2006, then headed up by Sharon Shoesmith, months before the death of Baby P in August 2007.
The three reviews which have taken place in the years since the toddler's horrific killing have highlighted 'the apparent lack of leadership, evidence of poor standards, insufficiencies in supervision and under-resourcing in children's social care services' at the time.
The serious case review notes, in the context of what was happening in Haringey, 'it is unsurprising that subtleties and complexities of Williams circumstances and the potential risks within them were not recognised or addressed'.
But it does slam the council for a series of failings over the years to 2009, including failing to respond to repeated referrals and requests for investigations, poor case management and finally - after the situation had improved after 2009 - failing to transfer the case to Enfield effectively in 2010 and 2011.
In among all this, the doctors who had cared for the family over the years from 2004 were repeatedly failing to identify and communicate any concerns they had over the safety of Williams and his siblings.
Doctors also failed to be pro-active when it came to child protection issues - even though they knew Espeut and the other adult, only referred to as AH in the review, had 'psychiatric conditions'.
In August of 2011, Enfield had finally taken over Williams' case. But the report notes 'insufficiently robust case management and oversight by [the social worker] meant [Williams] was not seen sufficiently frequently' and 'was not assessed at a high level of risk of harm'.
By this point, Espeut had asked for Williams, who is said to have joined well-known gang the 'Northumberland Park Killers', to be taken away - but this never happened.
Again, had he been removed, the then 15-year-old Williams never would have been in that street.
Claims: Williams' family maintained he was innocent following the verdict, wearing t-shirts to court. His motherSandra Espeut is believed to be pictured on the far right
Williams, now a young man, maintains he was not carrying a weapon the day Steven died, and says he did not strike the fatal blow.
Espeut, meanwhile, now says her drinking days are behind her, according to the report, and claims social services entire interaction with her family was a misunderstanding which began when her daughter became angry she was not allowed a dog.
YET ANOTHER SCANDAL FOR COUNCIL WHO FAILED BABY PETER
Haringey social services boss Sharon Shoesmith was awarded 679,000 for unfair dismissal from her job despite the near collapse of her department.
Ed Balls, who was Children's Secretary in the Labour government at the time, had her sacked from her 133,000-a-year job but a judge ruled she had been unfairly dismissed in 2011
Ms Shoesmith, who later complained of struggling to find work afterwards, was fired after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter in 2007, who was subjected to months of abuse.
She had presided over Haringey social workers while they failed to save the life of 17-month-old Peter Connelly.
The toddler died after suffering months of abuse from his mother, her boyfriend and his brother, even though the family had been seen on 60 occasions by social workers, health workers and others.
Shoesmith won her unfair dismissal case in October and was awarded the payout, the terms of which Haringey Council kept confidential.
But the council's accounts revealed she was awarded 679,452 in compensation.
She was still maintaining his innocence after he was convicted in 2012, appealing for the 'true killer' to come forward.
'By the name of God we are going to come out victorious  it is going to happen, he is going to come out,' she told the Haringey Independent .
However, Williams lost his appeal in November, and Espeut was in court just a matter of months ago herself.
According to the Essex Chronicle , she was given a community order for stealing clothes worth 639.74 from H&amp;M, and 281 worth of items from JD Sports in Chelmsford on October 2 last year.
But the review did find improvements had been made, noting 'many of the recommendations [made in the report] have been identified and addressed already'.
A Haringey Council spokesman apologised for its failings, and accepted the findings of the review.
'This case occurred at a time when children's services in Haringey were not operating as effectively as they should have been,' they said.
'As is made clear in the joint statement from Haringey and Enfield LSCBs, and was recognised in our most recent Ofsted inspection, we have made a number of improvements since this case, which address many of the issues raised.
'These include additional measures to ensure that the child's perspective is reflected at the heart of our work and support for families from an earlier stage to prevent difficulties from escalating.'
A spokesman for Enfield Council added: 'This was a tragic case involving a young man and our thoughts are very much with his family at this distressing time.
'Clearly the report states that the circumstances in which this horrendous crime was committed couldnt have been foreseen and because the perpetrator was not prevented from being on the streets at the time the crime was committed it is clear from the report that there was little, if any action Enfield Council could have undertaken to have prevented this sad and tragic outcome.'

The photo even shows that the guest had placed his bottle of beer on the table in front of the bride before getting down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend.
While the bride and groom appear to be happy with the events, the bride's arguably strained grin has been the subject of much discussion amongst Reddit commentators.
'This is up there with my uncle giving my cousins a puppy at my birthday party': The proposal has been overwhelmingly described as rude and inappropriate by internet commentators
'Her smiles says "congratulations", her eyes say "that b**ch",' one user wrote.
'The bride is doing a really good job of hiding her murder,' another added.
WhileAlliewonka added: 'Honestly I feel kinda bad for the girl being proposed to more than the bride, she's being proposed to at someone else's big day, he hasn't made it personal for her at all but I guess she seems ok with it.'
'Her smile pretends to be happy for them, but her eyes betray her true feelings,' cry_wolf wrote.
And Hargbarglin wrote: 'I feel like in some cases the people that would do something like this literally cannot deal with not being the center of attention.'
'The look on the bride's face too, wow': Reddit users express their outrage over the photo

	Alina Rudya was just one when her parents fled her hometown of Pripyat in Ukraine in the wake of the meltdown at the power plant, where her father worked, in 1986.

        <MainBody>Girls freak out during supernatural ritual
Alina takes a self-portrait in her old apartment in the Ukrainian town of Pripyat which she escaped as a baby after the disaster. She decided to pose nude to show 'where my life basically started over because of the disaster, so I am both vulnerable and exposed at the same time'
Poignant reminder: When
Rudya
visited her old apartment, she found this photograph of her and her mother on the floor after all these years
Reflection: Alina gazes out of the window of her family's apartment over the wasteland left behind when the town was abandoned 30 years ago
She added: 'This is our apartment, number 24, at Lenin Street. Many people ask me why I am nude, and my answer is that I wanted to show the place I came from, where my life basically started over because of the disaster, so I am both vulnerable and exposed at the same time.'
Her father, Constantine, was working as an engineer at the plant on the night of the accident.
She said: 'He was there when the whole thing happened and he couldn't leave his shift, even though just next door the tragedy was happening.
'His friends were working on the fourth reactor, which exploded and some of them died back in 1986, some others are still alive and I hope to photograph them for the project.'
The second part of her project will once again see her return through the forbidden zone to Pripyat to share stories of other people whose lives were changed by the disaster.
Turning back the clock: The 30-year-old, who now lives in Berlin, first returned to the town in 2012 and is now looking to make another visit to complete her project to mark the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe

	Yasmin Gasimova, 19, from Reading, admits to shaving only when she is on holiday or going out on the prowl. She now wants to encourage other women to ditch their razors to normalise going au naturel.

'I might trim my pubes if I'm going on holiday, but catch me on a normal day when my armpits are bushy and my legs furry, and you might be surprised.'
Yasmin says she used to get bullied at school when moustache hairs started to grow on her upper lip when she was just ten years old.
She said: 'I was trying to shave my noticeably hairy stomach.
When she was in school Yasmin was teased about her dark body hair but from the age of 11 she decided to stop shaving and embrace her body's natural hirsute look
Yasmin says that she will shave on rare occasions a such as going on holiday or if she plans to have sex
'I was never not self-conscious of my hair, but now I embrace it.'
Yasmin decided that the only way to feel happy in her own skin was to stop fighting her own body.
'I stopped caring when I was 11, as having naturally thick, fast-growing hair meant I'd need to waste an hour just to get prickly dots on my legs, which would grow back in a week.
'It's a huge inconvenience for me, as it never made me feel comfortable, gave me loads of ingrown hairs, and my hairless legs wouldn't match the rest of my hairy body.'
Since she's stopped shaving, Yasmin says she feels much more liberated - but admits that she still regularly tames her eyebrows.
One area of her body that she regularly tames is her face and eyebrows but only when they need it
Yasmin hopes to demonstrate that there is nothing dirty about women having body hair
Yasmin is so happy with her hirsute look, she says that when she does shave it will have to be for a very good reason.
She added: 'If I do shave, which is very, very rare, it's for absolute necessity.
'If I'm going on a beach holiday, having swimming lessons, or if I'm trying to pull a one night stand, I'll shave.
'I still unfortunately prefer the inconvenience of shaving to the inevitable dirty looks and rejection.'
Yasmin wants other women to embrace their own hairiness, because men are judged by their 'manliness' on their ability to grow beards.
She added: 'Although women have just as much body hair, albeit generally thinner and lighter, as a society we have decided they have to be completely hairless in order to be seen as truly feminine.
'But nothing about a woman's natural body should make her feel like less of a woman.
'There is also nothing dirty or unclean about body hair. Besides, we shouldn't hold women to a higher standard of cleanliness than men.
'This is the reality of a woman's body, and it shouldn't be hidden away.'

	Scots Nats MPs had to make to do with a white rose from Ethiopia, instead of the native Scottish flower they were meant to be paying tribute to when they took their seats in Westminster yesterday.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Scotland's new army of nationalist MPs made a dramatic show of their patriotism  yesterday - by adorning themselves with a special floral buttonhole for the state opening of Parliament.
But the stunt - in honour of the patriotic poem 'Little White Rose of Scotland' - backfired today after it emerged the flower chosen was actually an ordinary rose grown in Africa and exported around the world.
The SNP this morning attempted to brush off the embarrassing revelation - insisting they 'did not care' where the flowers came from.

'THE WHITE ROSE OF SCOTLAND'
Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid (pictured)
SNP MPs and its members of the Scottish Parliament have made a tradition of wearing the floral button hole at all Westminster and Holyrood parliament openings.
The flower was made famous by Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid in 'The Little White Rose of Scotland'.
The poem reads:
'The rose of all the world is not for me
'I want for my part
'Only the little white rose of Scotland
'That smells sharp and sweet - and breaks the heart.'
But the claim appears to undermine the opening line of Hugh MacDiarmid's famous poem, which the flowers were supposed to honour.
The poem starts:The rose of all the world is not for me.'
MacDiarmond says  all he wants is the little white rose of Scotland which smells sharp and sweet and breaks the heart.
All 56 of the Scottish National MPs adorned themselves with the dazzling white rose in tribute to the poem as they arrived in Westminster for the Queen's Speech yesterday morning.
But it emerged this morning that the rose chosen by the SNP - at a florists in Westminster - was not the Scottish variety glorified by MacDiarmid, but an ordinary florists rose grown mainly in East Africa.
The Royal Horticultural Society today confirmed the flower worn by the SNP MPs was not the Scottish rose.
The organisation's chief horticulturalist Guy Barter told MailOnline: 'The Scottish white rose is a very pretty little thing. But they are seldom, if ever, offered by florists.
'The SNP appear to be wearing white florists roses. Florists roses are a commercial form of rose bred to produce long-stemmed neat roses for button holes and arrangements.
He said the florists rose was actually derived from English tea roses about 50 years ago.
But he said: It is now a specialist branch of rose breeding with little in common with garden tea roses.
'Rose cut flower production is dominated by Kenya, Columbia, Israel and Ethiopia, and to the best of my knowledge none are now grown in Britain and few even in Holland which is the centre of breeding cut flower roses.
He added: 'The tea-rose has a long lineage of Asian and European species and as the hybrid tea rose was first breed in France.
'It has been and still is extensively bred in the UK, USA, France and Germany. It is not especially English, and the world register of rose varieties is held by the American Rose Society.'
An SNP source this morning insisted said they had never claimed the flower was an actual Scottish rose.
Its insignificant where the rose comes from. It symbolises the white rose in the poem, the source said.

The source added: We just asked for white roses. We dont care if its an English rose or not.
SNP MPs and its members of the Scottish Parliament have made a tradition of wearing the floral button hole at all Westminster and Holyrood parliament openings.
The flower was made famous by MacDiarmid in 'The Little White Rose of Scotland'. The poem reads: The rose of all the world is not for me; I want for my part; Only the little white rose of Scotland; That smells sharp and sweet - and breaks the heart.'
AN EXPERT VIEW: THE SCOTTISH ROSE IS 'A PRETTY LITTLE THING' BUT  SELDOM IF EVER AVAILABLE TO BUY IN BRITAIN
Guy Barter, of the Royal Horticultural Society, confirmed the flower worn by the SNP MPs was not the Scottish rose:
'The Scottish white rose is a very pretty little thing. They are seldom if ever offered by florists.
'The SNP appear to be wearing white florists roses. Florists roses are a commercial form of rose bred to produce long-stemmed neat roses for button holes and arrangements.
'The florists rose was derived from tea roses about 50 years ago but is now a specialist branch of rose breeding with little in common with garden tea roses.
'Rose cut flower production is dominated by Kenya, Columbia, Israel and Ethiopia, and to the best of my knowledge none are now grown in Britain and few even in Holland which is the centre of breeding cut flower roses.
'The tea-rose has a long lineage of Asian and European species and as the hybrid tea rose was first breed in France.
'It has been and still is extensively bred in the UK, USA, France and Germany. It is not especially English, and the world register of rose varieties is held by the American Rose Society.'

	Tom Hayes 'urged brother to ply HSBC colleague to fix rates'

	Tom Hayes (pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today) is denying eight counts of conspiring to defraud. He pocketed more than £4m while earning his employers tens of millions.

In emails read to the court from 2007, Hayes asked Mr OLeary: Do you know the guy who sets the yen Libor rates in your place? Mr OLeary replied: Yes I worked with himspoke to him quite a bit in New York.
Hayes then asked: Mate, can you do me a huge favour and ask him if he will set his three-month yen Libor on the low side for the next few days  I have $1million of fixes. It would be a massive help, if you cant dont worry.
The court heard that Hayes spoke on the telephone to his stepbrother and encouraged him to buy his HSBC colleague a 'few drinks'
Hayes then spoke to Mr OLeary by phone, begging his brother: At least get to know himit would be a big help for me, telling him to buy his colleague a few drinks.
He said the slightest move in the Libor makes half a million bucks for me.
WHAT IS THE LIBOR AND WHY DOES IT MATTER IF IT'S MANIPULATED?
The Libor rate, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is an interest rate at which banks lend money to each other around the world.
Rate rigging is when traders or brokers collude to set artificial rates, rather than genuine assessments of what the borrowing rates should be.
Bankers are able to take out bets, or contracts, based on the way the rates will move.
If they find a way to manipulate the rates, or persuade someone to manipulate them for them, then they are fixing the bet in their favour. This seriously undermines the integrity of the Libor financial system, on which global banks and financial institutions rely.
British trader Tom Hayes is charged with eight counts of conspiring to defraud by 'dishonestly' manipulating the Libor interest rate.
The Libor rate is linked to the cost of trillions of pounds worth of investments and trades. It is set in many different currencies  Hayes is accused of fiddling the rate for Japanese yen.
The charges carry a maximum jail term of ten years.
Three months later, Hayes urged his step-brother to ask to set the six-month yen Libor on the high side.
When Mr OLeary agreed to make the request in a jovial email, Hayes instructed him to keep it super casual.
Hayes later apologised to his brother for involving him, adding: I dont want to put you in that position again so I am not going to bother pestering you again.
'He probably thought: Whos this cheeky young graduate? As long as youre okay.
Emails read to the court alluded to Hayes champagne lifestyle. A 2007 email between two of his contacts said Hayes was going to Vegas to watch the [Ricky] Hatton fight... lucky bastard. PS Bubbly on its way with Tom.
Jurors were shown extensive chat logs between Hayes and his contacts, littered with smiley faces and pet names amid repeated demands to rig Libor.
The court heard that Hayes was fixing the Libor rate both before and after the economic crisis.
The scam was made more difficult when banks started rigging their own rates to mask problems, meaning Hayes had to fight his own banks fixings to make them work in his favour.
Hayes started to beg the brokers to fix the rates in his favour, in one instance asking them to plummet. In another message he wrote: Please try to get six months low for the good of humanity and me.
Hayes regularly pestered contacts to instruct their cash boys to manipulate the Libor rate.
He openly spoke of attempts to influence the market, telling one City trader that Libor is high because kept it artificially high. Mukul Chawla QC, prosecuting, said: If you ever need a clear example of deliberate rigging of rates this is it.
Hayes is accused of offering huge bribes to those helping him. Mr Chawla said: It is very much you scratch my back, I will scratch yours.
Hayes wasarrested in December 2012 as part of a massive criminal inquiry into the scandal by the Serious Fraud Office. His trial at Southwark Crown Court is expected to last almost three months
Hayes arrived at Southwark Crown Court yesterday for the trials second day with his lawyer wife Sarah Tighe, 34, although she did not watch proceedings.
The trader has been diagnosed with mild Aspergers syndrome, a type of autism, and was allowed to sit beside his solicitor rather than in the dock.
The defendant, of Fleet, Hampshire, allegedly behaved in a thoroughly dishonest and manipulative manner.
He was sacked by Citigroup after his methods were reported to managers. He returned to the UK and was arrested in December 2012 as part of a massive inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office.
Hayes denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. The trial, which is expected to last up to three months, continues.

	MBE poppy seller like Olive Cooke is also plagued by 'deplorable' charities

	Dionis MacNair, 85, (pictured) from Burley, Hampshire, started selling poppies door-to-door with her mother Ruth when she was just seven years old.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>The opening of the inquest into her death last week heard she had '
long term
issues with periodic depression', and it has been reported that she had become stressed by the endless cold calls and begging letters she was receiving every month from charities.
Ms MacNair today described the charities as 'deplorable' and slammed their treatment of grandmother-of-four Mrs Cooke, who lived in the Fishponds area of Bristol, as 'appalling'.
Ms MacNair, pictured left aged ten, started selling poppies with her mother when she was just seven, and last week she was honoured by the Royal British Legion for her 78-years of service to the charity (right)
The former secretary also said the worst offenders should be 'named and shamed'.
'I think it is deplorable that they bothered her to such an extent, and so many of them,' said Ms MacNair, who has never married
'It
to be cutting your nose off to spite your face.
'I think [what they did to Mrs Cooke] it was appalling. I think everybody does.
'The charities never leave you alone. I've experienced that - I think everyone has.
'They pass your details on to everyone else. It is deplorable.
It has been reported that Mrs Cooke had become stressed by the endless cold calls and begging letters she was receiving every month from charities
Ms MacNair says she has experience of charities passing 'your details to everyone else', and says she will put the phone down on cold callers
'I just put the phone down and say I don't want to talk, but I am fairly thick-skinned and a lot of people aren't and I'm sure she did find it hard.'
She
added: '
I think [the cold calling] is taking advantage of the vulnerable in the way that should never happen, certainly not from charities and especially not to dedicated people like her.
'I think the worst offenders should be named - I say name them all and say absolutely everybody thinks this is deplorable, you're killing your own charity.
'People aren't going to help you if they continue doing this sort of thing.'
Mrs Cooke's family have insisted that - while the letters and phone calls were intrusive and a nuisance - the charities were not to blame for her death.
Ms MacNair's mother Ruth, pictured on her wedding day to naval officer Ian, started supporting the British Legion after it was launched in 1921
Ms MacNair started going out with her mother to raise money as she grew up in Alverstoke, Hampshire
Ms MacNair's mother Ruth, an artist and wife of a naval officer, started supporting the British Legion after it was launched in 1921.
She started going out with her mother to raise money as she grew up in Alverstoke, Hampshire.
She
recalled: '
We had only just moved in and my mother took me around poppy selling.
'It was a very good way of meeting the neighbours and as a result we had a wonderful free childhood without realising that people were keeping an eye on us.
Ms MacNair's father Ian (pictured) served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War
'I used to rattle the tin and she used to carry the tray.
'I did it for years and years and then eventually took over from her.'
The family moved again to Malta and Gibraltar, where Dionis' father Ian served in the Royal Navy during the war before they returned to Burley.
Ms MacNair was presented with an award and certificate by Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire Brigadier David Harrison recognising her work for the Legion.
She was the first woman to be elected as a New Forest Verderer - overseeing the management of the area - and was awarded an MBE in 2010 for her services to the region.
Mrs Cooke started selling poppies in 1938 when she was just 16 after her father served in Gallipoli during the First World War.
She devoted herself fully to the charity after husband Leslie Hussey-Yeo, a sailor in the Royal Navy, was killed in Italy in 1943, leaving her a war widow at the age of 21.
The great-grandmother dedicated almost eight decades to raising thousands of pounds, selling an estimated 30,000
poppies
in 76 years, andwas a familiar face in Bristol and stood in the doorway of the city's cathedral every year in the lead-up to Remembrance Day.
It is claimed the former postwoman 'lost faith in people' two months before her death when 250 in cash she sent to a relative went missing in the post.
She was also dealing with constant phone calls and up to 260 begging letters a month from charities pestering her for cash.
Mrs Cooke was found dead on a cliff face overlooking Clifton Suspension Bridge after she was spotted jumping from a ledge on May 6,two days before the anniversary of VE Day.
Ms MacNair said: 'I think so many of the big charities spend an awful lot on raising money, rather than on actually giving it to the charity.
'When I was a secretary of a charity many years ago we got a thing from the Charity Commission saying they would look very unfavourably on charities who spend more than six per cent on administration. Some of these charity are spending 60 per cent.
'That's not what people give there money for.
'They want their money to go to the cause.'

	Miira Dawson claims long-term breastfeeding has made her five-year-old smarter

	Miira Dawson, 36, from Poole in Dorset, claims long-term breastfeeding has boosted her daughter's IQ and will allow her to 'unlock her potential'. The child, five, still nurses three times a day.

'I think it is a lovely thing for a baby to grow up and remember being breast fed, as not many people would be able to say this - plus there are all the health and IQ benefits.'
Mrs Dawson, a science researcher turned full-time mother, says that while other parents may raise eyebrows at her decision, the benefits of extended breastfeeding are scientifically proven
She told student newspaper The Tab: 'Most people ask me when I am planning on stopping but I don't have any pressure from my husband.
'I don't think other mums are bothered really. It's none of their business but they may raise their eyebrows.
'We co-sleep as well. I'm in the middle with one either side. It's fine. We go to bed and sleep and have milk and get out when we wake up.
Miira: Breastfeeding key to unlocking children's full potential
Long term: She says she would feed Tara, five, and Ray Lee, two, until the age of 10 if she could
'My children have never had to cry to sleep, or sleep on their own, or wake in the night and be afraid - because I'm there.
'I think it's unnatural for children to sleep on their own. They are not biologically suited to sleep on their own.
'There's a lot of research saying breast feeding and bed sharing protects them from sudden death syndrome.'
But Mrs Dawson's penchant for long-term breastfeeding and 'co-sleeping' has put a strain on her relationship with her wine merchant husband Jim, 56, who sleeps in a separate bed from his wife and offspring.
Her wine merchant husband Jim, 56, sleeps in a separate bed for medical reasons but does admit he feels left out and the breastfeeding has put a strain on their relationship.
'I had little choice in the matter of encouraging Miira to breastfeed as there was never an alternative other than to support her,' he says.
Newborn: Mrs Dawson, pictured with Tara after her birth in 2010, says she always planned to breastfeed
Science: She says her stance on extended breastfeeding is backed up by science
'I don't think we discussed it before Tara's arrival and I definitely did not expect her to still be breastfeeding at five years old.
'Naturally I feel left out when it comes to the sleeping situation. I feel like it restricts mine and the children's time together and it doesn't give me the chance to do things that I would like to, such as reading bed time stories.'
Nevertheless, he says he will continue to put up with the situation 'for now' and is impressed by Tara's intelligence.
'Tara is an extremely bright girl and is very grown up for her age,' he adds. 'So for now I will continue to allow it.'
Mrs Dawson, who is originally from Finland, has no such doubts and says the benefits more than outweigh the downsides.
'She's never had a blanket or a dummy so this is her equivalent,' she explains. 'I'm sure if I could detach my boob and just give it to her, she would be extremely happy.'
Cuddling up: Mrs Dawson also 'co-sleeps' with her children - leaving husband Jim to sleep elsewhere
Healthy: The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for the first six months
However, she worries about what will happen when she does eventually stop producing milk and says Tara becomes upset when that scenario is raised.
'Every time I mention it to her she looks so sad,' says Mrs Dawson. 'She said the other day she was going to have noo noo forever.
'There's research to support breast fed babies have higher IQs but whether that's because people who breast feed are more educated I'm not sure. Breast feeding will allow them their full potential.'
According to the World Health Organization, babies should have nothing but breast milk until they are six months old when weaning should start.
Beyond that, says the advice, breastfeeding can continue with complementary foods for up to two years and beyond.
'Breastfeeding is a topic that divides people and everyone has an opinion on it. In terms of breastfeeding older children, the research is very limited,' comments University of Cambridge sociologistDr Maria Iacovou.
'It's very rare to find someone who is still naturally feeding a child of six years. But there is absolutely no evidence that there is anything wrong, so why should mothers stop if it works for them.
'Mothers who breastfeed for an extended time feel that it has got really meaningful benefits for their children.
"I think it is a lovely thing for a baby to grow up and remember being breast fed, as not many people would be able to say this.'

'Be inventive and don't be afraid to experiment. If vegetables are on three for 1.50, there's nothing wrong with sticking them all in a pot along with some fresh herbs, spices and a can of tomatoes for a family meal.
A spokesperson for Tesco suggests buying whole chicken and bigger cuts of meat.
They said: 'If you buy a whole chicken for your roast dinner, you can then use the chicken left over in a stew, curry or for a salad.'
If you do decide to buy pre-packed poultry, you should separate your produce to make it last longer, they advised.
'If you buy chicken parts such as breasts, thighs or drumsticks you have the option to cook a few portions for one meal and save the rest of the pack to cook another meal the next day,' they said.
They also suggest marinating cheaper cuts of meat or using them in slow-cooking dishes such as stews and casseroles.

The images, some of them extremely emotive and shocking, have gone on display at cultural centres in Tehran, Iran's capital.
Graphic artist Massoud Shojaei Tabatabali, head ofthe House of Cartoon, told Press TV they now have plans to hold the exhibition in other countries like Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
'In order to reveal the true nature of ISIL we decided to hold this contest and have people submit their cartoons or caricatures,' he said.
'ISIL tries to associate itself with Islam, but in essence has no idea about Islam.'
The contest, launched in February, focuses on the terror group's horrific crimes, including beheadings, attacks on homosexuals, suicide bombings and the destruction of ancient artefacts.
The artwork will be judged by a team of experts and the winners will be announced on May 31.
Fears: The terrorists might not be afraid of spiders and scorpions but they are scared of the power of writing, this artist claims
The images have gone on display at cultural centres in Tehran and could soon be shown in Iraq and Syria

	The footage was captured by Geoff Taylor, 63, who was woken by the badger in the middle of the night at his rural home in Midhurst, West Sussex.

But we hoped this footage would show people that badgers are real characters and they can be very bold and cheeky when they get hungry.
The badger was unfazed by the lights or the house itself, however it shows they are still scared of people - he ran off pretty quickly when he was interrupted.
The first incident occurred in the early hours of the morning on April 27, when Mr Taylor was awakened to the sound of someone or something in his kitchen.
Filmed: Mr Taylor caught the badger after being woken in the middle of the night at his home in West Sussex
Running away: Only ten seconds after he started filming the badger did it finally spot that it had been caught
Worried about what he might find, he went downstairs and found a badger with the fridge open. It had eaten a six pack of eggs, devouring them whole after pulling them down from a shelf.
Badgers are real characters and they can be very bold and cheeky when they get hungry
Emma Barrow, niece of Geoff Taylor
Upon seeing Mr Taylor, the badger ran back out through the cat flap. Then, when Mr Taylor was woke up at about 3.30am the next night, he grabbed his camera.
Even with the light on, the badger did not stop eating the Bakewell tart - and only ten seconds later did it finally spot that it had been caught.
Undeterred, even after being scared off it tried to come back moments later - but found the cat flap locked.
Ms Barrow said: We should treat badgers with caution and respect, as they can bite if cornered but hopefully the footage shows what wonderful characters they can be too.
Time to leave: The badger fled the Bakewell tart and headed back towards the cat flap to make its escape
Run, badger, run: The animal can be seen (left) running across the kitchen and through the cat flap
Away it goes: Even after being scared off it tried to come back moments later - but found the cat flap locked
They are a protected species so we should look out for them. This was certainly one opportunistic badger though.
Ms Barrow is business marketing manager at Cornwall Environment Consultants in Allet Common, near Truro, which works alongside developments to safely rehome or build around badger sets.
She said they often use sweet items for bait marking to track where badgers have been.
This involves using golden syrup in a harmless pellet that the badgers eat, and when they defecate them it leaves a trail for the ecologists.
Ms Barrow said: Perhaps we should be using Bakewell tart instead of golden syrup for this? The way he went through the tart was very impressive - he clearly enjoyed it a lot.

'So I am satisfied a further period of licence is required for the purpose of protecting the public from serious harm by you.
The judge went on: You were not a child and any suggestion of naivety should not be overstated. You are highly intelligent and resourceful.
Zakariya Ashiq speaks of his intense efforts to get to Syria
Evidence: Ashiq had WhatsApp conversations with two friends - including Mohammed Ismail (above) - who had gone to Syria before him last year
You sustained a high degree of resolve over an extended period albeit in a criminal cause, and that cause was a cause you chose and it would not be right to see you as some kind of victim.
He is extremely skilful at downplaying his true commitment. He is a fanatic, that's what he is
Judge Charles Wide QC
Ashiq remained determined to fight for ISIS despite knowing it was responsible for beheading hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, he said.
The judge also highlighted his hostility towards the UK - the country of his birth and that of his parents - and the disregard he had shown for authorities that tried to help him through the anti-radicalisation organisation Prevent.
The court had heard about WhatsApp conversations Ashiq had with two friends who had gone to Syria before him last year.
Zakariya Ashiq asks friends to help him get across border
Fighters: ISIS members pictured in Ramadi, Iraq. When questioned by police Ashiq denied that he was trying to go to Syria to join the terrorist organisation, telling them: 'I don't want to get my head blown off'
In them, Ashiq described to Ali Kalantar and Mohammed Ismail hitch-hiking and sleeping in mosques during his journey across Europe to join them.
He appealed to them for help to get into Syria, saying the second he got the chance he would do Ishtishadi (martyrdom) against any ... all these people, the jury was told.
In one message, he pleaded: Oh, seriously man, just get me there, man ... I don't know how you gonna get me, but you have to get me across.
Ashiq's extremist sympathies were also exposed in other WhatsApp messages read out to the jury. In one he wrote: There is no life, there's no life without Jihad.
He also spoke of his admiration for Islamic State using the online website Chat Roulette, the court heard.
And he searched on his computer for phrases such as IS beheading journalist and 44 ways to support Jihad and Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary.
Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC chronicled Ashiq's various alleged attempts to join ISIS during the course of last year.
He went to Turkey with his father in March last year, just days after Kalantar and Ismail flew out to Istanbul via Frankfurt.
During the trip, purportedly to visit refugee camps on the Syrian border, the pair fell out and Ashiq flew home on May 20.
Then, in July, he tried to go abroad again and told officers he was intending to go to Corfu and had no time for terrorists or their beliefs.
After his arrest at Heathrow on November 20, Ashiq said he had no aspirations to join ISIS or become a terrorist, describing Ismail as an idiot.

	Mary Portas cancelled son's baptism after Catholic priest "uncomfortable" with relationship

	The Queen of Shops star shared the story while reading excerpts from her memoir – Shop Girl – at a festival in Wales. She said the priest was 'uncomfortable' with her relationship.

According to WalesOnline , Miss Portas said of the decision to have Horatio baptised in a Catholic ceremony: 'I couldn't believe it, my older kids thought we were mad.
'In the church I went up with Horatio to the priest in the baptist class and I could see he was just uncomfortable.
'I wanted him to know that we were the parents and was he comfortable with that.
Miss Portas said the baptism 'wasn't meant to be'
'I felt bad because I was stressing him out but I wanted to stand my ground. He said: "I'm not baptising you".
'Well that was it I stood up and said: "I can't do this".But I was out walking my dog and I passed the church and I had to go and see him.
'He wasn't there so I left him my phone number. And he rang me. I told him I was disappointed.
'And he wrote me back this lovely letter and he just asked me to pray for him.
'The baptism just wasn't meant to be.'
The couple's son, now two, calls Miss Portas 'Mama' and Miss Rickey 'Mummy'. Mr Newton is referred to as 'Daddy'.
Miss Portas  who had only told close family and friends about Horatio's genetic father  is one of a growing number of women in same-sex relationships who have asked siblings to assist with fertility treatments.
She started out in 1989 as a shop window-dresser at London department store Harvey Nicholls, rising to become creative designer with a seat on the board.
She rose to fame with her TV series Mary Queen of Shops, which ran from 2007 until 2010.
The Hay Festival was founded in 1987 and celebrates writing from poets and scientists, lyricists and comedians, novelists and environmentalists.It has been dubbed'The Woodstock of the mind'.
A spokesman for the Bishops Conference of England and Wales said: 'A priest considers every baptism on a case by case basis (not according to marital status or how a child has been conceived), but according to whether or not it is likely that the child might be brought up in the Catholic faith.'
Speaking last month at a homily Sunday for the ordination of 19 new priests for the diocese of Rome, the Pope told the new ministers: 'With baptism, you unite the new faithful to the People of God. It is never necessary to refuse baptism to someone who asks for it.'

Mr Hughes said: 'I was taken to the police station, processed, mugshot, fingerprints, DNA, the whole works. I was in a cell for about 11 hours, and then my solicitor finally arrived.
Preacher: Mr Hughes was arrested after police claimed they had received a complaint from a member of the public. He is pictured in Edinburgh
'I was interviewed by the police, they asked me a number of questions - "why were you out", "what were you saying", "did you say what the people said" - I said "no", of course. I was polite and courteous.
'I did say that you have my dictaphone in your possession, you can listen to the recording, the audio, if you like.They dismissed that. Not sure why, but I just continued with the interview, finished the questions.
He was then told shortly after the end of the interview in September 2013 that he would be released and no further action would be taken against him due to insufficient evidence.
Mr Hughes has now received 2,500 and a contribution towards his legal fees for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and breach of his human rights in an out-of-court settlement, according to his representatives.
He added: 'The whole experience left me feeling that street preachers - it's now a case of being presumed guilty until found innocent, which is really the wrong way round.
'Christians should be gracious in the midst of persecution, but at the same time we have a right to submit a legal defence.
His case was supported by the Christian Legal Centre, whose founder Andrea Minichiello Williams said: These cases are further examples of situations where the freedom of Christian preachers is restricted, when what they are saying is entirely lawful.
I was taken to the police station, processed, mugshot, fingerprints, DNA, the whole works

In Mr Hughes's case, he was not even talking about sexuality and yet was targeted by a member of the public who tried to shut him down.
The police officer involved with Mr Geuter's case wanted him not to preach the words of Jesus after one complaint was made about him expressing his opinion about the destruction of marriage by the government.
An Essex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Essex Police can confirm we've reached an out-of-court settlement with the claimant.'
Cardiff-born Mr Hughes moved to South Africa aged seven and became a Christian three years later. He returned to Britain in 1997 and now works with street evangelism group Operation 513.

	Breast cancer patients could be saved by £1 osteoporosis drug

	Secondary tumours in the bones cause roughly 85 per cent of deaths from breast cancer. Now Sheffield scientists have found a drug which may stop cancer penetrating the bones.

Primary tumours in the breast are relatively easy to deal with, because they can be simply removed with surgery or targeted with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
But when the cancer spreads to another part of the body - a process known as metastasis - it becomes untreatable.
Secondary breast cancers cause nearly all breast cancer deaths, and the most common site for the disease to spread is the bone.
This is important progress in the fight against breast cancer metastasis, increasing the chances of survival for thousands of patients
Dr Alison Gartland
Now scientists from Sheffield University, the Institute of Cancer Research in London, and the University of Copenhagen have found a key part of the mechanism by which the cancer cells dig into the bone.
The team estimates that the discovery could improve the prognosis of patients with the ER-negative form of the disease, who make up about 30 per cent of all breast cancer patients.
Research co-leader Dr Alison Gartland, a bone specialist at the University of Sheffield, said last night: This is really exciting.
ER-negative patients are the ones with the poorest prognosis - they are the ones who really need identifying and treating.
This is important progress in the fight against breast cancer metastasis, increasing the chances of survival for thousands of patients.
Her team discovered that ER-negative breast tumours release an enzyme called LysYl Oxidase - or LOX - which attacks the bones.
The enzyme creates holes in the bones surface, allowing the cancerous cells to enter.
The drugs, called bisphosphonates, are already in use as treatment for osteoporosis. But the team, led by experts at Sheffield University, hope that trials will show the drugs can effectively isolate breast cancer, pictured, in the most at-risk patients, stopping the disease from spreading
It is like the LOX enzyme is fertilising the soil of the bone, making it an attractive site for the cancer to grow, said Dr Gartland.
We have shown that bisphosphonates inhibit this process by stopping LOX interacting with the bone cells.
The team demonstrated that the drug works on human cells in the lab, and then backed their results up with tests on mice.
COULD THE HERPES VIRUS HALT THE SPREAD OF SKIN CANCER?
A genetically engineered herpes virus has been shown to halt the spread of skin cancer, killing diseased cells and kick-starting the immune system into action against tumours.
That is the conclusion of a landmark clinical trial of a brand new drug carried out at 64 research centres across the world.
It could be available within a year but there are fears it may be too expensive for the NHS after it refused to buy a number of high-profile new cancer drugs on the basis of cost.
The new treatment has been hailed as a potential cure to skin cancer, known as malignant melanoma, which is the most deadly form of cancer killing 2,000 people a year in Britain, with 13,000 cases.
Scientists believe the newest study is the first of its kind to definitively show viral immunotherapy is beneficial to cancer patients.
It was led by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden Hospital.
In total 436 patients with aggressive, inoperable malignant melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer, were recruited to take part in the trial.
They were randomly given either an injection of the viral therapy, called Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC), or a control immunotherapy.
The findings revealed that 16.3 per cent of the group taking T-VEC showed a durable treatment response of more than six months, compared with 2.1 per cent of the control group.
Some of the patients taking part showed a response extending in excess of three years - a mark oncologists often use as a benchmark for cure in immunotherapy.
In 40 per cent of cases in which it worked, the tumours vanished or shrunk by more than half.
And the new drug doesn't harm healthy cells which means the side effects are minimal compared to aggressive cancer treatments such as chemotherapy.
We had 100 per cent results, said Dr Gartland. Of the mice we tested, none developed metastatic tumours.
A series of clinical trials in humans is now planned, to test how effective the drug is on a large number of patients.
But because bisphosphonates are already used to treat osteoporosis, and are even used by some doctors to increase bone mass in breast cancer patients, they already know it is safe for human use.
They hope that within a few years the drug might be commonly used on the NHS.
As soon as a patient is diagnosed with breast cancer, a simple blood test could be used to identify the presence of the LOX enzyme.
Bisphosphonates would then be administered at an early stage to make sure the cancer does not spread.
Co-leader Dr Janine Erler, of Copenhagen University, said: Once cancer spreads to the bone it is very difficult to treat.
'Our research has shed light on the way breast cancer cells prime the bone so it is ready for their arrival.
If we were able to block this process and translate our work to the clinic, we could stop breast cancer in its tracks, thereby extending patients lives.
Around 15 per cent of people with breast cancer die within five years of diagnosis - a rate that would be dramatically reduced if secondary cancers could be stopped.
Katherine Woods of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, last night welcomed the discovery.
She said: By unveiling the role that the protein LOX is playing, these results open up a whole new avenue for research and treatments that could stop breast cancer spreading to the bone.
The reality of living with secondary breast cancer in the bone is a stark one, which leaves many women with bone pain and fractures that need extensive surgery just when they need to be making the most of the time they have left with friends and family.
Secondary breast cancer kills 1,000 women each and every month in the UK alone and yet we still dont know enough about how and why breast cancer spreads to stop it.
And Samia al Qadhi, of Breast Cancer Care, said: 'The findings in this early research indicate an exciting step towards a better understanding of how some breast cancers spread to the bones.
'This could, in future, help lay the basis for new and improved treatments and therapies for people with breast cancer.
'So we look forward to hearing the results from further studies and clinical trials.'

	Benefits Britain mother who rakes in £20k in dole a year criticises system

	Mum-of-three Sara Crafter, 45, from Essex, was filmed on Channel 5's Benefits Britain trying to help the boyfriend she met two weeks before to sign on to the dole to boost her household income.

But despite the lack of money since her separation, Sara says she is unable to earn a wage by getting a job because she suffers from vertigo, which is condition that causes constant dizziness and sickness.
Speaking on the programme, Sara said: 'Were called bums, lazy bums, but what [people] dont realise is when theres someone like me who would like to work but I cant work because I've got vertigo and stuff.'
Sarah celebrates as new boyfriend is signed on for benefits
Sara is pictured talking to her son Bryan, 22, who lives at home with his mother and two siblings
She continued: 'I have had three jobs, I worked at Tesco but then went on a dinner break and came back and they sacked me for no reason.'
But meeting Robert Zelasco, 39, from Poland, outside Morrisons while they were having a cigarette, gave her a glimmer of hope.
Until Sara met him two weeks before filming started, Robert was homeless. But a couple of days later he had moved in with her.
She said of their relationship: 'Weve been together for two weeks and Im hoping that when the divorce comes through we can get married.
'I think it would be best if I close my [benefits] claim down and Robert claims with us as a couple as it would be so much easier.
'I want to go down to the council and have Robert put on the tenancy, then I have to try and sort out a divorce from my husband.'
Despite being on benefits, Sara and her ex-husband installed a 2,000 shed in her back garden
Sara reveals on the programme that she bought a 12ft swimming pool that is now sitting unused in the garden because the lining split and no one has repaired it
When she brought up the topic with Robert, he told the cameras: 'I dont know, maybe Ill claim benefits, I don't know, well have to discuss.
'She told me that its difficult to survive on benefits, so I dont know if its a good idea yet.'
This is a nightmare, I hate it. This is hell. And they think its good on benefits?
But Sara interjected, explaining the difficult of surviving on an earned wage: 'If you get a job, by the time you have to pay full council tax, full rent, and other bills, you've got nothing, youre worse off.'
For the mum, however, living without a partner who is also on benefits, was leaving her cash-strapped and hungry.
She was shown towards the end of the month, as the handouts began to run out, leaving little in the fridge or freezer for them to eat.
On the day before her next benefits payment was due to come through, the family were down to 12 pence on their electricity meter.
Sara's three children are jobless and her younger son Bryan, who also featured on the programme, had been sanctioned for six months, which meant he couldn't claim benefits.
However the programme revealed that he has dreamed of stardom acting on soaps and has already auditioned for X Factor.
Sara and Robert are pictured in the living room of her Essex council house where they both now live
She said: 'Some days we can get really, really hungry. Were slowly running out of food.
'We weren't always like this, its only since Ive been on my own.
'This is why Im glad Ive got Robert in my life but weve got to sort [the benefits] out, weve really got to get money as a couple, whether hes Polish or not.
'When the telly goes off [because of a lack of electricity] I dont know what were going to do.
'This is a nightmare, I hate it. This is hell. And they think its good on benefits?
'How are we supposed to live? I know they do all of this Red Nose Day and stuff and send it all over to Africa and wherever but what about our country. Our country is in need as well.'
Sara, who lives in an Essex council house, said she used to have jobs until being sacked during a shift at Tescos but now suffers from vertigo, which leaves her with a constant sense of dizziness
A few days later, Sara visited the council offices to discuss getting Robert on the dole but returned despondent.
She told cameras: 'I went down to the social yesterday and theyre saying about not giving us money as a couple because hes got to have a job.
'Its alright them saying "go and get a job", but theres no jobs around. Were entitled to have money as a couple but theyre not even helping us.'
Robert said: 'For us Poles, there are no good jobs in the UK.
'If you speak English very well and finish your studies you can get a lot of good jobs, but without it you cant do anything.
'So I dont know what Im going to do. I really I have to do something. If theyre not going to give me benefits, I have to find a job.'
Sara meets Robert after he is signed on to the dole and she exults to cameras, 'Yes! He's officially on benefits at my house. I don't have to hide him any more.'
Sara reassured him: 'Youre going to be my husband soon and Im going to be your wife. At the end of the day, theyve got to accept that were a couple now.'
But the couple appeared to have some luck in the following days as in the final scene of the show, they were seen coming out of the local council offices with big grins on their faces.
Sara shouted to the cameras: 'Yes! Hes officially on benefits at my house. I dont have to hide him any more. Yes!'

        <MainBody>Longtime LGBT supporter J.K. Rowling responded with style when anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church threatened to picket the wedding of Dumbledore and Gandalf
Harry Potter author J.K Rowling has delivered a stinging slap-down to the notoriously homophobic Westboro Baptist Church.
The longtime supporter of LGBT rights was delighted by the news that Ireland had voted in favour of gay marriage, and sharing her joy on Twitter.
She retweeted an internet meme about Dumbledore and Gandalf being in a relationship together and enthused that if they were they could get married in Ireland.
Unfortunately the tweet was spotted by a member of the extremely anti-gay church, who failed to see the romantic side.
Along with an incredibly offensive homophobic montage, the WBC member tweeted: JK Rowling wants Dumbledore and Gandalf to marry in Ireland; if it happens WBC will picket!
Internet users were quick to acknowledge the bizarre nature of the threat to picket the wedding, given that both the intended victims are, in fact, fictional characters.
But never one to be beaten in a war of words, J.K. waded into the fray in support of her character and his potential lover.
She responded: Alas, the sheer awesomeness of such a union in such a place would blow your tiny bigoted minds out of your thick sloping skulls.
Some fans criticised J.K. for responding to WBC and giving them the attention they crave, the author made it clear that her response was for her fans and not for the church.

	It's time for spring-cleaning and there's a host of new products to help out. Handheld vacuums are the answer to backaches and hard to reach areas. Jill Foster has put 10 to the test for FEMAIL.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>A MUST FOR DUST
Black &amp; Decker Dustbuster Pivot, 82.21, amazon.co.uk
The rotating head on this model means its really useful for sucking up dust in hard-to-get-to corners such as the top of door frames and ceiling lights. I like the fact that its got an integrated crevice tool and brush which makes it impossible to lose them. The flip-lid means emptying is easy and it can be folded to half its size when stored. Great suction, too.5/5
MAN-FRIENDLY
Dyson DC34, 169.99, currys.co.uk
Although you cant fault the Dyson for its power (out of all the models I tried, this had the best suction for its size) its more than five times the price of some of the cheaper models and I simply didnt like the look of it. Too much like a workmans power tool, it would be more suited in the garage or a workshop than in a kitchen. I did like the boost feature which gave extra suction. A good Fathers Day present!3/5
GOOD FOR WOOD
Gtech SW20, 79.95, gtech.co.uk
Incredibly light with a swivel and telescopic handle, this is perfect for anyone who is a little less mobile. It sounds a bit tinny but is cordless and has a decent-sized dust-collecting bin.
While its possible to use it as a handheld device, the head is a little on the large side to use in small areas. Much better for picking up dust and spills from a floor. I found it picked up best on hard, wooden floors. 3/5
BUDGET BUY
Draper cordless, 19.56, drapertools.com
One of the cheapest I tried and with only a 6v battery the suction isnt great but it picks up small dry and wet spills well.
It comes with a wall-mounted docking station, a long crevice tool  although I thought the mouth of this was too small  but also a charger for the car, which is very handy.
It says it comes with a brush although the model I tried didnt have one. Value-for-money option but it didnt blow me away, so to speak. 2/5
NO MORE BACK ACHE
Good Ideas 2 in 1, 26.99, wayfair.co.uk
Very reasonably-priced, I liked the feel and look of this model. The fact that you can attach a long extension nozzle, making it look like a more conventional upright vacuum cleaner, will appeal to anyone who doesnt like bending over to clean up spills. Downsides are that its not cordless and the dust chamber is pretty small, so youd have to empty it regularly.3/5
HOT METAL!
Morphy Richards SuperVac 2 in 1, 74.99, amazon.co.uk
Aesthetically, this super-streamlined metallic model was my favourite but then, look at the price.
Although you can use it in an upright mode (like a vacuum cleaner) or as a hand-held dustbuster, the suction isnt super powerful, so I wouldnt recommend it to vacuum an entire room. It has a decent-sized dustbowl and as the handle folds over, it can be stored in a compact space.4/5
WET AND DRY CHOICE
Vax Wet and Dry, 70, vax.co.uk
Nothing to look at but perfectly efficient, this model picked up dust and wet spills well. The white docking station could be kept on a floor or a worktop  I prefer wall-mounted docking stations as I find them easier to access  and there is a crevice tool handily housed in the docking station. Reasonably priced.3/5
FLASH FOR THE CASH
Vorwerk Kobold VC100, 149, vkdirect.co.uk
One for the Apple generation, this sleek, white device would be well suited to a designer kitchen. Its incredibly light to use, weighing the equivalent of about two cans of cola, although the suction doesnt seem particularly powerful. It has a green LED display which tells you how much suction is left and with no tools to attach, its very much style over substance. But I did like it.3/5

Staff are said to be 'furious' at the positive discrimination and some said they were 'shocked' when they saw the advert. 
The 'politically correct job vacancy' has been blasted with some saying the 'box-ticking exercise' sounds like a story line from theBBC's own spoof comedy W1A.
An official advert posted on the corporation's vacancies website said the BBC does not currently have any disabled weather presenters
In a recent episode of the show, bosses hired Muslim Sadiq Iqbal as a weather presenter because they wanted a bearded man to keep the broadcasting watchdog happy.
A source told The Sun : 'This feels like political correctness gone mad on the part of the BBC.
'Surely it's much more important for the weather to be presented by an expert, rather than someone with a disability?
'Everyone supports disabled people getting great jobs but it makes sense that they still have the right experience and qualifications. This feels like a box-ticking exercise.'
'W1A is meant to be a parody, not a documentary.'
The BBC has traditionally employed fully-qualified meteorologists and many of itscurrent crop have a wealth of experience.
The BBC has traditionally employed fully-qualified meteorologists with a wealth of experience, pictured is forecaster Alex Deakin who has an astrophysics degree
Weatherman Alex Deakin has an Astrophysics degree, Chris Fawkes has a Geography degree, Peter Gibbs is a polar meteorologist and Philip Avery is a navy weather expert.
Many familiar faces had previously been employed by the Met Office - including Michael Fish who famously dismissed an oncoming hurricane in 1987.
The job advert said the BBC Academy would be running a free training opportunity to help men and women with a disability feel comfortable presenting bulletins on television and radio.
Candidates will be given a masterclass with current weather presenters as well as sessions with a voice coach.
They will even be given a session with stylist along with training presenting using an earpiece and live talkback.
'You will meet established weather presenters and members of the production team and will learn what it takes to present BBC weather bulletins,' it said.
Candidates who take part in the training will be eligible to apply for future vacancies.
A BBC spokesperson said: 'We are not advertising for a disabled weather presenter. This training opportunity is open to men and women with disabilities who have a passion for weather and the environment and who have the potential to become weather presenters in the future.
'There are no jobs guaranteed at the end of the training. There is nothing 'PC' about offering training to people with disabilities.'

	SNP MPs broke strict Parliamentary rules today by breaking into applause on at least three occasions as their Westminster leader Angus Robertson delivered his response to the Queen's Speech.

It came after David Cameron fired a warning at the SNP after their stunning landslide win at the election that he would go after them in the Commons.
The Prime Minister said the nationalists had got away without enough scrutiny in the past but would not be able to carry on escaping criticism in Westminster.
After unveiling a raft of powers for the Scottish Parliament, Mr Cameron said the party could no longer whinge about decisions in Westminster.
David Cameron this afternoon fired a warning at the SNP MPs - including its former leader Alex Salmond - after their stunning landslide win at the election that he would go after them in the Commons

Mr Cameron claimed new powers for Holyrood - including control over tax, spending and welfare - would make it 'one of the most powerful parliaments in the world'.
He said it was time for the nationalist to 'stop talking and start acting'.
'THE WHITE ROSE OF SCOTLAND'
The Scottish National Party's 56 MPs attended the state opening of Parliament wearing a distinctive white rose.
SNP MPs and its members of the Scottish Parliament have made a tradition of wearing the floral button hole at all Westminster and Holyrood parliament openings.
Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid (pictured)
The flower was made famous by Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid in 'The Little White Rose of Scotland'.
The poem reads:
'The rose of all the world is not for me
'I want for my part
'Only the little white rose of Scotland
'That smells sharp and sweet - and breaks the heart.'
However, the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon this afternoon demanded 'substantial' further powers for Scotland  on top of what was contained in the Queen's Speech.
Ms Sturgeon said the general election, in which the SNP won an unprecedented 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, provided a 'mandate for substantial further powers' beyond those already recommended by the Smith Commission.
The Scottish First Minister said: 'The Scotland Bill must deliver the Smith proposals in full, but that must not be portrayed by the UK Government as some kind of concession - delivering Smith would only be fulfilling the pledge they have already signed up to and the promise they have made to the people of Scotland.
'In addition, we believe the massively changed political circumstances in Scotland provides a mandate for substantial further powers beyond those recommended by the Smith process and we will continue to make a strong case to the UK Government for those powers to be delivered.'
Mr Cameron said the Scotland Bill will make Holyrood responsible for raising about 40% of taxes, according to the UK Government, with powers to set the thresholds and rates of income tax included in the legislation - and with all the money this brings in staying north of the border.
It also proposes giving Holyrood some money from VAT revenues, devolving responsibility for air passenger duty and give MSPs about GBP2.5 billion worth of new powers over welfare, according to Westminster.
Mr Cameron said: ''Devolution isn't just about getting new powers, it is also about the responsibility of how those powers are used.
''I would say to the SNP, if you are not happy with decisions made here at Westminster, if you want more taxes, more spending and more borrowing, you can now introduce those measures in Scotland.'

The Scotland Bill is one of 17 in the Queen's Speech which will apply in Scotland, either fully or in part.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: 'Scotland's future is on a better footing thanks to the government's ambitious programme with measures to create jobs and support working people at the heart of our plan.
'We are delivering quickly on further devolution by giving the Scottish Parliament wide-ranging new powers.
'That means Scotland will have a huge amount of flexibility to make its own decisions while keeping the many advantages of being part of the UK.
'The Scottish Government must now be clear on how it intends to use both these and its existing powers in the interests of Scotland.'
But Ms Sturgeon said the package of measures made it 'abundantly clear that the priorities this UK Government have outlined in the Queen's Speech are not the priorities of the Scottish Government'.
The SNP leader said: 'At a time when people are suffering the impact of austerity, with the most serious effects falling on some of the most vulnerable in society, we believe it is quite wrong to continue with an economic policy which involves more savage cuts to welfare provision.'
Clapping is allowed in the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood (pictured) but not in the Commons
With the legislative programme including a Bill on an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union by the end of 2017, Ms Sturgeon said her party would make a 'powerful and positive case for Scotland and the UK's continued membership'.
She wants to see a 'double-lock mechanism' in the legislation which would 'require majorities in all four home UK nations before any withdrawal from the EU'.
After 16 and 17-year-olds voted in last year's independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party would 'push for a referendum that is fair to all, by giving the right to vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, and to the citizens of all EU countries who are resident here'.
While Mr Cameron omitted legislation to scrap the Human Rights Act (HRA) from the Queen's Speech, he said the Government would bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights to replace it, with legislation expected following consultation later in the parliament.
The First Minister said the Scottish Government would continue to oppose any such move.
'While the proposals on the Human Rights Act appear to have been delayed, today's Queen's Speech makes clear the UK Government is still committed to its repeal,' she said.
'We believe that is wrong and deeply misguided, given the protection the Act affords to ordinary citizens in a whole range of areas.'

        <Description>
	Michelle Leathem, 32, from Warrington, Cheshire, suffers from the rare Ménière's disease. She is struck by eight hour spells of vertigo, and has been told she may completely lose her hearing.

She said: 'I've smashed plates while washing up, I'm covered in bruises and I've burnt myself while making coffee.
'If I'm out, I just hang on to the pram and hope for the best and I'm exhausted afterwards - I lose days of my life to the dizzy spells.'
The rare disorder affects only 1,000 people in the UK, and is slightly more common in women than men.
Mrs Leathem suffers eight-hour spells of vertigo in which she can barely walk, suffers tinnitus and loses her hearing intermittently. She is pictured here with husbandDave and sons Tyler, ten, andIsaac, two
WHAT IS MNIRE'S DISEASE?
Mnire's disease is a condition that affects a part of the inner ear known as the labyrinth.
This is comprised of tiny fluid-filled channels that help transmit sound vibrations to the brain.
The labyrinth is also key to our sense of balance, sensing when the head moves and transmitting this information, via the vestibular nerve, to the brain.
With Mnire's, the fluid in the labyrinth builds up, causing the tissue to swell, and disrupting both hearing and balance.
This leads to symptoms such as vertigo (attacks may last anything from several minutes to 24 hours), nausea, vomiting, palpitations and sweating.
The condition can also lead to depression and anxiety.
There is also no established cure, but it can be treated with drugs or by lifestyle changes.
As a last resort, patients may be offered surgery, removing some of the bone in the inner ear to create more space.
The exact cause of Mnire's disease is unknown, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear.
The condition has left Mrs Leathem unable to go back to her job in facilities management, so she cares for her sons Isaac, two, and Tyler, ten, and volunteers at a children's centre.
Her husband Dave, a manager at a telecoms firm, has been forced to keep the family afloat financially for three years.
And the whole family are on constant call to help with her episodes of vertigo.
They have learned to cope when she stops being able to hear and can't concentrate on what they are saying.
Mrs Leathem said: 'It affects every part of my life but I am determined to try my best to carry on - that is just what you have to do when you are trying to raise two boys.
'Sometimes when Isaac is running around the house I just can't tell what he is saying but Tyler has got used to it now and sometimes he'll finish off my sentences.
'I'll lose my train of thought all the time and my husband has learnt how to deal with it too and will just nod and let me come back to whatever I was thinking of later.
'I've never found a trigger for it - most doctors don't even fully understand it - some people claim that a high salt diet can bring on attacks, but I've not had that.'
'The other day I just lost all hearing for a while and it was terrifying - if I don't do something then it may be permanent.
'I can't stand the idea of taking my children to the park and not being able to hear a single word they are saying.'

Mrs Leathem, pictured  with son Isaac, is currently fundraising for a 13,000 treatment. 'I can't stand the idea of taking my children to the park and not being able to hear a single word they are saying,' she said
Mrs Leathem is currently fundraising for a pioneering treatment which she hopes will save her hearing, after doctors said she was unsuitable for surgery to treat the disease.
The treatment is called Stephen Spring Protocol (SSP), named after the Australian doctor who developed it. The treatment uses a different approach for each case.
Mrs Leathem needs to raise 13,000 for tablets she must take eight times a day, plus Skype consultations with doctors in Australia.
To raise funds, she has organised a ladies' night, and plans to donate any extra money she raises to the Mnire's Society charity.
She said: 'The NHS' strategy is usually to basically destroy your inner ear to combat the vertigo, which leaves you deaf in one ear but that is fine if you have another ear to compensate.
'I have Mnire's in both ears so the only option to rescue my hearing is to pay for the treatment which has a 60 to 70 per cent success rate.
'The treatment has worked for some people so I have to try it so at least then I can say that I have done everything possible to try and get better.'

As well as the reappearance of Miss Galore, famously played in the 1964 film by Honor Blackman and last seen wrapped in James Bonds arms, the plot uses an unused Fleming storyline called Murder on Wheels.
It will feature another original Bond girl, Jeopardy Lane.
News of the novel, which is being published on September 8, has been announced on what would have been Flemings 107th birthday today.
Horowitz said: It was always my intention to go back to the true Bond  the Bond that Fleming created and it was a fantastic bonus having some original, unseen material from the master to launch my story.
The novel, byAnthony Horowitz, will be calledTrigger Mortis and is set two weeks after Goldfinger ended
The book was commissioned by Ian Flemings estate.
His niece Lucy said: When you get these top authors you dont really want to interfere.
We read the script to see if there are any discrepancies with the Bond character, but there was really was very little to do on this because Anthony knows Ians writing so well.
Horowitz, whose screenwriting career includes Midsomer Murders and Foyles War, has sold more than 19million copies of his Alex Rider spy series.

	A study by Oxford University found that NHS waiting times for referrals for vital cancer tests are four times longer than countries such as those in Scandinavia, Australia and Canada.

They tended to tell patients with bowel cancer symptoms to change their diet, prescribe painkillers or just say there was nothing they could do.
The findings, published in BMJ Open, prompt concern that lives are being lost because GPs are reluctant to refer patients for expensive tests if there is only a very small chance they have cancer.
For years, data has persistently shown that cancer survival rates in Britain are lower than other countries in the Western world even though our healthcare systems are similar.
Although experts have speculated this was because GPs are not sending patients for tests, this is the first study to highlight the extent of the problem.
Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, which funded the study, said that GPs role as gatekeepers for vital cancer checks needed to be urgently reviewed if patients are not being referred speedily.
GPs have a difficult job to do. They have to ensure those who need specialist tests get them, without overloading a health system thats already strained, she said.
The study involved 2,795 GPs from 11 countries and regions, including the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and Australia. The doctors completed a questionnaire asking them what they would do in various scenarios.
Once referred, patients can still wait a month for a cancer diagnosis, by which time tumours may have spread to other organs and the bones (file picture)
Only one GP in ten in the UK who saw a 62-year-old heavy smoker with breathlessness would send him for chest X-rays or scans to check for lung cancer, compared with two in ten in Denmark and Australia, and five in ten in Canada.
Fewer than four in ten GPs in the UK would send a 53-year-old woman for tests for ovarian cancer if she was complaining of irregular periods and abdominal pain, compared with six in ten in Australia and seven in ten in Canada.
GPs point out that cancer is very difficult to diagnose, and symptoms of lung, bowel and womb cancer can easily be mistaken for other long-term health problems.
They say that of the thousands of patients they see each year, an average of eight will turn out to have any form of cancer.
Researchers also blame the structure of the NHS, which means family doctors cannot easily ask the advice of more specialist hospital doctors.
GPs also say they are often deterred by budget-wary NHS managers from referring patients for expensive X-rays, CT scans and other checks which will probably prove unnecessary.
The findings also show that waiting times for scans in the UK are nearly four times longer than elsewhere in the world.
Patients face delays of almost five weeks for ultrasounds  used to diagnose ovarian cancer  compared with less than two weeks in Australia.
Study lead author Dr Peter Rose said: These striking findings are the first to identify factors in primary care that could be contributing to international differences in cancer outcomes.
The Department of Health said: Early diagnosis is crucial to beat cancer. We are urging GPs to make sure people with symptoms are referred as quickly as possible.
Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England said: This paper, which identifies some key factors that could lead to earlier diagnosis, supports our major programme of work to test innovative ways to diagnose cancer more quickly.

GPs have a difficult job to do. They have to ensure those who need specialist tests get them, without overloading a health system thats already strained, she said.
The study involved 2,795 GPs from 11 countries and regions, including the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and Australia. The doctors completed a questionnaire asking them what they would do in various scenarios.
Once referred, patients can still wait a month for a cancer diagnosis, by which time tumours may have spread to other organs and the bones (file picture)
Only one GP in ten in the UK who saw a 62-year-old heavy smoker with breathlessness would send him for chest X-rays or scans to check for lung cancer, compared with two in ten in Denmark and Australia, and five in ten in Canada.
Fewer than four in ten GPs in the UK would send a 53-year-old woman for tests for ovarian cancer if she was complaining of irregular periods and abdominal pain, compared with six in ten in Australia and seven in ten in Canada.
GPs point out that cancer is very difficult to diagnose, and symptoms of lung, bowel and womb cancer can easily be mistaken for other long-term health problems.
They say that of the thousands of patients they see each year, an average of eight will turn out to have any form of cancer.
Researchers also blame the structure of the NHS, which means family doctors cannot easily ask the advice of more specialist hospital doctors.
GPs also say they are often deterred by budget-wary NHS managers from referring patients for expensive X-rays, CT scans and other checks which will probably prove unnecessary.
The findings also show that waiting times for scans in the UK are nearly four times longer than elsewhere in the world.
Patients face delays of almost five weeks for ultrasounds  used to diagnose ovarian cancer  compared with less than two weeks in Australia.
Study lead author Dr Peter Rose said: These striking findings are the first to identify factors in primary care that could be contributing to international differences in cancer outcomes.
The Department of Health said: Early diagnosis is crucial to beat cancer. We are urging GPs to make sure people with symptoms are referred as quickly as possible.
Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England said: This paper, which identifies some key factors that could lead to earlier diagnosis, supports our major programme of work to test innovative ways to diagnose cancer more quickly.

	BBC kills off Never Mind The Buzzcocks as JAN MOIR says more are ripe for the chop

	Let’s hope this signals a moratorium on the endless, vicious little battles of the witless which have characterised Buzzcocks — and so many shows like it — for the past 20 years, writes JAN MOIR.

For years Buzzcocks has been an enduring hit with its core audience, young-ish men whom I imagine to be lonely boys forever at a loose end, keen to amuse themselves once the allure of picking the curry stains off their Motorhead T-shirts and checking the airlocks on their home-brew kits has faded. Some of them have already started an online petition to save their favourite show, bless.
However, its too late, suckers. The plunging ratings can no longer be ignored. Official figures for the show, which is broadcast at 10pm on Monday evenings, reveal that under a million viewers now tune in. Which means it attracts an audience six times smaller than that of Countryfile and fewer than half the viewers who tuned in to watch Mary Berry marinate her pheasant breasts (laddish snigger) on her latest BBC cookery show.
No women  apart from the indefatigable comedienne Jo Brand (pictured with, from left, Alan Davies, Stephen Fry, Phill Jupitus and Josh Widdicombe)  make a regular appearance on these shows
No wonder that BBC2 controller Kim Shillinglaw has decided not to recommission another series of Buzzcocks in a bid to create space for new entertainment formats. Lets make that space huge.
Lets hope this signals a moratorium on the endless, vicious little battles of the witless which have characterised Buzzcocks  and so many shows like it  for the past two decades.
Launched in 1996, it was supposed to be a straightforward comedy panel show with celebrity guests answering questions on pop music. Yet from the beginning it was always an uneasy clash between comedy and rock n roll, between the comedian hosts and the funny-guy team captains on one side, who delighted in baiting the musicians and stars who made guest appearances.
In short, it was a place where bitter B-list celebrities got together to bully needy C-listers  and thus feel better about their big, bad selves. Quite often, it made for uncomfortable viewing.
Asked if the faltering show was still viable when he took over the reins last year, Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert said: I hope so! If I thought I was coming in just to stand on the bow while the bloody thing sank, I wouldnt be doing it.
TV presenters Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton, allow themselves to be patronised by Keith Lemon on Celebrity Juice. Above the three stars together
Ship aground, captain!
Since day one, the show has been put together by five comedy writers  all of them male, of course  and controversy was never far away.
Fan highlights over the years include musician Huey Morgan (front man of the Fun Lovin Criminals) smashing his mug in a temper; chunky team captain Phill Jupitus walking off in a huff when rapper Dappy made a joke about a fat person; and yes, dear old Lemmy from Motorhead also walking off when he finally understood that the waspish hosts were laughing at him, not with him.
Few women shone in the show as they were more often than not reduced to token blonde status; dummies who were there to be demeaned by the boys.
Everyone was ribbed, of course, but women more than most  it was a mystery why any sensible female agreed to appear.
Guest host Lorraine Kelly waxed Phill Jupituss leg and spanked funny-guy team captain Noel Fielding with a truncheon. Anthea Turner was roundly mocked for a brave attempt to relaunch her career as a perfect housewife, while Gail Porter, the TV presenter whose nude image was once beamed on to the Houses of Parliament, was shown no mercy when she refused to be rude about the rock star Michael Stipe, who fronted REM.
Well, go home then, sneered host Mark Lamarr. If you are not going to show us your a**e or slag him off there is no reason for you to be here.
Thanks very much, Mark, she said, clearly affronted.
Dont be stroppy, young lady, he snapped.
Another host, Simon Amstell, was always the most vicious. When the troubled Amy Winehouse appeared, Amstell  supposedly a friend of the late singer  made jokes about her addictions, asking if she wanted some crack or some more to drink.
This isnt even a pop quiz any more, its an intervention, Amy. We all care for you, Amy, he smarmed, as concerned for her welfare as a buzzard swooping on a wounded mouse.
This show, which has always been a crucible of hostility, a place where arrogance and petty cruelty masqueraded as witty bloke-ish banter, is over not a moment too soon.
And plenty of others like it are ripe for the chop. The topical panel show Have I Got News For You is still easily the best of a bad bunch, attracting an audience of more than four million each week.
However, even this classic is flaunting signs of wear and tear. The guest presenters dont always work and sometimes team captain Paul Merton, who can single-handedly launch HIGNFY into dazzling new heights of hilarity, looks bored.
Mock The Week, QI and others shows feature the usual dreary suspects, the same names and faces who turn up again and again on the creaking merry-go-round of big boy badinage and supreme male smuggery: comedians Alan Davies, Dara O Briain, Chris Addison, Rory McGrath, David Mitchell, Jeremy Hardy and, of course, Stephen Fry. Ugh, kill me now.
Have I missed anyone out? Yes, stalwarts John Sessions, Reginald D. Hunter and Alan Carr  who are all excused criticism, on the grounds that at least these comics are always genuinely funny.
Note that no women  apart from the indefatigable comedienne Jo Brand  make a regular appearance on these shows. And that is because most female entertainers dont see comedy panel shows as show-off gladiatorial contests which they must win at all costs.
Of course, the very worst crimes are committed down in the shallows of the panel game show genre. Eight Out Of Ten Cats with Jimmy Carr is simply unwatchable, Celebrity Juice is even worse. Written and presented by Keith Lemon, the alter ego of comedian Lee Francis, it is an execrable pile of nonsense. Female team captains, the TV presenters Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton, allow themselves to be patronised by Lemon, but its the men who truly deserve our contempt.
A new low came recently, when reality TV star Joey Essex was asked the name of Jesuss mother. Moses? he replied. In the last show of the series, Jimmy Carr and fellow comic Johnny Vegas were asked to eat food items then guess what each other had eaten by the smell of their breath.
Could it get any more puerile? Yes, rude remarks were made about an intimate part of Fearne Cottons anatomy during the guessing game.
She looked shocked, as well you might. But if you thrash around with boy pigs in the celebrity boy sty, you must accept that you will get hosed down with muck. At least from today onwards, there is one less opportunity for them to do so.

	Only three weeks ago it would have seemed incredible that yesterday’s Queen’s Speech would emerge in the form it did — as an authentically Conservative programme for government.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
The Trade Unions Bill will include a 50 per cent voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts, and a requirement that 40 per cent of those entitled to vote must back action in essential services. Trade union members will have to opt into (rather than, as present, out of) paying a levy to the Labour Party. These changes amount to the most significant curbing of trade union power since 1983.
Also welcome is the Immigration Bill, which will include the new offence of illegal working, enabling police to seize wages paid to illegal workers as the proceeds of crime. This is all well and good so long as the Government realises that further changes will be necessary if the net annual immigration figure is to be brought down appreciably from over 300,000.
Other sensible measures include further devolution to Scotland and Wales, which can hardly be resisted, and increased autonomy for some English cities. There is also a promise to reduce red tape (wonderful, if it ever happens) and a blanket ban on drugs offering legal highs.
However, one piece of idiocy which cant be ignored is a Bill to outlaw increases in income tax rates, VAT or National Insurance before 2020. Why couldnt an undertaking suffice? And what will happen if the world economy implodes again?
Disturbing omissions include an undertaking to maintain defence expenditure at 2 per cent of GDP, and a British Bill of Rights, which has been kicked into at least the next session. Admittedly it is a devilishly complex and contentious issue, and postponement may well be prudent, but to avoid the imputation of funk the Government should have explained its thinking with greater candour.
All in all, though, this is an impressive Tory programme such as many of us doubted wed ever hear from a Government led by David Cameron. That said, it is one thing setting out your stall in politics, quite another to translate even well-laid plans into action.
Labour and Lib Dem peers in the Lords will try to scupper many of these Bills, especially those proposing trade union, welfare and immigration reform. Consider the hullabaloo there has already been over plans to replace the Human Rights Act, with a gallery of misguided actors and activists shrieking that our very freedoms are at risk.
Mr Cameron can hardly create 200 peers at a stroke to redress the electoral imbalance in the Lords. But he can insist that Opposition peers observe the so-called Salisbury Convention, which dates back to 1945, whereby the second chamber wont oppose the second or third reading of any government legislation promised in its election manifesto. That covers pretty well the entire Queens Speech.
Mandate
It cant be said too often that the Conservatives won an electoral mandate and they have a right to expect that if their legislation passes through the Commons, it will not be endlessly frustrated by tumultuous Opposition peers acting in a fundamentally undemocratic manner.
And that concept of a mandate should also be understood by the BBC which, at least until Labour reconstitutes itself, is likely to appoint itself the main critic of Tory plans. Already I hear in its news reports words such as controversial attached to policies which won favour with the electorate even if they dont go down well in Broadcasting House.
And that concept of a mandate should also be understood by the BBC which, at least until Labour reconstitutes itself, is likely to appoint itself the main critic of Tory plans
The BBC should try to remember that its remit is to hold all politicians to account, not to behave as Her Majestys Opposition. And it shouldnt forget that its own privileged position as a public service broadcaster enjoined by law to be neutral comes up for review next year.
David Cameron will simply have to face down unruly peers and a sniping state broadcaster in a way that does not come naturally to such an emollient man. Equally, he is bound to face dissent from Tory backbenches over a British Bill of Rights when it is eventually introduced, and in due course over Europe. The Governments slim majority obviously makes him vulnerable.
Robust
The question is whether he will turn out to be a Margaret Thatcher, who thrived on a good scrap, or a John Major, who was gradually worn down by his critics, especially in his own party, and the ill-luck that befalls most leaders. It is certain that coalition has not prepared David Cameron for the convulsions and confrontations that lie ahead.
The question is whether he will turn out to be a Margaret Thatcher, who thrived on a good scrap, or a John Major, who was gradually worn down by his critics (both pictured)
Yet here is a robust set of policies on which he has staked his reputation. Perhaps against his own instincts and deepest wishes, he finds himself cast in the role of a radical Tory Prime Minister with genuinely Tory policies.
He can, like Margaret Thatcher in 1983 and 1987, steadfastly follow what is bound to be a sometimes perilous and lonely path. Or, like Tony Blair on so many occasions after 1997, he can accommodate his (domestic) enemies, avoid the big fights, and settle for half measures.
Which will it be? I confess that in all the years since he became Tory leader in 2005 I have never seen David Cameron as a radical who would battle against vested interests. After listening to the Queens Speech, I am wondering for the first time whether I might be wrong.

	Tory plans to scrap the Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights were plunged into confusion when it emerged that they had been delayed by a year and were not included in the Queen’s Speech.

Opposition MPs said Mr Cameron was booting the issue into the long grass and the Tory manifesto was unravelling.
Under plans drawn up in the last Parliament by Chris Grayling, then justice secretary, Strasbourg would have been given an ultimatum to agree to Britains courts having the final say. If it refused, the UK would have been prepared to walk away.
However, the idea of Britain leaving the European court and its parent body, the Council of Europe, dismayed Tory rebels led by former shadow home secretary David Davis, who claimed it would set a bad example to the rest of the world.
The Conservative manifesto promised to introduce a new 'British Bill of Rights' to curb the power of European judges and stop the abuse of human rights laws by foreign criminals
A British Bill of Rights would allow the government to ignore verdicts by judges in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg  giving the UK Supreme Court the final say instead
The Queen lays out programme of tax cuts and job creation
WHAT WAS IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH? 
Full Employment and Welfare Benefits Bill: Freezes most working-age benefits and cuts benefits cap for non-working families to 23,000 a year.
Enterprise Bill: Cuts red tape for small businesses and creates conciliation service to deal with disputes between firms.
National Insurance Contributions Bill: Tax lock to ensure no rise in income tax, VAT or National Insurance rates for individuals, employees and employers.
Childcare Bill: Families where both parents work will be entitled to 30 hours a week of free childcare for three and four-years olds for 38 weeks a year.
Housing Bill: Extends right to buy to housing association tenants, and makes it easier for those wishing to build own homes to acquire land.
Energy Bill: Communities to be given an effective veto on new onshore wind-farms.
Education and Adoption Bill: Powers to speed up the process of changing a failing schools leadership.
Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill: Powers over housing, transport, planning and policing devolved to Englands cities.
HS2 Bill: Clears the way for railway line with compulsory purchase orders.
Immigration Bill: Visa levy on firms importing foreign workers to fund apprenticeships, tagging of foreign criminals, deport first appeal later and docking wages of illegal migrants.
European Union Referendum Bill: In-out vote on UKs membership of the EU will be held before end of 2017. Only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 will be able to vote. EU nationals living in the UK will not.
Trade Unions Bill: Trade union members will have to opt in to contributing to the Labour party. New 50 per cent voting threshold for union strike ballot turnouts. Requirement that 40 per cent of those entitled to vote must back action in essential public services.
Psychoactive Substances Bill: Ban on all legal highs and jail sentences of up to seven years for dealers.
Police and Criminal Justice Bill: End to scandal of accused being left to rot on bail for years. New powers for police watchdog. Reforms to Police Federation.
Investigatory Powers Bill: New snooping powers for the security and intelligence agencies to track phone calls, emails, internet use and even smartphone apps.
Extremism Bill: New powers to ban extremist groups and close radical mosques.
Scotland Bill: More powers for the Scottish Parliament including over income tax thresholds, rates and spending as well as 2.5billion worth of new welfare powers.
Wales Bill: Powers over energy, transport, speed limits, local government and voting rules devolved to Cardiff.
Northern Ireland Bill:Relatives of victims of the Troubles will be given previously secret information about deaths of loved ones.
... AND WHAT WAS MISSED OUT?
Hunting ban: Tory manifesto promised a free vote on repealing the hunting ban  but it did not appear.
Human Rights Act: The Queen said British Bill of Rights would be introduced, but no legislation was mentioned.
Volunteering: Manifesto pledged guaranteed leave from work to do volunteering.
Turing Law: A promised Bill to pardon gay men convicted of historical indecency offences did not appear.
With the Tory majority in the Commons at only 12, party whips did not believe they had the votes required for the British Bill of Rights to pass. As a result, the threat to leave the court is dead.
The move is likely to dismay some Tory hardliners angry at Strasbourg decisions such as blocking the deportation of extremist cleric Abu Qatada and demanding that prisoners be given the vote.
But Whitehall sources insist there is no need for the UK to threaten to leave. Britain could ignore sanctions handed down by the court, knowing it would not be expelled. They point out that the Council of Europe has not expelled Russia  despite its illegal invasion of Ukraine.
There will now be a lengthy consultation over how to make Britains Supreme Court supreme and scrap the Human Rights Act, which Labour embedded deep in the constitution.
The Act enshrines the European Convention on Human Rights in British law. The Convention is overseen by the European Court of Human Rights.
The 1998 Human Rights Act - incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into British law - is overseen by Strasbourg's European Court of Human Rights (pictured)
The Tories plan to repeal the Act but put the wording of the Convention in the British Bill of Rights. This would give the UK courts supremacy over the Strasbourg court, which would be treated as an advisory body.
Tory MPs who want the Act scrapped warned the Prime Minister not to lose momentum over an idea first mooted in the 2010 manifesto, only to be blocked by the Lib Dems. But Mr Cameron insisted: Be in no doubt  we will be introducing legislation on this issue, because I want these decisions made by British judges in British courts, not in Strasbourg. Besides Mr Davis, potential Tory rebels include ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve and former chief whip Andrew Mitchell. Others with concerns include ex-prisons minister Crispin Blunt and Kenneth Clarke.
One rebel reportedly said: These plans will only pass if the Prime Minister wins the support of David Davis and Ken Clarke.
Ministers say they are confident of drafting a Bill to satisfy all sides. One said: This is not about kicking it into the long grass  it is about properly rolling the pitch.
WHAT IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND WHY IS IT SO CONTROVERSIAL?
When was it brought in?
The human rights act was introduced by Tony Blair in 1998 - putting the European Convention on Human Rights into British law.
The convention was a package of laws designed by nations including the UK in the aftermath of the Second World War.
It meant people in the UK could bring cases about their human rights in domestic courts.Previously, complaints could only be heard in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.
However, it also meant the Strasbourg court became the final court of appeal for human rights cases.
What rights does it cover?
The freedoms and other measures enshrined by the act include the right to life, the right not to be tortured and the right to a fair trial.
Rights to a family and private life and the freedom of thought, conscience and religion are also protected.
Why do people want it changed?
Critics claim it has been exploited by criminals and terrorists, while giving judges in Europe the power to overrule British laws and judicial decisions.
Why do they say that?
There have been a slew of controversial cases involving human rights.
One of the most acrimonious legal battles of recent times saw the Home Office spend at least 1.7 million over eight years trying to deport Abu Qatada - a Muslim cleric once accused of being Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe.
Attempts to eject him were repeatedly thwarted by human rights laws.
The European Court of Human Rights has also ruled against the UK's ban on voting for prisoners.
Why is this coming up now?
The Conservatives have pledged for a decade to replace the act with a British Bill of Rights.
After facing opposition from the Liberal Democrats while in coalition, David Cameron's party are certain to make the plan a key plank of their agenda.
What will the Bill of Rights involve?
The Tory manifesto  said their proposals 'will restore common sense to the application of human rights in the UK'.
They insist the Bill will remain faithful to the basic principles in the original convention. But they say the Bill of Rights will 'reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights laws being used for more and more purposes and often with little regard for the rights of wider society'.
They want to ensure that the European Court of Human Rights is no longer binding over the Supreme Court, Britain's highest court, with Strasbourg acting as 'an advisory body only'.

Behold the failed politicians, party donors, charity-sector schmoozers and title-chasing, favour-cashing crooks. And the lawyers  ugh! Supreme Court judges swaggered in, hands in pockets.
They wore European-style gowns, Lady Hale topped by a squashed-Eccles cake judicial hat. Is this proud Albion or graduation day at Heidelberg University?
Queen's Speech confirms crackdown on benefit abuse
Prince Charles, pictured with the Duchess of Cornwall, was in military finery  and stared at the ceiling
Blairite fixer Lord Levy was there; ditto tax-shy Lord Fink, and divorce lawyer Lady Shackleton, farmer of misery, her blonde barnet showing roots, her vampish make-up completing the look of poor mans Patricia Hodge.
Expenses grabber Lady Uddin was in a Muslim scarf  I dont remember her piety so evident before. New peer Lord Kerslake  Bungling Bob Kerslake, a dud as head of the Civil Service  was present. And was that Labour Europhile Lord Tomlinson taking a snapshot with a camera beforehand? Ye gods.
Off to the peer show: David Cameron and Harriet Harman lead a procession of MPs into the Lords
Some Lib Dem clown took a selfie. We may have removed most of the yellow peril from the Commons but there are hordes of them in the Lords for life. Or until the Tories finally realise how they have been stiffed in the Upper House and accept the need to scrap (or elect) the place.
Prince Charles was in military finery (yet he so placid a sausage!) and stared at the ceiling when the Queen said the Chinese would soon make a state visit.
TV boffin Lord Winston was noticeable for the blackness of his moustache  dipped it in Quink as a scientific experiment, perhaps.
Attention shifted to the Commons, where the Speaker gave a homily about selflessness, courtesy, civility, fairness. Objectivity! The House suppressed its desire to bawl with laughter at this dreadful Speaker demanding such virtues.
We heard a proposal speech of sporty laddishness from Simon Burns (Con, Chelmsford), long-standing foe of Squeaker Bercow.
Mr Burns took digs at Bercow, who pretended to busy himself in his paperwork. Bercow ally Angela Eagle, on the Labour front bench, wore an expression of sheer vinegar.
Harriet Harman later skewered Mr Burns, saying that when they had both entered the House in the 1980s, Mr Burns had looked like a young Robert Redford  he was a real head-turner. These days he is a bit more Jeremy Clarkson.
Miss Harman told Mr Cameron to beware the blond on the zip wire, a reference to the alleged leadership yearnings of Boris Johnson (Con, Uxbridge), who has been going round the Commons playing Mr Umble Backbencher. Mr Cameron, returning fire, noted that Miss Harman was far posher than I am.
The Prime Minister also larded compliments over Alex Salmond (SNP, Gordon), perhaps rightly suspecting this would ignite clan rivalries. The SNPs Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, was to give a speech strikingly sparse in humour and grace. That did not stop his newbies applauding him. They were told this was against the rules.
Oh, and a backbencher from Sheffield spoke. First name of Nick. A Lib Dem. Apparently he was Someone Important, once.

	David Cameron, freed at last from the shackles of the Lib Dems, today gave notice of his intention that the first Tory government for 18 years will be a great reforming administration, starting from the word Go.

Overall, however, the Queens Speech shows a commendable determination to hit the ground running, cramming as many vital reforms as possible into the early months, while backbenchers enthusiasm and loyalty remain strong.
Indeed, there will be no more two-day weeks for MPs as they get to grips with a jam-packed programme of 26 Bills  many of them hugely ambitious and exciting.
Among the most welcome are the plans to crack down on union abuses of strike ballots, under which the likes of Len McCluskey will no longer be allowed to inflict misery without a proper mandate from their membership.
As for political funding, it is clearly right that union members should no longer be made to contribute to Labour without their specific permission (though is it unduly cynical to suggest the Tories funding could also do with reform?)
David Cameron: This is the queen's speech for working people

Elsewhere, this paper is delighted that voters are at last to be given their say in an EU referendum (though the wording of the question may trouble eurosceptics).
Small firms should rejoice over Sajid Javids (pictured) drive to crack down on late payments and slash red tape to the tune of 10billion
It is also encouraging that education and welfare reforms can forge ahead, now that the Lib Dem brakes are off.
On the economy, too, this paper has high hopes of the Bill to create a northern powerhouse, injecting life into once-great industrial cities  while small firms should rejoice over Sajid Javids drive to crack down on late payments and slash red tape to the tune of 10billion.
All in all, this could be a new dawn for Britain  and with a team well versed in dealing with an obstructive Civil Service, Mr Cameron has many advantages.
But with a Commons majority of just 12, and Opposition dominance of the Lords, nobody should underestimate the scale of the problems he will encounter.
This will be particularly true of radical measures such as the snoopers charter, the right to buy for housing association tenants, English votes for English laws and extending Scottish devolution.
Above all, success will depend on maintaining party discipline and reminding unelected peers of their duty to democracy.
Meanwhile, Mr Cameron should also use his powers of patronage to install conservative-minded figures in the BBC and influential quangos.
As voters showed so resoundingly on May 7, the country is behind him.
But in fighting the engrained Left-leaning Establishment, he still needs all the friends he can get.

AFTER eight years as the international Middle East peace envoy, Tony Blair leaves with his pockets stuffed with gold  and the region in flames. Enough said.

	Kim Shillinglaw, the controller of BBC2 and BBC4, is at the centre of a conflict-of-interest row after Frankenstein And The Vampyre was commissioned after she took up the job.

Bill Cash, a fellow Tory MP, called for an overhaul of the rules governing the relationships between BBC executives and suppliers, adding: There is a strong reason why personal relationships of that kind can create significant ethical problems.
I believe it should be considered in the review of the BBC Charter. There are a significant number of concerns about the cosy relationships in a body which receives 5.2billion a year.
Frankenstein And The Vampyre was commissioned last September and aired in November on BBC2, using drama and documentary footage to explain how Lord Byron and Mary Shelley met to tell ghost stories.
The Oxford Scientific Films programme was criticised for frustrating omissions, but it was still shown in the coveted 9pm slot.
Her husband Steve Condie was an executive producer on the show
Miss Shillinglaw has previously highlighted programmes Mr Condie has made for BBC2, and has even agreed to promote one of them today at the Hay Festival.
She publicly endorsed his show Let Us Entertain You at the launch of BBC2s summer line-up last month.
The four-part documentary, also made through Oxford Scientific Films, argues that Britains pop culture is rooted in the Industrial Revolution. Miss Shillinglaw  who is in charge of choosing the new line-up for Top Gear and recently described the BBC2 audience as punks  will publicise the documentary series at the Hay Festival.
She was quoted in the press release announcing the shows commission, but it made no mention of her relationship with Mr Condie.
A television source said the situation felt incestuous, adding: If there is nothing wrong with having your husband as exec producer of a four-hour show, why not say so proudly?
Industry insiders estimated Let Us Entertain You will have a budget of up to 700,000. Mr Condie does not have a share in Oxford Scientific Films but he would have been paid for his role as executive producer. He no longer works at the company.
EX BOSS'S 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST'
A FORMER BBC1 controller faced calls to resign in 2009 when it emerged she was working for her husbands firm  which made large sums of money from the Corporation.
Jay Hunt, now Channel 4s chief creative officer, was company secretary of BrightsparkTV, a media training firm owned by her spouse, Ian Blandford.
The business had a contract with the BBC to coach presenters, and even used the broadcasters studios. Company figures show that by the end of August 2008  three months after Miss Hunt returned to the BBC from Channel 5  the turnover of BrightsparkTV had almost doubled to 160,402 from 84,994 the year before. Its pre-tax profits rose from 68,674 to 117,000.
MPs called on Miss Hunt to either give up her unpaid post at BrightsparkTV, or quit her 280,000-a-year job at the BBC. But the Corporation refused to investigate, saying it had been aware of her other job.
Miss Hunt resigned from her BrightsparkTV position shortly after the scandal erupted, but insisted it had been a passive role and that there was no conflict of interest.
Any show that makes it to screen is commissioned by two people  a so-called genre commissioner and the head of the channel on which it airs.
The Corporation combined the roles of controller for BBC2 and BBC4 in 2013, meaning Miss Shillinglaw oversees everything commissioned on both. BBC4s editor reports to her.
A BBC spokesman said Miss Shillinglaw made the appropriate personal declarations but it did not publish these online for data protection reasons which he said affect all companies. He added: The BBC has well-established procedures to ensure potential conflicts are avoided  Kim did not commission either of these shows and it would be factually misleading to suggest otherwise.

	Large classes and poor attainment leave UK pupils lagging behind Poles

	Researchers said pupil achievement in the UK was behind that of children in Poland, and fewer pupils go on to university. It comes amid mounting concern that British children are falling behind.

In addition, a higher proportion of Polish pupils go on to study courses after the age of 18.
Britain was ranked 26th in the 2012 PISA tests for 15-year-olds run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  behind Poland which was 14th. The tests in maths, science and reading allow comparison of pupils in different countries around the world.
The report comes amid mounting concern that British children are falling behind those in other countries after years of slipping standards.
The study found that while Poland has an average class size of 20, the UK average is 26
The Coalition tried to reverse this trend in the last Parliament by making qualifications harder and taking a tough stance on under-performing schools.
But the reports results were even more stark when researchers compared recent progress in education in different countries. Britain was ranked 133, while Poland was at 28.
The report, produced by management consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group, said that while the UK was still ahead of many countries, Poland has made more headway in education in recent years.
It said: The Polish education system was reformed in 2009 with changes being implemented over several years.
Education is now compulsory from ages 6 to 18, with alternative education options available from age 16, including apprenticeships. There is also a statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school education.
A Department for Education spokesman defended the Governments record, saying its education reforms and focus on standards were helping more young people to achieve their potential.
The researchers also examined economic growth trends and how governments converted wealth into well-being  or quality of life  among their populations.
While the UKs performance was above the global average in measurements linked to well-being, its progress in converting growth into well-being had fallen back relative to the rest of the world.

	Andrew Slaughter, a Labour justice spokesman, said there were mounting suspicions that the American authorities wanted to keep father-of-four (pictured) behind bars to guarantee his silence.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

He was handed to the US military for money and tortured at a secret black site prison. US intelligence claimed he financed Al Qaeda and was a key aide of Osama Bin Laden, an accusation that he vehemently denied. He has been cleared for release, but US officials are determined that he should be sent to Saudi Arabia, even though there are serious concerns he will face torture there. His family still lives in South London.
Mr Slaughter said: Shaker is articulate, intelligent and fluent in English and has been one of the organisers of opposition to the Guantanamo regime, including hunger strikes. He has witnessed some of the worst abuses at the base.
Despite mounting calls for him to be released - including from high profile MPs like Jeremy Corybn, Andrew Slaughter and Caroline Lucus - he is still trapped in the prison, where he is kept without charge
One reason submitted to us for them not wanting him to come to Britain was not because he would be a security risk but because they feared he would speak out about his treatment in Guantanamo, which would be embarrassing.
Campaigners have branded the scandal of Mr Aamer continuing to languish in the naval base in Cuba as an affront to civilised values.
David Cameron was told in January by President Barack Obama that Mr Aamers case would be prioritised.
Mr Stafford Smith, director of human rights charity Reprieve, told the BBC that Mr Aamer could be released within weeks.
He said: I have heard from various sources, which are very reliable I hope, that he is to be released in June. But of course weve had promises before and the worst thing one can do is, both for Shaker and for his wife and children, to promise something that may not happen. But theres no good reason why it wouldnt happen.

Andrew Slaughter: Shaker was cleared for release by Bush in 2007 and Obama in 2009 - so why was he still in detention?
The Labour justice spokesman, who travelled to the States last year to argue on Aamer's behalf, questions why the father-of-four has not been released despite repeated promises
Imagine that a US citizen had been imprisoned, mainly in solitary confinement, without charge or trial for 13 years by the UK Government, and avoided due process by being kept out of the jurisdiction at a remote military encampment.
You would have to imagine because in real life this could not happen. The US would have found this treatment of its citizen by a close ally intolerable and ratcheted up the pressure until they were returned home.
But this is exactly the situation in which Shaker Aamer finds himself. He was rendered to Guantanamo Bay on 14 February 2002, having been sold to US forces in Afghan soldiers interested in the bounty offered for foreigners in Afghanistan post-9/11 but not in what he was doing there.
Shaker maintains he moved his family there to work for a charity promoting girls education. His wife and four children  the youngest of whom was born after his abduction - are all British citizens and he is a permanent resident.
Andrew Slaughter, second left, travelled to America last year to try and get Aamer released
It has taken time for Shakers case to achieve cause celebre status even in the UK. Even now his case is often overlooked in the US, despite forceful lobbying from all quarters and opinions here, not least from the Prime Minister who asked for his transfer to the UK to be a priority when he met President Obama in January.
So the formidable Save Shaker campaign resolved immediately following the election to send its own delegation to Washington to meet the main opinion formers there, and raised the cash to do so be combination of crowdfunding and collections in Trafalgar Square in front of a mock-up of a Guantanamo cell.
That is how I found myself in Washington last week meeting John McCain, State and Defense Department officials and leading Democratic Senators who have the Presidents ear.
To show how broad the political opinion in support of Shakers release has grown my travelling companions were MPs David Davis, Jeremy Corbyn and Andrew Mitchell. All are members of the Shaker Aamer All-Party Group, ably chaired by John McDonnell MP, but have precious little else in common.
Aamer has been cleared for release by both Presidents Bush, in 2007, and Obama, in 2009
What did we think we could achieve that the PM, in raising the issue directly with the President, could not? And to answer the cynics question: we were all persuaded in meetings with foreign office officials here and our ambassador there that the UK Government is sincere and forceful in pressing the case for transfer.
Firstly, we wanted to find out in longer discussions what lay behind the refusal to release Shaker to the UK when countries such as Uruguay and Kazakhstan have in the last year been paid to take Guantanamo inmates who had no connection with those countries.
Given that Shaker was cleared for release by George Bush in 2007 and Obama in 2009, why was he still in detention? Shaker is articulate, intelligent and fluent in English and has been one of the organisers of opposition to the Guantanamo regime, including hunger strikes. He is also one of the longest-serving prisoners and has witnessed some of the worst abuses at the base.
He was cleared for transfer to Saudi Arabia. Why then not to the UK? Perhaps the US authorities think life will be too soft here and opportunities for talking about his experience greater. But if they genuinely suspect he is a risk and needs either de-radicalising or to be monitored or controlled, the UK has a much better track record than Saudi or many other countries. None of the 15 Guantanamo inmates so far returned here has been involved in seditious acts.
Seeking answers to our questions, we found them reflected back at us. None of the eminent and well-connected Democrat Senators  Feinstein, Leahy, Durbin and Manchin  could offer any explanation. However, this made them all enthusiastic to raise Shakers case with Obama and his Defense Secretary, in whose gift the transfer currently lies.
The second reason for our visit was to lobby directly John McCain. No friend of Obama and a hardliner on the so-called war on terror, he was nevertheless entirely sympathetic and I think persuaded. Whether this stems from his affection for the US-UK alliance or his own experience of torture and imprisonment by the Viet Cong, McCain promised to take up Shakers case. The importance of which is that it gives Obama cover against an increasingly dominant and shrill Republican Congress.
'For those brought up on a diet of US legal drama in which due process and constitutional rights were the dominant features of the justice system, what is happening at Guantanamo Bay seems beyond belief,' writes Slaughter
Thirdly, since Camerons visit in January, the House of Commons has debated Shakers detention and unanimously resolved that he should be immediately released and returned to his family in the UK. We have sent copies of the debate and motion to the Senators and the administration pointing out what a rare event this is. Now it is both the British Government and Parliament that is demanding his return.
Finally, the timing of or visit was designed to forestall the likely decision of Congress to take the decision on transfers out of the Presidents hands and make it subject to such restrictions that it is likely that not one of the remaining 122 inmates will be eligible for release for the foreseeable future. We hope that Shakers transfer will be approved this summer, failing which his prospects look bleaker than ever.
For those brought up on a diet of US legal drama in which due process and constitutional rights were the dominant features of the justice system, what is happening at Guantanamo Bay seems beyond belief.
We are right to fight as hard for Shakers return as the US would to enforce their citizens rights in another jurisdiction. But we should also learn the lesson that even the most mature and open societies are only as good as their laws and lawmakers. Something to bear in mind this week as the Commons debates the new Conservative Governments plans to repeal the Human Rights Act.

	The pay gap means that most women will be pensioners before they become 'income millionaires,' while most men will reach the target at least 15 years before they reach State pension age.

The study, by financial firm Prudential, found that the average worker will earn their first million when they are 56 and six months old  but will lose 212,000 of this to tax and national insurance.
Workers in the financial sector fare the best, reaching the 1million mark at a youthful 41, but those working in the hotel and food industry will not reach this point until they are 94.
Most men will comfortably hit this target at least 15 years before they reach the State pension age
Stan Russell, from Prudential, said: The welcome news of an increase in incomes for women is tempered by the fact that many of them still wont get to reach their million pound pay day before they retire.
WHY THEY SHUN TOP JOBS
The sacrifices needed to become a boss mean women soon give up the idea of making it to the top, a study has found.
After just two years in the workplace, female staff are turned off by the endless networking, being on call 24 hours a day and having to work excessively long hours.
The US study of 1,000 men and women by Bain Capital found that among new employees, 43 per cent of women and 34 per cent of men said they wanted to reach top management. However, two years on, those figures had slumped to 16 per cent for women, while men had stayed the same. Their expectations had been dashed by the demands of work, including having to socialise.
Among the women surveyed, one said that being on call 24/7 was not appealing at all while another said she did not want to trade my personal life.
The study said: If corporate recognition and rewards focus on those behaviours, women feel less able, let alone motivated to try, to make it to the top.
The figures, which were calculated using Office for National Statistics data on average UK wages, found that a man who started work at 18 and earned the average income for their age would have earned 1.5million by his 65th birthday, while a woman would have earned just 910,000.
Sarah Pennells, from money website SavvyWoman.co.uk, said women would be horrified to find out that they have to work for almost 20 years longer than men to reach their first million.
She said: We know that, despite the Equal Pay Act 50 years ago, the gender pay gap still exists. On top of that, many women find it harder to get senior roles if theyve taken time out to look after their children, plus many women in their 50s work part time, either because they cant get a full time job or because they have caring responsibilities.
These are some of the reasons why women will be pensioners before theyre millionaires.
Adam Memon, of the Centre for Policy Studies, added: These figures show that despite a fall in the gender pay gap in recent years, it remains large.
The pay gap increases significantly for women in their mid-30s, which suggests that there is also a motherhood penalty faced by some women.

Getting your laundry thoroughly clean will always be a nightmare
Summer's coming and we'll soon have grass and mud stains to deal with
Here, FEMAIL takes a look at some easy alternatives to stain removers

Not only is my white washing pile generally rather more grey than pristine, but summer means I also have grass stains and mud to contend with  thanks to two sons and a husband who play cricket.
Ive tried most stain removers on the market, but often find them wanting.
So, is there a miracle way of getting my murky laundry sparkling white again? According to various internet theories, the answer is a resounding Yes!
Scroll down for video
Getting your laundry thoroughly clean will always be a nightmare and with summer coming we'll soon have grass and mud stains to deal with too
I enlisted the help of laundry expert Stephen Anderton to test a range of tips, using items from my family wash basket as well as a control sock  a new white one soaked in a puddle and smeared with ketchup and butter  to create the same conditions for each test.
Heres how I got on . . .
DULL AS DISHWATER? TRY DISHWASHER TABLETS
The Tip: According to internet sources, good old dishwasher powder works on laundry, as it contains ingredients that break down food particles and stains.
Expert verdict: This will work, says Stephen. Dishwasher powder contains oxidising agents, which remove the colour of the stain, though if you look at the item under ultraviolet light, youll still see it.
The Test: Any white socks that manage to survive our sock-obsessed cocker spaniel end up filthy within a week of purchase. Partly because Im rubbish at washing, partly because my six-year-old daughter likes going outdoors without shoes.
I take one of her little brown-soled socks and pop it into the washing machine with an M&amp;S own-brand dishwasher tablet. After 40 minutes, it emerges significantly whiter  and the control sock is almost perfectly clean, too, though faint traces of mud remain on the sole. 7/10

DASH OF VINEGAR FOR STAINS AND SMELLS
It is said that the mild acid in vinegar can act as a freshner and whitener for dingy or greying clothes
The Tip: Its said the mild acid in vinegar acts as a whitener for dingy clothes. Apparently, it helps to dissolve detergent and fabric softener that may not have been rinsed away during the wash cycle, which can leave clothes looking dull.
Expert verdict: Vinegar is a fantastic cleaning agent and has all manner of domestic uses. Its acidic, so it neutralises alkaline food stains, and is antibacterial and anti-limescale.
I recommend running the washing machine empty on the hottest wash once a month with some vinegar to keep it clean. I cant see any harm in putting it in the wash, either.
The Test: I put an ancient, musty-smelling sheet into the washer and slosh in half-a-cup of white wine vinegar (not brown, which I fear may stain further) and washing powder.
The sheet comes out much cleaner. Even better, it has lost its mouldy smell. The control sock is fabulously clean, too. Well worth a try. 8/10
LEMON-FRESH LAUNDRY
The theory is that neat lemon juice bleaches whites without the need for harsh chemicals
The Tip: The theory is that neat lemon juice bleaches whites without the need for harsh chemicals. Mix 125 ml of lemon juice with eight litres of very hot water. Soak clothing in it for at least an hour. Pour the lemon mixture into the washing machine and wash clothes as usual.
Expert verdict: While this is a mild bleaching agent, the emphasis is on mild. Bleaching removes oxygen and therefore strips colour  we all know lemon juice on hair in the sun makes it a bit blonder. But I suspect it wont make a difference to clothes.
The Test: I take a dirty white sock  this nasty-looking item has been worn for a childs party in a forest and is as brown as the mud  and soak it in the solution overnight.
I then tip the whole lot into the washer and wash at 40 degrees. The results are disappointing  its cleaner, but not the sparkling- white I hoped for, and its very labour-intensive.
The control sock is cleaner, though the stains were less ingrained. 5/10
BRILLIANT BICARB
Soaking dishcloths in a solution of bicarbonate of soda and water will, apparently, lift stubborn stains
The Tip: Soaking flannels and dishcloths in a solution of bicarbonate of soda and water will, apparently, lift even the most ingrained of stains.
Expert Verdict: Bicarbonate of soda is mildly alkaline, which is why its thought to work on washing. Most detergents contain some alkaline ingredients. In the presence of oil, these go through a process known as saponification  it turns greasy stains into soap, which then washes off. However, I think youre better off using one of the standard specialist detergents on sale.
The Test: I soak an ancient, greying tea towel in a bowl of water and bicarb. The water fizzes up most satisfyingly and turns a loathsome shade of grey within seconds. I leave it for an hour, then put the tea towel in the washing machine at 40 degrees with my usual powder.
But Im afraid the tea towel comes out just marginally less grey, while the control sock is unimpressive, too, with some stains left behind. 4/10
GOODBYE TO GRASS STAINS
Rubbing methylated spirits on grass stains can remove them. But be warned, it's highly flamable
The Tip: Rubbing methylated spirits on grass stains can remove them. Dab the item with a cloth dampened with slightly diluted methylated spirits, then rinse, wash with soap and rinse again.
Expert verdict: This will probably work, but you might burn down your house in the process! Meths is a solvent. It interacts with the chlorophyll in the grass and removes the stain by making it water-soluble, meaning it washes away.
Its also very useful for removing oil and grease stains.
This is like dry-cleaning clothes at home. Just remember meths is highly flammable. Should you not wash it out properly and then put it in the tumble dryer, the item of clothing will combust in the heat.
You must ensure you wash it out properly afterwards  if it still smells of meths, wash it again.
The Test: I borrow my husbands stained cricket whites, assuring him they will be so bright when Im done that his team will win by blinding the opposition with the sheer glare.
I rub some meths into the knees of the trousers with a cloth, then rinse, wash with a little ordinary soap (as recommended) and rinse again.
The stains arent entirely removed, but are much faded. The control sock is nearly as bright white as new.
I heed Stephens warnings and put the trousers in the washing machine before drying on the line. 6/10
ASPIRIN FOR YOUR LAUNDRY HEADACHE
Soaking clothes in a solution of water and dissolved aspirin is said to help brighten your whites
The Tip: Dissolve five aspirin tablets in eight litres of hot water. Soak the laundry for around eight hours, making sure that all the material stays submerged.
Expert verdict: If you had put in 105 aspirin tablets, you might get a result. Aspirin does contain salicylic acid, but in such negligible amounts that nothing is likely to happen.
The Test: I throw a grubby sock into a washing-up bowl as well as one of my specially stained control socks and watch the aspirin fizzing away, then later rinse it off.
The result? Both socks are cleaner, but not much  and presumably the soaking alone had some effect.
This is too time-consuming for the result and I wouldnt risk it on, say, silk or cashmere  the only situations in which I can imagine being bothered enough to devote eight hours and precious painkillers to cleaning clothes anyway! 4/10
KITCHEN SPRAY THAT MAKES WHITES SHINE
Spraying laundry with Mr Muscle came up with astonishing results as it got rid of grass stains
The Tip: Spraying laundry with Mr Muscle Kitchen Cleaner, leaving for ten to 15 minutes and then washing at 50 degrees.
Expert verdict: This is designed to get tough grease and cooking stains out of an oven, so a grass stain is pretty straightforward for such a powerful product. It will wrap around particles of grass and soil to take them away from the material.
Be aware that its so strong it will eventually damage materials such as polyester, nylon and cotton.
The Test: I take an old pair of cricket trousers outside and rub them on the lawn, then spray some lemon-scented Mr Muscle on the new grass stains and the control sock.
I leave them for 15 minutes, then wash on a normal cycle at 40 degrees with standard washing powder.
The result is astonishing. Not only have the grass stains disappeared, but the trousers look much whiter overall and the control sock almost blinds me with its gleam.
Impressive  though Im not sure Id risk it on delicate fabrics. 9/10
GREASE MARK? CHALK IT UP AS A SUCCESS
The Tip: Rubbing white chalk on a stain then washing as normal can, apparently, lift and remove grease.
Expert verdict: The chalk acts like a blotter, absorbing oil away from the material  so this could work on a number of stains.
But dont wash whites with a colour detergent. You need a specific whites product, which deposits brightening agents onto the material. This gradually builds up and makes whites even brighter.
The Test: Grease stains are common in my house. Rather than napkins, its so much easier to wipe little hands on your clothing, isnt it?
I rub chalk onto the ketchup and butter stains I created on one of my control socks, leave for half-an-hour, then rinse and put it into the washing machine with my usual detergent on a 40-degree wash.
Afterwards, there are still some muddy stains on the sole, but where I applied the chalk to the butter stain, its bright white again. 7/10

	Business Secretary Sajid Javid is to lead the biggest changes to rules industrial action since the 1980s, designed to end disruptive strikes being called on low turnouts.

We fear that the reality of this Queens Speech will be very different from the rhetoric, she added. The Queens Speech talks of one nation, yet he sets the nations of the country against each other.
The Queens Speech talks of working people, yet he threatens basic rights at work.
Senior Tories believe their unexpected victory has given Mr Cameron a 12-month honeymoon in which he can push through a radical agenda while Labour is in disarray and his rebel MPs still feel bound by loyalty.
FACT BOX TITLE
Ministers announced a new charge on businesses that import foreign workers.
The money raised from the visa levy on firms recruiting non-EU workers will fund apprenticeship schemes.
The Immigration Bill will make it illegal for employment agencies to recruit only from overseas without first advertising the jobs in Britain  and in English. The new offence of illegal working announced by David Cameron last week will also be included in the bill.
Migrants found to be working illegally could have their pay confiscated and be removed without the right of appeal.
Their wages will be designated as proceeds of crime  allowing the authorities to go after them.
The Home Office hopes to make it harder for migrants to live and work illegally in Britain and encourage them to return  or face fast track removal from the country. Official figures showed net migration to the UK soared in 2014 to more than 300,000.
As part of a raft of new immigration powers, foreign criminals will be forced to wear electronic tags to prevent them going missing while on bail pending deportation. The GPS tags will allow round-the-clock monitoring.
The Prime Minister wasted no time yesterday in taking the fight to Labour and their union paymasters. A trades union bill will introduce minimum thresholds on strike calls. Unions will have to achieve at least a 50 per cent turnout for a ballot to be legal.
In key public services, such as health, education, the fire brigade and transport, any industrial action must also be backed by at least 40 per cent of those entitled to vote. In a surprise move, the bill targets the unions political funds, which they use to bankroll Labour. Members automatically pay a political levy of a few pounds a year, unless they opt out. Under the new law, they will have to opt in to the extra payment  potentially slashing the number who sign up.
When a similar move was introduced in 1927, the number of levy payers collapsed from 3.5 million to two million. During the last parliament the unions gave Labour more than 50million  almost half of the partys total income of 110million.
Labour accused the Tories of trying to rig the system for their own ends. Unions reacted furiously, with one source saying: This is vengeance. They want us put out of business.
The Unite union, which is Labours biggest donor, said: The Tories are taking Britain back to the 1920s with this shamelessly partisan attack. GMB boss Paul Kenny said: This is just the same old Tories who are anti-trade union, anti-working people having a voice and anti-democratic.
Its one rule for the Tory slush fund hedge funds and another for trade union members. But a Tory source said: There should be a conscious decision of opting in.
Former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said it was dispiriting to see Mr Cameron divert sharply from the more liberal stance he took in the coalition. The Lib Dems last night threatened to use their strength in the Lords, where they have 100 peers, to frustrate the Tory programme  even in areas where manifesto pledges are at stake.

The partys leader in the upper house, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, said: We may wish to reflect on the strength of the mandate of a government, which secured less than 37 per cent of the popular vote on a turnout of 66 per cent, should it seek to drive through ill-thought through and reactionary legislation without robust scrutiny.
But Labour said it had a great responsibility not to wreck the Tory manifesto in the Lords. And the party committed another post-election U-turn yesterday by accepting plans to slash the benefit cap.
Harriet Harman said her party would accept the Conservative pledge to cut the maximum amount a non-working family can take home in welfare from 26,000 to 23,000.
It comes just days after Labour said it would not vote against plans to hold a referendum on EU membership.
FURY AT FAILURE TO PROTECT DEFENCE SPENDING
The Government was last night accused of being disingenuous after it claimed Britain would remain at the forefront of efforts to defeat Islamic State  but failed to protect funding for the ArmedForces.
Instead, the Queens Speech hailed the Governments decision to ring-fence the foreign aid budget at 0.7 per cent of national wealth as an example of the enormous progress made to ensure Britain was safe.
Announcing a Strategic Defence Review, which will define the future shape, size and role of the military, the speech said the UK would do whatever necessary to ensure troops could protect UK shores.
However, the Government has come under fire for failing to ring-fence the defence budget, as well as not committing to spend at least 2 per cent of national income on defence  the Nato target. As a result, former military chiefs were critical, saying it was disingenuous to suggest that Britain could be playing a major role in tackling world conflicts.
Admiral Lord West, a former First Sea Lord and Security minister, said: We have cut our defence so much that we cant be at the forefront.

	Susan Roche, 48, yelled 'you greedy b*****d' as she beat Angela Marcantonio, 64, at the family mansion in County Durham, it is claimed, in a row over dying Robert Howey's estate.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
Miss Marcantonio had feared she would be left with nothing in the will, but Mr Howey had signed a second legal document promising her 163,000 from the sale of his 950,000 mansion  which the family were already preparing to sell.
Miss Marcantonio said the 163,000 was money she had lent Mr Howey to fund the development of flats and she wanted to ensure it would be repaid.
Brutal: Miss Marcantonio claims she 'couldn't believe the state of her face' after the alleged attack
However, the agreement was said to have infuriated Roche  who ran a hair and beauty business with her father.
It is alleged she set upon Miss Marcantonio while she was looking through some of her clothes which had been inexplicably moved from a wardrobe in the seven-bedroomed home to the garage.
Roche, however, denies the assault and claims she was acting in self-defence after Miss Marcantonio went berserk at her clothes being moved.
Recalling the alleged attack, Miss Marcantonio told the court: I was in the garage and had my back to her [Roche] as I pulled out boxes that had been put in there containing some of my good shirts.
'She got hold of me from behind with her arm around me and punched me twice in the face with her clenched fist.
I was absolutely stunned, I had never witnessed violence of that kind on myself, it was surreal.
She started to pull my hair, I tried to walk away from her but she kicked my feet from under me from behind and I fell to the ground.
As I lay on the ground she started kicking me all over. I moved around trying to protect myself but she kept kicking me and was yelling, you greedy b*****d.
Miss Marcantonio said the attack  in June 2013  continued until Mr Howeys granddaughter Sarah and her partner Andy ran into the garage and intervened.
The alleged victim said that an enraged Roche threatened her other family members as she was pulled away.
I looked in the mirror and couldnt believe the state of my face, I was in a terrible state, she said.
When she spoke to Mr Howey she showed him her injuries and said: Look what your daughter has done to me.
But during cross-examination Caroline Goodwin, defending, suggested it was Miss Marcantonio who was the aggressor.
Pensive: Miss Marcantonio outside Durham Crown Court, where she recounted harrowing details of the alleged assault
She said the alleged victim had yelled profanities at Mr Howeys family after discovering her clothing had been moved and that a scuffle developed.
Giving evidence behind a curtain, Miss Marcantonio denied the accusation, saying: I dont use language of that kind.
The red brick mansion in Old Waldridge, Co. Durham, was eventually put on the market for 950,000 but Land Registry records suggest it has yet to be sold. Mr Downey, who built the home himself in 2001, died in December 2014, aged 72.
Roche, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, denies inflicting grievous bodily harm. The trial continues.

Teaching assistant Louise Aspinall, who is accused of having sex with a 13-year-old boy she confided in about her relationship problems
A teaching assistant had sex with a boy of 13 after she confided in him about relationship problems with her husband, a court was told.
Louise Aspinall, 35, a mother-of-two, is said to have first kissed the boy when they wrestled over a mobile phone after being left alone together.
The teenager decided to keep quiet about the kiss, but the following week she took his virginity in her own marital bed, it was claimed.
Afterwards the boy relaxed by playing on an Xbox and she also performed sex acts on him on Valentines Day, the court heard.
Following their first alleged tryst, the boy claims Aspinall said: Obviously dont tell anyone. I can get in trouble for it.
Manchester Crown Court heard the pair met up on three separate occasions for sex.
Rumours began to circulate round the high school where Aspinall taught.
Eventually the boys mother heard the rumours and marched him to a police station where he initially denied the allegations.
But the following day he said the rumours were true and he was interviewed by police officers before Aspinall, of Swinton, Manchester, was arrested in December 2013.
Aspinall, a teaching assistant at 750-pupil Swinton High School, appeared in court charged with seven counts of sexual activity with a child under the age of 16.
The offences, which she has denied, are said to have taken place between February and March 2013.
During a video recording of the boys first interview with police, played to the jury, he said the first incident took place when the pair were left alone in a house together and started messing around.
He said: We kissed. I dont remember when but she took my phone off me and started going through my contacts and she was going to put her number in my phone.

Speaking afterwards, Mr Carswell said: 'I had just been in the tube station, and I was heading over to the bus stop. Out of nowhere a mob, over 100 strong, and it got incredibly nasty.
'I mean this was a lynch mob on the streets of London. It was an incredibly violent nasty mob and I was shocked.'
He added: 'It wasn't just the words that were aggressive, they had pretty murderous intent. It was extraordinary.'
Police protect Douglas Carswell from angry London protesters
Mr Carswell later tweeted: 'Am fine. Bit shaken. As an MP I will always use public transport and I do not want to live in a society when politicos don't'

Demonstrations: Mr Carswell, left, stands next to anti-austerity protesters in Westminster earlier today

It came as police chased protesters through the streets around Parliament and Whitehall. Meanwhile, one group staged a sit-in protest near Trafalgar Square, bringing traffic to a standstill.
Police confirmed that at least three people were arrested during the unrest in Westminster today.
One protester, who did not want to be named, described how Douglas Carswell, Ukip's only MP, was surrounded by demonstrators and doused in water before being bundled to safety by police.
He said: 'Douglas Carswell was in St James' Tube, someone spotted him and everyone rushed over.
'Everyone was chanting and he was stuck. The police had to push through the crowd and he got a bottle of water thrown over him. Then police put him in a van and he was driven away.'
Andy Dent, 39, who runs a joinery business and lives in Surrey, said: 'The Tories give tax cuts for the rich, they want to bring back fox hunting - they are trying to turn this country back into Victorian England.
'There are people out there who can't stand up for themselves, but that's what Britain is supposed to be about - helping the underdog and doing the right thing.
'We are going to see more protests when we see what the Tories do when they don't have the Lib Dems holding them back.'
'Shaken': Taking to Twitter later, the MP said that he was 'fine' and would 'always use public transport'

Speaking afterwards, Mr Carswell said: 'I mean this was a lynch mob on the streets of London'
Among those held by police was a man wanted in connection with an earlier anti-austerity demo outside Downing Street the day after the General Election results were confirmed.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 45-year-old man, wanted on suspicion of violent disorder in Whitehall on May 9th, was arrested.
'A 17-year-old youth was arrested on suspicion of assault on police during today's demonstration.
'A man was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and possession of an offensive weapon during today's demonstration.
'All were taken to a central London police station where they remain in custody.'

	The programme, which has the working title Britain's Hardest Grafter, will see 25 people compete in a series of challenges with the aim of being crowned the hardest worker.

Would-be contestants must be aged over 18, and have an annual income of less than 15,500 to apply.
According to a BBC pitch for the show, those taking part will carry out a series of 'real-world jobs', sometimes within 'the confines of a specially created factory, a warehouse space which over the course of five episodes will be transformed to cover the UK's largest blue collar sectors'.
The concept of the series has been likened to The Hunger Games, a post-apocalyptic film and book series starring Jennifer Lawrence (pictured), which tells the story of young people forced to battle with one another to the death for entertainment
It continues: 'The contestants are all there for one reason: to make money. The least effective workers will be asked to leave until only one is left, to be declared Britains Hardest Worker.'
The pitch says the series will tackle 'some of the most pressing issues of our time', including low productivity in Britain, the benefits system, and whether immigrants 'work harder than Brits', or are prepared to accept a lower wage.
It signs off: 'Who in Britain still knows how to graft? Its time to find out.'
Careers advice website Graduate Fog , which was sent the casting call by Twenty Twenty in order to publicise it to site users, has expressed concern that young people desperate for work or money could be at risk of exploitation, and said that the project 'feels distinctly Hunger Games'.
The post-apocalyptic film and book series starring Jennifer Lawrence tells the story of young people forced to battle with one another to the death for entertainment.
Production company Twenty Twenty also makes The Choir, featuring Gareth Malone (pictured with the cast of the Military Wives series) for the BBC
Twenty Twenty also makes popular Channel 4 dating show, First Dates (pictured)
'It's a reference to young people being pitted against each other for entertainment value,' founder Tanya de Grunwald told MailOnline.
'It's a dark idea. I'm questioning the tone of the advert and if that is reflective of the show.'
After receiving the request to run the advert from Twenty Twenty, which also makes popular shows including First Dates, The Choir and Extreme School, Ms de Grunwald asked producers whether participants are paid during the series, and if there will be any financial reward for taking part.
She was told: 'All contributors will receive compensation for their time as part of filming for the show (it will be filmed across two weeks)  were still working out the specifics but obviously it will not be below the national minimum wage. Sorry I cant be more specific at this stage.'
Ms de Grunwald said she hoped that the programme would be more sensitive and thought-provoking than the pitch suggests, but added that she was 'alarmed' when she was sent the advert for the casting call.
Programme makers told her the flyer she was sent was specifically aimed at young people, but they wanted people of all age and background to take part. 
'I always question these sorts of shows,' she said. 'We have seen things like this but not from the BBC, and certainly not from BBC2.

News that the programme was being made was met with distaste from some Twitter users
'It's not really clear what the format will be. It's important to remember to be really careful and sensitive when dealing with unemployed young people, who may be more vulnerable.
'I would question whether some subjects should be off limits for entertainment purposes.
'There is something about them being eliminated in each round which breaks my heart. These are young people who are struggling and to be told you are being kicked off a show might just be more rejection that they don't need.
'What's the after care? What happens when they get kicked off, especially if they have been humiliated in the public arena? Where do they go from there?
'It might be more fun to watch than to take part in. And there is the idea of luring them in with a cash prize - 15,000 is a lot of money, especially for someone who hasn't got much.'
News that the programme was being made met with distaste from some Twitter users, with one labelling it 'Austerity UK'.
Anne Godden tweeted: 'As disgusting as it gets. BBC makes a game out of young unemployed. Shameful.'
User @Murfalizer added: 'Its all about how hard you are willing to #work these days'
However, others suggested it could be a good idea and would show that many people are willing to work hard.
Twitter user Lazarus Nunya wrote: 'Those who have little or no job experience get to prove they DO want to work,and can work, and that they're not the "scroungers" the Tories paint them all as! That they are SO *desperate* for work they are prepared to potentially embarrass themselves on a TV show in order to GET work!
'Could have both positive and negative effects for the "stars" and the wider working poor dependant on how we're shown.'
A spokesman for the BBC and Twenty Twenty said: 'Britain's Hardest Grafter is a serious social experiment for BBC Two which investigates just how hard people in the low wage economy work.
'Each week the contributors - who are all in work or actively looking - will experience a different "blue collar" role as the series explores the truth about Britain's work ethic.
'Throughout the series, the contributors are rewarded for the work they do.'

	David Cameron this afternoon warned the SNP they could no longer whinge about decisions in Westminster as he unveiled a package of new powers for the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

        <MainBody>Cameron pokes fun at Alex Salmond while welcoming him back
Former Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond was pictured walking into the 'members' lobby' on his way into the House of Commons

'THE WHITE ROSE OF SCOTLAND'
The Scottish National Party's 56 MPs attended the state opening of Parliament wearing a distinctive white rose.
SNP MPs and its members of the Scottish Parliament have made a tradition of wearing the floral button hole at all Westminster and Holyrood parliament openings.
The flower was made famous by Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid in 'The Little White Rose of Scotland'.
The poem reads:
'The rose of all the world is not for me
'I want for my part
'Only the little white rose of Scotland
'That smells sharp and sweet - and breaks the heart.'
Under the Scotland Bill, Holyrood will be responsible for raising about 40 per cent of Scotland's taxes, according to the UK Government, with powers to set the thresholds and rates of income tax included in the Bill, with all the money this brings in staying north of the border.
The legislation also gives Holyrood some money from VAT revenues and devolves responsibility for air passenger duty and the Aggregates Levy to the Scottish Parliament.
MSPs will also get around 2.5 billion worth of new powers over welfare, the UK Government said, with the legislation allowing ministers north of the border to vary the frequency of the new Universal Credit, and also giving them the power to determine the rules for a range of benefits for carers, disabled people and the elderly.
The Barnett formula, which is currently used to determine public spending in the different parts of the UK will be retained, but the amount Scotland gets in the block grant will be reduced to account for Holyrood being given new tax-raising powers.
Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said: 'The tabling of the Scotland Bill is a significant moment. We will work to ensure the 'vow' made during the referendum is delivered in full, and that means keeping the Barnett Formula alongside more powers to make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world.
'The test now for the Tories is if they can deliver the devolution Scotland wants without leaving Scotland worse off.'
Mr Murray, who is now the only Labour MP north of the border, said:
'Scottish Labour are clear - the Scottish Parliament should have final say over welfare, the powers to defend the vulnerable against Tory austerity whilst retaining the Barnett Formula.
'The SNP ran a general election campaign on the basis of full fiscal autonomy and abolishing the Barnett Formula. If they intend to amend the Scotland Bill to reflect that it is now incumbent on them to produce credible costings for their plans.'
SNP leader at Westminster Angus Robertson said: 'When it comes to more powers for Scotland, the ball is in David Cameron's court. Anything less than implementation of the Smith Commission in full would be a breach of faith.
'But the Tories must also respond to the election result and react positively to proposals for atransfer of powers beyond Smith, a position which won overwhelming support in the election.'
FURIOUS BERCOW SLAPS DOWN SNP MPS FOR CLAPPING IN COMMONS
Commons Speaker John Bercow demanded the SNP's 56 MPs stop clapping
Scottish National Party MPs were today warned to stop clapping in the House of Commons by an exasperated Speaker John Bercow.
The MPs clapped on at least three separate occasions during SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson's response to the Queen's Speech before Mr Bercow stepped in.
Traditionally, MPs are only allowed to speak in the Commons when they have made their maiden speeches, meaning most of the SNP cannot currently make their voices heard.
After SNP MPs applauded Mr Robertson's criticism of Labour's supposed support of austerity, Mr Bercow intervened: 'Can I say at the start of the Parliament that the convention that we don't clap in this chamber is very, very, very long-established and widely respected?
'And it would be appreciated if members would show some respect for that convention.
'They will get their speaking rights from this chair, of that they can be assured.
'They will be respected but I would invite them to show some respect for the traditions of this chamber of the House of Commons.'
MPs on all sides cheered in support of Mr Bercow's intervention.

While tigers are hardly known for their patience, this young mother has proven it's possible after she displayed remarkable restraint to put up with the incessant provocations of her newborn pup.
The enthusiastic white Bengal pup was pictured running amok as he clawed and jumped all over his forlorn mother as she tried to doze in the sun.

Mr Reeve, who underwent counselling sessions, was reported missing on February 22 by his mother Norma after he failed to come home.
Two days later he was found hanging in the woods and was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.
His brother, Andrew, told the inquest: 'The attack completely changed him.
Traumatised: Mr Reeve (pictured) was found hanged in woods near Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire, five months after the attack on his daughter last September. Friends and relatives said the attack changed him
'He'd put blankets over the windows and he kept them there all the time. It was like blackout curtains.'
Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Grahame Short said: 'This was from all accounts a serious and horrific attack.
'I feel he could not live with his guilt - and that he did understand that he wasn't able to help his daughter - but also his own fears about the long-term effects that that was going to have.
'I think it was entirely wrong for him to have those thoughts, and that's why he needed help.'

Aldi's brand value soared 22 per cent, beating Tesco, as it is valued at 7.6million
Aldi has beaten the once-mighty Tesco as it is valued at 7.6million to become the eighth-biggest retail brand in the world.
The supermarket's brand value has soared 22 per cent compared with last year while Tesco plummeted 37 per cent to 6.1million, according to research published today.
Despite that Tesco is the only UK supermarket to hold a place in the worldwide retail ranking at number 12.
Aldi's rival Lidl rose in value by 27 per cent to reach 20th place worldwide with a value of 3.9 billion.
The BrandZ retail index of the top 100 retailers was compiled by brand specialists Millward Brown and WPP.
The report said Aldi and Lidl's focus on quality produce had paid off and boosted business significantly. It said: 'The major supermarkets no longer dominate the ranking.'
Alison Casey, retail director at Millward Brown, said: 'The discounters provide a great customer experience.
'They are relevant to cost-conscious shoppers with everyday low pricing and their smaller-sized store shopping format is more suited to today's "small and often" shopper.
'Importantly, they have also articulated and clearly communicated what they stand for.

	A Full Employment and Welfare Benefits Bill will be brought forward introducing a raft of new measures which aim to slash the annual benefits bill, pushing more people into work.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Today's Queen's Speech gave the first indication of how the government plans to save 12billion a year from the welfare budget  as set out in the Conservative manifesto.
In Her Majesty's 'most gracious speech to Parliament' this morning  the first fully Conservative Queen's Speech in almost 20 years  she confirmed the Government would 'continue to reform welfare' with a crackdown on benefit abuse.
A Full Employment and Welfare Benefits Bill will be brought forward introducing a raft of new measures which aim to slash the annual benefits bill, pushing more people into work.
Working-age welfare  including tax credits and child benefit  will be frozen for two years from 2016-17.New legislation will also be introduced to lower the benefit cap so the maximum a family can receive in a year will be 23,000 a year  down from 26,000.

A Full Employment and Welfare Benefits Bill will be brought forward introducing a raft of new measures which aim to slash the annual benefits bill, pushing more people into work
However, critics say the reduced cap is still too high. Receiving 23,000 a year in benefits is the equivalent of a 29,000 salary before tax. This remains more than the average wage in Britain, which stands at just 26,000.
Benefits for under-21s will also be curtailed, with a new 'earn or learn' principle  meaning youngsters will be forced to take a job or go to college after leaving school at 18.
Under 21s will be stopped from claiming housing support and if they have been out of work for six months forced to go on an apprenticeship or start training.
If they refuse they will have to do community work to receive their benefits.
Jon Sparkes, chief executive of charity Crisis, said: 'The Government's plan to cut housing benefit for 18-21 year-olds could spell disaster for thousands of young people who cannot live with their parents.
'At an age when other young people are leaving home to travel, work or study, growing numbers could be facing homelessness and the terrifying prospect of roughing it on the streets.'

	Clive Keegan, 59, met Valerie Bamford after he was spared jail despite admitting  causing the death of her husband, Martyn, 62, who was dragged under his lorry in Bristol in March last year.

'I pleaded guilty because I felt that I was responsible for some of it even though it was an accident.'
Keegan had driving back to his depot when he pulled up alongside another truck, blocking a narrow road in Bristol.
Oncoming cyclist Mr Bamford couldn't use the footpath which was covered with scaffolding so dismounted and attempted to squeeze between the vehicles.
He tried to backtrack but his jacket got caught on the lorry and Keegan pulled away without checking his nearside mirror.
Keegan (right) was given a community order with 200 hours of unpaid work after he pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving but was not banned from the road
The cyclist was dragged ten feet before falling under the lorry's rear wheel and was killed instantly, after suffering a head injury.
Mrs Bamford said: 'Martyn worked for Network Rail for 40 years. 600 people from his company came to his funeral, so you can see he was a well-liked man.
'He liked golf, rugby and going out for meals
'On that day he was just trying to get home. Mr Keegan took me by the hand. I said to him I am still very bitter.'
I'm glad I spoke to his wife. She said she is bitter and it is understandable
Clive Keegan
Keegan was given a community order with 200 hours of unpaid work after he pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving but was not banned from the road.
The court heard Keegan pulled up next to another lorry, blocking the narrow lane in Bristol, where scaffolding was being removed from a building, in March last year.
James Ward OBE, prosecuting, said Mr Bamford cycled on to the road and when he found he couldn't continue on the footpath, he dismounted.
He attempted to walk his bike between the lorries, but while the gap he entered was 81cm, he found he couldn't exit a 36cm gap at the other end.
Mr Ward said he backtracked but caught his jacket on Keegan's lorry, and the driver drew off without checking his nearside mirror.
'Mr Bamford was dragged around ten feet,' Mr Ward told the court.
'The bike fell away from him and people were yelling for the driver to stop.
'Mr Bamford was released from being stuck, he fell to the floor and the nearside rear tyre came into contact with him and killed him instantly.'
Mr Bamford died after he became caught in the lorry while it passed another truck in this narrow lane
Brendon Moorhouse, defending the father-of-two, said his client had seen Mr Bamford and thought he had got out of harm's way.
But he admitted he failed to check his mirror, instead focusing on scaffolding work taking place to his right.
He told the court the driver was so upset he was unable to drive for two months and added: 'On behalf of Mr Keegan he wishes to apologise to Mrs Bamford and her family through me.
'After the accident Mr Keegan was not able to work for eight days. He was shocked and very badly personally affected.'
Keegan pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving, and was given a community order, 200 hours of unpaid work and 11 penalty points.
Judge Michael Longman said: 'The consequences of your driving on that day in March last year were truly tragic.
'You are an experienced driver. You have driven in a professional manner for years and it is clear you have done so properly and carefully.
'I have no doubt at all you feel keenly your responsibility and will continue to do so.'
Mr and Mrs Bamford did not have any children.
Speaking from her home, Mrs Bamford said: 'He [Keegan] was waiting outside for me when the case finished and he kind of grabbed my hand as I came out.
'I felt like I couldn't really pull away so I shook his hand - I am still bitter about it though.
'I understand that he has to have a life and he needs to work but at the end of the day he still killed Martyn and he only got 11 points for it.
'I'm still a bit bitter about it all. My friends told me not to go to court but I just felt that I needed to - for Martyn.'

	Lamborghini Urus will have 600 horsepower and a lightweight shell

        <Description>
	Called the Urus, the sleek but tall car (pictured) is expected to be built in Italy, having been rumoured to be put into production for years. It is expected to go on sale in 2017.

It is hoped  the Urus will double Lamborghinis annual sales by broadening its offering beyond two seater sports cars, which have limited appeal in China, in particular, where roads can be uneven.
The model, named after an extinct ancestor of a cow, was first unveiled as a prototype at the Beijing Motor Show in 2012, but it was uncertain whether it would ever become a production model.
Take a look at the brand new Lamborghini Urus
It is hoped the new model (illustrated), which could make its debut in 2017 and is described as a super athlete, could double the iconic companys sales
Lamborghini said the Urus (illustrated) could be the fastest SUV in the field with 600 horsepower, as well as being one of the lightest thanks to the extensive use of carbon fibre
THE URUS KEY FEATURES
Name: Urus - named after an ancestor of the cow.
Size: 5ft 6 inches (1.7 metres)
First seen: The Beijing Motor Show in 2012
Power: 600 horsepower and 400KwH
Environmental credentials: Lamborghini claims the Urus will offer the lowest CO2 figure of all comparable (high powered) SUVS
Materials:Lightweight carbon fibre where possible.
Tech:Cameras and TV screens will replace wing mirrors and an adjustable spoiler will optimise aerodynamics
Cost: Not yet known
Release date: Possibly 2017
Lamborghini said at the time the Urus could be the fastest SUV in the field with 600 horsepower, as well as being one of the lightest thanks to the extensive use of carbon fibre.
It has design features in common with the firms iconic sports cars such as similar lights to the Huracan and the same shaped vents as the Gallardo.
At just 5ft 6 inches (1.7 metres), the model is set to be relatively small in comparison to other SUVs, targeting city dwellers and soccer moms.
Unlike stripped-back sports cars, the Urus is set to come with a host of tech inside, such as cameras and TV screens that replace wing mirrors, and an adjustable spoiler to make aerodynamics more efficient depending on the road surface its driven on.
Lamborghini claims the Urus will offer the lowest CO2 figure of all comparable SUVs, because it is a hybrid.
It said: As an SUV concept with four generous seats, a versatile luggage compartment, variable ground clearance and, of course, permanent all-wheel drive, the Urus delivers unique driving fun with virtually no limitations.
The Urus is Lamborghinis first SUV since production was ended of the boxy LM002, known as the Rambo Lambo, in 1993.
The 4x4 (pictured) has design features in common with the firms iconic sports cars such as similar lights to the Huracan and the same shaped vents as the Gallardo
The car will be fitted with a carbon fibre interior (illustrated), as well as cameras instead of wing mirrors to make parking easier. These features will allow it to compete with an increasing number of luxury SUVs
The less fashionable model did not find success and 300 were ever sold.
The company is determined the Urus will be different, and is planning to turn out as many as 3,000 per year, which could make the SUV its most popular model.
Last year, the brands deliveries rose by 19 per cent to an all-time high of 2,530 cars.
But, Urus will face fierce competition from the forthcoming Bentley Bentayga and Rolls Royces SUV, not to mention Maseratis Levante and Porsches Cayenne Turbo S.
Theres a chance the Urus could also share a V10 engine with Audis RSQ7, because Audi owns Lamborghini.
Its reported that Lamborghini has been in talks with the Italian government to make sure it could afford to put the SUV into production.
And it has been rumoured that the chassis as well as some other parts could be made at Volkswagen factories which already make components for the Cayenne to cut costs too.

	Philip Howard, 44, was stabbed to death by his girlfriend's 21-year-old son, Jed Allen, at their home in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on Saturday, alongside his six-year-old daughter Derin and partner Janet, 48.

They ask him to take care of 'our sister Dezzy up there daddy' and to 'take care of Jan too' and said that it is their 'worst nightmare come true'.
Mr Howard's older brother, who has not been named, added that the family is in shock at his murder and he will be 'missed so much'.
HEART-WRENCHING POEM WRITTEN BY PHILIP HOWARD'S CHILDREN
'Take care of our sister Dezzy up there daddy,
'Take care of Jan too.
'We wish you didn't have to go Daddy,
'It's our worst nightmare come true.
'We are taking care of Tetley Daddy,
'Uncle Andy too.
'You were the best there ever was Daddy.
'We're so glad to be part of you'.
He said: 'Our family are still all in shock and disbelief. My beloved bro and Uncle Philip youll be missed so much. Until we meet again little bro...'
The family of Mrs Jordon and Derin have also spoken out about their deaths, and described the six-year-old as a 'breath of fresh air'.
In a police statement, they said: 'Our family have experienced a tragedy that is quite frankly unimaginable. Janet was a beloved daughter sister and auntie.
'Dezzy was a breath of fresh air and truly one of a kind. For a family to lose someone so young cannot be explained in mere words. We would ask now that we are left alone to grieve.'
Allen lived with his mother Janet Jordon, her partner Philip Howard, and his half-sister Derin Jordon at their 300,000 council house, where their bodies were discovered on Saturday.
Armed police spent two days combing the countryside for their murderer, who was known to officers before the killings and described himself as 'lonely' and 'sad'.
The hunt came to a dramatic halt when Allens body was found in woodland not far from Oxford University parkland where he worked and where the search was being concentrated.
Seven friends received a message from Allen at around 7.30pm on Saturday, which he is believed to have sent in the moments before killing himself.
Jed Allen was found dead in woodland after killing his three relatives and going on the run
In the message he wrote: 'Tetley has not done anything wrong. He deserves a better life.
'I know what I have done is wrong, but I love you all and I will soon be in a better place. I need your help. I need you to call the police.'
He also made a goodbye phone call to his best friend Jordan Dee but it was the texts, which also sent personal thanks to each of his friends, that triggered a manhunt.
Two members of the public saw him hanging from a tree and he was identified by the distinctive tattoos of a spider and scorpion on either hand. It is not known how long he had been there.
Officers also found the murder weapon, understood to be a knife at the family home.
Allen, who modelled himself on the X-Men character Wolverine and had a knife obsession, is said to have failed to cope with the breakdown of his parents marriage.
In recent months, Allen posted videos and messages online expressing anger about his life and how he was 'fed up of being treated like dirt' at work and by women.
Murders: He stabbed to death his half-sister Derin, six, his mother Janet Jordon, 48, and her boyfriend Philip Howard, 44, on Saturday
Killed: Janet Jordon, 48, and her six-year-old daughter Derin, were found dead in their Oxfordshire home and after being stabbed to death on Saturday. Her son Jed Allen is said to have struggled with her drink problem
Pet: The family's pet dog Tetley was a much-loved member, pictured here with victimsJanet Jordon and her daughter Derin
He made dozens of short films in the past year and in one he screams wildly into the camera and says: 'This is a mad house. I can't take it any more'.
The groundsman also photographed himself brandishing knives, an axe and a knuckleduster and friends said he could explode into uncontrollable rages and had punched holes in walls at home.
In one photo, he was seen with blades between his clenched fingers like the Marvel comic superhero Wolverine in the X-Men films.
Social media appeared to be a way for Allen to admit his frailties and anger with the world.
He told friends recently that his life was going 'backwards' and he was 'depressed, 'lonely' and 'sad' because he was 'fed up of girls treating me poorly'.
In a caption accompanying one of his his many selfies he wrote: 'I don't know what I am anymore'.
In others he sang his favourite songs and, on one film in his car, he wrote afterwards: 'When I was happy'.
Overflowing: A police officer lays a tribute near the scene of the triple murder in Vicarage Road, Didcot
Heartbroken: Children went to school during half term to light a candle for Derin and drew pictures of flowers
In one of the more sinister films he secretly recorded his colleagues talking over lunch as he looked angrily into the camera.
On his Facebook page he wrote about how his job had 'turned sour already' and that he was 'fed up of being treated like dirt'.
In another, he wrote: 'I've decided there is no time of day that I function well.'
'Whoever doesn't like me just remove me from your lives so I can put you out of my misery. You know who you are.'
And two weeks earlier the former Oxford University groundsman wrote: 'Works (sic) turned sour already. Fed up of being treated like dirt.'
Meanwhile, shocked friends flocked to Derin's school to pay tribute to her as her headteacher threw open the doors to welcome friends them.
Children came to school during half term to light a candle for the six-year-old, known affectionately as Dezzy, and also drew pictures of flowers.
Headteacher John Myers said: 'People are shocked, devastated, sad, what you would expect.
Crime scene: Forensics enter the Didcot property where the three family members were stabbed to death as a child lays flowers on the road in tribute to the three victims
Touching: A handwritten note left near the property where the bodies were discovered on Saturday night
'It was such a shock, it was hard to believe at first. To lose any life is awful, to lose a little child is doubly so, but the nature and manner of the loss is hard to take and comprehend.'
Dezzy was about to finish Year 1, having been at the school since nursery and Mr Myers paid tribute to a beautiful and precious little girl.
'She was a beautiful little girl, pretty, smiley, gentle, precious,' he added. She was a wonderful character, very very lovely.'
Allen's family had only moved to their semi-detached property two months ago from a smaller home a mile away.

	Flesh-eating bug septicaemia triggered by COLD 'ate away' father's arms and legs

	John Rushton, 42, from Tilbury, Essex, contracted septicaemia after suffering pneumonia. The infection caused his limbs to rot away, forcing doctors to amputate to save his life.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>After developing septicaemia, doctors placed Mr Rushton in a medically induced coma for 10 days.
It was while he lay unconscious that the infection wrought havoc, killing off
tissue
in his limbs.
In addition, his kidneys began to fail.
'I'd lost the blood flow to my limbs, which meant my fingers, toes and feet turned black and died,' he said.
Doctors were forced to amputate his limbs to try and stem the infection and save his life
'I was told that I'd be having a quadruple amputation and, on top of this, because of the organ failure I may need dialysis for the rest of my life.
'At first, I just kept saying "no", but as time went on I begun to hate my limbs.
'They'd started decomposing whilst still attached and the smell of rotting meat was too much, so I know it sounds strange but by the time I had my operation, I was glad to lose them.'
Mr Rushton underwent the series of operations in February, with a week to recover between each one.
He has now returned home to Tilbury, Essex, with his 31-year-old wife and daughter Amy,
10,
and has ambitions of returning to work at Royal Mail.
With his kidneys functioning well, he no longer requires dialysis and is fully focused on his rehabilitation.
'I've been setting myself little targets to make the process seem less daunting,
'For example, the first time I was able to shower myself or the first solid food I ate after being nil by mouth for almost two months,' Mr Rushton said.
Last week, he ticked off the last of his milestones  walking on prosthetics for the first time, describing the feeling as 'amazing'.
Now, he is raising money to fund new state-of-the-art artificial limbs of his own.
'Though the NHS has been amazing, the prosthetics they offer are quite basic,' he said.
'They get you from A to
B
but you can't do much more than that.
'I want to be able to return to work, drive my car again and live as normal as life as possible and for that I'll need to fund the limbs myself.'
The prosthetics Mr Rushton has set his sights on cost 100,000 and will enable him to feel hot and cold.
Mr Rushton is now recovering back at the family home and has ambitions of returning to work at Royal Mail. He is raising money to try and buy state-of-the-art new prosthetic limbs
The money raised will also pay for adaptations to the family's home.
Mr Rushton is currently unable to reach the bathroom as it is upstairs, and so must rely on a commode instead of a toilet and sponge baths by his wife, instead of a shower.
He has praised his family for the strength they have shown throughout his ordeal.
'When we asked Amy how she felt about my amputation, she just said: "well I've still got my dad, haven't I?"
'Janine has been incredible too. It's been
tough
but we've had to adapt to survive.
'I'm going to be back up and walking, whatever it takes.
'There's no way I am letting this beat me.'

	Active volcano Mount Nyiragongo crater reveals lakes of lava

        <Description>
	Italian geologist Francesco Pandolfo travelled to Africa to study the volcanic activity on Mount Nyiragongo. He abseiled into the crater to examine the lake of molten lava that sits on top of it.

'When I was on the rope heading down into the crater the feeling was very strange but at the same time it was absolutely incredible.'
Mr Pandolfo had been in Africa conducting research in order to better understand the volcano, which last erupted in 2002.
LAVA LAKE SPOTTED ON IO
Lava lakes are huge volumes of molten lava in the vents or craters of volcanoes.
They form when lava partially fills the crater or vent following an eruption, or when a new vent erupts for a period of weeks and creates a crater that then fills with lava.
Astronomers recently spotted such a lake on Jupiter's moon Io, near its Loki volcano.
Io is said to be the most geologically active body in our solar system and it is covered in hundreds of volcanic regions, mostly covered by sulfur and sulfur dioxide.
Loki, named after the Norse god, is the largest of these and is specifically a volcanic depression called patera.
Similar to lava lakes on Earth, the crust solidifies as it reaches the top of the lake and cools, before shifting and falling back into the lake.
He said: 'It really was one of the best things you can see, a volcano in full flow. I have always been in love with the mountains so I think this is my true calling.'
Lava lakes are huge volumes of molten lava which form in the vents or craters of volcanoes.
Lava partially fills the crater or vent following an eruption, or when a new vent erupts for a period of weeks, leaving a crater  that then fills with lava.
They usually have a grey crust that forms over the top as the molten rock partly solidifies in the cooler air.
This crust measures between two inches (5cm) and 11.8 inches (30cm) and after it forms it gradually shifts and moves into the molten lava below and is replaced by another crust.
This process can take a few minutes, or a few hours depending on the size of the lake.
This movement is often referred to as 'tectonic' activity because it resembles the way in which the Earth's plates move, spread and slip.
Mount Nyiragongo is part of the Virunga volcanic chain that straddles the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.
It is one five major lava lakes that have formed since the 1980s and has remained in existence for decades.
Others are found at Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, Mount Erebus in Antarctica, Ambrym, Vanuatu and Erta' Ale in Ethiopia.
In 2002, an eruption by Nyiragongo destroyed much of the nearby town of Goma, leaving 200,000 people homeless. The eruption spread lava as far as the northern end of the runway at Goma International Airport - around 12 miles (20km) away.
Reports suggest around 147 people died from asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and buildings collapsing due to the lava and earthquakes, with around 4,500 buildings being destroyed. It erupted again six months later.
Nyiragongo is what's known as an active stratovolcano. It measures 11,382ft (3,470 metres) and is found inside Virunga National Park.
Mr Pandolfo (shown above) spent several days with colleagues living on the mountain to study the activity of the enormous volcano
Long-lasting lava lakes are relatively rare as they require volcanoes to produce large amounts of molten rock over a prolonged period. Most volcanoes erupt explosively. The lava lake of Nyiragongo (above) is one of only five permanent lava lakes currently in existence in the world
This image shows how close Mount Nyiragongo lies to the nearest town. When it erupted in 2002 it destroyed much of the town of Goma, leaving 200,000 people homeless as lava flowed more than 12 miles from the volcano to the edge of the city's airport
Mount Nyiragongois is part of the Virunga volcanic chain that straddles the border between Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda
But lava lakes also do not appear to be unique to the Earth - astronomers recently spotted a lava lake on Jupiter's moon Io, near its Loki volcano.
Io is said to be the most geologically active body in our solar system and it is covered in hundreds of volcanic regions, mostly covered by sulfur and sulfur dioxide.
Loki, named after the Norse god, is the largest of these and is specifically a volcanic depression called patera.
Similar to lava lakes on Earth, the crust solidifies as it reaches the top of the lake and is cooled, before shifting and falling back into the lake. This causes a rise in thermal emissions.

Not tonight... I've got a headache: Four-tonne elephant seal indulges in some very heavy petting with one of his 100 mates
Male elephant seals - the largest of all seal species -  breed with a harem of women which they will fight to protect
Can control groups of up to 100, mating with each of them in turn with each session lasting up to half an hour
While males weigh four tonnes, females only weigh around one tonne, making it difficult to resist their advances

	Nicola Sturgeon says she will fight to 'lessen' budget cuts in Scotland, despite a report revealing the average Scot already has £1,600 more taxpayers’ cash spent on them than the typical Englishman.

She said: I think if David Cameron is serious about listening to people right across the UK, then he will want to take notice of how people in Scotland voted because it was him during the referendum on independence last year who said that Scotland should vote to stay in the UK and its voice would be listened to as part of the UK.
She added: If the UK Government sticks to its current proposals, we will argue for ways in which the impact on Scotland can be lessened.
A generous funding formula means that Scots have benefited for years from much higher public spending than the English.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines Scottish Business Pledge
The First Minister - pictured with the Scottish championship trophy Tuesday - said she would demand that the impact of the government's austerity drive should be 'lessened' north of the border
The gap, which stood at 1,496 per head in 2010, had widened to 1,597 per head four years later. Spending has fallen in both nations, but has dropped further and faster in England.
'The SNP won the election in Scotland fairly decisively on the basis of a pledge to argue the anti-austerity case, so that is what we will do', Sturgeon said
Conservative MP David Nuttall said Scotlands decision last year to vote to remain part of the UK meant it could have no argument with the Governments legitimacy.
The Bury North MP accused Miss Sturgeon of trying to whip up anti-Scottish sentiment in England by emphasising the gulf in spending.
He added: The SNP need to recognise they lost the referendum and are in opposition. When it came to the decision about whether Scotland should remain in the UK, the majority of people said they wanted to.
Part of that deal is accepting the winner of the General Election forms the Government of the entire UK. The SNP want to stir up anti-Scottish sentiment in England because they think it helps their cause.
However, in a significant shift, Miss Sturgeon said she now backs the Governments Charter for Budget Responsibility, which sets targets for tackling the deficit.
During the election campaign she had said Labours support for it was equivalent to signing up to the Tories plans for 30billion in cuts.
n Powers for Scotland to set its own income tax levels will be fast-tracked today in the Queens Speech.
The move could mean those north of the border pay less in income tax than the English, Welsh or Northern Irish.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the law will be rushed through by next February. The full devolution of all bands and rates would then be in force earlier than the estimate of 2019/20.
